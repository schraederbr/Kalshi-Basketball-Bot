and one of them is going to go home after this and ones going to go onto the quarterfinals in a date with Louisville Bill Covington throws it up with Ted Valentine and AJ Desai and the ball is in the hands of Christian Tucker making his first start since December 3rd its an unusual Cal starting five with no Wilkinson and no blacker and theyll hope they can survive one more day this Wild Ride DJ Campbell back into the starting lineup for this one shot is rebounded by Maxim Reno which is a notable rebound for us because Reno whos part of the Stanford starting five has just passed the wonderful producer of our day side games here at the ACC tournament Kim Belton a great Stanford player and Stanford gets a threepointer out of it from Donovan young seeson average of 37 the Cal starting five so Campbells back into the lineup Tucker fifth start of the Year Reus petritis was a game time decision with his sprained ankle and then St yakovich and coko have been exceptional a game time decision meeting lets see who else isnt going to play and convince the healthiest to to grit it out Campbell over Reno misses a three and Stanfords got the ball with Jaylen Blakes a Duke transfer one of the most improved players in the conference oiah sers Ryan agarwall The Freshman young and Reno the Stanford five for first year head coach Kyle Smith and youve worked with me enough to say to understand like if youre going to double team right now they have to move the ball out of that and then play against the chasing defense could put Cal in a bad situation if he moved the basketball well but Cals got to take it out of Rs hands theyre going to have to lean on sto yakovich today hes double team gets it back from petritis and guarded by the junior sellers the former Stanford man sty yakovich who trans for this year to Cal rattles in his first shot so good and he really does he just watches Pace right watch the way he operates changes speeds really well but he has great balance with the basketball and thats how hes able to kind of create enough space to get shots off on the drrive blinks is smothered the rejection by Christian Tucker the point guard in is fifth start of the year with the athletic block you get excited about guards getting blocks Kev absolutely you got excited about all the blocks you got Im sure peaked in high school man sto yakovich find some space hes got the first four a lot of the things that sto yakovich does really well other players can do because theyre simple fundamental things like keeping your head up and keeping your dribble alive as you get into the paint probe a little bit change speeds a lot of little things he does well makes him hard to guard Stanford 11 and N in the the League this year first season in the ACC they were 3 and N away from home excellent in Palo Alto jumper short by sers and the long rebound Tracked Down by Blakes he feeds sers again hes shot ready from three I love that when you get a second chance opportunity you can get it back to the guy that just took the shot should always seek that out you got to feel for a shot by getting the first one up you get it back shoot it with confidence t team that really struggles to shoot last in ACC games in field goal and threepoint percentage but he sure does St yakovich and it looks like hes healthier now was Ill was dealing with a hip injury missed four games but these two JN has touch has been impeccable the problem for Stanford is you cant lose him youve got to communicate whether youre on him or not Reno out of the double team Blakes sellers another three Applause all set up by what Kevin dou double team like it comes so fast he held it for just a split second to allow as offensive players to get into position swing that thing around sellers who just hit one gets another look hes their best threepoint shooter on the year 39 and hes H his first two a 97 stand for Lee and they havent even Applause Music Applause Kevin thank you again welcome to Cal and Stanford and Charlotte welcome to the Andre stovich show the Stanford transfer with the first 9 Kevin Brown John crisen with you 291st meeting between Cal and Stan their first in the ACC tournament first year members of the league and there is the All America candidate Maxim REO missing a three if youre just joining us two starters down for Cal today Jeremiah Wilkinson Sixth Man of the Year whos moved into the lineup of late out with a concussion their point guard Javon blackshire is out with a foot injury and yet theyve got the lead because Andre stakic has everyone of their 11 points I mean hes taken all the two of their shots too and theres a reason why you keep going to him if hes making shots go back to him Reno is doubled again another open three and another threepointer this one for Jaylen Blakes Stanfords 12 points have all come from the threepoint line you know what a lot of those are coming because of the double inside so you may take raino away but if Stanford continues to hit threes open looks around the perimeter you may have to adjust a little bit heres M Soko on the drop off and sooko the first non St yakovich points for Cal graduate transfer from Michigan State who has been awesome down the stretch not sto yakovich points but he being on that side brings his Defender out which opens the roll young throws it away to Agarwal its a Stanford turnover their second DJ Campbell moved back into the starting lineup today off the hand of Soko and collected by The Freshman Donovan young for Stanford Campbell actually three lot that wasnt a shot he he was looking for sissoko down low Blakes to the rack and scores the first two for Music Stanford Jaylen Blakes was the runner up for most improved player in the ACC Donald Han Jr at VC won it Blakes 18 points per game at Duke last year averaging 13 4 and a half assists hes been an awesome leader Defender scorer and passer for Stanford Stak Applause heres sooko over Reno that a good start lot of scoring in this game so far I mean its not really up and down but but theyre making making shots 77 from the field for Cal you take that and ahoko with a golden Bears first foul staying out of foul trouble will be a major major need for Mark Madson whos got about a seven man Road ation today maybe seeking consecutive ACC wins for the first time in a couple of months of course a great player at Stanford was an assistant coach there as well was inducted into the Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame six years ago now hes trying to end their season you definitely tighten your rotations in tournament settings with its NC tournament or your conference tournament but the way cows had to do it is not really what you would choose Aiden camon on the floor for the first time for Stanford hes called for an offensive foul with an illegal screen Kyle Smith in his first year at Stanford came over from Washington State he was a pack 12 coach of the year last year wazu went 25 and 10 Washington State to the West Coast Conference at least for now with a temporary dissolution of the Pack 12 itll be the pack something soon but he is in the ACC with stand and his team cannot get a stop Cal has hit its last eight shots and thats DJ Campbell with his first two really all started with what sto yakovich was able to do and so much attention continues to go his way that youre going to have open driving lades because youre not going to help off of Tucker finds Campbell in transition back to Christian Tucker and theres the first Miss dakovic spins into it and sto yakovich has 13 a californ Blitz in the first eight minutes in a Timeout taken by Stanford stakich has just been terrific to start this game and when you see one go down and then you start to put the ball on the floor and get mascot fan but man having played at UCLA and G up against the that fear what what you call him the Fearsome tree fearsome tree yeah the two mascots were two of my least favorites which mascot most intensely staring into your soul during a jump shot the with a rocking headband well the bear will the the bear will sit there with his hands behind his back staring into your soul that the tree just goes nuts most of the game the duck was always really good around too that was another one all good all good mascots you love all mascots equally R nos back on the floor hes taking just one shot for Stanford Benny dealer Chism mcara Aiden camon Off the Bench heres Reno fakes the pass and now delivers to the corner for a sellers Miss from three its interesting to see Kyle Smith move right now around the perimeter because of the double team I would actually keep throwing it to him welcome the double youve gotten good looks from the perimeter and just have to get a stop on this end which means cut it off for sto yakovich theres Campbell against raino passes out of it Spencer Mahoney dumps it inside to Lee Dort and a travel so second Cal turnover R 2025 T price ACC mens basketball tournament bracket Georgia Tech and North Carolina have won in the first two quarterfinals uh first two second round games so chalky quarterfinals so far 18 45 Duke Georgia Tech Wake UNC tomorrow winner of this game gets Louisville and then we have SMU and Syracuse a 14 seed winner that game will face Clemson tomorrow the big boys The Heavy Hitters Duke Louisville and Clemson a combined 55 and five in the league a combin 522 against the other 15 teams in the league can somebody break through out of those top three sers off his own Miss sto yakovich tracks it down for C which is on a six nothing spurt here and has hit nine of its last 10 sakovich has hit his first six Applause gampo out to Mahone and the rebound down to dor sto yakovich again oh hes seven for sevene a Heavenly start for the former Stanford man now wearing blue and gold I got to tell you it really starts with not letting him feel good about his shot to start the game he made his first few and and its just been flowing like crazy so yakovich is going to be tough you cant cant let him get a catch you cant leave him on a scramble youve almost got to play junk defense here a marara Harford transfer the bucket Off the Music Bench Tucker heres stakic again aara out to defend him sto yakovich sizing up his man spins fakes leans in and theres his first Miss its grabbed by Dort a series of pump fakes and its stripped into the hands of Blakes I thought sto yovich got fouled on that one raino for three hes finally on the board finally on the board but really Cal lost him in transition you have to know if hes the first one down floor great probably play a three4 front dont allow an early entry pass but if hes trailing youve got to get out of the paint and take that away Maxim raino the only 2010 player in the league in the country 20 points 11 rebounds a game Tucker into the paint lobs it up for the big man Dort and count the bucket with a foul from Ted Valentine or no is he going to wave that off hes going to wave off the bucket hang on a second now he waved off the bucket and immediately went over to Mark Madson because he knew how the Cal bench would feel about this now were going to get the officials together see a bunch of hand gestures that I dont recognize over there I mean did he think it was Above the Rim it definitely was not Above the Rim inadvertent whistle that is a great call God bless Ted Valentine for just go you know what everybody gets a my bad in this world right he probably thought yeah was see May got Above the Rim but he clearly did not good my bad we good with that I wondered at first looking at the replay if there was a raino foul slap in the arm on the pass no he was waving and pointing I I couldnt follow what he was doing but so the the basket is going to count so Dort does get the Doug inadvertent whistle after that and its 24 to Applause 19 heres Campbell for Cal which by the way has gone way deep into the bench Vladimir pavlovich where in 33 its his third game of the year heres Benny geler second year scholarship player freshman walkon he can do that and thatll lead to a mark Matson timeout Stanford six out of eight from three in a 30se second stoppage for us points per game their point guard playing 30 minutes a game so Cal extremely shorthanded and still in front first basket for Rus petritis he was a game time decision with a sprained ankle petritis is one of those guys that he can play a number of different roles going to see him double down but hes also going to scramble out well Ray no into the paint there he is theres Petrus with a rebound and here is Vladimir pavlovich third game of the year hes played three minutes this season but somebodys got to play tonight a three four Campbell is short and grabbed by r I feel like hes one of those guys that when he gets into the game you you would mention his like major what what phds working on right now right he played seven games in 43 minutes a year ago pavlovich akara great threepoint shooter but he doesnt take many r no will take and r no will hit his second three and Stanford is seven for n from Deep hes kind of got that yic release where where its slow but its kind of behind his head and theres only so far you can get up into his space its hard to stop that once he lines up that threepoint Music shot at trus fls it back for Campbell I dont know that this lineup seen the floor at all for Cal this year with Mahoney and pavlovich and no Wilkinson or blacker or sto yakovich they have its called practice and they still find a bucket from DJ Campbell I mean right now W Batson stealing time with this lineup I mean they just scored two possessions in a row if not for giving up the three for rido I mean theyre doing a good job maintaining the little lead geler on the raino screen geler kicks it out another open three agarwall couldnt hit heres Mahoney 69 freshman who played for Kyle Smith last year at Washington State but red shirted Soko double team comes sooko throws it right to agar wall you can just see this is not a lineup that understands one anothers Tendencies as well as your starting group or even your second group would if they were all healthy theyre not going to double here at first and Renault spins around a tough angle Miss well played by sasoko and Mone you can sense the hesitation from the moment he didnt take it for the first time Watford pretty good program they were six seed this year struggled but theyre going to the tournament and so is Gonzaga beating St Marys after losing both games in the regular season you and I saw Watford against Duke earlier this season and we never would have predicted that they would make the tournament 35 points but at that time we probably didnt realize how good that Duke team was ton of hype But ultimately they theyve lived up to it then some and theyll play tomorrow noon against Georgia Tech heres r know California 28 Stanford 25 here at the ACC tournament long long long time pack whatever Rivals pack 10 pack 12 both moved to the ACC this year and the fourth time in six conference tournaments theyre Meed sty yakovich has been the man today hes seven out of eight and he misses that shot but its grabbed by Soko sto yakovich got fouled about five times on that play do you remember when we came out with that thing called freedom of movement did we flush it at some point oh my goodness I think it only happens in the final 20 seconds of games now or or last second stovic with 16 not too soon for some people too soon for others ACC fan bases sokos got six and again cal without jeremi Wilkinson or Javon blackshire theyre two starting guards C driving in on geler try to sell the charge Campbell gets his own Miss second chance no theres Soko again its off of the Cal big man Soko is going to find the open area in the paint just to post up here to get rebounds why cuz two have to go at sto yakovich takes a tough shot B sokos right there just waiting probably cuz he finally got himself a a little fluid in the last break Kev B Soko right now is fasting from Sunset to Sunrise because of Ramadan Sunset was about 10 minutes ago so hes able to have fluids to eat again nice little knifing move in the lane there oiah cell Mark Madson told us feels like in some ways m sokos game has elevated its like hes more emotionally spiritually connected in some way and he has three double doubles in the last four to be big tonight or just less poison k could be 14 and 13 last night so yakovich misses another Tracked Down By The Freshman young ahead to Music Applause sellers want to get it to Reno and theyll get it to him from the threepoint line Maxim with a left hand finish I mean how about that from the sevenfooter right theyre show high defense closes a little bit but just comes off their toes up to their toes and enough to get him off balance and he attacks the middle of the paint finish with the left thats a highly skilled Play heres pavlovich coko tough finish hes fouled with 327 to go C has led for longer in this first half than the first two meetings against Stanford looking for a stunner in Charlotte how about this Cal first two meetings against Stanford LED for 738 tonight theyve LED for most of the first half 1146 and again it Bears repeating pun not intended no Jeremiah Wilkinson no Javon blackshire there they are blackshire on the left in the nothing easy warmup Wilkinson on our right thats a combined 256 points per game game Wilkinson couple of games ago against Notre Dame had 43 in a four overtime loss and Cal has led almost the whole first half but you know it does something it it puts the game in the hands of Andre sto yakovich and if hes scoring well the whole game the whole defense just shifts his way and its going to create opportunities for everybody else a Cara I tell you what he doesnt take many threes but when he does he connects hes like the most interesting man in the world hes 16 for 35 and he ties the game at Music 32 Christian Tucker getting the start at the point guard today and theres an offensive foul its sokos second foul selection Sunday is coming up 6 Easter 3 Pacific with sports center on ESPN this Sunday and Bracketology presented by Lowes for the mens field of 68 followed by the womens selection special presented by Capital 1 at 83 5 Pacific and more Bracketology after that on ESPN 2 that last foul is something weve got to figure out right cuz its getting to the point where nobody wants to screen anymore youll see a ton of ghost screens you see a bunch of fakes but nobody wants to touch anybody anymore how do you figure it out my real answer yeah probably not cuz theyre only two and a half minutes left in this first half with a jump if youre going to make something a point of emphasis you have to understand how to create balance with the rule you cant just look for every bit of contact on a screener particularly when you have so many teams that switch teams are going to switch you really have to rethink calling that a foul got a foul on the drive by Tucker Stanford has taken its first lead in 11 and a half minutes quick example C if youre going against a switching defense and youre setting to scre and you roll into the guy that switched on to you how is that an illegal screen its just theres some nuance and when you make when you think the rules are really black and white the games not played that way the games played in the gray and I think you have to be able to officiate with Nuance foul was on rno by the way just his first Stanfords only committed four Cal three there have been just two free throws in the whole game sto yakovich comes up to set the screen and nobody guards him oh boy Stanford caught a huge break there and then giler is fouled by petritis I thought geler stood up with the ball I did two you know hes hes down on the floor stands up interesting yeah you wonder if two going out and coming back in it it kind of reset the Rhythm for sto yakovich he hasnt been able to find it since some of thats the physicality defensively though Reno floats it home hes into double figures and here comes Stanford hes got such soft touch so you double him in the post but those short rolls theres only so much you can do I love that short roll from a skilled player like Applause that sto yakovich matched up with Blakes Blakes takes it away Stanford Steels leader is fouled Applause you were big on Blakes in terms of most improved and and I couldnt disagree any or couldnt agree anymore hes really really become one heck of a player and I think hes been good on the offensive end hes kind of Taken on the responsibility having to be a playmaker but defensively where is is really where you see it just has a good knack for how to play the game how to be disruptive both on the ball and off he was at Duke for three years he he barely played which which is no shame a lot of great players go to Duke and have a hard time cracking the rotation he was a 18 perame scorer last year and Kyle Smith said he brings as a winning program culture and they thought hed be a real point of attack Defender which you just saw but hes been at pleasant surprise offensively tried to draw charge there and hell get hit with a block its his second foul and thats going to get Blakes out for the remaining 64 seconds and a half do you like the no call in that situation I kind of do right cuz I like I think the game needs as much flow as possible and even though yeah he kind of took a dive it it creates an advantage for the offense Id rather just see him not blow the whistle a hesitant Whistle Too lets see if we really want to go with this lets see how serious the diving Act is before make a decision was hesitant after that it what he called earlier final minute of the first half 132 Stanford run Dort geler comes down a double stripped it and he gets called for a foul he thought he had all ball one to still not a great possession for Cal kind of bail him out I I I doubt Ds going to get the best shot at The Rim there and remember they dont have Soko in the game because he has two fouls Campell into Music Applause petrius Campbell didnt want to do anything with a switch on rol Tucker he got hit no call heres agarwall whoa back to Tucker it comes and he runs into giler no foul you take it from here settled down boys one shot to go in the half that was like the the best play could just be boot the ball out of bounds and start over I got to think Cs tired too we we cant mention that enough Tucker looking for Dort lost it 910 of a second technically they could be there could be a shot clock violation the shot clock is at one but there are no decimals on this shot clock so its somewhere under 910 of a second Aiden Cs on the floor for the final play for Stanford a little extra Music height sto yakovich has a potential screening stovich breaks late to the basket and thats the end of the first half Stanford ends it on a 90 run its the 1034 Mark and Cal hasnt hit a field goal since the 57 Mark Stanford ended the half on a 90 run 132 run and the Cardinal had the ball leading by six Again Louisville gets the winner tomorrow night the number two seed oiah sers couldnt get it to go and then that ball is knocked out of bounds off of M Soko by a stand player was last touch so it will actually KN of Soko so it will stay with Stanford beg you pardon and Jaylen Blakes to inbound Blakes for maxim Reno and Reno with a little second half Thunder just no ball pressure that thats like a chest pass through the paint from the Baseline that shouldnt happen Reno looks like hes favored something right now hes wincing in the paint a dozen for the second leading vote getter on the all ACC teams so yakovich with another Miss Soko with an offensive rebound and a stick back plus a foul got to see why cow was able to win the rebounding battle against his Stanford group earlier just so physical down low so much attention to on St yakovich shooting the basketball that Matty Soka mty Soka is able to get where he wants terms of getting on the offensive glass Cal is one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country they lead the league 132 offensive rebounds a game sissoko second in the ACC more than three offensive rebounds a game Stanford beats a pressure with raino sers open sers swirls it out for Applause three theres Rus petritis for cow playing on a sprained ankle and lost his footing and turns it over thats the 11th turnover by cal cal picking up pressure on these dead ball Applause situations raino well he beat the pressure the last time Reno goes to the wing and isues a three and now seals off Tucker and Soka came back to get that favorable matchup r no will then step B thats going to stay with Stanford it was fumbled by a couple of cow Bears thats one of the concerns if youre going to pick up in pressure which means you end up scrambling back out of it when you get back into the half court youve got to recognize where Reno is I mean hes lining up a wide open three just stepping right into it hes going to make a higher percentage of those than youre willing to let him shoot sellers short Applause Music as DJ Campbell back in the starting lineup Javon blackshire and Jeremiah Wilkinson both injured and outs and Campbell with a pretty sweet fadeaway good balance took him all the way down to the block got the defense lead turn around double figures in his last two transfer from Western Carolina at of Hampton Virginia Ray no again for three thats thats the problem you want to talk about a pick and pop nightmare cuz its not just that he can pick and pop and make threes its that if he makes the right read he pick and roll rolls to the basket then he holds a seal and then he forces a double but its also the pick and short roll which just opens up other opportunities three Lev score second leading score in the ACC and theres Blakes his 18th game this year of multiple Steals and renaults open not going to take it from three we him his way down into the paint and get fouled by Tucker so many options right you you want to defend the ball screen sooko is going to hang back to take that that curl away protect the paint but youre cover R know its too much to ask of Soko in that situation particularly when you think about the six over times the last two games guys are gas I feel like Renault with a 15 points he has 611 hes really just finding it in the game cu the game started with doubles coming his way and and he kind of deferred until he found a little rhythm didnt score for about 10 and a half minutes dorts in the game right now R so foul thats absolute foul all right hang on a second now Ted Valentines calling it Stanford ball no foul thats going to be revers if its not a foul which it wasnt called its got to be cow ball just wonder sometimes like we had that freedom of movement stuff we patted ourselves on the back for blowing the whistle every 20 seconds I mean thats a fullon shove as hes going to the basket sto yakovich guarded by Blake spins around it so Applause pretty that thats special I mean the body control the balance on the spin recognition of where the shot blockers are just kind of getting just underneath the hands of the shop blockers first GE with Cal left Stanford after the coaching change Gerard H was fired Kyle Smith came in stovich goes just up the bay Blakes driving and Blakes is fouled this is just good stuff and sto yakovich is going to have to be strong with the basketball you know hes going to get physicality hes going to get a good look hes gone up against one of the better defenders in this conference just patient kind of feel the defender spin off good recognition thats just smooth Music stuff at 25 in first half for game and thats 16 10 his first double double of the year in the second Stanford game and again they have to lean on him more without Wilkinson and blackshire their second and third leading scores Applause Blakes goes two for two you got to think sto yakovich is going to have to have a ridiculous you know line for cow to have a chance but at the same time if he keeps scoring and starts to pull the defense with him the games going to get easier for everybody else Stanford extends pressure here with young lobed around it to Campbell Campbell floats it in hes playing with a lot of confidence Kevin sometimes its easier to play with confidence when you know you have guys that are typically ahead of you out for injury right you can just let loose be Fearless play with conviction Let it Fly first start in about 35 days DJ Campbell raino into the paint over Dort he doesnt miss many of those 17 for the first teamer in the ACC and the potential AllAmerican its also a crafty finish because the defender at that point as youre getting back down youre almost waiting for the left shoulder right hook he he actually jumped with his back to the defender and finished in a more Awkward way kind of showcases the skill hes got Campbell for Applause three it will stay with California this a sixpoint game at the half it remains a sixpoint game a winner go home second rounder in Charlotte for their resume except it keeps them alive for a quad two date with wake farest tomorrow and then if they win that likely Duke theres a bucket and a foul DJ Campbell these teams dont care about Bracketology you got to win the tournament to get in and K and Stanford fighting to get to the quarterfinals I really think theres something to being able to play knowing that that youre not going to get taken out Im not sure where the foul was on that TJ h on the line for with like hes playing freely theres hes holding nothing back hes taking tough shots hes being aggressive I thats exactly how you have to be in this situation only I would take as many bad shots as I could to be honest how many good shots would you take in there I have a smart response ponder that hold it back fourpoint lead for Stanford heres Blakes on the drive and he is fouled so this has been a little bit of a whistle heavier start to the second half Lee Dort with a second back up big like its a great challenge when youre prepping for this stay for team you watch a lot of Maxine Reno and you see him score at every level you see him get assist from every level that means pick and pop that means managing the double and passing out of it it means a short roll hard roll to the basket back to the basket good field hes really a difficult cover he he just he gets so much of your emotional energy when trying to defend the key is play freely on offense communicate as to the best of your ability if youre cow on the defensive Applause end saor Blakes goes one for two REO hes got 17 five rebounds and two steals in 23 minutes rno was also awarded the ACC scholar athlete of the year before the game you surprised its coming from one of the Well its theth year in a row a Stanford athlete has won their conference award not a shock Campell faing up the Freshman young step back two its short and its off of chis mpar stays with Applause cow they really fight on the offensive glass mentioned it earlier Lee the ACC C does 13 and a half offensive rebounds a game I mean the key is that you you be aggressive in the offensive glass without giving up too many transition opportunities thats the hard thing there are a lot of teams that wont send you anybody to the glass cuz you just give up too much in transition and they do give up unfortunately a lot of transition so its a rist reward for Mark Madson Campbell to three oh its pure DJ Campbell coming alive in the second half and here comes Cal within a bucket you can see in the celebrations too hes playing with a little ledge right Little Swagger out here you need it why not heres akara given space to shoot or to drive after the pump fake puts it home for two more its really good stuff the the four pump fakes get them all up hes got a great body to be able to go into the defender the Stanford folks told us hes the master of the pump fake Oar up how did that get in Christian Tucker just forced it home for his first two got to get Reno involved in the offense again Reno ceiling off to sooko theres the bounce pass theres the bucket you just see the setup of that theyre going to get him involved and he really wanted it on the Block and if you go go with the quick action the Doubles not really ready to come he made a quick decision once he got the ball too sto yakovich a three B his first basket since the 1034 Mark of the first half first threepoint basket anyway should say hes got 21 and its a onepoint game I like Stanford fell asleep because he hadnt scored in a while you cant leave him to help off of a driver into the middle of the Zone its raino again 21 now for the big man I said it earlier in our open Im sure the world saw that he can score at every level hes got great touch but you also double then you risk allowing him to get everybody else involved hes a far better player than anyone recognizes geler was very handsy with sto yakovich there a foul felt inevitable and its giler second its been a while for story yovich who had such a terrific first half but you cant help off if Yara cannot help off of the best scorer on the floor and Rayo I mean hes a hes in any layer score right hes putting himself in position heres the seal he set it up really well tough left H its a two leftand finishes in a row cant play his left shoulder right hook you cant play his right shoulder left hook hes got it all I think what I like the most is the fact that hes willing to short roll get to catch identify what the defense is doing and then from there play play facing the basket that makes you a threat from every position except the bench hes going to get a breather before the 12minute timeout if anybody could be a threat From the Bench it would be him somehow Aiden camon replaces him St yakovich with 22 with no Wilkinson and no blacker and Cal without two starters in this game stovich has been banged up petritis was a game time decision remember there without BJ omat who was going to be a starter 11 points in four games hes been out since mid November with a wrist injury Joshua Ola Joseph started 10 games hes out seven point per game score so they are really thin they are really short and they are really battling all the Applause while Cs first shot of the game is rebounded by Applause sasoko Cal could take its first lead of the second half stoy yovic can get them there at the line F the behind the back Tribble woo Giller was all up on him I mean right there good defense until he just sold him a dream going to the left and came back to the right here watch the round the back here I mean hes just smooth and then a little hesitation so sooko did a good job of holding that seal for a split second without picking up another foul for touching somebody thats almost a screen stovic was a McDonalds all American he was ranked 22nd in his class and went to Stanford and Jared H went into the portal after the coaching change and found a home here at Cal so sto yakovich and Mark Madson both former staner players both trying to lead Cal to a win over Mark matsons Alma moner and sty yakovich is former school and knock them out of the tournament its a kind of intermingling you dont necessarily see in Duke car well let me put it this way its kind of like sort of like to a lesser extreme its like Tyler hansboro coaching Duke I mean thats what Mark Madson was to that Stanford program he he was Tyler hbro at Stanford and I understand the Rivalry is not at that level so relax to a less extent you said I know I I gave my disclaimers off the Miss by sellers Here Comes C with pavlovich Applause wanted him to shoot he hasnt scored in two years youre lighing up your big call for Music him heres Applause Tucker 5554 the last team into this tournament 15 seated California got the lead with 1114 to go theres one more second round game coming up its Syracuse and esin and really had a great first season here especially at home coach youve had some terrific teams going back from Florida GF Coast at USC youve had tremendous highlevel NBA players this team plays with great balance what what do you want to see early against Syracuse to find that balance for SMU well one of what one of two teams in the country six guys average double figures we need to share the basketball get out and transition were much better at points per possession when we steal the ball or they miss a shot the opponents Miss were not as good when the team makes a shot so we have to get out get some deflections deals and Get Off to the Races you guys played Syracuse 8 days ago uh you led for about a minute one and a tip in at the buzzer has your heart rate slowed down from that well Syracuse playing very good basketball they played a great game against us we were fortunate to win the game it was a great college basketball game and we expect them to play well tonight so we have to bring our best Andy thanks for joining us well see you soon good luck coach Andy nfield I maybe not that soon its a cow game soonish theyve played four and two overtimes in their last two respectively tomor coach with 1020 to go sto yakovich guarded by okara hes got 27 in the game trying to find Space Hees it up at the rim and gets fouled and sto yakovich took a hard hit hes got the last nine for Cal this beaten and battered and bruised bear team stovich will get to his feet tell you I mean look kids kids with all their workout coaches and everybody else that you know is going to advise them in the game one of the things they dont work on anymore is simple pivoting simple pivoting is is pretty much what one Villanova championships simple stuff like that he got into the paint had nothing going the pivoting created the options for him and he did get whacked in the head great Warp Tour Band by the way simple pivoting its a real band I was going to say I could got that here thats ped and this is Andre who goes one for two so 29 in the win yesterday over Virginia Tech 28 today and theyll take a break with 1010 to go see this is we said this early when you look at this group theyre theyre beaten and battered you got guys out with injury theyve played six overtimes in the last two games theyve traveled you know the world basically to get here you youve got to really you got to be crafty with your rotations in terms of giving sto yakovich a little break but but having to get him back in hes too important down the stretch Blakes has had a nice night and he ties it good good back and forth and its almost as if when one team scores they both score when both when one team doesnt score neither does the other that points to the argument about rhythm in this game Cal shooting at 61 23 for 38 P tritis off the shoe of Reno no kick ball Tucker with five to shoot Tucker tough one short and look who was there Petrus knocked it off last Touch by Blakes thats a just straight hustle hes awesome you he was a question coming into this game too as you see sto yakovich shaking out staying fresh hes dealt with a hip injury recently he was sick missed four games with that combination some tape on the wrist before the Applause game its a kick its a Applause kick its going to be called a foul against par now its a kick I I thought I saw AJ deci side hold up a one and a zero for oars Jersey but I guess its just going to be an out of bounds off the kick nobody wants to listen to me huh Im a visual learner or you youve learned enough working with me not to listen its okay yeah little column a little column b nine to go in this tie game in the ACC tournament long time Rivals from the Bay Area heres Campbell on the fade away another one he is free hes just having fun and sometimes thats what you need that thats what makes a team really dangerous we see that the NCA tournament the team thats not supposed to win plays freeer I dont know if thats a real word 15 for DJ Reno cannot answer long rebound heres Campbell all the way and into Reno for a Applause foul be the aggressor how many times have we work together I said the aggressor usually always wins but really the saying is the aggressor always wins Cals been that theyve just played with confidence and fearlessness and thats all you could ask from the guys that are still able to play its just good stuff hustle Coast to Coast a Soko kind of oppos occupies the opposite side you go into the shop blocker DJ Campbell had 10 yesterday all at the Lock 10 12 today hes got 16 hes hes let loose though and only one of those shots at the line and the foul was Renos third by the way 825 to go I also think he understands who he is on the floor with sto yakovich Applause out and as weve noted well keep noting it Wilkinson out and black Shire out those two are done for the game not that they played in the game they were out before the game well a concussion blackshire with a foot injury both suffered in the wind yesterday good reset thank you if you were talking about me or geler looking for r i dont like resets on the FL for so you there you go a to shoot it sers lost it off his knee its Soko and here come the Bears with petritis pavlovich DED right off aars arm and then no will drive it Tred to go behind his back he went off his Applause shoe can I say thats a good reset on the floor take a breath yes you know you know sto yakovich is coming in at the under eight so so if you can get a decent look even get fouled that would be great if youre cow dont do that another dribble off of shoe Blakes sers got whacked 7 minutes and 22 seconds remaining the California Golden Bears dared de just does a terrific job coaching basketball and kind of shorthanded to start and injuries give a lot of credit taking over that program a lot of excitement there should still be in the tournament the Mountaineers despite the one andone here 722 to go oiah sers his first points of the half come on free throws its 6260 Cal the 291st meeting of the Cal Stanford mens basketball rivalry they call it the big game in football they call it the battle of the bay and womens basketball here its just Cal Stanford and its DJ Campbell spinning home another two and a chance for three in a second half that he has dominated hes really found something by really getting hard going hard getting low right kind of selling the defender on going all the way to the basket and then spin it back hes gotten this a number of times here in the second half but again I go back to the fact that he can play fearlessly like there is so much talent out there but I think guys get stuck in the mud thinking too much being worried about the guy behind them if they mess up or miss a shot and youre going to get taken out there is something that is incredibly liberating about knowing theres really nobody else no there theres something about that Im not saying thats what you desire if youre Mark Matson DJ Campbell his second best scoring night of the year fourpoint lead for Cal Blakes makes it two and hes got 18 thats what happens when Maxine raino is in some way the facilitator around the perimeter theres nobody there to deter anything at The Rim blakeson right now 39 of of 62 for Stanford Campbell Soko and sty yakovich have 58 of the 64 for Cal heres cell again that Balls knocked around its another offensive rebound for cal every time they miss they seem to get the ball back and a three missed by Campbell and finally a defensive rebound for Stanford can you believe were 34 minutes into the game that is the 10th defensive rebound for Stanford versus 10 offensive rebounds for calan back cut Blakes he ties it in its fouled what a great delivery it was from Reno its the second time in two consecutive possessions that Campbell got beat on a back cut I understand taking the pass away but there are simple fundamentals that are just trying true right stay between your man and the basket thats one of them I I get again you want to take passes away you want to disrupt in that sense but two times in a row you get beat because of a good passing big and Blakes put Stanford in the lead with the free throw the foul was sto yakovich is third and if youre cow offensively and you have Maris Soko on the block with Blakes covering him and sto yakovich on his side the ball has to find those two stovich right now off the screen he gets a switch with rno the two best players in the game matched up and sto yakovich misses a pretty good look well thats a really good look thats thats one you certainly live with if anything you probably take that most times down the floor healer gets a hard r no screen he launches too Applause deep Campbell around is Soko screen now he went back to it problem was Rau was covered him Campbell step back three no good punched up in the air by Reno hes called or is he thought Reno was going to be called for the foul at first a cow Ben the year three rebounds shy of his 24th double double his 23 lead the country on our Stanford Applause record and he misses the front end of the one and one under five to play the 15 Seed Cow the seven seed Stanford Louisville gets the winner at 700 tomorrow night that have been an offive foul there all the ones they call petritis Got Away With It sto yakovich slip lost it and its into the hands of sellers Blakes is open what do we got here somebodys going to make a call it should be Stamford ball I think so it is I I still look at that handoff and its like thats the exact thing that they say is what theyre trying to get out of the game that handoff he just I dont know who he lit up but it was Music somebody keny geler with Renault sers young and Jaylen Blakes who onepoint shy of a career high Zone it up here is tough to do with this man on the floor hes just such a gets to his left hand no got it back rare offensive rebound for Stanford Reno would like the basketball again why not left it short again he missed two Soko did a good job of keeping him off balance on the turn what he spun sooko got his body into the offensive player so he didnt have balance on the shot ultimately good scouting does that you can see what you can do to limit somebody Christian Tucker DJ Campbell bricked it and stoyanovich lies in weight for a cow put back and a Golden Bear lead many times have I said probably this week alone the worst misses favor the offense now Granite cows been great on the offensive glass but that was such a bad miss that the offensive player was likely to get it this is just great stuff what a story this is 6 over times in the last two game and Cal is on the precipice of another theyre up one 318 to go against their arch rival from across the bay in Charlotte North Carolina of all places 6665 Stanford with a ball sers with a drive and the Miss and the rebound is Soko really good defense there from cow on the wall up right you take some contact on the dribble but once they go up for the shot go straight up I love that theyre giving that to the defense under three to play heres Campbell hes for shy of a career high stovich is three shot with no Wilkinson and no blackshire tonight geler against to yakovich hide Advantage for the Cowman the former Stanford man leaves it short and its tipped out by sasoko to Campbell another offensive rebound for Cal which has grabbed more of its Miss than Stanford has stovich again into the paint out for Campbell tough catch got to shoot it oh in and Applause out not a bad possession though for Cal I know you want to score now this cant happen if youre Cal oh a quick one while theyre away oziah sers for a Stanford lead his first threepointer since since the opening minutes time out Cal were back at a half minute one to the best shooter on the floor for Stamford in sellers all the offensive rebounds have been great but youre right thats where it can hurt you and it was the first three for Stanford in 15 minutes 59 seconds is anybody else do it gosh yes sellers other than that its those four the guy who just hit the goahead shot not even on that graphic and theres a foul against keer thatll put sakovich at the line for a one and one okay I love what sto yakovich just did did you see what he just did after the foul he continued to shoot it right he hasnt really had a great Rhythm over the last few minutes and as a shooter you just kind of want to feel it come out of your hand before you go to the free throw line I love that he actually continued through that went through the shot process and let it fly one and one for sto yakovich there will be a second tell you theres something to that you know he has really hes been fighting a lot of what hes been doing is coming off the bounce he hasnt really had that much of a rhythm here since the second half shooting the ball Andre sto yakovich with a new career high 32 has tied it at the line this has been good man a really good game great heer in all kinds of trouble dribbles out of it heres Chism aara Reno touch pass sellers short keer with the offensive rebound taste to cows own medicine Giller 90 seconds in the game Reno for Blakes six to shoot it the former dukeman gives it to Applause Giller he hit that one from pal Alto wow look good possession for Cal and I thought theyd get REO involved I I thought maybe a pick and pop you drag out the defense a little bit were not able to get Reno involved and and this is really all you had left giler with the bomb and he found a little something off the bounce too he had people behind us U and Allen on his little ball handling but this is huge good defense now if youre cow youve got to start figuring out how youre going to get some easy offense because Ive got to tell you the last few minutes its been a grind on the offensive end I think youre really starting to see tired bodies for cow I think theyve done a good job defensively particularly against Reno hes going to get his either way but he hasnt been able to influence the game as well as he could I think youve got to find ways to manufacture some easy and somewhat quick offense too the first time K and Stamford have met east of Tempe Arizona they played in Berkeley in Palo Alto in Vegas and Tempe and now in Charlotte and this game like many of the others in the Pacific time zone is going right down to the end stovich on the switch with Blakes barrels into him step back two hes got 34 and its a onepoint game thats where theyre going to go for quick offense is just clear maybe ball screen if he gets a switch great if not attack the open side of the floor Cal used its final timeout after the last possession Stanfords got two theyve got the ball in the hands of Reno and he lost it with contact and then giler couldnt take it away from Campbell Stak its flocked by Reno he chased him down Cal I think has to foul here unless hakar is going to charge oh wow what do we have a blocking foul and a basket okaro with a threepoint opportunity the entire possession that started with the block for renult making his way back in it looked like St yakovich was wide open hes going to step in very slowly he took his time stepping into this one Reno comes from behind gets the block and then it goes the other way aara we dont hand out charges like we used to make it a two possession game he does Chism aara of Four Points being in Charlotte but how much would the man who loves these schools and the conference of Champions more than anybody else be he probably refused to do the game stovic in trouble he gets it back from Campbell for three thats pure wow looking like his old man 14 to go a leaks out and dunks it they didnt foul because they couldnt get to him so Cal is out of timeouts and Stanford will try to foul Blakes missed it stovic theyre going to call it theyre calling the foul its an illegal screen on sasoko Valentine has an offensive foul on sasoko and its Stanford ball theres a part of me that probably says yeah it probably was it probably was it was it probably was either way whether its a point of emphasis or not it probably was Ted Valentine is the guy that will call it its the right call Blakes Ray no and Reno is fouled and two shots are coming for maxim Reno and if he hits one it pretty much seals the game hey this has been a great game both these teams think hey East Coast wake up to these guys this is good stuff look Mark Matson terrific job with this program Kyle Smith terrific job with that program Maxine Ray REO one of the best players in college basketball that needs to be talked about a little bit more Andre sto yovic its a bit of a coming out party if the nation didnt know Andre St yakovich yet after 37 points they certainly do and they have needed every one of them no Javon blackshire with a foot injury no Jeremiah Wilkinson with a concussion second and third leading scores for Cal are out theyre down four players who started this year they have played six overtimes in the last two games there no way no way they should be hanging around here and yet they have given it everything but now it comes down to Reno with 53 to go and two free throws I think Campbell sto yakovich and sissoko has really carried the way here for Cal but its been everybody fighting you got to give them all the credit in the world Rayo puts his hand to his ear after he makes it a twopossession game 77 free throw shooter Kev you also go back real quickly sto yakovich makes that three and they give up in an immediate dunk yep that was killer didnt get a chance to foul although this is an amazing free throw shooting team they went 84 in the lead and Renault hits him both so its going to take some band on the field lateral kind of heroics here oh good job youre a pro sto yakovich back for Campbell back to sto yakovich she hoists he misses and the ball game is over it belongs to the Stanford Cardinal 7873 the Cardinal and the Cardinals
