youre watching the ACC on ESPN from Little John Coliseum in Clemson South Carolina its the 19th ranked Tigers taking on the Hokies from Virginia Tech and welcome everybody along with Corey Alexander Im Doug Sherman Angel gray will join us shortly and if you look at the standings right now Clemson is in first place in the ACC which is not where they were expected to be coming into the year you see they were number 11 preseason and in spite of having lost their last time out they are still setting the pace in the Atlantic Coast Conference meanwhile for the Hokies they found themselves in a similar sitchin a situation a year ago and yet somehow Corey they were able to figure it out and turn things around they absolutely turned it around youre talking about the ACC tournament champions a year ago who finished the season at 132 in their last 15 games and it all started at Florida State going into that game at two and seven they were able to knock down 18 threes as a team Hunter Couture was responsible for nine of those himself and got them going into our third member who is the flyest of them all today Angel gray take it away guys Im just trying to keep up with you but they will have to the Tigers will have to go with that their second leading scorer as well as their assist leader and Chase Hunter tonight due to a foot injury that he suffered against Duke I am told he is day today the team is optimistic about his return the biggest question coming into this window Corey not only how does the Tigers bounce back after suffering their first conference loss but how they do so without their floor General Chase Hunter is a conductor and a big reason of how they got things going early in the season angel I would not say that chase Hunter is is the best player for the Clemson Tigers but hes the most important player for the Clemson Tigers and so Clemson goes into war once again without two of its starting guards as Alex Hemingway continues to sit with plantar fasciitis and so that means number zero Joss Beadle has even more on his plate here again tonight Corey it does and UC early trying to get PJ Hall established on the inside hell have the basketball in his hands a lot as will this guy hunter Tyson who was playing at a firstteam all ACC level he sure is 158 points per game over 10 rebounds per game here he comes to the basketball instead sheplin gives it off to PJ Hall who has to fire away with the shot clock going on Applause and here is Sean Padula at the point the seventh leading scorer in the ACC at over 16 points per game and hes got an awful lot on his plate Corey he absolutely does he thought he was going to get some help from Rodney rice who injured his fingers Justin bus lines up the three unable to knock it down rice only playing one game in the Syracuse game injuring his finger having finger surgery so most likely wont be available at least until the ACC tournament yeah Rodney had surgery yesterday we know hes watching from Blacksburg best wishes to my guy from my understanding he was playing great basketball especially in practice good to see Hunter Couture back he is such a key part for the hoagies misfiring on his first attempt from the floor Music shefflin in the paint left it short nice job Walling up and grabbing that rebound for Grant basily now the Hokies Walk It Out Applause Darius Mattis around and out good box out by BJ Hall right now its been a lid on the basket for both teams still scoreless but you see Clemson wanting to play through the post shuffling getting his opportunities medulla with a burst off the steal and the seal is broken the Hokies on the board first and speaking of playing great basketball Sean Padula has been doing so all season long for the Hokies every game hes been in double figures but ran into a bus on Kihei Clark last time out against Virginia this is the second meeting of the Year between these two schools Clemson won at Virginia Tech back in early January in a threepoint ball game foreign Galloway somehow found a teammate PJ Hall able to finish the play and the soft touch for PJ Hall and we talk about injuries PJ Hall recovering from two injuries over the summer and the fall still trying to get himself back into 100 shape Applause well he put 26 on Duke on the 14th and then on Tuesday at Wake Forest he went for 22 sounds like hes coming along hes coming along you mentioned it 48 points in the last two games for PJ Hall and right now Brad Brownell going to play through him one of the very few guys that physically can match with Justin mutts as much tries to get the call but unable to do so picking up a flop technical foul and so that will be a free throw for the Tigers Applause and there is the 13th year head coach here at Clemson University has his team off to a 154 start they have won 13 in a row here at Littlejohn including 100 this season and that 70 start to conference play the best in program history theyve only won one regular season championship in the ACC and that was 33 years ago Corey yeah and again when you think about that year if you look back youre talking about Dell Davis youve got a squad or you know a 1990 team youre talking about and these guys were spectacular Elder Campbell had just moved on but when you go back and look at the bigs that have played at Clemson it is a special group Horace Grant tree Rollins the list goes on my big fella Sharon Wright add this guy into the mix PJ Hall who continues to cement himself as one of the better big men in Clemson basketball history a junior from Spartanburg he and the Tigers on top 42 early Applause Hunter Tyson all over Maddox shot clock under 10 fedula probing on the switch shoots the three Applause Kentucky fresh is a small thing but you see how PJ Hall is able to switch out on the guards and contest their shots even guys like medulla who are great off the dribble thats what makes him so valuable not just what he does offensively hands on breaks and gets the friendly roll Applause foreign off to a slow start from the floor today oh for four on threepointers until there not surprisingly its Grant fazzilli making nearly 40 percent of his threes on the year to make it 75 Clemson and Brazilian adds that Dimension that Virginia Tech had a year ago with Kevin Loma the bib stretch the floor at the five positions passed mishandled though and lost out of bounds by RJ Godfrey Applause Music Applause well in the first game between these two teams back in early January Corey five Tigers reached double digits Hunter Tyson led the way with 13 points 14 rebounds theyre going for what would be the first ever series sweep in a regular season matchup between the two but the physicality in that game was a problem for Virginia Tech it was that and thats one thing for certain that Mike young does not like is for people to be more physical than his team especially in Castle Coliseum on their home floor something that coach young has talked to his team about made sure that they were prepared for the level of physicality coming here to Little John and in that game they shot only 28 percent on twos and thats the worst of the Mike young ERA this is year number four for the head coach of the Hokies has his team trying to snap a sixth game losing streak Music Applause Music hey Alexander Im Doug Sherman at Angel gray as well in this matchup of great importance for both these teams Clemson looking to get back into the win column and maintain sole possession of first place in the ACC meanwhile the Hokies are in the midst Cory of their longest losing streak in eight years but all is not lost for Virginia Tech at this point this Virginia Tech team is a team thats much better than their record and when you look at the fact that these guys have struggled in ACC play you also take into account that theyve been here before this is a team that was two and seven to start the season a year ago in ACC play went on to win 13 of their last 15 games including winning the ACC tournament so Mike young not hitting the panic button yet but he says time is running out and of course we got a third member Angel gray talking to us about the Clemson Tigers absolutely will guys the tigers are going to have to go without their second leading scorer and their assist leader in Chase Hunter due to a foot injury that he suffered against Duke I am told he is day today they are optimistic about his return but the biggest question coming into this one Corey obviously was not only how did the Tigers bounce back after suffering their first conference loss but how they do so without their floor General a very intricate piece to their success this season Chase Hunter the conductor thats the big name I have given him because he controls so many different things on this floor of course I love it Angels already throwing out nicknames hes giving people nicknames all that I can appreciate that but and Chase Hunter may not be the best player on this Clemson team but he may be the most important player on this Clemson team right now show you what you he has been doing lately for Clemson 48 points in the last two games with PJ Hall continues to be a force on the Block very few guys can physically contend with Justin must when they catch the ball with their back to the basket however PJ Hawes has success here early yeah the Junior from Spartanburg South Carolina as you said 48 points last two games 26 against Duke on the 14th 22 on Tuesday in the loss at Wake Forest so far in this matchup its been a complete contrast in Styles five threepoint shots have been taken by Tech none so far by Clemson pokies try to go inside unsuccessfully and turn it over if thats not something you see a lot of from Virginia Tech six nationally only 99 turnovers a game but it turns into a bucket for Hunter Tyson who is playing first team on acc tight basketball its almost right on cue the Hokies go inside it doesnt work and for the first time Clemson goes outside and as you mentioned Hunter Tyson making 42 percent from Beyond The Arc this year knocks down his first today but his points off turnovers Hunter Tyson is playing aggressive basketball talking to Bradford now he loves the confidence Hunters playing with this year and he knew he was capable of it without injuries hes played great basketball but now playing healthy getting the job done Brazilian no Hall with another rebound yeah Hunter Tyson second in the ACC seventh in the nation with his 10 and Counting double doubles Godfrey no Applause Music Applause Padula and Couture in the backcourt Brazilian mutts along with Darius Maddox who sets the screen for Hunter Couture to see the ability to be able to switch makes Clemson so different DJ Hall coming in thinking that he had a good block on that possession as Virginia Tech tries to take advantage of the switch but you see Brad Brown now defensively switching everything forcing Virginia Tech to have to make individual plays or punish a mismatch on the Block theres the 13th year head coach former standout player at division three DePauw University in his home state of Indiana although he has picked up a Southern drawl over the last 1314 years well you have to remember he started his head coaching career at UNC Wilmington so hes been in the South for quite a bit of time now his other coaching staff was at Wright State medulla flips up a wild shot looking for the foul call that doesnt count heres Beetle the redshirt freshman Bullet Pass inside Middlebrooks no trying again keeps it alive to himself finally coming in to finish the play is RJ Godfrey that goes back to the physicality that you spoke about three opportunities for Clemson on the offensive glass and they have been quicker and stronger to finish than have the Hokies and middle Brooks has every bit of 242 and then Godfrey doesnt look like your usual freshman 67 225 thats coming off the bench for the Tigers you had a little conversation with that young man Lynn Kidd right before this ball game I sure did interesting matchup Lynn Kidd who reclassed up missed his senior year of high school to come to Clemson transferring to Virginia Tech this is the first time he will see action on this court and Littlejohn as an opponent in comparison to being a member of the Clemson Tigers and he had a little extra motivation in this game Middlebrooks Music one thing for certain we knew it was going to be physical in this game as Beale gets inside and finds Middleburg whos able to unable to finish on the first one but middlebrush continues to stay with it the second chance and then Godfrey coming in with the finish and heres a guy thats no stranger to the Clemson grit the Clemson physicality Lynn Kidd the transfer to Virginia Tech but he cut his teeth here at Littlejohn as a freshman but he likely would have red shirted if not for the extra covid year he played only seven games for Brad Brownell had a concussion and it just never came together here at Clemson and he has really taken that big step this year here is Kid Applause four to shoot Couture with the runner and its a wedgie its a soft wedgie though it is thats it I mean soft wedging you see how easily they were able to get that out of the rim thats not a tough wedge you dont need to use the fist to get that out there you can just use the hands and tap that one away if they didnt have somebody else get that ball down I was gonna you on your way yeah you know I thought about that you talked to me earlier about your dunking ability were you able to dunk a tennis ball and you could rattle home a volleyball never dunk a basketball nope but uh I think you could have got that wedgie out there heres Justin mutts wrap around pass Glenn Kidd with four quick points off the bench for Tech yeah Lincoln coming in being a Difference Maker just like that now its a onepoint game because of backtoback buckets McCory in his first two years one of Clemson one attack he scored a total of 15 points now this season hes hit 104 points and Counting Turn Around by RJ Godfrey rarely do you see teams in the ACC challenge Justin mutts on the interior but right now Clemson has won that battle with a number of different players going at butts on the Block Hokies have begun to heat up making their last three from the floor mutts denied Godfrey with a rejection and Clemson has numbers right now with much behind inside they go swing to the corner shot fate for Tyson after the flyby and the long rebound comes to Virginia Tech missed opportunity for the Clemson Tigers on that possession bus was behind the play Hunter Tyson got a great look Maddox with a quick release off the back iron Godfrey had a shot at it kept it alive Clemson basketball Darius Maddox is doing a little more of what Mike young has asked him be aggressive shoot the basketball feels like hes been very comfortable since coming back from the break Music Applause Hunter Tyson with his second bucket thats Hunter on Hunter crime right there weve got Hunter Tyson going up against Hunter Couture these two guys mixing it up on the Block and Dougie fresh one thing weve got to know Sean Padula taking a break for the first time in four games this is the first time hes been out of the game as MJ Collins steps up and knocked down the big three and there are lots of folks from Clover South Carolina rooting on that young man The Freshman who grew up just a couple of hours from here told us this morning hes got over 20 family and friends who have made the trip to Clemson well you know hes got to put on there no no choice other than to have a great showing when youve got all those people coming to watch you play Applause and I believe weve got another flop technical on Collins on that possession Applause Music our second of the ball game and it takes us to our second media timeout 1614 Clemson when he saw the crowd rushing the floor he said we have to expect this telling his team if we want to take the next step as a group we have to understand how we need to be a Powerhouse in this conference and expecting those type of wins guys yeah you can expect it all you want theyre going to brush before when you big Duke I dont care what the record is its gonna happen here and of course Little John Coliseum one of the most difficult places to play in the ACC that goes way back before I even I played college basketball but when I was playing this was always a tough place to play back in the black and white days you know well again again remember youre older than me so whatever you say my games are bouncing off me it sticks to you buddy medulla absorbs the contact didnt finish the play but thats something with his bigger upper body he has put on good weight this year to be able to do that sort of thing he absolutely has much stronger and playing like it this season as hes been brought my opinion the most improved player in the ACC ENT well hes one of the few players in the country who has taken a double figure jump in scoring average from year to year hes up more than 10 points per game and part of that is opportunity with storm Murphy Moving on but part of it is hes just better than he was a year ago as a freshman so we got a coachs box warning on Brad Brownell Music Doug sermons making sure he goes over and I can respect the fact that Doug service Roger here is theyve been very communicative with us making sure we know everything thats going they make us look like we actually know whats going on you need all the help you can get absolutely do I did not go to officiating School two to shoot Galloway steps around the defender and does a good job just to get it on the rim pokeys basketball down by three just over nine remaining in the first half Padula crosses over the defender dumps it off and there is a foul that will send Lynn Kidd the free throw line to shoot two on our big Monday ACC Big 12 college basketball doubleheader on ESPN in the F Duke travels to Blacksburg to take on these Virginia Tech Hokies at seven oclock Eastern and then well take you to Waco for chiante George a number 21 Baylor squaring off against Jalen Wilson in number two Kansas Wilson was the only Jayhawk to do anything on offense today they got absolutely throttled by TCU well and thats two losses this week for the Kansas Jayhawks correct they lost at Kansas State earlier my guy keante Johnson getting the job done at KState Jerome Tang doing a great job Applause Lynn Kidd getting a large Ovation from the Virginia Tech faithful behind the bench here applauding his performance thus far and what would be a homecoming Applause Dylan Hunter while his older brother sits with the injury getting more extended run and PJ Hall spinning and glancing at the Hokies bench dangerous if he if hes doing that we really have a problem the ACC has a problem if PJ Hall is stepping out knocking down the three ball but he was the top 50 recruit nationally coming in this has been expected and its been coming and like you said now that hes healthy or close to healthy its really starting to come together yeah and he picks up the foul there battling on the Block getting the basketball back continuing to try to fight around this is Dylan Hunter six three and a half freshmen from Atlanta Sunrise Christian Academy Music Applause also into the game Chauncey Wiggins who had a breakthrough performance in Tuesdays game at Wake Forest played 30 minutes careerhigh 10 points three of five from the yard Dylan Hunter inside shefflin I like the things that young man does around the paint but one of the things you continue to see is the concerted effort from Brad Brown now and the Tigers to throw the basketball inside to force the Hokies to have to guard their interior players much pass knocked away but itll stay at this end where a little magic has just happened during this timeout Corey Alexander I know Ive never made a 94 foot Putt and Ive never made a putt for ten thousand dollars but it just happened well Im not sure if this young man did before but he did when it matters and you see the Jubilee the excitement 10 grand in his hand give me my money apparently its got to go for tuition not for having a party tonight I mean it depends on how they give it to you cash at me homie 10 grand Justin mutts to the left hand the versatility of the young man from Millville New Jersey on display once again thats a big bucket Virginia Tech needed that because they needed to show that they were going to match the physicality of Clemson and they must doing the job defensively as well coming up with the steal that bucket there first in over three minutes heres must moving the basketball gets it back from Couture here goes Couture off the bus trying to get to the Baseline loving the hunter on Hunter matchup Padula I love the rebounding Chase weve got for the title in the ACC threeman race between Jesse Edwards from Syracuse Hunter Tyson for Clemson and Armando bacon for North Carolina asked Hunter Tyson this morning would you like to win instead of not even thinking about it but its a great threeman race over 10 per game I love the match I love the race but I must add the asterisks in the race four you do realize that Armando bacon only played one minute against Virginia thats true that does hurt the app that does hurt the average significance no question one Rebound in that game if not for that he would have had a double figure rebounds because he gets double figure rebounds every game and so he would be far away in the league just got to work a little harder the rest of the year I mean this motivation but I love the fact that Hunter Tyson as he comes up with another rebound is getting the job done from the three the small forward position thats even more impressive that hes going out averaging double figure rebounds from the wing but he said this morning its actually easier for him from the wing he can see whats going on and get a running start and his numbers have just jumped for more 100 lets go to Angel you just saw the numbers on the side of the screen but how about having the respect from your head coach bronnell said hes just a grown man he comes in he gets a cup of coffee and hes in here an hour and 15 minutes before he even lifts so he was just talking about just sitting down making his oatmeal drinks a cup of coffee like a grown man and hes been able to play Like It All season they trust him and they definitely want to see him progress as the season goes on that sounds like your routine you drink coffee right every day do you eat oatmeal not usually not usually coffee and you know breakfast is setting up coming in so that that sounds like a old man not a grown man thats all right whatever works for you absolutely its working for Hunter Tyson no question about that Applause the tour is yet to score tonight for Virginia Tech 10 to shoot mutts working on the Freshman cheflin Lynn Kidd a little strong on that shot oh yeah if my memory serves me correctly PJ Hall and Lynn Kim were in the same class coming to Clemson those guys possibly roommates back in the day now battling against each other here in opposite uniform and either way they certainly would have squared off in practice every day for a whole year when Lynn Kidd was a freshman with the Tigers making his return to Little John Coliseum instead wearing the Chicago maroon and burnt orange three ball first of the night for Couture and a beautiful dime Cross Court hook pass from Justin mutts and I love the way Hunter Couture was already prepared to shoot the basketball as soon as it touched his hands and thats not unusual for Justin mutts among the best passers in the ACC over four dimes per game but he was waiting for the exact moment he watched Brevin Galloway sink in too far to where he could not contest Hunter Couture shot and then immediately delivers on a dime right into Hunter shooting pocket I love the way Mike young describes Hunter Couture quote hes tough as a pine knot in his usual home spun Radford Virginia charms and he is playing through a painful arm injury that kept him on the sideline for four games BJ Hall draws the foul with just under five minutes remaining in the half Music tomorrow well have an ACC womens basketball matinee on ABC and the ESPN app Diamond Johnson leads number 20 NC State against Haley van lit and Louisville coverage begins at one Eastern on ABC and the ESPN app Johnson leading the team in threepoint shooting percentage amazing to see that graphic when you watch Louisvilles womens basketball program without a number beside it meaning theyre not ranked youre talking about one of the best programs in the country not just in the ACC which by the way happens to be loaded deep on the womens basketball side NC State whos the threetime reigning ACC Tournament champion their 20th theyre like fourth or fifth in the ACC right now youre talking about Virginia Tech you got Notre Dame so many different programs who have made the ascent this year on the womens basketball side Nations eight teams right now from the ACC on the womens side are in the bracket Applause should be at least eight or nine on the mens side but you know well get into that later PJ Hall makes pair of free throws hes now got nine points to go along with three rebounds to lead all scorers to Clemson lead back to three Applause nice fine Lynn Kidd on the reverse off the feed from mutts give him another assist its just smart basketball though just as much recognizing the defender on the outside Hunter Couture Thorn get to the top of the key the easy high low pass for Lynn Kidd who has his third field goal here in this homecoming hes got eight points well on his way to a new career high as we get closer to halftime whistle on the drive by Galloway Applause as Hunter Couture looks to see if he could get the basketball inside the kid Justin much knows that as soon as he catches the basketball hes going to go high low with kid because the Defenders are on the top side the easy opportunity to lay up at a onepoint game for Virginia Tech lets go back to Angel guys heres a stat for you Lynn Kidd through his first two season had a combined 15 points in this season alone he is already at a hundred so when you talk about a player that has put in the work you already mentioned he may have a little juice behind it too returning back to Clemson but this is a player that has been dialed in all season Angel and I I went to him before the game and I said hey you got anything on being back here in Little John and he said business as usual I said any extra added motivation and he wanted to say the right thing Angel but Im giving them the look and he says a little bit he had to admit there was a little extra fire in this game all on the post entry and hes out of IMG we talked about the development of Lynn Kidd he was on a loaded roster where he was a backup behind guys like Zach Edie I mean he didnt play a ton and he clashed up he reclassed and again his development everybodys on a different pace you got to run your own race and for Lincoln it seems to be coming together this year but Lynn Kidd another one one of the guys whos come to Virginia Tech and spent some time on the bench watching the system and then once they got their opportunity to play coming into being productive Kevin Luma comes to mind as Galloway turns it over foreign Music that puts the Hokies in front 2625 meanwhile the Tigers have been without a field goal for more than four minutes now Corey the threepoint field goal is so important for Virginia Tech now four for ten from Beyond The Arc take their first lead here in the first half and Sean Padula playing with tremendous confidence well be back in 30 seconds Music Applause Music Applause thank you Music foreign Music I was thinking about it and just completely eliminating Dougie fresh from the from this broadcast but hes my guy just like you and Jordan Cornett who are rocking the hair now when I met these guys Doug they were both ball dish now they both rocking the Fades not only my do I feel partly responsible I feel proud to see my guys rocking the hair on TV what is baldish well its when youre trying to decide whether your hairline has gone too far back for you to wear your hair gotcha or if you could still get away with it gotcha you know and and right now both my guys rocking the hair proud of them both thankfully thats not something you or I worry too much about Music yeah Im not going to say that you know I dont worry about it its coming its going to happen so I dont worry about it because its inevitable although among the things we saw in the graphic coming back and what the guys in studio were talking about is that Virginia tax takes care of the basketball theyve only turned it over three times Corey they are sixth in the country and fewest turnovers per game but seven assists on 10day field goal sharing the basketball and of course that is just a byproduct of Mike Young basketball another good look behanukkah tour unable to knock it down but great offensive movement for the hokers PJ Hall with his fourth rebound hes got the basketball now tries to pass inside but bazilly knocks it away seventh Clemson turnover Padula Bullet Pass mutts with a layout the patience Sean Padula unable to be sped up he knew he had killed his own dribble but yet still not going to put himself in a tough predicament stays patient makes the right play even under the rest Applause Music Ula catches himself in the painted area yet multiple pump fakes and there was so much action going on PJ Hall kind of caught in between as to where he needed to be defensively just as much finds the open spot in the Easy Button Oh I thought it was another dime ends up being a turnover great recovery defensively by Hunter Tyson for the Steal Music heres Galloway on his third stop in college most recently Boston College Godfrey back out front finds Hall 43 long rebound Tyson went after it but Padulas got it for the Hokies lost it Beatle after it but Doula gets it back no change of possession shot clock Down Under 20 Couture Brazilian chance for three and Padula back in midcourt holding his head after that scrum for the basketball Applause getting on the floor gaining possession for his team and of course for Virginia Tech you have to be aware of Hunter Couture and his ability UC Sean Padula not wanting to turn over diving on the floor and then his Hunter Couture gets the basketball such a dangerous shooter the pump bag gets two tigers in the air opening up Grand basili for the bucket and the harm the grad transfer from Wright State University now with those seven points and its a sixpoint Tech lead Virginia Tech has not won a game in over a month Corey not since they beat Grambling State way back on December the 17th pokeys hoping to get that elusive win here tonight at Clemson Music our big Monday ACC Big 12 college basketball doubleheader is a good one on ESPN on the ESPN app Duke travels to Blacksburg to take on the Hokies at seven Eastern and then well take you to Waco number 21 Baylor squaring off against number two Kansas Duke defeated number 17 Miami this afternoon 6866 and Corey it was so good to see Derek Lively have a big game off the bench for the Blue Devils 10 rebounds five block shots six points Derek Lively has played through injuries of course he missed a tremendous amount of the preseason this year but he will be very important for the Blue Devils going down the stretch this season more because of his Grand protection and defense than his scoring held ball and the possession arrow goes the other way itll be Clemson possession Applause Corey the Tigers last field goal was at the 757 Mark that is now seven minutes ago yeah weve watched Virginia Tech go through a drought very similar here in this first half but the Hokies have found the Rhythm on offensively and theyve picked it up on the defensive end as well Music Chaplin a little strong Tyson had it for a moment but then knocked Away by MJ Collins Music Applause final 30 seconds of the half Applause sets the screen for fedula heres mutts feeds inside Applause blocked by Hall plenty of time on the clock for the Tigers Applause foul off the ball as Hall and kid came together Applause thats on Lynn Kidd the official is going to go look at this one Doug sermons right on top of it and immediately said were going to go look at this as you see Lynn Kidd standing up PJ Hall from that angle not as difficult to see how high That Elbow came but if it does make contact above the neck and it does not looks like he got him in the shoulder I believe that would just be a common foul because if that elbow was above the neck that would be a flagrant foul but I think thats just going to be a common foul looks as though that elbow then kid hit him squarely in the shoulder I agree with the ca I think its going to be just a common foul the second personal on Lynn Kidd who has been so good for the Hokies so far tonight he has been and Lynn Kidd of course hes heard about the physicality of Clemson and UC he wants to make sure that he provides as well lets go okay so it is actually going to be a flagrant one simply because Doug sermons and Roger Ayers going over looking at it felt like that it was excessive and not an unnecessary so that will be a flagrant one against Lynn Kidd and thats a momentum breaker honestly for Virginia Tech because it gives Clemson opportunity to score two points at the free throw line but also get the basketball back with 74 remaining and try to cut into this sixpoint lead Music Applause Music and here is PJ Hall out of Dorman High School Spartanburg South Carolina Music Applause last year honorable mention all ACC and he was the runnerup to Darion sebron North Carolina State for the most improved player in the Atlantic Coast Conference he gets one out of two from the line hes into double figures and that snaps at eight nothing Virginia Tech run but more importantly the basketball back the opportunity to put points on the ball right here to cut into this Virginia Tech lead Galloway lobs it in Paul gives it back to Galloway three seconds two seconds Galloway runs into his teammate and is called for traveling and I love that call I love that call because it wasnt running into his teammate now there was contact with Virginia Tech but because it was Galloway running into the back of Hunter Tyson its called to travel and even though Hunter Couture does give Hunter Tyson a little bit of a shove right there Im not sure its enough for that type of reaction that is the ninth turnover of the first half for Clemson badulus he falls short and that is the end of the first half of the Hokies on the move with a fivepoint lead and a strong turnaround for Virginia Tech to end the first half gaining the fivepoint lead after struggling to score Midway through they were able to get together offensively and defensively as well lets go to Angel Applause coach lets talk offense first she went on an 80 run to regain the league and thats that in the first half but you have also four of your starters that have already knocked down the threepoint shot so when youre looking at the execution what do you like most you know Angel okay all right we had a couple of really bad miscues in transition bad shot selection um you know a couple of very uncharacteristic turnovers but all in all I thought we competed on that end and we had some good high low stuff with mutts in the uh in the post players most impressed and pleased with what we did on the defensive end I thought we guarded Clemson whos quite good offensively PJ Hall and others so a long way to go thanks coach and indeed the tigers with no field goals in the final 7 57 of the half 3126 our halftime score Virginia Tech on top of first place Clemson lets send it to Jordan Sean and Dallin back in the studio oh my guys Applause Music oh back in tigertown as the Clemson Tigers Trail Virginia Tech 3126 moments away from the start of the second half with Corey Alexander and Angel gray Im Doug Sherman welcome back everybody Clemsons had control for the first 1314 minutes of that half but then the the switch just flipped there Corey the flips with the splish flip simply because of the defense of the Virginia Tech they were great defensively and their offense really got them started on that but you talk about the start for the Clemson Tigers it had to do with PJ Hall getting off to a great start great touch around the rim he was able to attack the basket he dominated the paint early and even stepped out knocked down a three ball 10 points with PJ Hall in the first half to go along with his five rebounds but Virginia Tech was able to steady the ship from Beyond the threepoint line Grant basili getting involved into action MJ Collins knocking down a three and then of course the usual suspect Hunter Couture and Sean Padula getting involved in the mix as well and Angel gray had an opportunity to talk with Brad Brownell to talk about his first half well Corey weve asked the question at the beginning of the game how this team was going to execute without Chase Hunter coach Brownell told me the exact same thing and it was alluding to that to his team the same question he said were playing like a team with no quarterback hes not thrilled with the nine turnovers but on the flip side he said defensively we were able to do a few good things hes proud of how theyre able to fly off the ball and able to put a little bit more pressure on them but the main objective in this have is to play better together and limit turnovers well the Tigers in that first half angel only nine of 27 shooting those nine turnovers youre talking about which were turned into nine points by tech and and the Tigers just went Stone Cold no field goals over the last eight minutes of that first half and thats where your point guard becomes most important when things arent going your way youve got to have that guy to settle things down and recognize this exactly who he needs to get the basketball in the hands of or take it upon himself Brazilians and again funds and playing without two of its starting guard because of injury Chase Hunter and Alex Hemingway who has been out much longer because of plantar fasciitis and Beetle On Cue turns it over and that Beatles first turnover from the point guard position between Beetle and Dylan Hunter over two from the field both three field goal attempts two assists and thats the first turnover as you see Dylan Hunter immediately checking into the game for Josh Beadle and one of the things that Brad Brownell has talked to his young point guards about the redshirt freshman in Beetle the freshman and Dylan Hunter is simply about being solid with the basketball making the right play in comparison to trying to make a spectacular play and on top of the scoring both those guys bring Chase Hunter shoots it at 40 averaging over 14 per game and Hemingway at 50 from Beyond the arm Justin butts now starting to assert himself in the painted area and again when youre able to go at PJ Hall and win that battle youre talking about a strong young man but Justin mutts is exactly that six points for mutts this is the largest lead of the night for either side Hunter Tyson saves it but out of bounds Virginia Tech basketball that is the 11th Clemson turnover Music well the Tigers led by six in the first half Virginia Tech led by five at the break and the Hokies looking to snap a sixgame losing streak and during that time Sean Padula has not shot well the team has a hole during the stretch Corey is not shotted well well but a lot of reasons why they have a shot of well for those games theyve missed Hunter Couture and you consider the fact that Hunter Couture not only is their best threepoint shooter but hes also the backup point guard his Justin Buss turns it over great job defensively by PJ Hall coming up with steal Applause all right Music Applause Music shuffling skip pass spotting up Dylan Hunter no and its a good look for Dylan Hunter hes capable of making that shot but right now Virginia Tech is going to give him those looks theyre going to make make him be the guy that beats him in comparison to giving PJ ho opportunity to be able to work on the Block and he is now over 11 on threepoint shocks this year and its had a quiet first half now he sets the screen for Padula three to shoot Padula has to fire away out of bounds whose basketball is it its going to go back to Virginia Tech a lot of the partly because of the hustle of Grant bazilly going after the offensive rebound even though he was sandwiched in between two tigers that basketball actually goes out of bounds off of Hunter Tyson Music good job Music Applause Justin mutz the pass to bazilly who missed the layup terrific back cut terrific pass possession continued but Padula missed the three Applause Music Applause trying to find Hall inside and you see right now PJ Hall with the beautiful move and beats the double team Champa Doula was coming to the top side to double team PJ Hall PJ Hall recognizes it and immediately spins to the Baseline once he gets the basketball PJ Hall sees the look but he sees Sean Padula coming in on the double team just as much knowing that he has helped coming in cant give up that Baseline PJ Hall with a quick spin move the finish the opportunity for the end one Munch joins his teammates Maddox and kid each with two fouls Paul continues to put numbers up by the way that threepoint play the first field goal since 7 57 of the first half to Clemson and little John comes back to life thank you Applause Maddox quick release no monetize him with only three rebounds in that first half youre talking about a doubledigit rebounder now starting to flex his muscle on the glass the double team and the whistle comes Music that is number three on Lynn Kidd once again a concerted effort by the Tigers to throw the basketball inside they feel thats where their advantage is against the Hokies especially when youre considering as you mentioned earlier theyre starting back for it both injured with Chase Hunter and Alex Hemingway thats not the advantage for the Clemson Tigers where theyve been able to hold their own throughout the majority of the year in the backcourt but they have an advantage in the front court and Brad Brownell wants to make sure they get an opportunity to touch it every time down the floor it takes a scene for those three personal fouls shuffling with a pair of free throws its a twopoint game Applause Brazilian Here Come the Tigers Applause Galloways fouled by Padula Music first foul on Padula third on the Hokies here in the second half the numbers for PJ Hall 13 points three of eight from the field look at the rest of the team only 166 of 21 so PJ Hall extremely important to the success of the Tigers well when we come back the goodlooking freshman Ian shefflin will be at the free throw line to shoot two second half its been all Clemson so far Music thats the SEC Big 12 challenge oh my God back and forth we go boy that is just perfect theres no question we got some Ballers here this is one of those chances to make a statement it is not for the faint of heart we got a ball game should be a lot of fun with those 10 games next weekend Corey Alexander youre an ACC guy through and through but can you argue against the Big 12 being the conference so far this year I love the Big 12 and I love the SEC but let me tell you the reason why I love the Big 12 most because they play a true round robin Home and Away each team and when you look at the SEC Big 12 teams going at it all the ranked teams between the two conferences in this matchup would I believe we have Kansas Kentucky I think theres a Kansas Kentucky matchup and you have of course two of the Blue Bloods going at it Alabama most likely the best team in this matchup out of both conferences right now Collins into the game Clemson can take the lead tigers have had the advantage of the freethrow line so far tonight 1113 the Hokies have only been there three times theyve made all three but its a continuation really of the loss of Virginia on Wednesday when the Hokies only took two free throws and all coach young said publicly afterward was the stat is incredibly interesting what do you make of the fact that now for the better part of two weeks theyve not gone to the free throw line or two games theyve not gone to the freethrow line well I would say that the majority of their shots are jump shots they do play inside through just a month so we cant say that they are completely on the perimeter but 16 of that 35 field goal attempts have come from Beyond a threepoint arm Applause on rebound Couture after it but its Clemson that comes away with it pokeys only one for nine shooting in the first five minutes of the half listen to shefflin and the sophomore goes down after being fouled that goes against Justin mutts Music Mike young just trying to get Justin much attention and pointing to his head telling him be smarter on that possession Alone Justin much cant get that foul now with three fouls he comes out of the game and again hes so important and so vital to this Virginia Tech hokey team success three fouls with 15 minutes remaining its tough to be able to navigate through and the Hokies have been called for five fouls this half Clemson is yet to be whistled Brooks 13 Music Padula into the lane foul and he immediately calls his team together before heading to the freethrow line Music weve got some womens ACC action coming your way Thursday at 8 Eastern on acc Network number 12 Virginia Tech and 13th ranked Duke Square Off Elizabeth kitley averaging 18 points 11 rebounds two block shots a game for the Hokies Thursday womens basketball 8 Eastern ACC Network I will be tuned in two of my favorite womens college basketball coaches of course my first cousin my blood Kenny Brooks coaching Virginia Tech going in to see Karen Lawson who our colleague and Ive worked on the court a lot with Carol Lawson and of course Angel gray Im sure has a little best to add on that matchup well you know I love womens basketball especially in the ACC anyway but just looking particularly at Virginia Tech to the last unbeaten team in the ACC but also Virginia Tech one of those teams that was very good last year but even better this year had a lot of key players that came back Taylor Soul coming in from Boston College so I think its going to be a great matchup Kenya Brooks doing an incredible job and Corey you and Kenny have a date coming up yeah tomorrow Cowboys on hes got a game tomorrow at one oclock though so Ill be traveling but Cowboys at six at his house I hope hes got snacks thats all Im saying make sure hes got snacks if cas coming you got to have snacks hang out with my nieces of course Kendall Chloe and Gabby Kendall most likely will make the trip from Greensboro my baby girls working for the ACC now shes all grown up on us that happens and hes really used to actually babysit Chloe believe it or not yes come on yes Angel used to babysit my nieces I did it was the most um interesting three hours of my life at that very moment I said you know what I I dont know if I can do this again but now seeing the work in the ACC and then even seeing how theyve been able to grow and just give so much to the womens game as well I think its so incredible to see how they become beautiful young ladies now so angel youre saying it was just one and done you babysat one time and that was it youll have to say that again because I just saw an amazing block on this end that was an amazing block but it ends up being a foul and Lynn Kidd who has been Ultra aggressive here in his homecoming to Little John Coliseum looking to get into double figures and he has been very aggressive part of the main reason why Virginia Tech is winning the points in the pay battle verse Clemson in a game which Clemson has featured their interior it still has been Advantage points in the paint for Virginia Tech Applause I mentioned one of his teammates at IMG comes in Huntley Hatfield Jalen Johnson Musa diabate just The Bigs he was battling with in practice trying to get playing time Music steal by Padula and he drops it off for kid taking those lessons from IMG and putting them into practice here at Clemson Applause youre giving Lynn Kidd a lot of credit for Sean Padulas work Sean Abdullah getting a hand in the passing Lane getting out and then the presence of mind to recognize the shot blocker coming to get his shot but knowing Lynn Kidd was running hard to get an opportunity for the bucket now offensive rebound off of a free throw and Brad Brownell cant be happy with the effort from his team with the simple things cant do it Music but doula Applause good rebound by The Freshman Dylan Hunter Music s middle Brooks Music Applause Music Applause Music thats where you figure the shots gonna come from with this group but Tyson cant make the shot and Clemson stays cold here in the second half but without Chase Hunter on the floor Clemson is limited offensively because theres so much more attention paid to Hunter Tyson into PJ hall because theyre not really guarding the guards on the perimeter not fearful of the making threepointers at all five to shoot kid gave up the dribble brings it back out to Maddox Sandy traveled lost his footing on the step back attempt and turns it over the seventh of the night for the Hokies timeout eight minutes into the second half with the Hokies up four Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause JC thanks so much back here in Clemson where the tigers at the moment are projected by Joey brackets to be a number eight seed ACC well represented and as for Virginia Tech before the six game losing Street Corey they were up as high as a potential six seed and they can still get back to that theres a lot of time left in the season a lot of time left but you have to give Virginia Tech a lot of credit for a great nonconference season and again when you look at what is happening all across the landscape of college basketball conference play in my opinion has to be weighed heavier and I do believe Virginias tax will get back into the mix and get to a you know a positive record in ACC play but giving credit for a lot of nonconference and Ill say this to other conferences not as much to ACC I think is a bit overblown because teams are nowhere near as good in November in December as theyre going to be in March and Virginia Tech is coming into a tough part of the schedule they play Duke up next then Syracuse then at Miami and Mike young made it very clear after the game at Virginia on Wednesday in his four years in ACC basketball this is the best ACC that hes seen from top to bottom there are no easy wins well its one easy win in this league right now but at the same time youre going to have to compete everywhere you go Dylan Hunter off the turnover that ends the scoring drown of over five minutes for Clemson back within two and Dylan Hunter playing very valuable minutes right now Brad Brownell giving Hunter more minutes here in this second half then Josh Beetle who started the game okay s pass kicked by shefflin see Dylan Hunter coming up with a nice fine from PJ Hall and finishing it off a little bit of contact with no foul right there but defensively PJ Hall coming up with the steal just a sloppy pass right there for Virginia Tech leading to offense for Clemson and you dont want to do that because Clemsons struggling to score right now Virginia Tech but they set their defense are very difficult to score against Applause all right all poked away from bazilly and theres another one of those just sloppy mishandling of the basketball that could turn into points Tyson off the shot bait into a double team gives it to Hall big to Big the Tigers respond but were tied at 37 points all turnovers Applause all right under 10 to shoot Couture penetrates dumps it on bazilly blocked by shefflin out of bounds Little John is excited and the reason that theyre excited is because the defense of the Clemson Tigers has stepped up shuffling coming in with the big block shot PJ Hall not getting the foul something that he battled with early in his career was getting inbound trouble and you can see right now little John urging their team one second on the shot clock the Hokies dont know it the crowd does and they aid the Tigers and they stop 10th turnover committed by Tech Applause well Clemson didnt get to 154 on the year seven and one in the ACC for nothing they have punched back and are right back in it with a chance to retake the lead Music rank this week nationally in the AP Poll for the first time in two years at number 19 Chauncey Wiggins has come back in for the lead that ball goes through for Hunter Tyson and Couture is down Applause under Couture took a big shot Music you gotta have your teammates calling out screens and youre not sure its so loud in here that the spring could have been called out but hunter Couture got hit blindly with the screen and weve talked about his value to this team hopefully hes okay Applause Music Roger Ayers the official came over to the Virginia Tech huddle to say it was clean but hunter Couture getting hit but that left elbow getting right in the mix and its been painful for Hunter Couture hes playing through the pain and Roger Ayers letting us know its a basketball play and it was a clean screen from PJ Hall and its not though the screen but we dont know if the screen was called out or not but its so loud here in Little John that he wouldnt have heard it either way continuing just to try to defend Im not sure if it was anything other than that elbow but of course coming back from that elbow injury which he was having to play through the pain to try to help his team win games foreign from behind for the first time since late in the first half and they cough it up Applause the Doula goes for the steal Dylan hunter gets away here comes PJ Hall Chaplin back out front Dylan Hunter drives and finishes Mike young calls time out all right number 19 Clemson backed up by four Music Applause Music Clemsons rattled off the last eight points Corey using its defense for offense all eight points are points off of turnovers PJ Hall coming up with the steal Dylan Hunter attacking the basket then Dylan Hunter getting on the floor and finding a teammate which leads to PJ Hall finding Hunter Tyson getting to the rim dropping me back off the hall for the layup once again Dylan Hunter stepping in coming up with a steal and then the play ends with him attacking the basket just like that the Clemson Tigers have been able to stretch out the lead because of their defense turning four five turnovers on the last few possessions from Virginia Tech into eight points off turnovers and a fourpoint lead and heres angel with more guys we were asking the question of how the Tigers were going to generate offense without Chase Hunter and at halftime I heard Dylan Hunter saying to his teammates we have to figure this out offensively running back with them saying how do we get on the floor how do we even create points in transition to your point Corey making things more difficult on the defensive end getting those easy buckets in transition they won the ways theyve done that they have tracked whenever Virginia Tech has caught the basketball in the post theyre trapping and guys are sinking down into those passing Lanes coming up with those steals but again if youre Chase Hunter right now you want to be on the court so bad but you have to be happy to see your little brother out there making an impact and bringing your team back into this game getting it done defensively and offensively as well the second foul on PJ Hall allows Justin mutts to score a couple of free throws hes now got eight points five assists and its good to see Hunter Couture back on the floor as well after that big hit that put him to the floor and again we think its a residual effect of that arm injury that kept him out a couple of games ago yeah we called it the for the elbow but it could be forearm as well as Couture gets out and defends Hunter Tyson on that but when you watch Hunter Couture running down the floor he is definitely holding that left elbow forearm very gingerly but playing through the pain recognizing how important this game is for his team oh hes trying to snap a sixgame losing streak Clemson trying to hold on to sole possession of first place in the lead and that foul will take us to break Music should have a good finish here at Little John Coliseum Clemson hanging on to a twopoint lead Applause Maddox drilled that threepointer As Time expired in overtime to propel the Hokies to the 7675 win Corey Alexander you were there I was on that call and I can remember Mike young substituting Darius Maddox into the game for Kevin Loma immediately saying oh wait a minute theyre going for the win theyre going for the three here and of course Darius Maddox or Maddox makes the winning bucket Angel you got anything on that well I know that one thing is for sure we were talking about this before the game you know we want to make sure we put some respect on his name on how you say hes that his mother says Madisons father says Mad Dogs but I honestly think the woman is always right in this situation so its Maddox were gonna go with that theres that yeah Im going with Mom so youre gonna go with Stephanie yeah over Sean whos been a Mad Dogs his entire life but yet Stephanie married into the family and becomes a Maddox you guys are going to go with the person who who got this name later in life happy wife all tigers here in the second half the lead back to four that is the fourth personal foul on kid that sends Paul to the line it is a strong finish once again for PJ Hall going up against Lynn Kidd the contact the finish the excitement here and Little John Coliseum we talked about these two guys being teammates three seasons ago and now competitors PJ Hall winning that matchup working on another big game 18 points seven rebounds three steals for the six foot ten inch Junior from Spartanburg and I tell you hes still not 100 I asked him pregame how are you feeling he says Im playing thats all that matters but youre talking about a athletic specimen down five Padula trying to post up Hunter who stood his ground thats one of the areas where when you have Dylan Hunter on the floor its different than Beetle Hunter is a taller point guard Applause Chaplin sets the screen for Wiggins quick release good luck 100 ties who hasnt shot the basketball well at all in this game but still is having a impact on the glass and defensively now the Hokies trying to break a long drought of their own its been going on seven minutes since the last bucket and that continues only one for their last 15 from the floor Corey well and thats the wrap on the calling Clark its defense thats everyone talks about this Clemson team and what theyve done offensively this year as PJ Hall turns it over great hands from Justin mutton these are really two really good defensive teams Mike young of course has a great offensive reputation but defensively is really really makes his name known well Clemsons number one in the ACC in field goal defense this year allowing the three ball from Over the Top MJ Collins stepping up knocking down a big three now weve got a twopoint game and a much needed basket you mentioned Virginia Tech only making one of their last 15 shot opportunities but yet Clemson unable to have any type of separation see if Wiggins can get involved on the offensive end over the back foul again Shetland off the air ball Applause on our big Monday ACC Big 12 college basketball doubleheader on ESPN on the app weve got Duke and these Virginia Tech Hokies at seven Eastern and then well go to Waco chiante George a number 21 Baylor squaring off against Jalen Wilson in number two Kansas as The Jayhawks look to rebound from todays big loss to the Horned Frogs looking forward to the Duke Virginia Tech matchup Ill be on that call with my God Dave OBrien and notorious dob Andrea Carter joining us in Blacksburg and Blacksburg has been a house of horrors for the Duke Blue Devils as of late Applause position for the layout tied 44 a piece and the Hokies got back into this game now it starts all over as you mentioned tied at 44 on the road Mike young has to be happy about where the Hokies sit with 453 remaining Music to me is the point guard of the future for this program getting an extended run with the injury to his older brother shefflin from the corner no you know sheplus turned down a bunch of Threes in this game I was wondering if he had that enema Brad Brownell doesnt look as though that was the shot he wanted from his team coming out of that timeout and shetlands only made three triples so far this year Padula bad pass here comes shefflin and the Tigers and another bad pass theres a reason why big men will tell you well coaches tell you get the ball to the guards and again not that chaplain cant make that play but at this time you want to have someone else being the guy trying to find Hunter Tyson in their corner Corey thats the 16th Clemson turnover Applause Couture bounced it off his own foot its an over and back violation Couture is trying to say it was touched but to me looking at it live he dribbled it off his own foot and we got to mention the Virginia Tech Hokies sixth nationally only 99 turnovers per game and right now in crunch time turning the basketball over 13 turnovers for the Hokies havent helped them here in the hostile environment Applause Music thank you Music shot clock down to six Brevin Galloway gonna be called for the offensive foul another turnover Clemson whos gonna win it 44 with under four on the clock Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause on your phone Applause Chris thank you yes Coco is scheduled to play her match tonight here on ESPN2 at 9 Eastern and then Jessica pagula the toprated American on the womens side scheduled for a 1 am start down under of course her parents own the Buffalo Bills and shes got a split Allegiance here thinking about tennis but also thinking about her bills trying to stay alive in the NFL playoffs I think our parents actually have to split Allegiance because theyre trying to figure out if they can stay up and watch their daughter play and still be on point for tomorrows big game for the bills against the Bengals the man with the basketball is a huge New York Giants fan both his parents are from New York City hes looking forward to tonights game against the Eagles once we get done here tied at 44 with Corey Alexander and Angel gray Im Doug Sherman there is a look at Sean Padula the sophomore from Edmond Oklahoma but like I said his parents are native New Yorkers his dad was a lefthanded pitcher at Fordham University back in the day Applause did you look cut off being defended by Hall he has to bring it back out with six to shoot medulla gonna have to fire it Applause thats an air ball and another turnover number 14 for the Hokies again a team that averages fewer than 10 per game and when you look at these two teams rarely get the credit for how good they are defensively but what weve had is a defensive battle breakout in this game both teams hit him with 44 points with just over three minutes remaining another drop for Clemson over four minutes since its last field goal during that time theyve coughed it up three times and that goes as a blocking foul no shot but I really love the way Dylan Hunter has come in in the second half and been more aggressive and really trying to take this team by control you know Angel gray mentioned the fact that in the Huddle Dylan was the one saying hey guys come on we got to get this together and hes been the guy thats been much more aggressive here in the second half he was number 64 in last years ESPN 100 originally signed with Baylor lets go to Angel guys weve heard the phrase built different well thats exactly what the hunter family is its just in their DNA to be great and were talking about the different hunters even on this roster where well go back to their father the late Bryce Hunter he was in all SEC wide receiver for Georgia and thats a huge shot thats knocked down for Virginia Tech but then also you gotta acknowledge his mother as well Brandi Decker played basketball for Georgia and was a member of two final four teams obviously Dylan we have Chase here as well but its really cool to see even their brother Jaden Hunter at Western Kentucky taking care of business so its just theyre built a little different guys and mom Brandy taking out her competitive nature on the real estate market she is like the Real Estate Mogul in Atlanta while her son is taking up all the real estate in the painted area that purple for the Clemson Tiger Dylan Hunter has owned here as a lead foreign Applause Retreats has it under two minutes in regulation dangerous pass Tyson got a piece of it Brazilian off the great feed underneath by mutts and Justin mutts recognized he was going to have multiple Defenders jumping played it perfectly dropping it off to basily for the easy bucket Applause pokies have made for their last five shots Hunter Tyson pulls no big stop for Virginia Tech Applause months hands it off Couture has a little bit of breathing room tries to pass it and its taken away by Clemson under a minute on the clock youve got to get the basketball in the PJ Halls hands hes got to be the guy that you go to at this time of the game sheplin gets it to Hall he spins along the Baseline tough Applause job timeout Virginia Tech both teams with its tremendous amount to play for in this game Hanukkah tour scrambling after the basketball dropping it off to Justin button finds Grand facility for the easy bucket but on the other end of the floor nothing easy about this pass or the bucket from PJ Hall but it was so necessary for his team to pull within one Music tomorrow well have an ACC womens basketball matinee on ABC and the ESPN app Diamond Johnson leads number 20 NC State against Haley van lip and Louisville coverage begins at one Eastern on ABC and the ESPN app dont let those records at the bottom of the screen fool you Corey I dont think the fact that this is a competitive game down to the wire has fooled anybody it has a bold anybody and when you look at this Virginia Tech Hokies team they are way better than a one in 16 in conference play they had a great nonconference they dealt with injuries but at the same time theyre very well coached and find themselves in a position right now to be able to get a little bit of separation and see if they could get a quality win on the road before it we started the broadcast you were talking about its been a year ago the Hokies were in a similar spot with their conference record it took one good game one win to turn their season around it absolutely did that they did that one offensively but if theyre able to come away with a win here today it will be because of their defense which Im sure Mike young will take much more Pride on and speaking of Defense Brad Brownell one of the best defensive coaches in the ACC and throughout the country and right now leaning on his team to come up with a big time stop here to get the basketball back with a chance to win this game so the Hokies have one timeout remaining the Tigers have two foreign to the block contact and a foul Music number three on shefflin and Grant Missouri recognizing the shot clock going down not going to give the basketball up taking matters into his own hands and the opportunity of the freethrow line 73 on the year calmly drills the first and right now Im sure Brad Brownell has told his team what he wants to do here whether theyre going to push it down the floor and try to get an easy bucket and extend the game or if theyll call their time out here to draw up something misses Clemson can tie it with a two win it with a three Brad Brownell says lets call timeout and talk it over and whatever you do right now if youre the Clemson Tigers you want it going to the basket you want the pressure on Virginia Tech to be able to defend you but more better things can happen for you when you attack the rim you can score so you can get fouled and Im sure whatever Brad Bravo does it will be something designed with the basketball touch and PJ Halls hands and him attacking the rim Chauncey Wiggins is checking in as well a threepoint specialist for Clemson PJ Hall has been the best tiger here in the second half he absolutely has that he was the best tiger in the first half as well 10 points in the first half and hes just continue with his success here in the second half and doing it primarily with strong finishes around the basket as he continues to dominate The Painted area for the Clemson Tigers third straight game for PJ with 20 or more points foreign to take the signs or in as a sign with Chauncey Wiggins coming into the game for Clemson that they might go for the win here looking for three absolutely not they bring in taunting Wiggins to space the floor to try to give more room to PJ Hall you cant help off of Wiggins so that gives PJ Hall more room to be able to attack the basket if Virginia Tech does make the mistake of helping then PJ Hawes but very good playmaker he can find the open God and now you may have Wiggins with an opportunity from three to win the game so Wiggins The Freshman from Grayson Georgia will inbound from the sideline Here Comes Galloway inbound comes to Tyson off the shot wide open three for the lead Hokies and now itll be their turn to try and respond DJ Hall has been the best tiger tonight Hunter Tyson has been the best tiger all year and Brad Brownell having confidence in his fifth year senior to go make a play and he does just that had to shot the basketball well tonight but he made it clear to us earlier today one thing that Hunter Tyson never battles with is confidence and I love the way he went to his guy and Hunter Tyson delivered 12 points eight rebounds now for Tyson believe it or not that was Clemsons first three of the second half well theyve struggled it again Connor Tyson is the guy that David Lawrence looked to to be able to score from Beyond the threepoint Arc he struggled from Beyond three and before that shot he was one for five from Beyond The Arc but didnt shoot it as though hes one for five never thought anything about the other ones stepping up and knocking down the big three ball so they put some time back on the clock to 100 eight where do the Hokies go here Corey well when you want to get the basketball in the hands of Sean Padula hes your playmaker but you want to get downhill once again better things can happen for you two opportunities youve got Justin butts and youve got Grant bazilli bazilly is a better free throw shooter than Justin butts and of course youre always looking for the contact of the possible foul in this spot so you have many options if youre Mike Young and you only need a two to take a lead Padula is one of the best free throw shooters in the ACC as Clemson uses a timeout its final timeout and so the Hokies will get one more opportunity to talk about what theyll do Clemson trying to match it up Music lets show you one more time what happened between these two two teams in Brooklyn last March Darius Maddox with the gamewinning three could we have that sort of finish again here tonight well one thanks for certain Mike young knows that he has a guy that can deliver The Knockout blow when necessary because hes done it before and so when you talk about the different options that Mike young has on the floor to be able to go to here to get him points all five of the players that actually theres Darius Maddox not on the floor MJ Collins getting the minutes here down the stretch but all options are available for the Hokies here on this last possession Here Comes Padula with 10 seconds left in the second half uses the pizzelle screen Couture for the lead no fight for the basketball but Doula tried to put it up on the glass Applause and thats your ball game defensive struggle the Tigers defense at the end gets it done foreign the reaction from Mike Young after that it seems as though he felt there was contact on Sean Padula trying to get after getting the offensive rebound hes 100 Couture comes off gets a good look unable to knock it down but Sean Padula gets in for the rebound and I believe thats a good no call by the officials medulla in amongst the trees and you see the reaction from Mike young he wants contact he wants a foul on that one but at the end of the day from the angle we saw it looked as though medulla was just in amongst the trees and a great job defensively coming up with a stop for the Clemson Tigers a huge bounce back win for the Tigers after losing on Tuesday in Wake Forest their first loss of the ACC regular season it was fun my man great to be back with you and Angel gray of course absolutely Clemson improves to 81 in League Play and stays alone atop the standings in the atlantisco conference final score 5150 Clemson over Virginia Tech thanks so much for watching for Angel gray Corey Alexander Im Doug Sherman and our entire crew up next live coverage of the Australian Open Music
