more in three of his last five games has already established the Stanford freshman record for points in a game when he dropped 32 on Colorado And I think the things to watch who which team can control the pace and the tempo of this game North Carolina we know they want to play up and down We want music they want to get this game into the mid 80s and into the 90s scoring wise And then Stanford wants to slow them down take away their transition make this a half court game as best as possible Here is Caleb Wilson on a step back and the games first points 17 seconds in belong to Caleb Wilson And theres that midrange jump shot that we talked about in the open The pick and roll the short roll he catches it and then the beautiful elevation and knockdown Starting five for Stanford across the bottom of your screen Shot clock at 10 Ryan Agarwal moving in gets underneath the pump fake that he saw Henry Vasar in his rearview mirrors and Carolina racing back the other way to the bucket The layup set Trimble in transition Well Stanfords going to have to do a great job of taking care of the basketball Agarwal tries to make the pass into the paint but no one was home there Oscar Hilte the freshman from Belgium going to work down low and with the left hand gets the roll cheering and Stanfords first points like like that move from the freshman just patience in the post using his pivots and gets to that left hand jump hook Hes taken over as a starting center for the Cardinal Poked away by Benny Geler and then Henry Vasar goes down a foul called and heel to Stanford The first whistled against the Cardinal and thats one thing you got to pay attention to Benny Gers loves to you bring the ball down loves to try to knock it away Leads the Stanford team in steals Well hes a guy whos super active Coach Kyle Smith he praises Benny Giller Just tell him you are an ACC player He hes a guy that comes from Rolling Hills Prep High School in Palace Verde came to Stanford as a walkon and was rewarded a scholarship by Jared Hass And Jared let go Now Kyle Smith in his second year and Benny Gelers game has really taken off and hes become an integral part of what this team does Yeah And they really rely on him being one of the best defenders on the floor He got he got challenged over his time here as a Stanford Cardinal to be a better defender and he has risen to that challenge uh as a player Now the concern for Stanford in the perimeter miles theres size and a team like North Carolina can take advantage of that Heres Henry Fesar down low pass deflected stays with the Tarheelss and seven to shoot Raosi with good post defense right there Besar tries to go to the back down but couldnt move Rahosi off his spot Seven on the timer AJ Roi checking in for Stanford Celebrating a birthday by the way today a grad transfer driving the lob and Wilson has it knocked away at THE RIM cheering DIVING FOR THE BALL IS RAOLI Basar ends up on top of him and theyre calling a foul on Henry Basar Great rotation on the backside Agarwal puts his body on Caleb Wilson to deflect the lob And then you love Steven first to the floor is going to win that battle Excellent job by Roi getting down on the floor and getting the possession for the Stanford Cardinal Stanfords offense struggled against Virginia Scored just 55 points Ibuko Cororey deep on a three and the rebound grabbed by Ken Evans for the Tarheelss But the six shot clock violations at Virginia against the Cavaliers last Saturday Vesar going to work left it short and right Agawal the rebound for Stanford Two good defensive possessions by Roi in the post Vasar not able to back him down I want to see Basar maybe face up Use his quickness to try to go by Roi Benny Geler slides in finds a Cororey Ryan Agarwal launching three cheering Really good possession by the Cardinal The baseline drive and drift action and then the extra pass to the wide open Agarwall Caleb Wilson looked like he had it cheering slip out of his hand as he was going up and Stanford comes away with it Benny Geler open too strong on the three and Henry Vasar the rebound and here come the Tarheelss Ken Evans in transition Trimble the floater and Carolina seesaws in front of secondary break action there for the Tarheelss as Trimbles trail into play good job of probing by Evans and finding the trailer Trimble AJ Rahosi in the lane Up and under by Roi and it falls off trying to keep it alive and the rebound grab Jiren Stevenson for North Carolina Its a battle down there between the Duke big fellas Vesar and he was off balance and good post defense by AJ Roi He Hes got to go away from that He Its 0 for three on the post possessions there Basars going to have to go to something else Ryan Agarwal missing the step back and Caleb Wilson the rebound and Carolina controls it Four minutes in and a onepoint lead Both team both teams a little bit gassed here They they want this TV timeout the pace that Carolinas liking even though the scoring isnt there for both sides Points per game have five guys averaging double figures ACC always going to be a battle on the drive Slicing in and Caleb Wilson with a follow slam You know even though Trimble missed that he drew multiple defenders to himself and that gave and that gave Caleb Wilson the free run to the rim for the follow slam Threepoint Carolina lead Aiden Cameron off the Stanford bench as is Jeremy Dent Smith the grad transfer from Cal State Dominguez Hills was a division 2 allAmerican as the pass broken up by Seth Trimble and its out of bounds It belongs to North Carolina Well theres the drive Multiple defenders collapse to Trimble Hes one of the best at touching the paint And that leaves the free run for Caleb Wilson for the slam for the putback follow Mismatch down low Ball stripped in the lane Recovering as Luca Bogabots Shot clock down to eight and the rebound batted out by Oscar Heelte but the Tarheelss get it Lining up a three and it goes for Ken Evans Just a bad break there for the Cardinal That loose ball They have to come down with those and then Kayen Evans pays it off with the threepoint shot in the corner Seven nothing run for UNC North Carolina in a one through five Switching right now to see if they can expose that matchup into the paint Five to shoot for Stanford Ryan Agarwal drives off balance and a foul called and Ken Evans in disbelief applause And thatll put Stanford at the free throw line Coming up next our triple header continues over at Hos Pavilion in Berkeley is number six Duke with their wooden award front runner Cameron Boozer The Blue Devils invading Berkeley taking on Mark Matsons Cal Bears Also available on the ESPN app West Durham and Dennis Scott over in Berkeley for that one Speaking of great freshman Henry Im not talking about Dana Ames whos not a freshman laughter No Boozer is an absolute stud man That that young man can do it all handle the ball post up Excellent passer and I really think underrated in that category Like people talk about his his points but man when he plays in the post or handles the ball on the perimeter man he really gets the gets his other teammates involved and able to find them Henry Vasar on the block and the jump hook using the glass and Vasars first points So the difference there is now he goes against Heilte Okay Raosi stood him up in the post He a little bit less resistance Vasar felt comfortable right there and gets to the soft jump hook off the glass Stanfords got to get a shot for Aorei Carolinas done a good job against the freshman so far Well you see they committed to him in the gap there It was good help and recover by Trimble Hes open on the weak side They find him Ibuka Okorei Three First points for Ibuka Okori who averages over 22 a game Defense defense defense defense defense defense Step back on the baseline Look at Bogavots the junior from Montenegro Yeah and thats big for his confidence Bogots has come in He hasnt shot the ball as well as they expected Only 31 from three on the season but right there thats a thats a confidence building confidence builder for him And then heres the post up by Vasar right the back down the pivot puts his shoulder down low into heel tay and then Aorei with the answer the ball gets swing Carolinas in rotation Vasars too late and Aorei makes him pay Last shot was rolled at two by Okori by the way as foot was on the line so its 158 North Carolina Jeremy Den Smith from way out there rattles Thats a no doubter three He is not shy This young man was a twotime allAmerican at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Southern California Played for a division 2 national championship last year Henry Vasar counters at the other end with three Hes so good One of the best big men in all of college basketball Shooting over 50 on the season from behind the arc Pick and pop Youve seen him play in the post inside and out threat Oscar Hilte underneath and challenged by Fesar who blocks the shot and Carolina comes away with it Cameron Grant off the bench for Kyle Smith and Stanford cheering Here is Wilson Terrific move on the baseline by Caleb Wilson The footwork was beautiful right there He gets cut off on the first move and then he spins back baseline Something coach Hubert Davis talked about with us at shootaround today is that he keeps getting fundamentally better Obviously he can do some spectacular things with the ball and his body and he plays above the rim but now its like the fundamental part of the game is really uh turning on for Caleb Wilson And you saw that right there with the footwork in the post Tarheelss have made their last five shots to the floor Miscommunication Jeremy Den Smith oneonone with DEREK DIXON DRIVES IN AND POWERS IT off the window and in Good finish Den Smith more of like a microwave score 19 points per game at the D2 level Good confidence for him because he had been struggling from three the last six games He made one now he attacks He was two for 18 in the last six from behind the arc Henry Besar in the lane and a foul will get him to the line and the foul on Oscar he of Stanford but Carolina is rolling offensively Well caring youre going to look at a guy and I and I know he doesnt shoot a lot of threes quite yet in his career Hes only four for 16 on the season 25 But watching his shooting motion and stroke during warmups thats something thats going to vastly improve I think at a rapid rate once he gets to the NBA Basar splits the pair Henry Basar one for two at the line And its Carolina by eight and Stanford has had some prolonged droughts this season as Ibuka Okori starting to find his game offensively and hes got four Man hes smooth Okay I love the overthetop pass against the pressure and then the fact that a Cororey is not scared He just goes down shoots a little the little floater over the big Its good offense Henry Vasar rattles it in from the lane and Carolinas getting in the paint and they are attacking way too easy 12 points in the paint already for the Tarheelss Basar with eight and the Carolina lead is eight AJ Rahosi down low and he cant get that to go And here come the Tarheelss Tough floater across the key A wild shot by Luca Boabots And Stanford brings it up and Ibuko Cory one on three drives Throws it up and nearly went in And Carolina racing back the other way with Derek Dixon And a block is called as Donovan Young was inside the restricted area and two free throws for Jared Stevenson and the Tar Hills ACC Networks Thursday womens double header Number nine Louisville takes on Hannah Hidalgo and number 23 Notre Dame 6 Eastern and then Duke and Virginia from Cameron Indoor Both games are available on the ESPN app Kyle Smith questioning the call as the block was called on Stamford and our crew tonight with Bill Cington Jr working with Jamal Spearman and Greg Nixon So the foul was called on Ibuka Okorei his first and then a technical was assessed to the Cardinal as well after the foul call Jiren Stevenson will shoot two and the first one rolls in A 78 foul shooter One more for the junior from Chapel Hill The transfer from Alabama Stevenson rattles into second as well And this is the play that Stanford was upset about as a block was called on Donovan Young Thats a block I mean I dont know So upset Obviously you want the calls to go your way but thats thats a block Hes still moving Whether he was out of the restricted or not that was a blocking foul They reported the wrong number Thats why they went to the monitor to make sure they had the correct foul call So the blocking foul on Donovan Young and then the technical was also assessed to Stanford and to Donovan Young So he picked up two fouls on that one play And when youre already shorthanded okay without Apara the size some size that you had on the inside that really hurts this Stanford team Stevenson who shot the tentacles first and now the common foul free throws as Carolina has opened up a doubledigit lead here midway through half number one Stevensons a guy that coach Huber Davis is super high on Coach Davis told me hes like I I think hes going to be an NBA player cuz he can defend play multiple positions He said hes the nicest kid that hes almost ever coached and he said he just wants him to be a jerk for two to two and a half hours a day Thats it Thats all he wants from him Then he can go back to being the nicest guy in the world Foul off the ball in North Carolina and its a hold on Jonathan Powell First on Powell and team fell number three on the Tarheelss So right now if youre Stanford okay youre down 12 points about midway through the first half ARs got to be the guy Get him involved Hes got to touch the ball each and every time down Probably going to have to force the action a little bit Up and under Leans in and he gets the soft touch to drop and Ibuko Cororey goes to work And thats exactly why because hes a guy that can create his own use the pick and roll Okay Get to the rim and create for his teammates Continually put the ball in his hands Hes got the ability to take over a game Is Henry Vasar a tough step back from the sevenfooter Stanford went to zone right there but they didnt keep the ball out of the paint They found the Tarheelss found the soft spot in the zone with the big fella Vasar Stanford trying anything right now to try to slow down the Tarheelss Abuko Okori three Thats what Im saying Roxy Keep finding him Keep feeding him They run the set call to bring a Cororey out of the corner right there cheering down the lane the drive and a pretty finish by Jonathan Powell That was a great job by Powell turning the corner getting to the paint but underrated thing Henry Vasar just sealing off his guy to free it up at the rim Cameron Grant spots up in the corner The three pops out The rebound run down Seth Trimble Had it knocked away by Benny Geler And AJ Rahosi comes down with it for the Cardinal Ryan Agarwal too strong on the three and Henry Vasar pulls down the rebound and Carolina quickly pushes it back but IO Cory steals it Stanford in transition Agarwal to the basket The reverse by Ryan Agarwal defense to offense for this Cardinal team created by Ibuka Aorei playing the passing lane and then finding Agarwal with the beautiful reverse finish Step back Tough shot Jonathan Powell and AJ Roi watched it trickle out of bounds It belongs to Stanford cheering Well against this zone if you can have a sevenfooter in there looks Lets look for him And then the beautiful soft touch by Vasar Scores in the game Six points five rebounds for Caleb Wilson Ibuka Okorei leading Stanford with nine And the freshman brings it up for the Cardinal Okorei gets inside the scoop How about that move by Ibuka Okori Thats pro Okay thats some NBA stuff Thats thats holding his guy off on the pick and roll so he cant get back in front And then the inside hand finish versus the sevenfooter Now the zone for Kyle Smith Ken Evans gets in the lane cheering Jaden Young way out top Deep three from Evans and a foul going for the rebound Its a push on Cameron Grant of Stanford Well Ibuka Accord running that mid pick and roll But look at the physicality Like usually you think of physicality on defense but look at the physicality he played with on offense right there against Seth Trimble One of the better defenders in the country And then he finds a way to score being crafty around the rim Shot clock at 10 Seth Trimble feeds Basar and threw it into the stands Nobody home in the corner Carolina turnover We have Miami covered before in the game Well have the field pass presentation with the crew on the sidelines providing commentary and reactions And after the game well have a complete breakdown with coach and player interviews Miami Indiana on Monday Who you got Going with the U Im taking Miami Youre taking Miami Arent they banged up a little bit Theyre on the ACC network Got to play homers cheering And Kyle Smith again not happy with the call and a foul on Stanford Looks like a lot of ball Good hands by Agarwal First foul called on Agarwal and thats the seventh putting North Carolina into the bonus Shooting foul two for Henry Basar applause Basar one for two at the line You know what a what a great impact that Basar has had for this North Carolina team this year Hes been a leader Hes a great competitor Coach Davis described him as like hes a quiet young man but in the games hes a great talker which is really what you want Like in games and in the huddles not only like motivating his teammates but describing and see and letting guys know whats happening on the floor and what they can like go after and exploit and what they have to do better Jaden Young with the offensive rebound off the missed free throw and Carolina up eight with the ball again Vasar has it knocked away by Grant but a foul called on Stanford This will be a one and one for Vasar And its the second on Cameron Grant Well you see the high low action right there Grant gets caught behind on Basar Basar does a great job of of sealing to try to get that high low pass But back to Vasar He hes really almost the most indispensable play We know that Caleb Wilson is really really good But Vasar because of his size his shooting ability his shot blocking ability is almost the most indispensable player for this team They dont really have a like a great backup five at this point So when hes not on the floor Carolina struggles at times uh in the Michigan State game when he wasnt in the game they really got hurt against the Spartans Besar hits both He has 13 and the Tarheelss have pushed it back to double digits with just over 6 minutes left in the half Yeah And I I thought Basar was big time for Arizona last year Like really really good He stepped up when they needed him to in the injury to Motas Creas Absolutely I across the key and one the dynamic IO Okorei now with 13 The burst Okay off the crossover Quick first step the change of direction Look how low he plays to the ground And now thats the second time against a bigger ath more athletic defender He goes with that inside hand layup That is some tough finishing That that thats like elite stuff that that gets you to the NBA Okay we know he can shoot the ball He can handle it But touching the paint and being able to finish at the rim over bigger guys elite skill set by Ibuka Aorei Stanford settling into the zone Ken Evans inside and Stevenson gets bumped and Jiren Stevenson will go to the foul line for North Carolina Fouls on Aiden Cam2 First on Cam and now Stevenson shooting two the former North Carolina Gatorade player of the year with the Tarheel blood with his mom being a really good player for the Tarheelss in the mid to late 90s One more for Stevenson And cheering his dad was his high school coach in North Carolina And his dad was a pretty good player in his own right Played at Richmond then overseas Missed both free throws in the rebound Ryan Agarwal for Stanford Lets see if they keep using a Cororey and pick and roll Penny Keeler drives baseline Ryan Agarwal THREE Nine for Agarwal Pass deflected by Agarwal Out of bounds Subtle thing but a big thing for Aorei He gets double teamed in the pick and roll for the first time tonight He zips that pass to the corner Now Carolinas in a scramble situation And they find one of their best shooters on the floor in Agarwal to knock down the threepoint shot Six straight for Stanford and the second three for Agarwal tonight Wilson isolated cheering drives and he scoots to the basket It spins out for Caleb Wilson cheering Okorei penetrates and hell get to the line as hes clobbered and ends up out of bounds Stanford was down 12 They have a chance to cut it to two and its been Iuko Aorei leading the way This is a young man that comes from the New Hampshire area went to Brewster Academy I had the chance to talk to his high school coach Jason Smith one of the best high school coaches in the country yesterday So this Ibuka Cororey originally committed to Harvard Okay He went home for fall break and told his parents I dont want to go to Harvard Thats not my dream school I feel I can play at a higher level So he had really committed to them because of his parents and and wanting to appease them And Stanford was the first school So sorry go let me go back Jason Smith calls Georgetown Vanderbilt Michigan cuz hes a high academic young man Stanford was the first school to come in and watch him They came three weeks in a row That kind of set the president and the president and then building the relationship with this young man to able to get him in a Cardinal uniform and but he had to sacrifice academics by going to Stanford right I think its working out well for him I think he found his place Yeah I think hes going to make some money on the drive Seth Trimble out of the double team Knocked away and Stanford comes away with it A Cororey trailing on the weak side AJ Roi in the key The drop off to Came back to Rahosi and a foul will get him to the line And the interior passing by Stanford will get them two free throws Really good big to big passing right there You shoot it No you shoot it laughter Thats what it looked because Henry Vasar was right in their face First foul of Luca Bogavots and AJ Roys birthday today And hes a great story as he went to Washington State when Kyle Smith was there You can see free throws are not his strength as hes only a 33 foul shooter but walked on at Washington State was there for a couple of years transferred to Division 3 Claremont Mud Scripps was an academic allAmerican in addition to being an allAmerican at that level And now for his last season hes from the Bay Area from the North Bay playing for Kyle Smith again although he missed both free throws and no offers out of high school and now hes averaging eight points a game in the ACC What a great story Like you said only played in 11 games in his two years in Washington State And now challenging at the rim as Bogabots couldnt convert over the 69 Rahosi Now lets see how Stanford plays and reacts with no AORI on the floor BENNY GAYER AND WERE TIED AT 34 FIRST POINTS for the senior 10 straight for the Cardinal Vasar three right back at it for Carolina How good has this guy been in the first half Vasar in the trail spot And thats thats what you love the versatility of Vasar and Wilson being able to play around the rim and then Vasar at 7 feet playing on the perimeter and stretching the zone Carolina three of five from downtown Aiden Camman attacks an offbalance tough shot Draws the foul The second on Vasar with 313 left in the half Stanford was down 12 Theyve come back Tarheelss up three Initiated the play But thats just like its its an advanced play for a freshman to be double teamed Okay And knowing he hes he was a little bit hot at the time Thats why they sent the double team But knowing just when to get off the ball and when to attack thats all thats all a feel Aiden Cameron goes one for two at the line Tarheelss up two Basar sitting with the two fouls So well see how Hubert Davis maneuvers these final three minutes and Henry Basar right now on the bench Also Stanford doing a better job the last of not fouling not sending Carolina to the line Open in the corner and the stroke and a three for Luca Bogots And thats what theyve been looking for from Bogavots all season long Heres a guy only shooting 31 coming into tonights game Hes shot the most threes on the team Has not shot it has not shot it extremely well But if he brings that to the table nightly really helps this Tarhill team Ryan Agarwal missing a three and the rebound grab by Seth Trimble for the Tarheelss Wilson recovers 10 on the shot clock and a foul on the drive Jeremy Dent Smith with the push and thatll put Luca Boavat at the line for North Carolina 10th team foul The double bonus now for UNCC 73 for Bogavatz at the line Last couple of years played in the Adriatic Basketball League Native of Montenegro His dad was a player and coaches over there And one more for Bogavots whos had a nice game so far off the bench Yeah one thing theyve discovered about Bovots is that hes a better ball handler that than they anticipated The shooting hasnt come around but he can still he can still find that Hes always going to be a threat Okay teams on the scouting report theyre not going to leave him open because he is dangerous from behind the ark He does have great size but if he can consistently find that shot and knock it down from behind the ark that really opens things up even for guys like Caleb Wilson and Vasar After going scoreless in two of the last three games hes got seven now in the first half And after Stanford tied the game Carolina has pushed the lead out to seven Now lets see what adjustments Carolinas going to continue to make on Aorei as they run him off the little baseline screens here Agarwal missed him Cameron Grant launching three Sixth first half three for the Cardinal But you cant lose Cameron Grant He does one He does one thing He only shoots threes Eight of his nine makes And 34 of his 35 shots are from behind the arc Cameron Grant has to put the ball on the floor on any catch Good box out by Aiden Cameron and Stanford controls 90 seconds left in the half and wave it off on the drive and a foul committed by North Carolina Well Cory just dragging it out there Okay And then he finds the guy and delivers that ball on time on target Late close out by the Tarheelss and Grant knocks down the three Stanford in the bonus Itll be a one and one for Ibuka Okorei Second foul on Ken Evans Roxy going back to Aorei and his Brewster Academy days He that that backcourt okay Aorei and Killian Tore okay of Iowa State Now thats like Aorei is the the offensive monster and Killian Torey was the defensive giant So the the first day that Killian Tory comes over to Brewster Academy he picks up Ibuka Aorei full court and he rips him This is what Jason Smith is telling me He rips him goes down and dunks it Iuka Cory looks over at Coach Smith and was like Nobodys ever done that to me before And then he said like they had one of the best back courts in high school basketball uh last year but two guys who are super close with each other We can see why with their progress at both Stanford and Iowa State 10 to shoot for North Carolina Pogots cheering Jiren Stevenson from deep and a three Just a 21 threepoint shooter And his first field goal of the game And its a fivepoint Tarheel lead North Carolina five of seven from downtown And now a Tarheel foul will send Stanford back to the line Well Stevenson on the little pick and pop action Gets his feet set Gets it over the high hands of Cam Stevenson no panic with as the clock was running down And now Stevenson called for his second foul Its Aiden Cammon The one and one 69 the sophomore from Andover Massachusetts Hes come off the bench now the last 10 games after starting eight in a row for Stanford And one more for Cam for North Carolina Number one Zayen High Zayen High is first appearance tonight The sophomore from San Antonio bringing the 610 big man in off the bench And with Vasar two fouls Think Hubert Davis wants to keep him protected until halftime Yeah for the last minute of this half hes wants to just get by and and go into the locker room hopefully with a lead here Caleb Wilson floats in the key and the rebound batted around and IO Cory runs it down Transition Ryan Agarwal attacks and a finger roll off the window by Agarwal Love Agarwal sprinting the lane right there and then getting rewarded for the hard run by a Cororey Hes got 11 and Agarwal averages six a game and a foul will send Seth Trimble to the line for North Carolina Well they get the stop and then Agarwal Agaral running that left lane really hard and he gets the finish at the rim Stanford giving North Carolina a little bit of dose of their own medicine playing in transition there Second foul on Aiden Cam and two shots with the double bonus set Trimble 69 foul shooter cheering And one more for Trimble 23 seconds left in the half and Trimble who missed nine games of that broken left forearm Hes been so consistent when on the floor for Hubert Davis this season Stanford looks like theyll play for the final shot of the half North Carolina leading by as many as 12 Lets see if they guard him straight up or send an extra body at him Okorei attacks step through the DROP OFF AND THE FINISH AIDEN Cam and that will take us to halftime and its a twopoint game and Stanford closing the first half strong Stanford 10 assists just two turnovers in the first half I think the big thing if I was Kyle Smith that I love 10 assists on 16 baskets Thats elite numbers right there And and now lets watch as we come out of the half What adjustments does North Carolina make on Ibuka Aorei defensively Ryan Agarwal had a strong first half and that pass intercepted Seth Trimble goes up the ladder but Benny Geler takes it right back Agarwal launching too strong on the three and Henry Vasar pulls it down for the Tarheelss Long outlet ahead Caleb Wilson behind the defense and hes fouled second on Ryan Agarwal is leaking out Wilson and the turnovers to start the half Actually really big play there by Agarwal because they they had lost Caleb Wilson obviously behind the defense but to not give up the dunk was something that can spark Caleb Wilson could spark this Tarheels Send this guy send him to the line where he where hes where hes only a 69 foul shooter One more for Wilson Hes got seven points in this one as hes been in double figures in every game so far this year for North Carolina In fact double doubles and four the last five for Caleb Wilson I mean hes having a special freshman year in North Carolina history Hes on pace to set the UNCC freshman record in scoring And Roxy just think of how many great freshman have played for the University of North Carolina the Hanssboro Vince Carter Joseph Forte Antoine Jameson McCants Barnes Marvin Williams and hes going to set the scoring record out of all those guys I know Jordan but Dean Smith was the guy that could hold back Jordan right Well Michael Jordan with North Carolina played in this building back in 1983 Dr Tom Davis was the Stanford head coach at the time and a three is way off from Donovan Young in North Carolina rebound Michael Jordan fouled out of that game in just seven minutes and had only four points and never fouled out since laughter Go to the bucket and Caleb Wilson goes to work inside Theres that post footwork right there Some good lower body strength Catches deep on the block Young not really wanting to foul because he has two Here is Okorei and hes hounded and forcing the turnover is Seth Trimble Really good job by Trimble there of denying Okorei the basketball And there you see the post up Okay the patience there Feels the body Young gives him some space Almost pulls the chair on him but good balance by Wilson An excellent finish And its sequences like that one where you can see Stanford really misses Chisok Park Yeah they really do cheering Ken Evans turns the corner The lob THE FINISH BY WILSON AND ONE WELL Ken Evans has an easy job when you can just throw it up to 610 and put it up a foot above the rim and hes going to go get it Geler did his best job to try to peel back but Caleb Wilson is just on another level right there of elevation Not many people are on his level No sir No sir And one free throw for the McDonalds AllAmerican last years Georgia Gatorade player of the year And Wilson already in this second half with a strong start has six since halftime and the Tar Hills have pushed the lead to eight Pass deflected trying to force it to Buo Cororey Carolina running with Wilson and he gets the shot to go off the window Timeout Stanford and all of a sudden you look up and Carolina comes racing out of the gates to open up the second half with an eight nothing actions and after the game a complete breakdown of the national championship game Coach and player interviews national championship coming up Monday Caleb Wilson taking this game over in the second half but Cory finally gets Stanford their first point since halftime You know really good coaching by Kyle Smith to run a little bit of false action and get Ibuka Aorei moving through the paint and then coming out the weak side on the DHO Just really good stuff When you know you need a bucket or a good shot put the ball in your best players hands simplify the game as best as possible And thats what Stanford did there Foul on AJ Roi and that will put Henry Vasar at the line for North Carolina Well Cory now with 20 points already his 10th 20point game of the season and he missed two games And it spins out as Vasar is now four for seven at the line One more for Vasar What a huge boost he has given North Carolina transferring from Arizona and he goes one for two He leads the Tarheelss with 17 Right now North Carolina just face guarding Okore Yeah they just top locked him They didnt want him coming up to get the DHO A Cororey works his way up the floor still Here he is Drives takes the body grabbed his own miss and a foul No its an offensive foul on a Cororey for a clear out And Basar is down cheering Practicing in Chapel Hill Practiced here yesterday Are playing the Cardinal tonight And then well head across the bay before they play Cal on Saturday at Hos Pavilion as Seth Trimble spots up and nails a three Really good zone offensive execution by the Tarheelss Trimble takes it back Trimble attacks Trimble drives Little out of control and Agarwal comes away with it for Stanford Outlets for Ibuka Okori Trail three Ryan Agarwal Season high 14 for the junior from Texas Agarwal and Aorei have a connection out there on the floor Theres been multiple times tonight in transition and Basar gets the roll and just trailing plays that A Cororey just has like his antennas up to find Agarwal Geler has to look at the rim I mean he he comes off right there Hes wide open at the top Loose ball and the Tarheelss steal it Thats what hes out there to do is help space the floor and shoot I mean he was wide open and his his eyes are facing you and I over here on the side of the floor and nobody was nobody was guarding him That was a ridiculous play by Caleb Wilson on the fadeaway as the Tarheelss have matched their largest lead and at 610 Its hard to contest that 10 already in the second half for Wilson and a foul on the drive committed by Trimble Well next year Stanford has a Keem Elijah son coming in That was a Keem Elijahesque by Wilson Yeah the little across the country to the Bay Area the Tarheelss over in Berkeley to take on Mark Madsons Cal Bears And then we close it out right here at Maples Pavilion with Duke taking on Stanford Second half the Tarheelss are six of seven from the floor Stanfords turn it over five times leading to 10 points AJ Rahosi gets the roll inside and the first points for the birthday boy Great job of finding the mismatch in that and then Rahosi making him pay Trimble from the corner missing the three but the offensive rebound Caleb Wilson Here is Trimble curling off a screen Trimble and going down is Camman who was off balance and a hard fall for set Trimble Man he turned that corner hard and thats a hard blow right there He comes across both arms He was not going to get that ball up to the rim as he got upended a bit trying to get around Henry Basar and thats what caused Camman to be off balance and a hard foul delivered to Seth Trimble I feel like Trimble is a little bit of like the X factor for this North Carolina team We know hes been out with some injuries but hes capable of having some big games Hes hes their best downhill driver Okay he can get to the rim Hes a big physical guard Hes as coach Hubert Davis describes can be the best defender in the country And hes a proprietor cheering Yeah owning Ben and Jerrys in Chapel Hill Thats one thing I love about the NIL guys taking advantage and learning how to use their money wisely build a business Buco Cory steps through a double team gets to the bucket That was next level Well there you see the adjustment They tried to put two on the ball with Vasar He jumps out but Ibuko Cororey so smooth with his handle Able to split the big fella and get all the way to the rim Deep three in and out for Derek Dixon Offensive rebound Henry Fesar drops it in 21 for Basar If Stanford can make somebody else besides Wilson and Basar score theyre going to have a chance to win this game Auko Cory scores again 24 for the freshman in the end I mean thats beautiful off He drags the pick and roll all the way to the other side of the floor the double team and turns the corner and finishes over one of the best shot blockers there is in Caleb Wilson Extra step Caleb Wilson traveled Well heres the pick and roll Heres the split the between the legs Goes to the rim with a beautiful finish Then the last one look at this He drags it from one side of the floor to the other turns the corner and finishes over Caleb Wilson again Two possessions in a row Iuko Cororey trying to will this Stanford team back into this game just keeping them alive The quickness and the burst that he has and the h and the handle and then the finishing ability the whole package And now hes pushed by Jaden Young as Ibuka Okori tried to turn the corner And and it really hasnt mattered what defender they put him They put about four different guys on them tonight Okay And it and it hasnt mattered You I think you still have to keep like two on the ball but you got to do a better job of containing it Desar you cant get split You have to almost corral the basketball a little bit more Make him play you know keep him on the perimeter Hes doing so so good at turning the corner The only team thats figured him out was Micah Shrewberry and Notre Dame in that game The only singledigit performance of the year for Okori and Stanford was held to 40 points Here he is on a step back three cheering Roxy thats ridiculous He is putting on a show Henry Fesar offensive foul The third on Vasar Its the Ibuka Cororey show here in Maples Pavilion He rocks him to sleep and because hes driven to the basket just had two straight finishes Young gets on his heels Now he gets the separation and knocks down the three We are watching a special talent Not one of the best freshman not one of the best freshman I repeat one of the best players in the country right here Ibuka Aorei Were in the middle of January right Conference play is just getting going Hes already scored the seventh most points by a Stanford freshman in a season Oky goes to work Cameron Grant in and out on the three and the rebound Jiren Stevenson for North Carolina Great look Love that Accorey didnt force it and found the shooter on the perimeter Jiren Stevenson drives and Stevenson is knocked down Nope Foul call but its out of bounds to the Tarheelss How fun is this This is highlevel awesome basketball This is really really good ACC basketball at its best Even though its weird to say Stanford in ACC Im not going to lie Is there a point when you will get used to it No sir Cuz I I I played in Maples Pavilion when it was saying Pack 10 and Pack 12 on the floor I coached here But the one thing I will say from the days that you played in here the energy and the excitement is in this building like when you were playing here back in the day Yeah it really is Student section is lively and active and Bogavots hes active behind the arc right there knocking down the three Sevenpoint lead for North Carolina I love what Kyle Smith is doing Just keep it in your your best players hands And North Carolina running two guys at him Jeremy Den Smith AJ Raosi and he is grabbed and fouled hard and goes down 3 seconds to play Of the final 42 points that Stanford had in that game against the Hokes Ibuka Okori either scored or assisted on 40 of the 42 Is that good Well it would have been better if he was on every single one of the 42 Well the young man has like a will about him when you watch him play okay And a want to about like winning and competing And when you have that along with the skill set that he has great things are going to happen to special players for special players like him Caleb Wilson finds Bogavots Missed the three and the rebound Batted around and Cameron Grant grabs it Here come the Cardinal McCory finds Jeremy Dent SMITH IN TRANSITION THREE cheering Second three for Den Smith And Stanford has cut the Carolina lead in half Den Smith has been a great contributor off the bench tonight Two for two from behind the arc Wilson cheering will get to the line Well Stanford gets the stop on Winn and then you see the vision Okay the way he sold it He had his eyes straight up the floor into the paint but all along he knew he had Dent Smith on that right side Great job of running the break by Aquari Caleb Wilson shooting two Third foul on Oscar Heel Theres Wilson now two for four at the line And remember I came to a Stanford practice in October And Kyle Smith said publicly the day before I showed up and went to Stanfords practice that Ibuko Cory is going to be our starting point guard this year And I talked to Kyle before practice the next day And I asked him look youve got Jeremy Denith the Division 2 AllAmerican transferring in Benny Geler cheering has started some games for Stanford over the years but youre going with the freshman And Kyle looked at me kind of smirked and said Youll see why Youll see why hes in the game next year Its Caleb Wilson with the bucket for the Tar Heels But those are big possessions right there You have to have free throw blockout if youre Stanford You want to win this basketball game You get Caleb Wilson misses both free throws and you dont come up with the basketball And now he forces a turnover Look at Bogabat Here is Wilson down low and moves along the baseline Caleb Wilson the flush Thats ridiculous And you know what That was set up by Roxy You remember a couple minutes ago when you told me about that turnaround jumper on the baseline That set it up right there You think that thats coming The left block is where you can get to your right shoulder but you maybe got to front him or three quarter him You got to make his catches a little bit tougher Try to make him play play at like the 20 foot mark not the 10ft mark AJ Roi inside and it falls for AJ Roi Its not always graceful with him but its effective And right to the bucket Luca Bogots in double figures now with 11 Off a made basket You cant let Carolina score within the first six or seven seconds there Got to get your defense set Little too easy on that end Way behind the line THREE RATTLES IN FOR JEREMY Dent Smith We mentioned it in the first half Microwave score and Dent Smith providing great minutes and offensive punch off the bench to complement what Aorei is doing AJ Roi underneath the scoop and the rebound grabbed by Luca Bogavots who pushes four on three for Carolina Bogots the step through and draws the foul 25 second on Jeremy Dent Smith and Luca Bogavatz will shoot two and hed been fighting it recently Bogabots have got off to a good start this year with North Carolina but recently in double figures in just one of the last six games coming into tonight Hes got 12 in this one He was in double digits in nine of the first 10 games for the Tar Hills this year Yeah hes a guy that they want to rely on to be a floor spreader especially when you have the two big fellas that in Vasar and Caleb Wilson that can play in the paint Vasar can spread it obviously behind the arc but they want this guy to shoot shots make threes and be a be a big contributor like he is tonight He is that third scorer for Hubert Davis tonight Vasar with 21 Wilson with 20 and Bogotss now 13 Watch a Cory coming out of the left side here Gets into the key Jeremy Den Smith FIRES THREE ANOTHER three for Jeremy Den Smith Hes four for four from downtown What a fun game on the farm at Stanford tonight Caleb Wilson How about that move How fun was that Caleb Wilson in the high post oneonone just making the sweet crossover and then the extended arm finish Okorei the floater and Ibuka Okori with 29 Touches the paint at will Doesnt matter how many bodies are in front of him Thats an elite skill for a point guard Seth Trimble penetrates the lob for Vasar down low Vesar powers his way up and in Really good gather Vesar is stronger than his body looks Like hes kind of thin thin body but man the gather right there and then to play through that contact Good job by the big fella Jeremy Den SMITH OPEN THREE THEY LEFT HIM OPEN IN THE CORNER cheering Season high 17 for Den Smith Bugabots back the other way Den Smith the rebound picked up by Agarwal for the Cardinal Ibuka Okorei and its tipped out Thatll be basket interference as Cameron Grant tried to back tap as the ball came back down on the rim Carol Yeah unreal talent on display Both of these guys doing what they do best A Cororey doing anything he wants out there on the floor and Caleb Wilson having a monster second half for this Tarheel team A Cororey getting a breather right now for Stanford The lob over the top to Henry Vasar Great atto by Hubert Davis knowing that Stanford is going to front the post there or three quarter Flashes Wilson out to the wing and then he delivers the pass perfectly over the top So right now if youre Stanford where do you go offensively Do you find Jeremy Dent Smith This guys been hot Here he is relocates missing the three AJ Rahulsi rips down the offensive rebound Tried the reverse layup Last touch by Stanford and Kyle Smith may want to challenge this Hes consulting with his bench The ruling on the floor was North Carolina ball Well Jeremy Den Smith five for five from behind the arc They sprint to try to get him off the line Good relocate a reload three by Den Smith Just couldnt get it to fall do that So they tried to give a Cororey like a little bit of an extended break He got the timeout break then hes out for the first two possessions and now they put him back in to try to close this game out and try to win it for for the Cardinal here in the last 6 minutes 10 to shoot Heres Vasar set Trimble in the corner Tough fall away three Short and the rebound and Stanford runs it down Its a Puka Okorei in rhythm Three spins out for Okori and pulled down by the Tarheelss Watch Caleb Wilson on the early post up They get it to him again They just let him catch too easy Wilson for Aiden C And thats whats going to happen Theres no three quarter Theres no front Ball pressure was limited Hes been killing on the left block all night You have to get him off of his spot Hes tied a careerhigh 24 Ibuko Cororey gets to the bucket and hes fouled at the rim and two free throws for Ibuka Okori Here he is on the left side here Okay nobodys digging nobodys helping Okay you got to make somebody else score besides Caleb Wilson here in the second half Theyre leaving him oneonone Thats not a good matchup for the Cardinal Eight for eight from the floor in the second half and 18 of his careerhigh tying 24 since halftime Either you got to make the catches a lot tougher or if youre going to allow him to catch on his spot on that left block hes got to see multiple bodies Okay Hes got to see more bodies in front of either send us send the double team make him a passer spray that basketball out make Trimble um or Evans try to beat you on the perimeter Okay Something has to be adjusted there for North Carol uh for Stanford Free throw crawls in for Okore in his fourth 30point game And its a fourpoint lead for North Carolina And a steal Okorei races to the bucket Okari the land Careerhigh 33 for Ibuka Okorei cheering Back to a twopoint game cheering Caleb Wilson Lost his balance Two to shoot The floater set Trimble quiets the crowd Good defense by the Cardinal Just an unlucky break and Trimble is the beneficiary of picking up that loose ball and scoring 10 on the timer for the Cardinal Okorei off balance throws it up and letting it go out of bounds Wise play by Jiren Stevenson Tarheel ball 348 to go Carolina up four cheering Carolina with the ball up four And for the Tar Hills tonight second straight game that Henry Vasar and Caleb Wilson have 20 or more And its the fourth time this season theyve done it in the same game Ken Evans left open in and out on the three And Vasar has the rebound ripped away by AJ Rozi There was some physicality by the Cardinal on that defensive possession Thats what you need if you want to come back and win this game Jiren Stevenson guarding Aorei with the FOUR FOULS RYAN AGARALL A CAREERHIGH 17 FOR AGARWALL cheering And now hes just drawing multiple defenders and finding the shooters on the perimeter Nan Evans feeds Vasar runs over Roosi and a block is called on AJ Roi and its the second on Roi his second personal team Team foul number eight And the crowd reacting to the replay shown on the video board didnt agree with the call Would you expect anything more Anything less Not really We got the general Andrew Luck over here leading the cheers One and one for Vasar The foul was on the pass Missed the free throw and Rahulsi the rebound Stanford fans are saying right now ball dont lie Roof is going to blow off this place if they can score here Okorei and the rebound grab by North Carolina Here comes set trimble and a jump ball Possession arrow North Carolina on the alternating possession 25 on the shot clock for the Tarheelss So if youre North Carolina right now that ball has to go to Caleb Wilson Okay Hes been the best player for them in the second half on the offensive end Lets see if they can get him to his spot on that left block Here he is at the elbow Challenged and a foul Aiden Camman picks up his fourth and Caleb Wilson will head to the free throw line for North Carolina Now on the couple face up opportunities that Camman has guarded him Hes done a pretty good job of showing his arms moving his body he just moves into him at the last second cheering Wilson at the line Two for five now Three for six A new career best 25 for Wilson And he hits them both to put Carolina up three And Hubert Davis wants to talk things over 87 blocking him out of the corner I want to do that But if hes coming off pick and roll he cant split You got to corral the basketball make somebody else beat you and then be able to have your rotations on the backside really tight There it is Theres the corral Thats a better job by Vasar And then the rotations were good Now I dont let him get it back He gets it back 12 to shoot A Cororey into the key and the high arcer as he got knocked down and will get two free throws You know one thing I I I A Cororey showed me a lot right there because they tried to deny him the basketball back but he showed as a freshman a sense of physicality He goes and he like he pushes off a little bit to get the separation to go get that basketball and then the hard drive And when he drives hes a physical driver He put his hands on the Carolina defender and and initiated some of that contact Cory now 6 for8 from the line Second foul on Caleb Wilson cheering and Aorei splits the pair and its the Tarheelss by two So conversely for the Cardinal as we talked about what North Carolina was going to do with Aorei what are the Cardinal going to do with Basar and Wilson Make their catches tough They cant just catch the ball in their spot here And they tried to go right there to that left block And Cam was doing his work early Much better job You got to make one of the other three shoot the basketball Ken Evans lost the ball trying to step through a double team out of bounds The Tarheelss give it away They took away the initial option The ball ends up in Ken Evans hands Thats what you want if youre Stanford He tries to split Nowhere to go Good defense by Arosei 80 seconds to go Ibuka Okori Aiden Cam moving in Good job by Trimble DEN SMITH FOR THE LEAD STANFORD goes in front Their first lead since it was 54 20 for D Smith AND CAROLINA LOSES THE BALL Stanford has made 15 threes tonight Ryan Agarwal three Try to get a layup A lot of times in these situations teams do not want to foul because coaching staff are saying Play without fouling Play without fouling Try to get a quick one to the rim Cut it to two and set your press Set trimble over to Vasar You dont need a three Attack the rim Thesar isolated Backing in Vesar is fouled Will shoot two 169 remaining Now the foul actually helps Stanford Good job by Rahosi Great job by Basar to to draw the foul But with no timeouts for Stanford if that was a live basket they were not going to be able to get a Cory back in the game And now if his cramp is healing up as you can see hes hypervolting over there on his calf they can put a Cory back in the game Basar now 5 for 10 from the free throw line And Okori comes back for the Cardinal cheering Okay if he makes this and cuts it to a threepoint game you do not need to foul right away cheering Play for the trap Play for a steal and then you can foul once that ball gets near the half court line Vesar makes the second Hes tied a careerhigh 26 tonight for Henry Vasar You see theyre going to a diamond press Theyre going to look to force the catch to the corner Stanford tried to sub Benny Geler back in They cant cuz he exited after the first free throw from Vasar No time went off the clock Thats why Geler cant reenter And theyre explaining it to Kyle Smith and Wayne Hunter his assistant Carolina has two North Carolinas committed 16 fouls Next one puts Stanford into the bonus for a one and one Well you can see theyre in a one two one press Theyre going to try to force this to the corner and then trap that first pass They get it to Aorei and hes fouled immediately and a one and one for Ibuka Okorei They didnt react quick enough to get to the trap but part of that was Aori speed So one and one for Okori He is seven for nine at the line The foul was on Wilson his third Front end of the one and one Makes it a twopossession game 35 points for Ibuka Okorei 36 for Oori And a smart substitution Kyle Smith getting Rahosi And that allows Stanford to set their defense Yep And theyre setting into zone to try to slow up anything Carolina wants to do Here comes Ken Evans Bogots fly by Evans missing the three The weak side put back set Trimble Timeout Carolina 62 to go Trimble now with 13 points Well good action Run Theyre going with the football formation Okay You see the trips right National championship game on Monday night The general Andrew Luck sitting to our left Yeah And theyre going to try to run a Cory right in front of the basketball And Den Smith has trouble getting it to him And a turnover and a whistle at the other end Oh my They called a foul on Ken Evans Hubert Davis cannot believe that the foul was called from the official on the far end of the floor So Ken Evans right there He clearly Good call Good call And Geler 92 will shoot a one and one The senior from San Pedro California One timeout left for the Tarheelss and Geler before the inbound pass So no time ticked off and its a one and one for Benny Geler who has three points tonight This is almost icing the shooter Evans standing in front of Geler at the foul line Benny Geler One more coming applause And now its a twopossession game replacing number five And there needs to be some urgency Carolina has to go faster than quick And they get a timeout in the catch made in midcourt by Luca Bogots Cameron Boozer taking on the Cal Bears over in Berkeley All right Carolina ball and centrible will play it in The lob for Wilson and he lost his footing and a travel is called on Caleb Wilson and it goes over to Stanford with 37 and the Cardinal 37 away from the upset Great job of pulling the chair by Roi been their best post defender tonight And what a win this is going to be for Kyle Smith and the Stanford Cardinal after they knocked off Louisville here right after New Years Stanford about to knock off number 14 North Carolina the second consecutive ranked opponent to come to Maples and the Cardinal behind a Stanford single game freshman scoring record 36 from Ibuka Okori and the Stanford Cardinal Lock on
