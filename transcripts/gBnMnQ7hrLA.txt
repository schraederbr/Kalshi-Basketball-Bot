head Matthew Cleveland hes been a bucket since he got to college averaging right at 20 points a game over the last little bit this guy can score it the winds have come and gone but he can put up some stats in a hurry Divine Ugo chuko the starting point guard the fourth different starting point guard this year for the Miami Hurricanes number 99 had the basketball first kanes with it in their Road Orange uniforms the inbound knocked out of bounds youre going to see a lot of times in Baseline out of bounds situations theyre going to clear out aside and give Matthew Cleveland room to work hes really good in that 15 to 17 short post area cuz hes athletic and he can shoot over the top here is Matthew Cleveland in his fourth year college basketball couple of years in Tallahassee a couple of years in Coral Gables and facing this lineup for the yellow jackets we dont have a lot of healthy scholarship players either way only 15 total so these guys get familiar with these faces Terry George Dongo Suare and Powell that pass goes out of bounds back the other way to the yellow jackets I dont know who he was passing it to but by Dongo who you were referring to over his last three silly numbers 19 points and 16 boards a game uh finally starting to play like the player we expect expected coming off a terrific freshman campaign last year five straight double doubles 11 on the year in indongo after the first couple of months of the Season he has really turned it on in transition Cleveland with a basketball Works down the lane has it poked away from behind by Lance Terry and here comes Georgia Tech Terry turns tail hands it off to the hottest shooter on the team howwell misfires sware from Point Blank Range missed it you can see hes a little frustrated with himself Suare no way wasnt even close but it I feel like Georgia Tech right now trying to hit the home run early in this game go ahead and get into whats been making you play better as of late thats elongated offense sharing the basketball and getting it to BU Dongo who has been terrific when he gets it in what they call the dunker position hes going to score averaging 13 points nine rebounds a game one of only two in ACC play along with Eddie lanin of Syracuse averaging a double double against ACC opponents hes athletic hes long and you and I talked to Damon stom his activity level over the last few games has really increased and thats why hes starting to see success well you mentioned Damon STM youre number two and the yellow jackets under his direction are having their best season since 2020 2021 when they won the ACC Championship and they have everything they want out in front of them 15 and 14 overall 9 n in League Play doesnt necessarily knock your socks off but playing the way they have having put up three quad one victories in their last eight they can beat anybody in the league going to Sharp and thats what makes them so scary as he pleads for his team to wake up a little bit on the defensive end but it hes got talent I really like the future and the direction of this program under Damon STM not just how hes recruited but if this Georgia Tech teams healthy from the beginning of the season I feel like they have more consistency throughout the season Once Again the Miami defense will allow you to pretty much do what you want so if Bongo is going to get the ball that deep hes going to score all night long little bit of a late switch by Dango Im not sure how you get to that point but nice read by Nate George and thats one of his gifts right the ability to process where the matchups are best taken advantage of get the ball to the big boy and hes going to be able to finish especially matched up against a point guard he has taken that step from freshman to sophomore year where he was on the all rookie team in the ACC a year ago and Coach St says it is just about his activity if he is active and getting rebounds out of his area and just making himself available he is going to be an allc conference player and he pinpointed the rebounds out of the area because that dictates or that shows the coaching staff how engaged he is as far as his activity level is concerned when hes that hes Relentless and over the last three more than 16 rebounds a game I call that Relentless the sophomore from senagal makes it four nothing Tech sloppy start to begin the game for the canes couple of turnovers over for two from the floor also missed their two free throws from Brandon Johnson a moment ago a deep three and the canes are on the board thanks to the Sweet shot of Austin Schwarz thisy can play top 50 recruit in his class coming into this year didnt play in the early going but injuries breed opportunity and I think this is a guy that can score a lot of points in his college career its just going to take a little bit of time to develop and you know what Terrence after shoot around today interim head coach Bill Courtney made a point to tell us that whoever comes in and becomes the next head coach at Miami if asked coach Courtney will highly recommend Austin Schwarz and thats smart I mean you look at this knocking it down from the g g thats not a short look but this is a guy I saw him for the first time playing for Boo Williams at the peach jam in Augusta and this is a guy that can really score and he has the temperament to be a big time scorer off the hesitation Terry along the Baseline back out to Duncan Powell Dongo again in the lane and this time Cleveland denies him and comes away with the basketball driving one on two right down the lane couple of Point Blank opportunities missed by Miami and here comes Georgia attack right away they see a mismatch that they like AJ State McCrae a strong guy nice help better finish dunan pal shagman shagman be ready for him well on the heels of his worst game of the year at Boston College when he went 0 for six the reigning lud olssen National player of the week has been nothing but Sensational absolutely and a freshman Mistake by Miami there Austin Schwarz comes over on the Baseline side looking to trap and if youre going to do that as a young player you have to chest up the guy thats spinning your direction if you dont he can just step through easy bucket you put yourselves in a vulnerable position for an and one and you mentioned shagman again for those who dont know its the haircut he went to doto high school hes a Dallas kid with North Carolina Roots but it is a thing in north Texas the Shag he told me I needed it Im a little disappointed right youve got the perfect line for it right thats right just just hair in the back thats all I got you can do it shot clock under five huku off the back Island soaring for the rebound is Lance Terry Lance Terry senior day thats a guy who can score in a hurry too little bit frazzled right now as George attack like move the basketball make the defense change sides of the floor thats when you can take advantage of Miami I me and you alluded to it the worst defense in the conf Yeah by a country mile and that just has a lot to do with so many different pieces having to play men throughout the course of the year but if you make them move theres going to be opportunities to drive and then find easy Avenues to score well Miami opponents shoot 50 from the floor 40 from three both worst marks in the ACCC that along with the rebounding issues and the shooting issues and you can see why its gotten off the rails the canes this year Here Comes Cleveland but as weve said they are not devoid of talent they have players out there who would be coveted by a lot of other Schools Cleveland had it knocked away as he went into the lane and that will take us to our first media timeout here at mamish Pavilion in in fact he is 24 years old and told me last week that his teammates call him pops and old head theres some points for Miami coming off the bench from swars coming out of the timeout nicely drawn up by Bill Courtney and the canes are back within two we talked about his ability to score and at 65 hes got the size to see over the top as well so why has he only averaged five and a half points per game this season I think a lot of its just finding Rhythm and you know Nigel Packs not a part of the lineup he wasnt playing early in the season and now hes being relied on even more and a lot of it too you know you look at different rosters it comes to opportunity and now that hes gotten that you see how explosive he is if he just gets that sh clock under 10 Cleveland trying to go to work on pal here comes the second Defender passes out of it swars from the logo thats a shot clock violation chalk up the turnover forced by the yellow jacket and thats tough if youre Matthew Cleveland you either need to observe where the defense is coming first or you dont need to pick up your dribble and get out of there because youre putting your team teammates in a vulnerable spot by not getting rid of the basketball quicker I feel like every time you do a Georgia teeker a Miami game you got to run through all the players who are not here so ly Kidd Paul Joe Bay did not make the trip both are nursing ankle injuries still in South Florida Cleveland off the turnover big collision and its a blocking foul meanwhile for Georgia Tech we saw Javen McCollum he did get a lot of work in after shoot around today and they think hes getting close to come back his head injury but not available tonight kaasi Reeves among those who is still sideline for T kaasi Reeves would give this team a a wing with size that can defend and shoot and you know you look up and down the roster for Georgia techken the guys that are playing Jaden mofs a big guy but hes 65 kaasi Reeves gives you that 67 68 guy that can switch and play some front cor positions at times when other teams go small so limited in what they can do Ill say this Boi Rees you saw in your picture there a really impressive young man I mean I I didnt know the guys studied abroad if they were athletes hes one of those guys that has and if you ever have a chance to sit down and talk with him just an elite human oh I have I mean he is a remarkable guy senior from not far outside of Atlanta making his Terry scores off the B I love the fact that when kaasi was at Florida before transferring for Georgia Tech every time I saw him he had a different color of hair he is a ful interesting learned young man a published author yeah how about that Matthew Cleveland thats not typically his game stepping out knocking down shots thats kind of been the missing piece for him right he does so many things well he boards hes switchable defensively 7ot wingspan can you knock down shots with consistency been his ails Hill in Miami we talked about their lack of Defense theyve guarded well so far Huey rewarded for the block shot at the other end and hell have a chance now I guess no foul was called but huy gets the layup and the Hurricanes Take the Lead 119 I think the official was official Ron Gro was calling a goal 10 but ball went it anyway got but how about the defens of Presence by Miami Georgia Tech opened up this game a little bit sloppy I thought they started out the first three minutes trying to do a little too much maybe that might be the senior day nerves but you have to take care of the basketball and again Jalil Bea now coming off the bench providing some defensive intensity Miamis already got three block shots they hold him the first and second time but eventually if you dont secure that defensive rebound the offense is going to get you that time Nathan George buries the three offensive rebounds lead to step in threes more often than not big time shot by Nate George and you know Nate George over his last couple of games 0 for five from distance but before that he had gotten on quite a role and you know Terrence that he has made himself not just a passer you have to defend him out on the perimeter absolutely when he gets switches hes he can attack but you better not overcommit on him because hes got Elite Vision yellow jacket is just not able to hit shots right now Cleveland physically hes one of the most gifted in the ACC without question without question its doing some of these things consistently has been his issue but the man has always been able to score and hes extra motivated this game from about 15 minutes away is where his high schools at yeah parents both still live in Atlanta his parents both graduated from Georgia Tech his mom was on the dance team here when she was in undergrad and they are in attendance here tonight George looked at the rim with five on the shot clock gives it back to mustaf who cradles it like a running back got it on the rim and now we didnt have a reset of the shot clock did it catch iron or will it be a shot clock field goal Miamis ball 30 seconds on the shot clock so that was Ron groover explaining to the crowd here at mamish Pavilion here on senior night what that call was and uh we need to point out if Georgia Tech wins this game teren they will clinch a first round by in next weeks ACC tournament in Charlotte and that would be one week from today theyd get the day off and Advance right onto the second round so a lot on the line for this Georgia Tech team that has won six of its last eight ever since the start of February they have been just about as good as anybody in the ACC Music Suare with the rebound and here comes Nate George the accs leader and assist per game but thats a young mistake right Jalil Bea comes in the game and instead of letting the ball work a little bit overdoes it and what a pass are you kidding me the touch the over the top the Finish Suarez tough on the feed from George whose numbers are the best in terms of assists for this program since Drew Barry about three decades ago anytime you mention Drew Barry its a good day theres so many great names around this program we can go a lot of different directions Suare with his third Point Blank look and second in a row a nice drive and dish by Daren Sutton its a guy whos seldom used but hes got big time potential just have to harness some of that athleticism as his career goes forward yeah 6A freshman from St Charles Missouri open looks for state McCrae a little strong Here Comes Music Applause Terry and this is Sutton and back to George as Carl Hobs the associate head coach for Damon STM today what is Georges ceiling can he play in the NBA and he said oh absolutely he can get there his teammate cost him an assist right there with a Mis dunk by Darion Sutton he went for it heres Jalil be this guy is loaded with Talent hes still learning the college game and he has some of those young freshman demeanors and Body Language those are some of the things he has to clean up but the talent certainly there Bill Courtney said he has made major strides in a number of areas this year even though statistically you may not think he has made that sort of progress and he also predicted that Betha is going to take a huge Le from freshman the sophomore year despite the close out the triple is buried by Lance Terry and you go underneath the screen and Lance Terry is going to make you pay the largest lead for Georgia Tech so far on a 9 run you go underneath Lance Terry cant do that on him the stroke is pure to 1230 Eastern with the nothing but net crew its Mark its that time it certainly is and a lot of conference tournaments already up but the one that matters the ACC tournament Im fired up its going to be a fun week off the Cleveland Miss Johnson got his own missb keeps working kicks it back out St McCrae spins into the lane 10 on the shot clock Cleveland thought about the pass being hounded by power State McCrae somehow got the shot off despite the closing Suare but missed the shot Applause a rare Miss lately for tech on this 90 Applause run say what you want I love Ibrahim Suarez activity level he he missed a layup early in this game didnt let it bother his effort and energy and it still continues look he needs some refinement too a younger player but 610 gets off the floor quickly lot of potential and I feel like thats what I keep coming back to when we talk about Damon sodoms Georgia Tech like a lot of young players that are starting to figure it out he continues to recruit well overtime Elites right down the road which is a factory for talent Bea absorbs the contact and one its what he could do straight line drive and you got to respect the shot first and if you put Jalil Bea in a closeout situation hes fast enough and athletic enough to finish does he get out of control at times sure but but the talent is evident 65 190 from Uptown Philadelphia Billy Catholic League MVP McDonalds AllAmerican as mentioned he was number 10 in last years ESPN 100 there was talk of one and done anytime you are raed that high nationally but thats a a heck of a burden to carry with you for any kid it is and he came into a situation where you expect to play alongside Nigel pack a veteran point guard that can find you shots but this is a guy a lot of athleticism can really shoot it game needs to be refined sure and I think hes going to really coach said it hes going to see a big jump from his freshman the sophomore campaign and now whether that happens in Miami orange and green or somewhere else that is yet to be determined again with the interim tag on Coach Courtney and the season going to end for them out of nowhere Darion Sutton using that left hand to somehow bat the ball out of the air and through the cylinder how about the activity thats whats picked up over the last few minutes for Georgia Tekken gotten them on this run but pal needing to get it up just tip it in why not thats wheelhouse weve seen young flashes of both Galil Betha and Austin Schwarz two guys that can score the basketball and were just waiting for them them to develop a little bit you see Jil was the 10th overall recruit in the ESPN top 100 and you think about the Freshman Class across the country these two guys highly recruited highly touted be theya picked Miami over everybody Austin Schwarz picked Miami over Ukon like this is a combo of guards right here a combo of combo guards that can really score in the future would be bright but theres just been so much mixture here since Lena decided to after the early going part of the season so you hate to say it but these guys need development and with so much in the mix it makes it really hard for them to really fall into their roles at an effective rate and weve seen it that freshman wont necessarily make you a winning team I mean look at ruter sure theyve got a couple of guys who are going to go in the top three or for the NBA draft and theyre just an average team at best in the Big 10 conference that thats 100 correct now you talk about nil you cant spend all your nil on two players right which is what it seems like has happened up in ruter but nonetheless but again youre absolutely right basketball yes and the way college basketball is now as you know too when youre playing against 22 23 24 and even 25 year olds when you are 18 that is a steep hill to CL right and Schartz has a little bit of an advantage thats a bad shot Schwarz has a little bit of an advantage because physically hes ready right now hes got broad shoulders a wider base you know Betha is going to grow in to his body what a move something off the spin couldnt finish you get a sense at 68 his ball handling skills the uh the fact that he can play the wing with that frame the f is three long grabbed by Johnson out to Cleveland I will say this about Miami they have talented guys and and thats another example of just that but you notice it the ball just sticks they dont move it everybody every time they catch it they try to create something on their own and thatll hold you in games for 12 to 15 minutes its when the other team goes on a Rolls can you sustain this shot making theyve taken some hard shots this contest so far so if Nigel Pat doesnt go down how much of that goes away well it changes because it changes the play calling and you have somebody steady at the point thats going to be able to get you within your offense again Miami has used four different starting point guards between an ineffectiveness and injury theyve had 10 different starting lineups and at the moment they have been starting the Freshman from Sugarland texes the third of the three freshman sure this year huku he had a short run here tonight and has been on the bench for an awful long time with Bea in the ball game Applause if youre Dongo you got to go and try to dunk that pass you have health coming over late you got to jump up and try to get after it theres a lot of contact there sure but if you go after the rim with more Force the guy who initiates the contact often times is the guy who gets the foul go yep Cleveland with the steel but then gave it back great Hands by Nathan George then he finds the open man who find the more open man the Slam by plus the Applause foul the pass to start off that sequence of events by Nate George a lefthanded onehanded across look at this the skill level of being able to do that the quick one more and Duncan pal Duncan all over you big time move and Big Time sequence by Georgia Tech thats trying to find their Rhythm and that hockey assist youre talking about thats the super power Damon STM says about his point guard that off the dribble onehanded pass from one side of the court to the other you wouldnt encourage a lot of guys to try that he does it with great proficiency he certainly does and to be honest with you Doug the more I watch him he loves coming off his right and then flinging it but hes able to make that pass with both hands and he doesnt have to gather the ball to make it happen so the ball gets there on time and on target such a tough skill to master Cleveland leans in draws the contact and hell have a chance for three say this Matthew Clevelands coming play he has been aggressive on every single catch his parents are in the crowd hes from right down the road he gets you leaning and thats Duncan pal thats two and hes only played here once before as a Collegiate player as a freshman at Florida State but then he didnt play as a sophomore for FSU here in Atlanta last year the canes didnt come here so this is a big opportunity for him in front of his friends and families and so far he had has shown out hes four for seven from the floor his teammates that combined four for Applause 16o inside for two and just another example of floor vision and hitting that seam pass in a position where your guy can score spotting up swz tried to bank it in or maybe didnt try almost did huy right to the rim and he missed it it rimmed out on Kyrie huy tell you what the canes have come to fight balls loose Georgia Tech comes away with it must down the pan off the window for two thats the culture that Damon STM is trying to build here and hes thriving these guys are on the floor theyre on the glass theyre communicating theyre pushing in transition theyve won four out of their last five its one of the major reasons man hes fast Betha George head up as always lobs it to the rim Dongo has to come down with it lost it saves it mustaf back to George under five minutes to go in the half Dongo cleans it Applause up when this front court is rolling they just play harder than you thats the difference in B and Dongo last few weeks of the season and part of that too the yellow jackets already have 11 Second Chance points Cleveland penetrates again and again he shows physically hes going to be hard to stop when he puts his mind to it hes getting to his right hand and hes making decisions off that right hand thats where hes at his best but you see it quick shot fake direct line drive and an excellent hold off there by Brandon Johnson the East Carolina transfer sometimes youre ceiling trying to get post position that guy starts the drive just continue to hold that seal and you give your guy a lane a long stretch of the loss of Carolina on Saturday Cleveland was the best player on the floor he is 10th in the ACC right now in scoring and he is third in field goal percentage and those usually go to post players maliku and one for Florida State Dongo is two for Tech but Cleveland who is a perimeter player gets to the bucket so much and finishes so well he makes over 50 of his field goal attempts sure most of those field goal attempts theyre within 10 to 15 ft sure but its a matter of getting there against some of these smaller guards but I think they call that a hesi thats what that is Cleveland with another steel hes got Powell to be he does ball rims out but hes going to go to the line to shoot a pair and thats a big foul dunan P dun third his third foul and Tech does not have much of a bench and so what will Damon stmy and Company do is Matthew Cleveland in his home thank you Michael Miami LED 1312 before a 9 nothing Georgia Tech run but Matthew Cleveland singlehandedly has kept his canes in it Mom and Dad both alumni from right here at Georgia Tech he grew up went to high school Pace Academy about 6 miles north of where we sit here at mamish Pavilion and his folks have followed him around pretty much for his four years of college two in Tallahasse and two in Miami theres Ralph always yeah always wears his sons uniform with a Blazer over top looking sharp that is an official look right there I would do the same thing if my myself play that may come it it certainly may well there is his son at the free throw line who is in the midst of a heater in spite of that Miss free throw 14 points he has drawn six fouls on Georgia Tech already three of which have come against Duncan pal who is one of the key cogs to everything the yellow jackets like to do offensively and a guy who could really space the floor out for Damon STM Squad Matthew Cleveland basball was actually his first sporting love hes a huge fan of the Atlanta Braves played high school as a kid but eventually outgrew baseball and turned into an Elite basketball recruiting High School I would imagine 67 with long arms isnt conducive to a compact swing Aaron judges it out thatll work certainly will I dont think he gets enough credit for how good of an athlete he is oh hell dunk on you he certainly will and he just finds a way to float in the air what a finish and look at Georgia Tech now little two3 zone out of a timeout just to mix things up you have to find the shooters Austin Schwarz has shot the ball well here in the early going hes looking to pull look chuku back in the game he passes to Cleveland who front irons it Georgia Tech has dominated the glass as expected especially on the offensive end so far tonight 3 minutes remaining in the first half George off the bounce you okay with the midrange there absolutely Im okay with the midrange and heres the thing you have to take what the defense gives you they bounce off he makes it easy thats been one of his biggest improvements over the course of the season I know you know what the analytics say but I still love that midrange game and I think it should be used if youve got a good open look from 15 why not take theres a clean look from 19 why not take it if you can make it hey just like any shot Doug the shot is determined by whos shooting it right and if Im Damon sodar Im living and dying on what Nate Georges decision making is going to be and hes just been so decisive on switches trying to attack quick Boomerang pass right here hes going to attack the big Dongo spins to the Baseline goes to the reverse and lays it in making it look easy here tonight in Atlanta just another example you have a guy coming over to help Baseline if youre going to do that you need to come over and guard with your chest with this level physicality and here we go George throws it up and ter throws it down we told you he dunk on you Showtime on senior KN Lance ter that piece together perfectly s everybody Cal yeah everybody calmed down a little bit atin Schartz still plays for the Hurricanes already into double figures the Freshman out of the Canon School Concord North Carolina makes it a 10point game final minute 20 of the half Tech has made eight of its last 10 from the floor and of those eight five have been layups two have been dunks two three Zone back okay so the guy who dunks on you can step out to 25 and VAR it what do you do with number zero and one you stay in front and you stay disciplined and then you worry about the guys behind you if they can help you out now Georgia Tech staying with this two3 lead l know Dongo with another rebound be a little hesitant cuz thats exactly where Clevelands most come Terry again C down Why Stop Now L Terry efficient 6 to7 15 points in his last game on this floor an outstanding Applause pass well this is going to be the fourth time in Georgia Tech program history that theyve got five players averaging double figures it was done in 65 86 and 92 they have a lot of weapons teren they certainly do and its all orchest frustated by the man with the afro Nate George but heres the thing if Im Lance Terry who do I love playing with more than George he finds you on every single possession a terrific passer right on the Music Applause numbers three on the shot clock Cleveland 4 seconds left in the half can Tech get up a shot no Cleveland denies it but Tech grabed momentum at after falling behind 1312 and they very much look like a Georgia Tech with the basketball to start the second half here at the camish Pavilion do you get an assist on that pass Im giving it to him its like a a different kind of Derek Wittenberg kind of pass in quotes Ill give him the assist too why not you know its funny when you and I talked to dadar he said you know what Duncan pales found a home and I said wheres that home the left corner he loves that spot on the floor he really consistent there in ACC play he is the leading scorer as Cleveland gets a lucky roll on that threepoint shot but Duncan PO is averaging nearly 15 points per game and shooting at almost a 40 clip against ACC opponent so again he is the reigning lud olssen National player of the week who is shooting the lights out lately and I understand that before shoot around today when Damon STM asked him if he knew who lot Olsen was its a good thing he had been clued in or else he might have been running laps because of course lude Olsson the lak rate head coach of the Arizona d uh Arizona diamonds Arizona Wildcats was course the head coach for D sty back in the90s Terry has the first three from the corner here in the second half 18 points to lead all scores for Terry so the yellow jackets now made seven straight shots Teran six to close out first ATT and theyre first to begin the second theyre just playing with such wether if they dont have something they get it back to their playmaker and then they make something happen quick D stom slowing the troops a little bit letting them figure it out they see a mismatch by Dongo he knows how to attack thats good thats good action theyve now made 13 of their last 15 shots from the floor as Terry delivers yet again seems good but really nice pass by Pongo he sees the double team coming doesnt lose his composure sees the opposite 45 L Terry on a heater Cleveland trying to answer and Music does something about Atlanta you dont think hes got a little extra juice tonight coming home to play what is going to be his next to last college basketball game here in his hometown nice pass Dongo crosscourt over top the double team and then Cleveland what you can do sir I can do better but you see the quality of the shot right I I mean Georgia Tech moving the basketball finding their advantage where the mismatches at meanwhile Miami very oneonone oriented throughout the course of this game and Terrence that is a trickle down from the man who has the basketball right absolutely that if George shares at an elite level if youre his teammate you want to do the same and they have full trust in him and they if something stalls its been ingrained in them by Damon stom hey get the ball to Nate hes going to find you hes not going to take a shot that he doesnt absolutely feel contrite about hes very unselfish and they understand if I give it to him Im getting it back Dango with the block but called for the foul the Baseline official Brian oconnell all over it and its a two shot foul is first fou you going see the explosion of Jalil Betha not a lot of contact there I thought Bea put the ball right there Dongo shoulder youll remember last years final four Jalil bethia windmilled a pair of dunks over two7 Footers to win the slam dun contest yep hes got that kind of hops and when given the the opportunity hell show it off its about harnessing that athleticism and that potential thats kind of like what you had to do with cleansing yeah I had so much athleticism just bursting at the Applause scams freshman out of Archbishop Wood high school in Philadelphia makes it Music 5538 George again off the bounce with that lefthanded pass into the corner finds its way inside to Duncan Powell defended by Johnson to the left hand and he draws the foul and if you notice when pal gets the ball in the post he is being overly patient waiting to see if a double team is coming but when Brandon Johnsons guarding him a oneonone theyre going to go ahead and leave him there you have to be able to make a play he realizes the situation quick drop step hes able to get to the free throw line and so the 68 red shirt Jor from Dallas at the line the nothing but net crew will be in Greensboro for the Ali ACC womens basketball tournament starting tomorrow theyll have pregame halftime and postgame shows throughout the tournament providing previews highlights analysis and game breakdown Applause Music teing it up from way downtown huku no Brandon Johnson yes his first field goal of the night what a movement on the top there just to find Nate George an angle to attack excellent scoll he George just so good at evaluating the backside of the defense if theyre going to be able to come over in time and you know what too I cant help to think about that combo theyre both sophomores George and indongo if they wind up coming back next year and keep the foure around them theyve got good recruits coming in how good can Tech be next year a handful a handful and just being able to stay off the injury tape that thats going to be biggest thing because a lot of these guys are going to come back they have a good recruiting class coming in uh it Im telling you its on the right Dongo Dongo able to do whatever he wants inside makes it Applause 6142 Cleveland may have gotten away with the tra may have well the whistle didnt block well he says how about that Cleveland would much prefer that finish to The Possession then a whistle and a tra dad says yeah Ive seen that before the hometown kid having a big night one Savage I fouled him entirely too hard okay he threatened to quit the entire tournament in the championship game but we ended up winning okay Waka got 100000 to his charity of his selection we had a great time we played Joiner Lucas in round one we played Rody rich in round two and we beat 21 Savage in the championship game did w play he played he was the he was the best rapper there he I mean a beast on the boards walk a flock by the way the yellow jackets have now made 12 consecutive shots their last six attempts in the first half their first six to begin the second half Lance Terry having himself a night I mean why not end his career with a bank been so consistent how about Austin Schwarz talked about his ability and potential as a lead guard or not a lead guard but a scoring guard rather Fus smoth hes got a dozen his first two points of the second half make it 6446 now before the game you went and saw your guy Waka he uh was fired up to see yeah its my man that was a unique experience I would think it was over at the overtime Elite area wow what a shot Georgia Techs just clicking and Miami has given up a little bit on the defensive end it comes down to personal Pride at some point Bill Courtney talked about that today like when things go Ary are you going to man up take some pride in your matchup and defend and sometimes that can slide away from him and by and large the answer to that question all season long has been no they are last in the ACC in field goal percentage defense threepoint percentage defense and next to last in rebounding which is largely predicated on effort and they get stuck out of position I I think thats the big time because early in the game theyre struggling to defend they get stuck and when guys are coming over and help and theyre coming over too late and theres no forced action on the defensive side of the ball and I feel for Bill Courtney because you got a lot of guys one foot out of the door especially the way this league is trans or this season has transpired for them and hes put in an impossible position of trying to Wrangle these guys in the fact of the matter is he will be out of a job this weekend after they play their regular season finale at home on Saturday there will be a Changing of the Guard off the steel Here Comes Brandon Johnson and its been wisely reported that Duke associate head coach Jay Lucas will be that next head coach in Miami neither side has commented on it of course the Blue Devils have other things on their uh agenda for marching they have a national championship to win so we dont know exactly whats going to happen or when its going to happen but we do know there is a Changing of the Guard at Miami ever since Jim another that is silly Lance Terry is acting Applause different that ties his career high with 26 points for the senior from College Park Georgia hes missed one shot thats the most he scored as a yellow jacket when he played for Gardner Webb to sophomore year he put 26 on Hampton hes got almost 13 minutes to better that here Applause Music tonight George leaves it for Terry hes hunting a little bit right now this Balls going up goes right around the freshman and lays it in on the reverse for a new career high 28 points what a performance we still have more than a quarter of this game to play he came off the bench the first five games of the Season he has been nothing short of a revelation this year for Damon ston how about the recognition too of like hey we need to get this guy the ball I mean thats not a hard answer but still Cleveland continues to pile up the points 8 minutes into the second half Georgia Tech looking to move back above the 500 Mark in AC SE play the lid would have come off this place love the crowd reaction Lance Terry has been that guy Mr Sherman he is attacked and done so officially 11 13 on the day look at this you called it a hesy my bracket Im having Duke win the whole thing and I know were biased watching them all year and being in the ACC but sure they are as good as advertised and as you know when you see them in person its even better thats absolutely right and keep in mind too Georgia Tech they could still if they went out now they need help but to get that seventh spot over Stanford that puts them in a different Applause position Suare back into the game playing some good defense the ball eventually Finds Its way to the senior from Raleigh Brandon Johnson who lays it in 7154 Miami LED briefly in the first half but Tech used a 90 run and then they have been on quite a heater late in the first half early in the second half barely missing anything its crazy for me to think that Georgia Techs only win this half by one point it just feels like excuse me three points now after Ibraham Suare gets one to Applause go how can you continue to find good looks if youre Miami thats by playing fast Here Comes Applause Terry hes already got a career high with 28 points hes had a couple of real highlight shots on the held ball possession points the other way the Hurricanes will have Music it I like the aggressiveness sometimes you have to see whats in front of you you have a oneon three break I appreciate trying to attack and get your guy leaning but at the same time see whats in front of you I know youre feeling yourself right now currently 11 for 14 from the field but you have found your offense when the offense has worked for you not necessarily when youre forcing Applause it chil Bea with the basketball out there with Cleveland heres Johnson with Applause it Miss fires from the free throw line and as always the point guard Nathan George with his head up he gets it back from Music Dongo in and out Dongo on the offensive CL as he has been right from the opening tip Im sorry I know Miami is in a tough way right now that efforts not okay Matthew Cleveland I I if youre going to battle that ball swung you have to fight to get back in front thats kind of you know my complaint with Matthew Cleveland is he talented sure but there comes a point guys like you have to be able to at least hold your weight from an effort perspective George Off the Mark long rebound to Cleveland going in and one of the other aspects of it you know you say Well theyre in their final week theyre going to have a coaching chain if these players are looking to play professionally or looking to transfer and have another program want to bring you on and pay you money what you put on tape tonight matters its huge and heres the thing Matthew Cleveland like he was a top 30 recruit in his class he has an NBA frame in B you have a chance can you show that you do winning things and right now down 23 points in your effort WIS Im not a fan Im not a fan of Applause that 846 on the clock has expected George attack well in control over Miami doesnt need to score understands Lance Terrys feeling some of these other guys are having big scoring nights Im just going to be a be a point guard and find spots for those Applause guys mustaf brings the ball up gives to Terry I think Jaden mustos a really good player and hes going to to figure out how to score at a high level and consistently throughout the course of his college career basketball in his blood well its the ninth time in his career Bongo has had a 20po game fourth time this season hes up to 22 the lead is 23 theyre trying to find Travis best in the crowd but looks like he may have gotten out of here talk about the long list of great point guards in the history of this Georgia Tech program best 2000 point scor there was a pretty good point guard at there as well as any team in the past x amount of years its been them and Auburn you talk about Alabama and Auburn I know were in the ACC Network so Im to keep it keep it quick the number one ranked offensive efficiency in the country in Auburn and the number three ranked offensive efficiency in Alabama and you can do that in Europe you cannot do that here yeah Terry interfered with that shot takes two points off the board goes immediately to his teammate whose points he took well we did find Travis B he didnt leave early the 2000 Point scorer on the right there one of the alltime great George Tech went on to have a terrific NBA career heck of a hat you like that I did I was grabbing his numbers earlier 257 career points for Travis basketball behind only Rich Yunis Matt Haring mark tennis Scott Tom H this program has 6 2000 points scor the tradition at Georgia Tech and anytime you bring up rich yonus its a good day Big Time Music score thats his spot from the corner he loves it you called this morning thats his home hes found a home David St told us its in the left corner its also at Georgia Tech Shore but his spot on the floor is that left corner well he grew up as a UNC he was a kid North Carolina even though hes a Tex played his high school ball home is Dallas he was a tarheel but hes thrilled to be in the ACC now balling for the yellow jackets and I played with his cousin Julius B who was roughly the same size and he had that slingshot release over the top of his head very similar to what Duncan has one of my favorite teammates I had super nice guy to be honest with you the Vibes I get from Duncan very similar Strong finish Inside by Brandon Johnson well you spent two years balling at clemon so you never had a senior day right no I didnt do you wish that you had it do you miss it when you come and see what were seeing here tonight absolutely and I Im jealous of these young kids now Im not sure thats what Bill Courtney wanted offensively and I got to throw in youre not that old come on turning 37 here soon like I but heres you know I Im jealous of the student athletes today because they have options and they have the ability nice play they have the ability to get information from multiple people so this is back in 2009 even were talking what 16 years ago we didnt have the the ability to grab information because everything was a rule now these kids have the ability to figure it out seek outside help quite frankly Im jealous what a move by state in prey so you played for Oliver Pernell like Clemson what kind of role or guidance could somebody like him nearly 20 years ago give you if any I mean none it wasnt even a conversation worth having a lot of times and not to mention you know Oliver had a unique style he was very much a CEO type of Coach I had a great practice relationship with him but I didnt have a relationship where I could go up and just talk to him and ask him questions and expect good feedback I I think in the last 10 years the dynamic with players and coaches has changed Music dramatic had a point guard to play with Hamm and this just tells you the difference between todays coaching Styles and 15 16 years ago I say Cliff you know I Ive never really talked to all of him I think I talked to him twice outside of practice in two years that ended up being all and the third time I talked to him was after I announced I was leaving and he hung up on me wow so like thats just part of the gig but at the same time I asked Cliff I was like this is when I was a freshman do we not are we not supposed to have relationship with their coach he goes why would you wow so hes like youre getting your scholarship hes giving you playing time and youre playing well for him so its wow thats a very different Dynamic than what I was used to coming up and now because kids can leave and transfer that Dynamic has shifted dramatically absolutely absolutely the power has completely shifted and its not even about being in power or with or without it its about just taking care of your guys and not saying made not saying that you know he was a bad person it was just a different Dynamic then than it is now number zero Matthew Cleveland is first Cleveland picks up his first personal foul Terry working on senior night already has a career high and very nearly got another Sports Center worthy highlight there hes been good today hasnt he so athletic thats the first time Ive seen him getting pushed off balance and I think this is my second or third doing Georg Tech over the last few year or last few weeks hes never knocked off balance hes got tremendous athleticism the whole thing well were really excited about our next gymnastics meet on AC Network Sunday at 5 Eastern 2 Pacific its all part of the Elevate the stage quad meet Kalen North Carolina as well as Alabama and Michigan State will Square Off the teams will be competing in four skills bars beam Vault and Floren keep your eyes on Maya lazon the AllAmerican from Cal shes capable of going for a perfect 10 or two or three any single day four minutes to go in regulation in a game that has been dominated by the yellow jackets they Trail 13 to 12 the canes were trading baskets early but then in the blink of an eye seemingly and weve seen one burst after another over the course of the last 30 plus minutes but the yellow jackets have clearly shown theyre the better team absolutely off the turnover Johnson throws it out and the layup is rolled in by Jal Applause Bea game starting to open up a little bit Georgia Tech getting a little comfortable right now damid sty recognizes it gets a timeout going have to clean some things up over the last 325 yeah the hurricanes have made five shots in a row and so that prompts the timeout call the canes making a little noise here with 3 and 12 minutes left in regulation in Atlanta going seniors recognized by the crowd during a wonderful ceremony and you see some of the balance there this is the sixth time this season Georgia Tech has had 10 or more threes in a game theyve won four the first five theyre about to win five out of six and they have shot it very very well they are six of 10 from distance in the second half overall for the game 10 of 21 48 Terry has to put it up to beat the buzzer doesnt do it a shot clock violation back to Miami you see the look on the face of Coach STM now thrilled with that one theres ammo everywhere yes and if youre a and what I mean by that is you have a play like that coming out of a timeout and youre winning by 17 points if my math is doing me correctly watch out if my math is doing me correctly now 15 points youre always is going to have things that a head coach is going to be able to pick at yep well we overheard Damon STM after shoot around today I cant say exactly what he said no you cant coming back from Christmas we were really messed up and they have really turned things around the second half of the season in day even more so its ramped up from mid January to where they are now on the verge of winning nine of their last 11 including three quad one wins leaving it off the bounce missfires save back to Cleveland who has it poked Applause away Terry penetrates over to georgean Hill give a little shov C Dongo had it knocked out of bounds Georgia Tech will keep it and now for tonights player of the game brought to you by carvana its going to be no surprise the man who leads all scores with 29 Points theres Mr ter and he says wait a second Duncan P says Im the national player of the week how can I not be the player of the game well I think that shows more than anything how many different guys can have an explosive night for Georgia Tech George commits the foul and thats an opportunity to get emmer Nichols into the game the third of the three seniors being recognized tonight had a huge opport on Saturday is threepointer brought the house down against North Carolina State and my only want at this point to is for that man to get as many shots up in the next minute 42 as humanly possible and if youre a teammate if youre a scholarship teammate give him the ball set him a screen where wheres this like Miamis playing good basketball over the last four minutes oh my goodness an exclamation point by Lance Terry he wants to smile after his 31st Point comes on another slam dunk Johnson dumps over Emer Nichols the red shirt sophomore from Woodside California by the way as Nicholls tries to shovel the pass taken away 11 assists now for Nate George so that is backto back games with double digits 23 in counting George still in the game with a basketball in his Applause hands oh man down I recognize I was about to say you told us about your pickup it looked pretty that looked like the description right there thats it to a t but Im 58 W hes got a lot going on in his mind right now Terry thats for Lance Terry and why not be sure deserves it what a Applause performance 31 points 12 of 19 from the field at one point he was like 8 for N 9 for 10 and I tell you what hes the only remaining member of the Josh passer era what a bridge he has been maros San Miguel Marcos San Miguel a sophomore will come in as the bench gets empty by coach stmi these guys are getting a standing o and let me say this over the last eight games they deserve it yeah they really do theyve played well theyve played together four guys averaging 14 points a game and ACC play they played unself they will close out their regular season Saturday at Wake Forest and they will play next after that Wednesday in the second round of the ACC tournament because theyre earning a first round buy with his victory here tonight SW who had a no way ear earlier wow I think his I think his knee is feeling better he heard it last week against Pittsburgh hes moved very well tonight man hes such an a standing 610 611 Just Bounce hes still learning right lot of tools though that kind of epitomizes things for Miami tonight and for the season Austin swords took the pass and stepped out of bounds give it back to Georgia tack theres the uh season in a nutshell on the face of the interim head coach Bill courton thatll do it what an impressive performance by Georgia Tech well balanced well oiled machine played incredibly well played incredibly hard especially in that first half Georgia Tech continues to roll in the right
