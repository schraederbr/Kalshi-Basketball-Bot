against Boston College this is the best stretch so far in his young career it absolutely has been that and talking with the associate head coach Adrian Autry pregame he talked about the game is starting to slow down hes starting to figure out his teammates where they need the ball and when he also needs to be aggressively scoring the world of talent there and the youngsters Syracuse wins the opening tip and we are underway inside the KFC Yum Center for both of us always one of the great stops in college basketball we know that Louisville is really struggling Edwards going in strong air they come in with a record of two and twelve Syracuse is playing better nine and five coming into this game and experience is starting to show up for Syracuse at this point and Louisville making one change in the starting lineup Kamari lands is in there for Jalen Withers what do you think about the Freshman getting his first career started I like it he adds shooting on the floor and honestly it takes some of the pressure off of Withers who hasnt had a great stretch as of late see if it brings him off the bench take a little bit pressure off him but see if they can get lands going a little more from the perimeter early well certainly a hot hand along with mints these days for Syracuse is Joe Gerard Gerard hitting 36 percent from three hes better than that right on target will be Chris Bell to knock that one down the freshman and thats going to be interesting to see whos the better shooting team in this game of course the cards are going to have to make threes against this Zone but for Syracuse when the three ball travels theyre dangerous James with a misfire rebound snatched by Benny Williams whos coming off a doubledouble against Boston College he stared 11 rebounds in that game Gerard gets himself a look cant stick that hes been shooting the ball very very well lately and the pressure was taken off of him he no longer has to be a point guard OB so now that he can just go be a score allowed you to miss a takeover the point guard role is Rock taking a lot of pressure off of jg3 and Mintz has been finding him regularly dry coming in at 16 points a game curry in close swatted out of the sky by Edwards up there quickly hes going to try it again the stick to it this of Susan Curry pays off with the cards but going up against the accs leading shot blocker and Jesse Edwards Edwards won round one but Curry continued to battle Curry is a big body the 68 senior hes trying to whittle that body down a little bit heres Gerard from three and hell knock that one back but you see the ability of Jojo Rock to be able to move off away from the basketball makes him so much more dangerous as he scores Joe had 24 against Boston College on New Years Eve top Louisville looking for their first winning conference play for Kenny Payne loose on the deck thatll be scooped up five minutes who is really quick gonna take it to the Lane nice dish there and Gerard cant finish it though youre too close for Joe Girard hes not used to shooting that close thats exactly right those guys who like it from like 27 feet they missed their layups Vince over the top cant get the slam to go Edwards cant Music just underway here inside the KFC Yum centered three turnovers already for Louisville huge problem for them all season long almost 17 a game if you look at the orange 141 turnover was forced per game second in the ACC and that zone can often cause problems for opponents often Edwards nice well done there to get it on that soft rim and it rolled in you know Obi one of the things that Im seeing from this Syracuse team earlier each and every possession guys are dapping each other up theyre giving each other handshakes that congratulate each other for the nice pass whatever it may be I like the chemistry from this group early Ellis will swing that one a little bit too far off Huntley Hatfield and um kind of a developing chemistry maybe a little bit of that was missing early in the year I believe it was missing early in the year a lot of it has to do with the fact that youre starting a freshman point guard youve got a freshman on the wing and then youve got guys like Benny Williams who really hadnt been in the rotation much got a nice look there absolutely greatly and the pickoff here by Ellis Ellis comes in at 17 and a half points a game to distribute theyll swing it here for James Syracuse got back to play good defense Ellis to the paint downstairs Curry once again meets Edwards and didnt like it very much back up and hell draw the foul Sydney Curry is the only Cardinal who shoots 50 or better and you know where he lives absolutely but when you look at Jesse Edwards who controls the paint for Syracuse its the second time hes blocked the shot of Sydney Curry but Curry has stuck with it both times and now finds an opportunity to put Second Chance points on the Lefty Williams with the personal his first Louisville a pretty good foul shooting team a lot of areas have been totally outplayed but the line had been pretty good and talk about Curry a guy who could be so explosive as he was last year against Virginia went off for 24 and 14 hes had a 28point game against Wake Forest and if he can trim down and keep the weight down he could be a monster he absolutely can be one of the things that Kenny Payne has been working with Cindy Curry on is getting his body in shape to where he can be able to play 2530 minutes a game and stay out of foul trouble James trying to bounce into the paint Curry again and Edwards came over once more but a foul this time it should be a real fun battle to watch all night long here tonight at Louisville whats up Peloton its your girl Ali love welcome were gonna have a good time today why do dry

Louisville great player in a 1986 National Championship with Denny Crum absolutely and the distinction of Kenny Payne and Jim behan both have won a national championship as coaches division one however Kenny Payne the only division one basketball coach to have won a national championship as a player as a coach and to be a NBA draft pick so its a rare company we have here especially when you consider a guy whos won over a thousand wins twice Kenny has Danny Manning and Nolan Smith on the staff too not a bad group man look at the alma mater guys a thousand and seven wins and Counting for the great Jim Boeheim among those who get to do it for the school that they matriculated out Edwards up top swings here for Bell hit the opening three Gerard went sliding down and a turnover it was started so well for Syracuse handling the basketball theyve got a little sloppy as of late turning it over but bull Returns the favor a simple unforced error for Mike James the Cardinals theres hardly a phase of the game in which they havent been outplayed theyve been outscored by about 13 a game steam more turnovers than their opponents theyre being outshot 47 to 41 thats how you get to two and twelve nice feed there by Gerard and a stop for Edwards and Edwards is now one for three on dunks which is something thats rare for him of course she was close to 70 from the field always great in the painted area and around the perimeter heres Withers back into the game did not start in this one Ellis is Withers from the corner a little bit too strong but Curry there for the rebound he decided to beat it out and instead of going toetotoe with Edwards this time that Drake putter is all through by James and that Improvement by the Louisville Cardinals earlier that may have been a shot that LL is forced in comparison to touch and the pain and kicking it out to James to knock down his second group coming off eight points in the last contest off Target Edwards will knock it back right to Louisville Applause Steve Ellis gets started against 17 and a half points a game for L Ellis ones in and out Gerard comes away with it Music Syracuse has won six of their last seven games so they have found a better rule below as you say now getting sloppy with the ball last three or four minutes and Louisvilles done a much better job putting pressure on each pass and also the passer is forcing a little more attention on the orange not making things easy for them on the offensive end of the floor and because of that nav opportunity to actually take a lead Louisville began the season of course by dropping nine in a row before finally beating somebody they beat Western Kentucky on December 14th for their first Victory and the stuff High out of the sky goes trainer look by LL is recognizing Jesse Edwards was way up in the painted area no way he could backpedal and get to that before a trainer put it down a little on the little nine two run here that one comes free again for James going up against Gerard and a great stop there by Bell take up in Black and clean absolutely was but Louisville hustling back maintaining possession Withers thought about it theyll look for the three instead and James drills it doesnt mobile as all of them out of both sides right now yeah thats one of those possessions where youre okay with getting your layup blocked when you end up getting a three because of it another turnover Ella hes got it what a surge here for the Cardinals now on top 1610 and OB as you can tell it doesnt matter the record they still make noise here at the KFC Yum Center encouraging to call Gerard will pull off way off Target weather is lines up a long while sticks it Jalen Withers who makes 38 percent that forces a timeout for Jim behind you talked about the

LL is over the top the JJ trainer has opened up things on the outside Mike James jumping up knocking down his second three and then Jalen Withers Off the Bench for the first time this season is definitely in and producing as soon as he steps on the floor a Saturday at Kentucky Louisville was two for 13 from threepoint land to start it out and theyre four for five in this one so talk about that game they got buried early 215 early in that game versus Kentucky just like getting down 82 here but they responded differently here today than what we saw from them on Saturday so Syracuse looking for a hot hand suddenly down by nine points to the Ville Justin Taylor getting into the contest here is Metz off the big and drains it and hes one of those guys that can go get one on his own can individually make plays and thats where you know talking with this coaching staff they said hes got to figure out the time when to do that and right now that scene this seems to be the time that theyre going to need him to go make individual plays Syracuses highest rated recruit and just thrown away by the Cardinals so back to the orange down by seven right now you see Jim behav going to a young group Malik Brown Justin Taylor getting on the floor Music out of the wing and knocked down by Gerard who had a 31point game against Richmond earlier this season yeah I dont care how well things are going for you you cant let that guy have a wide open look thats not going to be good for your defense yeah for him thats as open as it gets Music foreign Applause ERS back to land so far Al Ellis has been doing the distribution work Huntley Hatfield had it knocked away Gerard is mints shredding the D and knocked out of play and Lee Hatfield with the block and off of Syracuse thats a great recovery by Hundley Hatfield I thought Judah Miss was about to make it a 70 run for the orange just like that which Im sure would have ended up with a Kenny Payne timeout so thats a big time block right there to gain possession back to your team lost the handle and out it goes good crew here tonight Bert Smith Jeffrey Anderson and John Gaffney are officials and those turnovers are going to pile up eight of them already now for Louisville and especially when things are going in your favor youre shooting the ball well you want to make sure you continue to get quality shots turning the basketball over only the fleet deflates you Applause Taylor likely to get a little more playing time here hes played very well shot clock out of four Gerard wriggling in on a tough drive for two oh and a little Flex on the way back oh well be showing off the guns thats not something Joe Girard had when he arrived in Syracuse putting in the work right now to Glens Falls New York a little seven nothing run here for the orange winners again tell hes feeling it Gerard gets it free Syracuse playing better defense this year than they did a year ago in the last year Jim behind fought the worst defensive team hes ever had in fact a lot of that has to do with Personnel when you pick the guy like Judah Mintz his athleticism and put him on the floor Music and hes talking to the Louisville bench over there yeah and hes talking to Nolan Smith of course Nolan from the area the DMV knows Judah very well Nolan stands up and smiles a little conversation between the two guys a challenge shot but he drained it 19 apiece so nice bounce back here for Syracuse yeah it has been that you think about the 90 run after the timeout so this has been sorry to cliche you but a game of runs thus far for both teams really has been shot clock of factor got a heat way downtown Lance just had to cut it loose and a shot clock violation Applause on the topic of strong B for the orange 909 to go here in the first half and well take a quick timeout 30 seconds and right back tied at 19 of course the AC dies in the middle of summer luckily were members of American Home Shield American Home Shield provides home service plans that help cover the costs on parts of more than 20 home systems and appliances wear out like our AC just did Bissell toilets been flushing for three hours straight its no biggie though my American Home Shield plan covers items no matter their rate Music I already showered today for a free quote go to ahscom thats ahscom Music out of Powerhouse Oak Hill Academy he could make some Shock he absolutely can Im still trying to figure out how he made this shot I asked for a replay to see that at a better angle and that is extremely difficult shot and of course just a little short conversation with the guy from the area Nolan Smith I think you can get away with a little convo after that shot well for the record Nolan Smith two dimension of course myself all a mums of Oak Hill Academy so theres a Brotherhood that goes a month so thats why those two guys can have that conversation among many great players including one of the Syracuse race of all time one who wears my same initials Carmelo Anthony yes indeed Music Syracuse to a national title Gerard Way Way Back and hes going to get fouled while shooting a three so Gerard who Crystal spectacular foul shooter at the line for three and a 1919 game trainer with the personal Joe 86 percent at the stripe you know one of the better foul Shooters in the history of Syracuse Music and knocks down number one we have mens basketball Saturday and matinee coming your way Oscar shibway Mr double double and Kentucky and Tuscaloosa taking a number seven Alabama coverage of the Sonic Blockbuster begins at one Eastern on ESPN and the app we talked about Judah Mintz as one of the better freshmen in the country this year youve got to look at Alabama my God B Millie AKA Brandon Miller who is playing great basketball leading all freshmen and scoring this season and looking like a high NBA lottery pick Alabama turning into a basketball school all of a sudden oh once you say that just Im just kidding about that but I mean theyve got a terrific basketball team they really do NATOs done a great job there and Im sure Nick Saban doesnt mind the basketball team rivaling the football team but he knows youre you know youre a Georgia guy yeah my Georgia Bulldogs are headed back with a national championships heavily favored by the way Music Applause Music he absolutely is but you see the difference for curry inside when theres no Jesse Edwards on the floor thats a tremendous difference when Edwards is on the bench hes the guy that protects the rim for the orange Applause mints on the spin heres Taylor straight on yes a threepointer good look for Justin Taylor The Freshman out of Charlottesville Virginia his mom made the trip carries in the stands today cheering him on she texted me earlier to make sure she I knew she was in the house after she drove well flu shes actually been hanging out in Syracuse over the break out of Charlottesville Virginia on the dribble drive and lands lost it poked out by Syracuse Bay High and disagreed there Syracuse surging back in front if theyve been surging with the threepointer Joe Girard with the easiest look hell have today foreign spots and pressure points on your mattress

that is hockey we welcome you to the ACC on ESPN and tonight from The Young Center here in downtown Louisville at Syracuse taking on the Louisville Cardinals and Syracuse forcing turnovers this has been a seasonlong problem for Kenny Payne and the Cardinals and up to nine it absolutely has been 16 and a half turnovers per game for Louisville and many of those turnovers a hunt for us thats the problem thats whats been so frustrating for Kenny Payne oftentimes youll see passes end up in the stands with really not much defensive pressure on there and thats the way that Louisville has really shot himself in the foot they played a great segment the four minutes in between the first two media timeouts and since then theyve been turned the basketball over you see the nine already Ellis with a pass off the backboard trying to get it to a teammate but another shot clock violation Syracuse done really good work on El Ellis 17 half points a game only two so far they really havent thats one of the things that the Zone can do for you you can put extra attention on one particular player and Jim behinds game plan has done just that year for Louisvilles leading scorer Cindy Curry picks up a senseless foul those are the fouls that come back to haunt you later in the game when youre in foul trouble Judah mints kind of hit the deck on that and then chatted with a fan close by who had a great seat he has one of those personalities he can light up a room they also light up an opponent yeah its a new boat the kick here by Louisville off the foot of Hunter Hatfield you know one of the things that you know the Syracuse staff has realized with Judah mints hes a underrated passer this is the first time hes really played the point guard position always wanted to have the basketball in his hands coming up through high school but now you see he is more than capable of making plays with the ball good defense there Syracuse throws it away Ellis will set it up now for the Cardinals Applause hes trying to swing it and one pass too many heres Taylor they run it Mintz will lay it in and already tonights happened several times where Louisville has made one or two passes too many been a great play by Justin Taylor there reacting in the zone coming up with the steal but more importantly pushing down transition getting the easy Buck if you do to miss Music Curry looking is James for a triple hell nail it out hes been the guy yeah well Louisville they need to get him for a look see if they can find ways to get him in action moving around that zone to find some more of those looks because hes filming it right now and man who missed all of last season with an Achilles injury bad injury Miss throwing a lot of defensive attention gets out of the double team Taylor off the front of the iron tipped up Syracuse continued to work mints down the paint will lay it in Applause right now Syracuse feeling good about things as theyve answered the Bell with their own 195 run against the car near hemo with a lot of hard work underneath there in Adobe you have to think about it Jim bam has had Jesse Edwards Benny Williams and Bell on the bench for a very long time going with his second unit Lee Hatfield kept that one alive and that leads to a foul on Syracuse to the turnover a moment ago leading to the fast break points but one of the things when youre playing The Zone with Syracuse you have to be active on the back side Justin Taylor does a great job moving over coming up with the steal but then converting it into points on the other end of the floor for judamins so Cindy Curry to the line strong in the first one foul shooting has been an issue for him 56 percent monster of a rebounding game against Florida a m balding 19 just a little peek into what hes capable of yeah I mean hes one of those guys and you talk about it he ended the season last year averaging over 23 points per game and Tim rebounds so hes a guy that is capable of doing it has had a hard time adjusting Broly to the way that Kenny Payne wants for them to play way downtown pretty silky smooth there both these teams have shot the three very well with one thing theyve done thats it and right now you seem Louisville going willing to a box at one time to deny Joe Girard Mike James not giving him any type of look Gerard gets it up there but it wont fall for him itll stay on this end at Syracuse ball with 5 13 to go in the first half and forgive me that wasnt a boxing one but it was just all out denial by Mike James just trying to keep the basketball out of Joe girards hands but Gerard working hard enough to still be able to get a shot off with great defense by James in that possession thatll go the other way an offensive foul Music so Syracuse gives it up leading by two evil with number one turnover for Louisville Syracuse has scored 17 points off of those 11 turnovers thats really whats given the orange the edge here as we near the end of this first half in bayheim of course is taking Syracuse to the Final Four final three times winning a national championship Gary going in strong left it short completely different painted area when Jesse Edwards is in the game thats the truth and hes on the other end and Curry will foul him as Edwards went for the dock that will be number two on Sydney Curry Music and so thatll be Edwards to the line hes a 71 foul shooter Gerard and mints with 19 the rest of the team was just 10 to this point thats part of the reason why when Jim behind went to the bench he kept those two guys on the floor he knows what theyre capable of not a Firepower between those two guys on the perimeter you know maybe hes done this a time or two before he kind of knows his way around the sidelines just a little bit seven years at the helm for Syracuse a remarkable career that is amazing and I am leading the charge for behind 50 Ive talked to him about it Ive talked to his wife Julie about him shes okay with it Julie is yes Julie is okay with it which means that Jim really doesnt have much choice but to be okay with probably right is he personally on defense with trying to reach 50 uh I dont think he I dont think its a goal of his it was more so my goal I brought it up to him I like it when you give other people goals you give me a lot of good ones on a regular basis thats on the line youve already accomplished so much I really dont need to give you any more goals but oh my God Jim behind when you look at the record you know the 1007 wins which I like to refer to as 1108 personally but you know I mean that would be just me but when you think about what hes been able to accomplish in this game the longevity and more so adjusting with this game for so long Taylor got a good lunch but its in and out Applause so approaching the four minute Mark here Louisville all right and a threepoint deficit for the Cardinals and then a great run about 10 minutes ago to grab the lead after a chilly start once again a block by Edwards hes had a bunch of the Merlin at some point you got to realize I cant shoot this basketball over this guy he leads the agency of blocks for a reason just squaring him up look him in the eyes is not going to be beneficial Applause next up the Johnsons when their water line broke they paid over 2 600 dollars on the flip side the Ortegas theyre homeserved customers when their sewer line broke we

four for Mike James and he was the guy that got us started from Google from Beyond The Arc and looking very confident in his shooting ability to this point three threes for him nine points overall and Louisville shooting the basketball very well from threepoint Landers allowed them to stick around in this one in the first half its not been a big deal for them this season obviously just 31 but tonight 60 percent so far thats one of the things when you play against the Syracuse Zone you have to be able to make them come out and defend you on that perimeter if they can allow the packet in youre making much more easy for them to rebound and do everything necessary on the defensive end of the floor so James pulling them out that zone quite a bit making those wings have to be accountable for him each and every time down the blue so Benny Williams at the line trainer fouled him right before the break 16 Points 11 rebounds in their last victory against Boston College he started every game this season for Coach Bay High Jims one of those coaches who sets a starting lineup and very rarely will come away from that yeah youve got to really take yourself out of starting lineup but hes

victory in the conference and Louisville looking for win number one in the ACC if Louisville you know hanging around had a strong push right after that first time out and right now Kenny Payne trying to see if they can find a way to get a quality look the difference is when you come in to prepare against the Syracuse Zone which is your scout team doing its completely different when you got to get out here against these guys in Orange uniform with their link to athleticism and of course who have been coached by it for 47 years have it down to Perfection tough to duplicate Jesse Edwards at 611 and with your scout group and then theres that rather difficult man he is such a force defensively for Jim behind small thing seeing Judah mints fight over the screen not allowing himself to be screened disrupts everything for Louisville offensive end shot clock down to one gotta get it in the air and thats going to be a violation its the third time its happened here in the first half yeah with 14 seconds on the shot clock coming out that time out and you see Judah Miss fighting over a screen its a very small detail but its something that goes a long way one of the reasons why you come up with a shot clock violation you cant get your first action itll be a blocking foul Applause coming over to guy Jesse Edwards who got the entry pass when you see well coming down oh now that one yeah thats going to be a block simply because Jalen Withers does not allow Jesse Edwards anywhere to land it has to be contact on the landing not a popular car here but the right car Applause Music wheeler is bouncing inside for Huntley Hatfield no Gerard calls to the ball in the wing try to beat everybody down there and he got beat up Withers rejected that shot Ellis underneath and got it to go Brandon Huntley Hatfield the 610 sophomore and the transfer to Tennessee for two and a great job by Louisville attacking Northern playing four on five lls with a nice pass inside through the easy finish look at the pressure Mikes team was putting on Joe Gerard just all out denying him no help responsibility Williams got an excellent opportunity there couldnt stick it in but the foul goes against the bill another go against Huntley Hatfield number one for him so Syracuse to check it in from the Baseline back to the block and Joe Gerard attacking the basket but is met by Jalen with us does a great job going vertically and then being able to block that shot Vince with a misfire on the inbounds land slicing inside got it here Music the second time weve seen that here this evening thus far we saw one from one freshman on the other end with two to miss and now the Freshman tomorrow lands anything you can got his first college start here tonight Edwards banging in close and tight d by Huntley Hatfield the clock down to six now down to three for Gerard and he will flip it out of bounds the defensive effort by the cards is fueling their offensive energy as Kamari lands is able to attack the basket go around the accs best shot blocker and find a way to get it off the glass but its really with the defensive effort course Jesse Edwards was used to doing the blocking and not getting his shot blocked so Louisville can retake the lead here and a shovel the minute 13 to go Edwards with the personal Music it has been back and forth on the Seesaw of this game Edwards with number two and those fouls are very valuable for Jesse Edwards of course Syracuse is a much better team with him on the floor but then when you have to go sit down for the remaining 113 of the first half with those two fouls things change especially for Louisville on the offensive end before attacking the rim is nowhere near the same with Edwards on the sidelines will replace him Ellis up high as we approach one minute to go in the first half on the spin Withers will kick it James back to lands for three fight for the rebound Syracuse wins it so Louisville had a chance to be in front Syracuse those missed their last seven shots drawing on the back door hell lay it in thats a nice finish by Joe Girard a beautiful pass as well recognizing that hes being face guarded so backdoor options are going to be available Applause Music lands on the attack and hell turn it over again and the turnovers have been a major issue here for the Cardinals in the first half 2014 times now that has been the Achilles heel of the Cardinals all season long and gives the orange opportunity to take some momentum into the halftime locker room free lands collect said can hit it now its tipped in by Ellis once again and Ellis with his hands in the air looking for a call with 13 and a half seconds to go well Ellis felt like that Bass Pro should have counted as though Syracuse threw the best basketball inbounds and it was another steal Smith not in agreement with that on the cut off Polo Jack heres Ellis time to get a shot in the air but Vince will commit the foul with exactly five second look at that because lets see if we can pick up the whistle but we cant pick up the whistle because the energy in this building and the crowd is so exciting you see L Ellis make the shot then you see Judah Mitchell has the basketball out of bounds loses it inbounds two L Ellis who lays it up the basket does not count however Louisville steals it gets it back and now an opportunity to get a lead here going into the halftime locker room Music Alice with two seconds on the Hatfield knocks it down got it off in time and Louisville what a Furious finish today has a onepoint lead at the break Kenny Payne has to go into locker room saying thats just the way I drew it up El Ellis put five seconds to going hes playing much Freer at this point not the responsibilities of having to be the primary ball handler in the point guard thank you for other players now he can just think score which he does very well Louisville opening up the second half of the basketball heres Ellis see if he becomes more of a scoring performer here in the second half he passed the ball really well the first half James had the hot hand for them he has it now on high Lance lets fly that wont drop theyll get a second effort though the swing for James will he stay high lands into the lane and that wont drop big fight for the rebound tough to take it away from that man Curry possessionaire will take it to the other end Cindy Currys done a great job on the offensive glass thats now his fourth offensive Rebound in this game and again even though they dont maintain possession it moves the possession arrow back to Louisville on the next tied up tied basketball so when you think about it thats it even though you dont come away with points You Come Away with something on the positive end of the floor carrying six eight out of Fort Wayne Indiana Music okay Guinea pain recognizes that the going forward Zone pressure helped his team to end that half coming out to start it over now theyre traveling immense and a lot of the turnover happened because youve got the wrong guys handling the basketball when you play against that pressure throwing it ahead Jesse Edwards Ill be on threepoint line happened to be a decision maker pushed Judah Miss in a tough spot Louisville at 212 Syracuse 95 when you think about these two schools and their amazing basketball tradition some break games between them two James pulls up thats off the back iron Gerard going down on his back and theyre gonna have to fall down travel and back over to the Cardinals you know one of the things you see OB Jessie Edwards of course the great shot blocker that he is when he goes to block a shot it exposes everyone on their back line trying to find a way to take Sydney Curry off of the boards a Brandon Hundley Hatfield if Im Louisville whenever you get the ball in the middle if you can get Edwards a challenge you should be crashing the glass Bella slept wide open for a triple and nothing but net as we mentioned earlier in the game hes taking hes take double the shots of any of his Cardinal teammates actually not shooting at that great 38 percent overall but he has to shoot a lot of shots usually he has to suit a lot of shots that he has to play a lot of minutes this is my third time here with the cards this season but he hasnt come out of the game yet and I dont expect to see him come out of this one either especially when hes lining up shots at the top of the key knocking him down and this is just you to miss getting hit by a screen unable to get out and cover Ellis with his easiest look of the curry just picked up his third foul for Louisville hes going to have to step off and you go back to the foul where he just pushes Judah back Judah Metz out of bounds earlier Gerard off balance no one comes free to bell bell started the game with a triple for Syracuse and a turnover Ellis up ahead James yes and one boy he got to the rim and a heartbeat he got to the rim the heartbeat he also recognized the camera quickly too when you think about Mike James does the job defensively gets the deflection El Alice looking ahead finds a teammate Mike James was able to finish through the contact and of course find the camera for the quick Flex Music success is picking up extra shifts to support your family now you want to be the boss success is keeping our country safe now you want to secure

Tuesday presented by Progressive from the University of Louisville campus thats a great shot Chris were at the yump center downtown crowds been outstanding talking about a basketball team that has really scuffled this season but the fans continue to petition healthy numbers and support the program they absolutely have tremendous support for this program of course you talk about one of the best college basketball programs in the history of the game and you can really appreciate the way the fans have supported this team as you mentioned only two wins this season but you wouldnt know that in this environment right now Bell thought about a three a little pullup 18footer smart play by Bell right there run off the line but going to the one dribble pullup promising young player and this Syracuse team has a lot of young talent and again this is maybe what keeps Jim beiheim around a few more years Ellas trying to follow it up cant rebound picked off by Gerard permits Mintz will get there and Duncan hes got that too over hes got that type of athleticism and Mike James went for the steal there of course gambled and when you lose that gamble you give up an easy bucket just like that its a one possession game youre seeing those two you ride in mens playing very very well together arent you they really are and a lot of it has to do with the fact that Judah Mintz takes away with you know the deficiencies are for Joe Gerard playing with Buddy bayham he had to be the primary ball handler couldnt be the scorer that is his greatest string James shot clock winding down it has several violations and its in anywhere for lands having a great first start quickly to the other side goes Edwards for two no coach is ever happy about that after a May bucket giving up a layup on the other end to the opposing team Center who was under the basket defending the shot out runs everyone down the floor by my count tonight already in the game three impossible shots have been made there

Bell already with eight came in not much of a factor offensively for Jim Bay heimel has been starting every game hes just seven points a game love watching Jesse Edwards go get the basketball his highest points thats the sign of a great rebounder Gerard cant drain that tied at 43 both teams have made the triples drive went down Ellis will fire and short with it yeah once again and thats part of the reason why Jesse Edwards averages a doubledoubles not just about the rebounds that come to him he goes and gets them to wherever they are Gerard with a couple of Misses there from way downtown hung his head a bit after that last one he was pretty open almost dribbling through everybody in a kickball with 1505 to go in again Syracuse able to get back to a tie Judah Mintz with the Finish

year in college we had US Olympic Festival there and so that was my one time playing at Poly Pavilion but never during my college career Withers turns to fire s they cant sink that I met coach wouldnt there the first time I was ever there and it was a bit of Dreamland experience you know to beat him I can imagine remember he was surrounded by about 15 UCLA cheerleaders with a giant smile on his face he was having a great time did you even see coach at that point its a pretty good point tip back to James is 43 can he hold it yes he did good job in the corner by Withers Applause shot clock down to 13 Ellis trying to penetrate slashing in and blocked by Edwards blocked it out of play with nine on the shot clock very small thing there but L Ellis as he gets to the basket recognizing that that is the accs best shot blocker he had a open man in the corner UC Jayla Withers standing right there thats one as the progression goes you kick that out to the corner allow Withers to have the easy through Ellis took a look at the clock now down to five plans will zip it here for Withers off the fake and two nice patience nice poised by Withers in the painted area the pump fake gets Edwards off his feet hes getting the easy bucket at the end of the shot clock 4543 the bill Music thats where its hands off from Mintz lost his dribble there Music Applause Music get off a shot you wont wait and around and out it goes oh the oftentimes I think the orange forget about Jesse Edwards on the interior lands too strong Syracuse crash into glass when a guy plays that hard hes a capable scorer when he you can see both numbers hes got to get the basketball I thought they had an opportunity to get him the ball in that last possession he didnt get his hands on it and 22 against Notre Dame he had 20 against Georgetown can certainly get it done this one tied up at 45 oh my God Ellis trying to get in close theyll swing for lands hands on the dribble pounding it in on the deck he got it back out for Withers the onehander got it we talked about but coming off the bench calm Jalen withersden it looks like it has to this point hes had a productive offensive game seven points for him three or six from the field but he looks like hes playing it in much calmer pace well on the Baseline bodied up by lanzer commits the foul Lamar lands with his first the cards on the glass Second Chance opportunities Kamari lands coming up with the rebound on the floor and Jalen weathers for the second time attacking the shot blocker being able to finish over the top of Jesse Evans you look at the numbers 17 Second Chance points but Louisville has been a large staple of their offense here this evening Applause and its going oneonone against Ellis and no Edwards looking at the foul as he went for the rebound Music Jesse Edwards is going to continue to attack the offensive glass Jim behind having a conversation with his freshman point guard to the mens and Im sure a lot of that is lets see if we can get the big thumb to basketball when hes working this hard on that other end of the floor lets see if we can get it in his hand some allow him to attack think of all the point guards the great point guards Jim has had at Syracuse hes had that same conversation with from time to time hes got a couple of them sitting over there beside him on the bench sure does in the corner long one around and out by with his second effort and Edwards up for another deflection winners slashing inside Edwards again staying home its free still itll go the other way thatll be a foul against

know its going to be an interesting time as weve been near future Im so chilling last night which is never expected to see that in athletics well go to the line Roosevelt wheeler getting into The Fray commits the personal and theyll be out of the timeout you see Jim behind with a design play to get the ball into the hands of Jesse Edwards right again you know and thats one of the things as a young point guard Judah Mintz will learn as time goes along when things arent going well for you as far as your team offensively its always great to have that anchor on the interior get the basketball inside let your big guy go to work because good things can happen for you he can score or he can get fouled but more importantly even if he misses long rebound I mean a short rebound doesnt get you beat back in transition Syracuse back to even in 47 Music Ellis has come alive offensively Crush scoring hes only passing it tonight very effectively might be on his way to a doubledouble and assists and points shot clock at nine news trainer backing it out shot clock down to three now on the attack off the iron great decision by JJ trainer just missed the easy layup but by pulling Edwards out of the paint area they gave him an opportunity to play oneonone and go by the Big Fellas three Edwards is fouled on the play Bell is trying to try it three he commits his first foul tonight once again trying to get the ball into the hands of Jesse Edwards as LL is going to the floor just trips up Edwards Applause not a popular call here but no harm really no foul so although there was a foul other than that Applause Edwards to the paint heres Bell blocks the shot clock its his one Bell launches and there was off the back for it so tight D there by the Cardinals and right now Jim behind looking at his team getting guys to have to understand you have to see the clock know whats going on on the floor outside of what your individual responsibilities are coming up on the 10minute mark s around the back to his Withers heres land Ellis with a jump stop trainer gets a look Music Edwards another rebound and hes been terrific on the glass and blocking shots tonight for Jim behind he really has I thought Jesse Edwards was the accs most improved player a year ago got injured late which I think knocked him out of the running for the award but he has really grown as a player during his time at Syracuse I can remember Beggin Jim Mayhem to put him on the floor when he was a freshman which wants to go got it up there almost got the shot in but hell be at the line to shoot two I mean Leslie Hatfield right on him and thats foul number two the 610 sophomore and boy here in the second half what a difference for Louisville 14 first half turnovers the ca just won here in the second half and when you consider that they havent shot the basketball as well but by not allowing Syracuse to score points off of turnovers Syracuse has 20 points off of turnovers in this game and thats considering Louisville with only one second half turnover that shows you the way theyve been able to really stay in this game Applause low scoring Affair here 47 a piece Edwards with another one on the way 9 28 to play Applause and just the parent Applause s for the corner Withers yes great balls Lose It by the card give him the basketball inside the painted area and allow your gigs to be decision makers nice decision about Brandon Hundley Hatfield to find with him Edwards rolling in the basket hell draw the foul certainly getting a lot more touches here in the second half with UC moving the basketball around once it touches the painted area Syracuse Wings collapse to try to take away any easy layups as Jesse Edwards has to go up and Guard the guard with the basketball nice decision to find Jenny with us in the corner meanwhile Withers on the underrand just committed his fourth foul to put Edwards to the line so hes on his way out of the game for a set AC Saturday both Syracuse and the bill are featured first at 3 PM we have Wake Forest taking on Louisville directly after that got the orange traveling to Charlottesville develop check out all the ACC coverage on acc Network and the ESPN apps and you and I get the weekend off partner we do not sure if we deserve it but we we do and I just learned why buy a little vacation set up there we go when you take vacation that means I get vacation tell us yes another triple 5348 but Obi another time that the ball touches the paint and then you find the shooter playing inside out and comparison to taking contested shots on the outside of the zone now the whistle here building 20 20 Familia James for his first and its one in one time for his Syracuse itll be driving to the stripe and James trying to deny Joe Gerard the basketball not giving him those easy looks that time a little over aggressive but I respect the effort from Mike James on defensive end of the floor and Gerard had a big first half for the orange and well see what lies ahead for him in the last eight and a half minutes here in the second half makes the pair so threepoint game he has 17 Bell will step out for Jim Boeheim and Justin Taylor is back on now above this so with the substitution Jim behind stops the action immediately goes to his full court pressure this is one of the areas where Syracuse has been great when theyre able to track and speed teams up over the top and too much and they will get a tournament and it works for Perfection thats it you know when this is one of the areas Ive asked Jim behan why he doesnt do it more often is Ellis heres James with a quick strike and one hell be at the line as well and once again Mike James finds the camera hes got a gift he understands when he gets it and one he knows exactly where to look and off of this missed opportunity Louisville looking to run El Ellis gets it out to James quickly whos able to finish through the contact and then of course finding the camera with the most light likes that camera oh yeah camera likes him hey when you when you get and ones its the perfect time to find the camera yes right there under the support freshman from Orlando and cant get it no threepoint play as scramble and Syracuse comes away with it Louisville by five under eight minutes left here at the Young Center Gerard for the corner draws the contact as he gets nailed smart play by Joe Girard and speaking of smart plays Inside Out basketball has helped the cars touch the paint find the shooters for three LL is knocks it down and of course a little excited about his work the way

Eastern time Speedway continues to have a spectacular season of 14 rebounds a game hes incredible on the glass he absolutely has been dead and Brandon Miller The Freshman leading freshman scorer in the country pretty much Im sure already has SEC Rookie of the Year locked up but now looking at possible SEC Player of the Year as Alabama continues to roll Gerard filed right before the break 86 percent foul shooter and a rare Miss for him very rare youre talking about a guy thats normally automatic at the free throw line Global really sharing the sugar effectively that is not necessarily been the case this season but it has been tonight to get it to Ellis who draws the double James will lay it in and boy that was right on cue it was a great cut by James recognizing the L Ellis in the double team could be in trouble and in comparison to putting his arms up and waiting for the three cutting to the basket getting the easy layin now this is nine assists in the dunk by Edwards not a quick answer I like the patience by Judah Mitch waiting for Edwards to get to the rim and theyre throwing it up with only his teammate can finish it Edwards with a doubledouble tonight for Syracuse 1010 just as you were saying theyre going to find him more on the offensive end they started to do that Music its here for James shot clock inside 10 heres Lance and a rebound tipped immense Syracuse so the ball down four freshmen going to work into the paint kind of a wild shot there Edwards with the save a scrap for that mince is in the paint you lay it in Syracuse taking the page out of Louisvilles book The Second Chance points give Jesse Edwards a lot of credit on the glass Ellis yes Applause you talk about range oh the LL do not have a deal when I show up he has to show out thats our thats our role and so when you think about it El Ellis knows that its time this is where he has to be a Difference Maker you watched him early in the game where he was being more of a facilitator now its time for him to be a scorer he knows his team needs points 16 points nine assists the last time I was here he had 30 and 10 and looking at another double double here assists his career high I think he knows youre here we talk pregame Applause Music heres the three and and in the rebounding action a foul here against Louisville holding Benny Williams with 5 53 to go thatll be trainers third number of guys now suddenly in foul trouble for Louisville and itll be Williams to shoot 73 percent fouled shooter the sophomore Applause and in and out of the first one and this has hurt the orange at the freethrow line we saw Jesse Edwards go with a couple of empty trips we saw Joe Devon actually miss a free throw and now Benny Williams puts a pair and again when youre trying to come back and make it a game at the end youve got to take advantage of those opportunities at the line lands looking for someone Terry coming up says screen with the hot hand early shot clock down to five now for Louisville Ellis its down to one hes got a heave it and nowhere near out it goes shot clock violation back over to Syracuse the new down by four but only the second turnover for the cards here in this second half and with the basketball going out of bounds it allows the cars to get back and set their defense so of course Kenny Payne never once they turn over but if you have to have a turnover thats the kind you would prefer Paynes been a tough first year but a win against Syracuse would be awfully sweet especially here on the home floor if they can pull it off these last five minutes heres Gerard oh yeah the threepointer for the senior big bucket and once again Syracuse running that ax and allowing Gerard to be a run through multiple screens and get to his sweet spot at the top of the keys youre riding with 21 to lead all scorers Miss with a tip in the South hes got Gerard out in front Gerard going in squamous blocked James got back defensively and made the play you know and Judah missed kicking the basketball ahead it was the right play but Joe Gerard trying to finish over Mike James is it going to work Joe Gerard is not a dunker and at this level you have to dunk the basketball because layups get blocked strong game under Mike James The Freshman from Orlando Music Applause Music Applause to set it up now for Jim Boeheim a onepoint game Syracuse can take the lead Williams cant hit it Syracuse went to the advantage but came up empty and a whistle off the ball with 428 left in the contest Whitney Williams for that I thought that was going to be four when Jesse Edwards they end up getting Vinnie Williams on that foul to his second 6059 first half was back and forth back and forth it was certainly a half of runs this one has been the second half nip and tucked Ellis off the inbounds he has one assist away from a doubledouble Music Applause Justin Taylor with the steps heres Gerard off the back iron James colliding there with Huntley Hatfield but Louisville has it Im okay with that teammates colliding with each other to make sure they secure that rebound Alice with a floater no Williams there on the Baseline but off him and out it goes so its going to be Carnival the orange making a run doing it behind their senior Joe Girard hes the third and hes good for three hey I met that guy were wearing the same coat to a party and I was like twins

Williams 69 sophomore for Syracuse thats not the Jersey he had on two minutes ago now watch what happens when he fumbles this one out hes really upset with himself I mean really upset I dont think Ive ever seen a player do this to his own Jersey this is Incredible Hulk thats the end of that one well most guys dont get that frustrated on the floor but I can understand that Benny Williams coming off of a doubledouble last time out only three points over three from the field in this game an important possession that he was unable to secure for his team now hes wearing the backup Jersey I doubt theyve got three of them oh the steal here by immense he comes away with it and Ducks it and Syracuse flies into the lead 6116 and an unforced error l Ellis just lost the basketball right out of his hands at the top of the key leading to the easy bucket for the orange Applause first lead in a while Lee Hatfield yes it always helps to have a guy in the middle of that zone who can play oneonone against Jesse Edwards that time Brandon housing Hatfield winning that battle approaching a threeminute Mark here at the KFC Young Center so well back it up Applause to the paint off the bank you know well he did get Ellis up in the air but Ellis refused to commit the foul Phil I believe judam is way too long he allowed now Ellis to even land before he jumped if he would have jumped into him he would have got the opportunity to get to the free throw line even if he didnt make the shot Withers is open on the wing cant stick it Gerard with the rebound took a tumble and theyre going to call the foul uh Louisvilles Mike James back to that duck though yeah just a simple easy play for Judah Mintz getting to the other in the floor with the Finish after Ellis just lost the handle on the basketball at the top of the key gave Syracuse a brief lead but the cards able to regain the one point lead Louisville with the personal to put Gerard at the line hes shooting two Applause and drops in number one and reties it at 62 what a bonus for a guy like Judah Miss who really has never played the point guard position fulltime throughout his career getting the opportunity to be coached by not only Jerry McNamara whos a national champion point guard but also Adrian Archer who was a great point guard in the South and Syracuse will both play in that system knows what Jim behind tell us a triple still goes second chance kick out for James and now Ellis on the drive fellas dribbling through heavy traffic there shot like a town James is the open shooter boy he got an excellent look on the half of a crash in the glass there under two minutes to play Syracuse by one more Second Chance opportunities for the car LS yes Applause give him credit for attacking the glass great look from Louisville on that possession unable to finish until the LL has been playing football Ellison 18 Gerard right back at him with a triple weve got two senior guards we talked about the Freshman coming in but its been two senior guards making plays for their teams and weve got an entertaining one here down the stretch 26 for Joe Gerard tonight lets bottle up a bit James will back it away one minute 10 seconds to go Hundley Hatfield heres the corner Jumper by James on the money in three pointers under a minute heck of a finish here tonight Miss on the attack held up by Ella silk him at the foul with 493 to go and Louisville ahead by one and weve got some guys stepping up making big time shots L Ellis goes to the midrange to pull up and is able to knock down the two Joe Girard on the opposite end goes for the three as Mike James gets caught up on the screen but Mike James makes up for it on the other end of the floor three ball Corner Pocket is good for the freshman Mike James showing up in a big way tonight for Louisville Applause certainly Joe Gerard has as well 26 points mints at the line Music the first one to go James the freshman 19 points came in averaging seven but a big big game against Syracuse the Cardinals are getting better their players are getting better theyre getting more comfortable and thats evident watching Mike James grow right before I meanwhile Judah Mintz has just delivered the lead to Syracuse Again by one Applause us will get the time out from Kenny Payne time on Louisville 458 to go this has been fun my friend Im glad we got a good one here tonight Syracuse the one point lead over the cars Kenny page team has fought hard Mike James has a careerhigh 19 points of course L Ellis is making plays Joe Gerard is making plays interesting 458 for possibly longer remember how the season started too for Louisville they lost three consecutive games by one point and Kenny was telling us in his office before the game some of the players were beginning to believe and they were talking about it this way like there was a dark cloud over the program something he had to address he said I basically ran out to practice and said get over that theres no such thing as that its about work ethic its about working hard overcoming mistakes all of those things here they are with a heck of a battle against Syracuse with 45 seconds to go and thats one of the things that Kenny Payne has had to teach throughout his short tenure here in Louisville is trying to teach winning attitudes and winning culture and its hard to do that when you dont win games now with two wins under their belt Louisville knows they can win a game and an opportunity to get one here well they have a very cool customer at number three L Ellis whos put on a show here in the second half hes had a bunch of big shots certainly not alone in his ability to make the shot but hes the unquestioned leader the senior he absolutely has been and he will be the guy with the ball in his hands but he doesnt have to be the one to take the shot right now when youve got Mike James shooting the ball as well as he has Jalen Withers has stepped up and made a number of big shots for his team here tonight so L Ellis will have his options but he has to be aggressive attacking the paint to see whos the best option Applause Syracuse leading 6867 and heres Ellis across midport Applause Curry set the screen Gerard on Ellis gives off for James shot clock down to 10 Ellis trying to make a move Zips it here Withers off the bay that long drop but Syracuse comes away with it and you got a foul at this point getting chances waiting for this time do they do file do files Gerard not the man they want to foul but had to there to stop the clock was 172 so itll be Girard to shoot small thing Obi Jalen Withers who misses the shot in the corner no harming dont worry about that but he has four fouls so he runs away from Joe Gerard and does it foul forcing someone else to come up and foul Joe Gerard theyre probably about three to four precious seconds go off the clock and in a one possession game which will be if jawron makes this free throw and his thats a lot of time Applause so heres Ellis down by three in a Timeout Louisville takes one with 136 to go with a threepoint Advantage trying to come into the KFC um Center and grab their third ACC victory of the young conference season Applause 9 and 5 overall Louisville just two and 12 your place and Ive already lost a bunch of very close games this season Syracuse kind of squeak one out yeah Syracuse getting better six other than last seven wins when you consider the fact that theyre playing better basketball at this point in the season now to be able to come onto the road regardless of the record of the Louisville Cardinals they have been a formidable opponent here this evening if theyre able to walk away this will be a great win for the orange who will force a much better at home than theyve been away from Syracuse this season so who takes this shot coming out of the timeout for Louisville I like what Louisville did on the last possession you put the ball in the hands of Elders but you have a lot less time to attack and then if the defense draws in you find someone on the perimeter for the three if not you try to finish at The Rim get a quick bucket and extend the game Applause so itll be Jalen winners to put it in Applause the whistle I like the foul for Syracuse at that point you still have fouls to give so each and every one of those fouls takes time off the clock and you go back to the not fouling as soon as the shot is missed by Jalen Withers and now Syracuse is able to continue to foul and run the Crossland immense with that person with 101 Applause Music still plenty of time to get off a good shot here its Ellis Gerard bodies him up and its 82 to go number three on Joe Gerard but now its going to be a oneonone but whats Jim Dahan did he did not allow Louisville to get a look at a three so basically youre gonna have to go to the free throw line make your free throws and if youre Syracuse at this point its very important to box out and again its a one and one so its not as though you get automatic Two Shots box out make sure you secure the rebound on a Miss now lets make 77 percent cool on the first one and a twopoint game and right now if youre LL is important to make Jim behind trying to get a timeout you want to make this free throw with 82 seconds you have more than enough time to be able to extend this game Kenny Payne Im sure it would tell Al Ellis to make the free throw then it allows you to set up your full court pressure see if you can get a track and possibly steal if not you foul or Syracuse to make free throws because if L Ellis makes this free throwing its a onepoint game two free throws for Syracuse doesnt beat you you still have an opportunity to come out down and be able to just hit it three to tie the game but if they miss one now you only need a two to tie it or a three to win it so right now Im sure the mindset of Kenny Payne is to go out and try to make this free throw he makes it Syracuse will do everything within their power to get the ball to number 11 Gerard with 28 points to lead everybody in scoring tonight so L Ellis will get another shot here with 82 seconds to play Applause hes had an outstanding second half and makes the ball and see this is what I love now you stop action with going with your substitution you get JJ trainer into the game full court pressure see if you can come away with a steal Applause Music ing freeze Austin Ellis with three seconds to go its free again a scramble and it goes to zeros and thats the game Syracuse pulls it out a frenetic ending 7069 thats how the game comes to an end Williams of Syracuse Victorious here tonight as they pull it out at the KFC up Center frantic is the
