just three of 20 in his last two game so Earl Grant is a second year head coach Jay to Zachary is also in that BC backcourt he is not in the starting lineup but Shin Brews in the game at Virginia Tech well see if he comes in and can contribute any minutes this afternoon Mike yeah he looked pretty good warming up Tom and you know the thing is youre going to miss his defense especially against this backcourt for in so he stayed there thats a thats a big hit for BC to absorb Ashton Langford with a basketball for the Boston College Eagles home gold and maroon traveling red for NC State thats inside and post has two you know its interesting that theyve switched the matchups and they put Greg Grant on post inside figuring if he goes out to shoot the three but he can stay with him uh you know the post will take him inside if that keeps up at post 42 percent from Beyond The Arc this out of the corner thats Joyner its perhaps good to see him at least launching away Mike early on yeah we talked about with Kevin Keats about that about the matchup and uh between Burns and post now theyre going to be spending some time this afternoon on one another Applause get post just backing his way down again who defended it well defended it well and no double team coming for NC State either letting him play man up inside Smith the jumper bounces off Matson pulls it down youve seen this uh on these noon starts a little ragged in the you know maybe the first 510 minutes of the game just trying to get into the flow of things Ashton Langford acrobatic shock he got bumped in midair and hes clutching his lower right leg so Makai Ashton Lankford who for most of this season was BCs leading scorer before Clinton post started to pour it on it just came down awkwardly and uh Burns just kind of moved his body and this the thing about DJ Burns hes not a shot blocker per se does take up a lot of space in there defensively so theres uh he looks like hes ready either for World Cup soccer or coming back for Virginia Tech as you said that the injury that he had but Chad Kelly with the game that he had in support seeing him this afternoon as well coming off the bench with 17 points at Virginia Tech the most recent victory at Boston College they are 12 and 13 as a team with Ashton Lankford from Worcester Massachusetts at the free throw line its a wicked awesome Place Mike Smith the runner saw bounce yeah hes so good hes so tough to keep in front in the half court though this NCAA State team likes to get out and run they like to get offense from their defense because both guys can break you down off the dribble fantastic win for the Eagles Mike on the road in Blacksburg at Virginia Tech on Wednesday 8276 post tries to regather it was knocked away in a whistle well we have a moment lets take a look at our Ford keys to the game with Mike jiminsky well for NC State they want to get out and run fast break points they lost it Virginia only two fast break points in the game for Boston College no turnovers take care of the ball get positive possessions so Gantt picked up the foul for NC State Ashton Lankford down the lane spins it off the backboard and the follow is good BC crashing the glass with McLaughlin he also had a big game against Virginia Tech are pretty good you know very good on the offensive boards to that 14 points against the Hokies and with six of seven from the floor in that win on Wednesday inside of 10 on the shot clock Smith slicing through that Boston College defense and uh thats just created by himself and if post came over tried to get the shot but you get that little teardrop in the lane 18 and a half points per game to Cleveland Smith the sophomore from Greenville North Carolina and then stepping on the sideline for BC out of bounds that was a lead bag Applause well heres the look and uh you see hes just comes off gets a little bit of a high brush but thats all he needs he doesnt need a lot of space to get his shoulders by the defender and get into the lane that shot over Quentin post seven footer from Amsterdam the Netherlands couldnt defend turquavion Smith thats been a problem for a lot of people this season rocking the rim with the three Smith and that was interesting that he got a switch that time had post outside I thought he was going to try to take him off the dribble but it knocks down the three 74 Main threes this season for Smith and that leads the team and hes got all their points so far Applause missed on the turnaround too strong and burns feeds it up to Smith hes got a size Advantage inside whoa whoa you settle down now GMan that was that was from the that was from the Worcester City Limits wasnt it so its turquian Smith 10 Boston College five post back and down thats a skillful move Mike yeah and its starting to come a little bit with a double team but uh much quicker that time good decisive move hes going to be able to get that shot against Gan 56 from the floor for Clinton post granted most of those shots in tight to the basket he does it at every level from the freethrow line 42 percent from Beyond The Arc theres that switch again but now theyve got a guard inside on burns DJ burns from Rock Hill South Carolina a lot of dribbling how to pick it up more cell launching a three pretty nice job by McLaughlin not letting him get into the lane forcing him to give up the ball Applause Music Applause entry post trying to get it right back to McLaughlin gave it up post for the fake it too so tough when you can face up like that and uh you know that you really put the defender in no mans land do I come up and challenge or I lay off beautiful up and under six points now post 304 from the floor just like post and Smith play uh Burns trying to join them in the Bucks score whistling his way to the rim you know I tell you I mean it would go way way old school he reminds me of five one year wow with that with his body type and hes lefthanded and that soft touch St Bonnies guy and then uh Nate Smith Hall of Famer that one ends up with the hands of Joyner Marcel sets it up and knocks it down torso has been terrific for them had a big game against his former School Virginia in a losing cause but hes been shooting 50 percent from three in his last two 18 points at Virginia for Casey morrisell and he made four threepointers on nine tries against the Cavaliers in a losing effort Gantz is really working hard on post inside trying to front him position in doing so he gives up offensive rebounding position Great Seal by post Post in the last six games has averaged over 21 points per DJ Burns calculate the angle big man and he wrong footed it too I think but still that soft touch Music Applause in Langford needs some assistance action up and down the court post has the basketball shock box down to three McLaughlin tough catch didnt get that didnt sniff out the mismatch and McLaughlin had Smith in the low post but he got the ball late that loss of Virginia on Tuesday stopped a fourgame winning streak for the pack theres a whistle and a foul called turquian Smith 10 points couple of threepointers four of five from the floor Quentin posted the other end hes got eight to lead the Eagles Music 11 lead and a lot of the offenses by turquoia Smith hes been electric here early off the dribble thing that makes him so tough Tom is that he can do that and he when hes knocking down threes almost becomes illegal in how you have to defend him Applause hes made both of his threepoint attempt so far in this game so hes up to 75 made for the season 34 percent from Beyond the arc on the year for Jacobian Smith who is closing in GMan on a thousand points in his career well interesting switch now theyre taking Quentin post out of the ball game for BC they were game they were and NC State was involving him in high pick and rolls they were switching it and he picked up his last foul and coming in Zachary for his first action this afternoon thats good to see and hes drawn the assignment of turquian Smith Burns short little jumper Baseline wow they went right through the mismatch to him in McLaughlin he did a nice job earlier on his switch but having to play him man up inside that is awfully tough Music DC with the win at Virginia Tech on Wednesday also recent wins against Clemson Louisville and at Notre Dame Music all right tried to flip it into a congested area Joyner Joyner oneman show too strong McLaughlin over the top rebound thats the way NC State wants to play turnovers and getting out on the break so this is Chaz Kelly with the basketball or did he first start of the scene in the last game Mike at Virginia Tech you know what youre an injury away from significant playing time as uh Madison missed the jump shot Kelly is a freshman who had 17 points Off the Bench hes got the ball now Zachary you go most of that game out in the after the first five minutes with that legging hurry that collision with a Hokie and that lowered Lake cruise and hes in the lineup right now NC state has the basketball and an eightpoint lead nearing the Midway part of the first half Burns just inside the freethrow line Matson the rebound you can just see BC is such an expert Team without post on the floor Id be interesting to see how long Earl Grant I know he doesnt want him to pick up that second foul early in the half though TJ Bickerstaff also in there number one to BC thats Zachary limited leaping ability doesnt stop him there were five red jerseys around him theres no way he should come up with that but that was just great fight he beat everybody off the floor twice at that protective sleeve around the lower right leg not as beating his ability to get free and get that rebound and thats DJ Burns determined to get to the class speaking of not impeding wow its really tough to impede him from getting to the rim just puts it in reverse that was a that was a really nice footwork on the Move slick moves for a guy six nine 275 pounds and a transfer from Winthrop and now Joyner steals it away ran into Burns you dont want to do that you can avoid it Marcel needed help Joyner a lot of dribbling almost knocked Away by Victor staff out of a corner knocked around Bobby ball off the rim Burns will tip it in well they kept it alive long enough and burns he just is forcing everybody underneath the basket would be interesting that its going to be its a tough matchup both ways the post is on the floor and hes getting ready to check back in bigger staff to spin challenging Burns it falls and hes going to the freethrow line so Burns at the offensive end a problem so far for Boston College with 10 points double digits and a sweet spin from big number 30 but Bickerstaff challenging him and making him pick up the foul tense in a threepoint play Bickerstaff Music it would appear that up the second thank you as well we played nine percent of the time which is one of the worst in the league or in the country or not worse I should say thats his decision yes so we probably have seen the last of burns for this half good news for State they dont have the offense behind them but they do have defensive players that can fill in and post is back in with that one foul and well see how this adds up fans of all ages enjoying the action from Connie forum here in Chestnut Hill Mass on the BC campus bigger staff is at the freethrow line yeah you know its the thing to look at that what you know coaches will do with the two personal fouls and its you know I think its a matter of trusting the person whether they can play and still be fairly aggressive and not pick up the Third catch up though and how its uh Zachary and Smith better defensive matchup for BC LJ Thomas is in there for NC State oh a difficult shot and he made it well we saw it he had a massive game against Miami in the overtime win in Raleigh Music Ernest Ross had 17 points and nine boards in that win against the caves and theyve gone consistently with the power forward in guarding Ross and watch the thing too that theyre trying to involved Clinton Ross in the pick and roll Zachary hustles it up post thats his sweet spot for the 3G straight on I gave it away Ashton Langford had it knocked away in midair Marcel was unable to save it he surprised me by Pat by giving that three up Tom thats the one weve seen in this last stretch where hes been so effective post has not attempted a three for his head coach Earl Grant second year went over from the College of Charleston had a couple of wins at the tournament in Brooklyn last season trial on Ross on the play first on Ernest Ross post 16 and a half points per game almost six and a half rebounds shoots 85 percent from the freethrow line his numbers add up G and imagine if they had him for the first 13 games of the Season he was out with a foot injury heres a look at our Fresh Market discover the best Clinton post those are the numbers against Virginia Tech and hes just been so constant plus 24 times in the last six games that you know we talked about those numbers if you add up field goal percentage threepoint percentage and the free throw percentage if its over 180 youre an elite shooter and posting right there with those numbers for numbers against Virginia Tech his second DoubleDouble of the season and he made all three so theres threepoint tries against the Hokies at a winning effort Smith of a handoff shot clock inside at 10 Smith five feet behind the line is short Applause bounces around Thomas kept it alive and preserved the possession of the state people blocked out for BC that time but nobody went after the ball to wanna set a little screen and Thomas shot over it hey now talking about uh contributions about 10 minutes a game last two only eight minutes total as he played nice impact so far Thomas is a freshman from Plant City of Florida Post backing it down hes making it look easy GMan well and its also from the right block and hes coming in and scored with his left hand that time pretty solid NC State is stunting a little bit with the double but not really committing to coming down 12 points now for Quentin post and that leads everybody Burns and Smith have 10 for NC State were inside a seven and a half minutes to go in our first half what a pass inside Smith and theyre going to score that basket so Smith was able to find Ross and you can score the basket for NC State in front by seven over the Eagles Music well on the last day of January 20th ranked Clemson came to Chestnut Hill Hunter Tyson at his regular game for the Tigers 22 points and eight rebounds but the Eagles stayed tough Makai Ashton Langford two key baskets down the stretch BC gets the upset 6254 third win in four games for the Eagles you know in time you really have to throw out all the game tape prepost play this is a completely different team and those are the only ones you should look at a big win here a chance to pick up a win again against the ranked opponent here and uh the thing for BC I mean post has been posed for theyve got to get that second and third scorer going for and for NC State you know they had him Burns is in foul trouble with two on the bench Joyner is not scored in the game yet hes got to get going its only taking two shots and missed them both our old grants team by the way Mike if you reflect back to that Clemson win against number 20 Clemson at the time they held them 20 points below their season scoring average I think they went 13 minutes without a field goal in that game um you know the one thing when you talk to coaches playing against this team physical tough those are words that pop up all the time Kevin Keats trying to get his program back to the NCAA tournament in his sixth year the head coach of the NC State Wolfpack the thing that could work in BCs favorites and stay five team fouls now you can see you can get through the bonus Eagles have not hit a three yet in this game weve seen that before against against North Carolina oh six in that game yeah but they made 12 at Virginia Tech Mike that was a season high in the winning effort Zachary tough angle well you can see guano was out he was guarding post and forced him to give it up behind the threepoint line hes a hes a little better matchup defensively inside and outside it appears Mike that our Pace has slowed just a little bit here Smith with a tough one heres the thing too when dwan is setting the screen post does not have to honor that you know its a different deal with burns out there it makes it a much better play Applause Zachary on the pass from post really nice I mean Zachary is is so good out there I mean just a steadying force runs the offense well and hes got good size what a pass by Clinton post and then he stops joyners progress and he has to send it back out to Smith to wanna set the screen Smith shot never got to the rim Madison will run it down a much better defense on Smith than these last few minutes for BC Prince Ali Bay backing down offensive foul against the Eagles now heres the thing at his size he can see over people youve got to get up and pressure that pass but thats uh thats just easy you know sometimes we make the sport too tough Tom the easy plays are usually the best ones but those kind of collaborations Mike are born out of practice and the repetitions and the chemistry between teammates and you can see it right there between those two guys yeah and and now after having played 12 games everybodys on the same page with him shot clock inside of 10 Smith bothered by Matson on the hip doesnt stop took wavy and Smith it just doesnt matter if you see running a lot of different bodies at Smith defensively but hes taking on all comments right now man he is Silky Smooth GMan Bay trying to fill the lane he went down lost with a nice defensive play this is Joyner on the dribble hes so anxious to get something in the scoring column and he will Applause jarkel Joyner was two of 14 in that five points at Virginia and he struggled the last two games but he had that last bucket for NC State well and how about this number Tom in the NC State doing everything oneonone or off the dribble 15 made field goals they only have three assists they got people doing stuff individually Music time for our CPI Security protecting the paint theres that look inside and uh talk to you know what this this team NC State doesnt have any individual in the top 15 in shot blocking but theyre the best shot blocking team in the conference spy blocks per game for NC State their second in scoring over 78 points per game and if they get to 70 Mike watch out NC State is 192 on the offensive end and strong defensively as well you know its blocked second Im sorry I said they were first but I mean this is this is how they score this is where their offense comes from steals Force turnovers blocks converting out in the open floor already six fast break points in this game and more importantly six BC turnovers 10 points off of those turns so thats uh thats a number that Boston College has to really take a look at NC State number 22 in the nation they won in their last ten you can see theyre attending to Makai Ashton langfords uniform I need that I need that stuff for some of my shirts a stain remover he will remain in the game tough customer Applause 25 games starts since 0506 gettings done looking like a very solid NCAA tournament team at nine and five in conference play coming into this afternoon Zachary an extra gear post with the tip how about Zachary and we were wondering about his participation today hes been aggressive in attacking the rim tested that Shin early GMan and he felt he was ready to go inside knocked away BC recovered defensively really really nice pass that time but no finish Applause like nobody stopped Ashen Langford Kevin keets not happy with that defensive transition first field goal of the game on the drive by Makai Ashton Langford who started at the defensive end by post and Bickerstaff and then the individual effort from number 11 to the Eagles Jersey JB is the head coach of Cleveland hes the his uncle hes the OG of that family sure yeah and uh you know just a long time NBA lifer but uh if you had that first name Kobe Bryant still just hard to believe what happened to him and how his life ended and the impact that he had and uh during that time you know I got a chance to I played against his dad actually Joe Bryant but certainly uh you know Kobe and it brought back memories too with LeBron coming the alltime leading scorer with Los Angeles and Kareem being there and that Ive played against saw Bill Russell on the back of one of those shirts and you know what that name name means around here this part of the country absolutely and hes being honored throughout the NBA this season with the number six Applause Smith has the ball and flings it into the corner he might have had a comment for that PC bench as well GMan well and he uh we talked about it looking for a shot a little bit more but thats uh spacing in you when those guys are knocking down threes almost impossible to guard four of ten as a team on threepointers for NC State they make about eight and a half per game and theyve got the ball back and the thing is I mean neither will neither one of you spend their joint are a great threepoint Shooters but theyre good enough that it really sets up their Drive just grabbed it out of midair Applause Eagles trailing by 10 closing in on three minutes to go in our first half of play so glad that youre with us Time Warner Mike javinsky are outstanding AC basketball production crew this is the first of two it context on the road and Notre Dame to follow us remember I said about finding a secondary scorer and maybe Zachary is that guy seven points three of five and I was going to say even BC is not taking advantage of burns being out of the ball game they hadnt made up much ground at all but that its a huge shift first three of the game for the Eagles by Zachary and then he commits the foul out of the 9 53 Mark in the first half for DJ Burns how about in in those first 10 minutes 107 rebounds for him so he was having an impact on the game he only had eight points at Virginia in the loss this week he had gone nine straight games in double digits and theres a doubledigit machine right there at turquavian Smith Applause just these planes so much more under control this year as two covers are down as assists are up Applause 25 times to double digits thats every game except one post inside nice roll into the basket he set a screen up high and then just went right to the front of the rim does so well Mike to position himself to those high percentage chances near the rim I mean you know what burns not out there theres a lot more space to work with in the paint area thats true deflective Kelly got a piece of it and then hung onto it most leads everybody with his 16 points this is Zachary stop and start free throws coming up Jaden Zachary the sophomore from Salem Wisconsin you know and this is the thing Tommy we talked about it I mean he was out he didnt score against Virginia Tech only played four or five minutes put into two games prior to that he was rolling offensively 13 and a half points a game you can see right there and that again it was only um you know seven minutes and hes not a hes not a huge scorer but hes got the Knack to do when his team needs it Applause well he does have that bandage on the right lower leg Mike but it hasnt bothered him much so far you know Tom I I think with that its more pain management if it gets knocked again as opposed to like an ankle a rolled ankle or a hamstring or you know something like that that really inhibits your movement he looks like its moving great out on the floor lets see hes got that protected pad inside the sleeve Applause a minute and a half to go the lead is down to six for NC State which is led by as many as 11 and thats a three from Joyner well theres the switch again that they ran that high pick a role and it was Joyner that had post on him Music close couldnt catch it out of bounds back to NC State it was a tough pass they tried to go back to him Applause trying to get back to the NCAA tournament for the wolf pack since 2018 Kevin Keiths first season took him to the postseason tournament NCAA style inside of a minute to go first half Applause joyners got a couple of threes and now hes got another one watch out for number one you know what that was terrific defense he got caught over the screen Kelly was right there and trainer just beats it with a fabulous shot 50 percent from Beyond The Arc for NC State in the first half it bounces out of bounds BC doesnt get a call heres the look I mean we talked about it it was Smith from the first hand in the first half of this half and then Joyner crossovers just bought him enough space to get the jump shot up 11 points now for Joyner double digits 21 times this season who documented his struggles in the last two games but not today against the Eagles so theyre just checking the shot clock right now theres only a two second Difference game and shot at the moment officials Chuck Jones Tom Morrissey and Greg Evans this afternoon you know you you talked about Burns in this game against Virginia you know its under double figures Virginia does as good a job doubling the post as any team in the country Applause Thompson scoring defense in the ACC no surprise there and this side watching him play in the first half we should zero in on uh on burns to see if BC tries to attack him early get that extra foul looks like post is going to get by with just that one personal three wolf back players and double digits and scoring in the first half Applause late in the shot clock and in the game clock Joyner scissor kick three bickerstadt Rises up to the board pass to Langford sends it and misses right before the horn Music 4432 and NC State goes to the locker room with the lead and Smith only needs three points for a thousand in his career for the sophomore from Greenville North Carolina Clinton post from the Netherlands Amsterdam see what kind of contributions those two players make you would imagine theyd be significant second 20 minutes largest lead of the game right now as we start the second half for NC State Tom wormy Mike chavinsky are outstanding ACC college basketball production crew and theres Burns no double team coming that time great patience and you notice were talking about he sat the last 10 minutes of the first half so NC State wanted him to get some touches get him going early here that is a veteran player as a transfer from Winthrop 116th career game trying to defend McLaughlin score of the basket number three on burns yeah that was a big big play early on they got the they got the switch right here and he just went full attack right inside and there was the it was the reach in there he didnt have to do that but here it is I mean this is this is you know hes lefthanded hes going to turn that way to the Baseline there but really sets up his shot nicely so Burns has 12 points in the game hes looking over at Kevin Keats right now hes still in the ball game Applause now the thing is that in BC with Burns staying in the game theyre going to uh you know they should attack him as much as they can so the redshirt freshman Devin McLaughlin from coming Georgia could not complete the old school threepoint play Applause theyre going to try to theyre going to try to get as much out of burns as they can on the floor right now Burns over a double team Justin Lankford pulls it down up ahead post deflected he wanted a foul didnt get it heres Marcel pass was too low to him in transition Applause Smith just be seemingly scoring a will in this game Tom I mean that time just surveyed things rising up for you know you wanted to rise up for three on the break third main three for Smith post not enough elevation wow and even NC State conceded that basket the Eagles get it back that was a dicey elevation situation GMan injected by the rim out of bounds to BC after the Miss by a league Bay theres a look and you score a thousand points in your sophomore year you know youre doing some serious work sitting right on a thousand Smith knocked around on the entry taken by gants theyre trying to get Oliva has not scored in this game as well we havent said his name a lot foreign doing this without the benefit of any free throws so far GMan I mean Nick had a few drives inside Burns lost it on the way up out of bounds and that is off of Boston College according to Tommy Morrissey who was right there for the call I kind of like this keeping Burns in there making him play disciplined basketball yeah and well we talked about it Kevin Keith is really reluctant to play you with two fouls in the first half but a little bit more room for error here with the third personal foul Burns the last couple of times hes settled for a little Fade Away shot not putting any pressure on post to defend Zachary Nifty dribble and the jumper Joyner out leaping everyone Joyner feeds it to Burns this game is dangerously close to getting out of shape for Boston College Music letting them play through it at this point 14 points for burns Ashton Lankford unable to save it right near our broadcast position in the front row now theres a look inside you can see that Smith with the little our Joiner with the little hesitationally true post over its an easy two points for burns charcoal Joyner playing it in 140th Collegiate basketball game is a transfer from Ole Miss and Cal State Bakersfield Marcel got bumped a league Bay on the foul theres just one of two on your Regional Sports Network out of the ACC well also have Virginia Tech on the road at Notre Dame Mike Bray in his final season stepping away from the program after this year Zachary the Steele and the shovel bigger staff knifing his way two and you can see and burns really just gave him that lane did not even want to come close to picking up his fourth foul if you cant if youre not in position the block just sits two points Let It Go shes got a 15point lead Five Points now for Bickerstaff Marcel holding that follow through the threepoint shot is just killing Boston College right now eight of 16 for the wolf pack BC has just one make free throws are overrated Tom yeah from a threepoint distance and Zachary has the only three midrange bicker staff and now Joyner Applause Joyner ripping the ropes for NC State Timeout on the court Applause all right I mean youre at this at this point with those theres not a whole lot you can do threes and for NC State Joyner had the last one for Coach Keats its bow time thats not a phone in your pocket its up its a lot colder a week ago and right now BC needs to snap out of it try to get back in this one after trailing by 12 at halftime to Kevin Keats into visiting pack but with that uh you know beats per NC State With the Wind looking to get uh joined that group with 10 wins at the top of the conference the only team that can get to that point still try to keep themselves very much in the conversation for a double Buy Applause college has an 85 home record serious Jeopardy right now as they turn it over and here comes Smith he lost the handle the post Justin Langford the feed the layup the tip picking and third tries and thats the BC situation in a nutshell and theres Joiner with style up and in Tom how about this half weve seen post miss a dunk and then Zachary missing easy layup right there Ashton Lankford a tough layoff he was falling away from the rim and he made it and they needed it Applause thank you Music Smith leads the way with 17 heres Burns Stutter Step Applause C had its chances at one end at the other end jar killjoyner surveys the situation hangs and scores NC State big Music our Coyote Tractor Turning Point as NC State starts to pull away in the second half its been the threepoint shot nine of 17 I thought that number might come down a bunch in the second half but theyve picked right up just putting so much pressure on Boston College through the you know defending defend and conversion BC on the other end one of five from three and only 41 from the field Applause thats right about their average for made threes in a game for NC State Mike well as you see I tell you what time you had better be able to defend guys off the dribble if youre going to guard this backcourt for NC State thats fourth in the conference of May threes per game Boston College having its struggles now heres the thing I mean defensively at some point you make choices right and uh rather than letting them get into the room you know right now Im Id almost want them to get into paint and make this a twopoint game instead of letting threes dont worry BCs attempted eight free throws NC State none Ashton Langford got his defender in the air and missed Applause up at NC State they are running to my 14 fast break points after just two in the loss at Virginia on Tuesday they lead the conference in that category well that was the season low for him and Virginia took very good care of the basketball or so with a rare Miss from behind the arc Bickerstaff wants to run Euros around more selling lays it in or you could Rush up the floor and uh with that long shot NC stayed a little slow getting back defensively in transition Gantt Burns blocked by Aston Lankford who got there and then the loose ball picked up and scored by the pack and thats a thats just a nice job by Burns of staying with the play and hes actually played very well Tom with the third personal foul and posting yet to score in six and a half minutes of this half 16 points in the first half Gat knocked it away Joyner gets it off Marcel somehow got it up on the cylinder has fouled in the process heres the look and its just great fighting around from behind Greg Gantt getting that and you know Gantt is a hes he really is a perfect story of this team Tom hes a guy who had 10 dnps on the year and 10 starts Applause Music 80 from the line more sell this season 3240 free throw number one in the game for NC State while we have a moment a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land youve got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of get going and that the first made free throw of the game for NC State as a team theyre 72 percent from the season 13th of the conference so they dont necessarily need the free throws post looking for his first points in the second half and a nice look from Kelly nice feet in the paint area I always loved bounce passes more than direct passes a lot easier theyre a lot easier to catch Kelly is a famous name here at Boston College Mike John Snooks Kelly class of 28 this is one of the honored former athletes here inside County forum hanging in the rafters Applause PC lost on the ice to Maine last night converted to the basketball court here we go Boston College has the ball back well in this uh this NC State team is used to playing over ice as well do you see hes going to the hurricanes Applause Snooks Kelly the head coach Mike back in the 30s and 40s you really cant really be your boy are we were not bad were good Music now were going to bring you back to basketball to bring you back to 2023 I mean Snooks is great but you know I want to be alltime great nicknames clearly and BC is that actually theyre theyve changed up and theyve gone Zone the last couple of possessions its got the NC State standing around a little bit Burns gets easy Rim Bender you know that both Gantt and Ross have been the beneficiary of burns passing ability because when they come big like that when they go inside he threw everybody inside in just a great pass jelly looking for space into the corner Matson catch and release went down got tangled up with Gantz and it goes to Fourth on burns see who they give it to GMan theres a lot going on there oh theyre gonna give it the game cant got it okay again the beneficiary of the pass from DJ Burns 20point lead wouldnt it be great if all uh you know theres the big three I mean thats where thats where the offense is going to come from and burns again a lot of the offense runs through him I mean we talked about Smith and his assist but Burns in the middle of that zone is playing awfully well as well now you say big three in Boston Mike well a couple of other names come to mind uh you buy I never heard of those guys 81 8486 NBA champs all right stay tuned for the fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer and well give you more detail about the second game of our doubleheader Virginia Tech and Notre Dame jumper is short from Kelly Applause he did a decent job on the offensive glass in the first half but thats gone away for them as well State keeping them off the glass NC State shooting 57 as a team Joyner got fouled on the way to the rack and again Amy you know you have to make choices and yeah you want to force him left sure but what a what a finish hes just yeah I almost looked like he surprised BC how fast he was able to get to the rim reminds me so much of Anthony Cat Barber who played at NC State so quick in every aspect thank you guys now this is going to be a major boost of confidence for charquel Joyner who had struggled in the last two games Music Applause Madsen best threepoint shooter on the BC roster first points in the game for him time for him to show up you know what the thing about State though through time is that if they win this game they get to 500 on the road which if you look at the top teams in the conference they are all 500 or better away from home its going to be a big component going down the stretch three and four in conference play away from Raleigh in PNC Arena although NC State after this game pretty favorable Home and Away going down the stretch next game for the pack Tuesday at Syracuse at the Dome seven Eastern only regular season meeting between NC State and the orange and thats Kelly puts a little English on that one off the glass well and theyve had two guys the last two possessions had not scored in this game and Kelly and Madison but a good take off the drive coming underneath Music and this is this is really if BC can grind this game down get to the freethrow line get threepoint plays the oldfashioned way Applause just an absolute career day at Virginia Tech for Chaz Kelly its only attempted now nine free throws on the season and made five couldnt finish off a threepoint play Eagles trying to Chip Away tough to do when NC State is making nine threepointers and youve only made two filed against BC looks like Matson Applause so the foul was against NC State BC has the ball and an interesting Armani Mighty out on the floor for BC with post out of the game so Marcel for NC State 14 in red and white picked up that last foul Kelly Marcel on the hip Applause Mighty got it back Mighty with the move oh we traveled just like he got the ball a little one step outside of his comfort zone and that caused the travel Applause I dont know if coach Grant saw the travel as well for Armani Mighty The Freshman from Toronto Ontario Canada 610 225 number two in Golden maroon Joyner crossed it over Matson was waiting more cell and you know what hes been quiet today I mean theyre you know with the way that Joyner and Smith have been guarding and uh Marcel has been on our streak of his own hes now in double figures too three of six on threepointers for more cell Kelly 27 on the year coming in third three of the game for the Eagles still enough time to claw back in this game Applause more celery loads for three of course not if State keeps 11 of 23 now from well Im the arc Its just tough for me especially for BC to its tough for anybody to keep Pace with that NC State made eight threes in the losing effort at Virginia on Tuesday 6350 Mighty from the elbow not high enough of the square Ashton Lankford picks it up and fires Applause Mighty got it back he hit the deck foul on the play looked like Gantt was in the vicinity GMan you like the effort I mean you know you like what hes putting out on the floor Music four on Gantt Mighty started the day four of 15 from the line three Fresh Faces in for NC State Gantt leaves with the four personal foul Smith follows him and dewana and I think you know more than anything thats thats just a function of not a lot of trips consistently for the freethrow line over the course of the year BC as a team near the bottom of the conference G man 72 percent from the strike 14 Applause Music closing into the eight Mike strominsky Batson diving for it Joyner took it back healed Duncan its better than Coco I dont think I throw a Tbone in there too yeah I dont think stux was gonna stick no I thought Id give it a shot Kelly there he is driving to the rim Nifty move Kelly hes got to be there again Burns is going to be a little reluctant right now to help out everybody lifted an open driving lane seven points for Kelly The Freshman from Houston Texas Houston home of the final four this year Michael see what sort of representation the ACC might have after sending two to the Final Four Season to go of North Carolina to the title game Timeout on the court 7 16 on the game clock comfortable 20point lead NC State Applause Music fans of all ages taking it Taking in our game this afternoon unfortunately for that young guy NBC fans its a 20point uphill climb with Joyner standing a free throw line Joyner in the game 21 points Mikey leads everybody with those 21 posttest 20 for PC you know were talking to Kevin Keats before the game time we talked about uh you know how did the team feel about its ranking and they were taking good ownership of it theyve played their way into that ranking and you know as opposed to some teams that were anointed before the season North Carolina and do finding themselves outside of the rankings Music Applause second three that hes hitting the game Applause Madison has 29 made threepointers on the season now thats the best for the Eagles and uh how about with this and you know and Joyner just uh Japan Smith has had the second half off but good news for NC State Jack Clark on the ball on the court for the first time Music in a while missed the last 10 games oh 24 points jarkel Joyner same spot not the desired result Here Comes Smith Music Applause Burns leans in and scores its just so good at getting that shot up he can protect it with his body in the left hand Zachary had it knocked away to stay at this end of the floor Applause so Jack Clark the graduate student the transfer from LaSalle had a core muscle injury Mike and that was against Clemson at home December 30th so hes been out for 10 games and that was a guy who gave them 97 rebounds uh early on in the season so that was a big gap to film and frankly Gant and Ross have done a nice job filling in for him we have 15 starts prior to today for Jack Clark and dushan mahorcich well and you know and Kevin Keith said that the you know he thought he might see some action today this lead gives him some time on the floor they just they want him to get in shape for uh the postseason the ACC tournament in the NCAA tournament yeah Im a horse is the big guy for NC State with a kneecap injury earlier in the season and hes missed 16 games left as a leading rebounder for the team with six and a half per game but has not seen action since the game against Coppin State and theres Clark bringing the bell for the back and thats not a huge part of his game either but uh a threepoint shooting contagious for the wolf pack in this game so theyre up to 13 made threes on 25 tries like thats 52 as the Eagles come back with a bucket at the other end and you can just see its deflating for BCs defense to you know theyre a lot theyre knocking down long threes and here you got a guy who hasnt played in a long time he comes out shooting well the lead was 12 at halftime for NC State Mike mentioned through 25 games this year 196 and a good chance to get their 20th win their best record Mike since as you said back in the old 506 season well and think of this too that we talked about BC without post and what they you know did prior to that but you know what Kevin Keats has done without Clark and the horse its really really fabulous its time for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina coming schedule for Coach Keats yeah I mean you know for right now I just I cant think of there arent a lot of teams that have had three in a row at home so yeah you want to be polite you want to be able to play the best against the best competition theyre going to be coming to Raleigh traveling violation they want it Wake Forest by a point 7877 one at home against Miami number 16 in the nation at the time in overtime and the Duke game Mike that was January 4th against the Blue Devils in Raleigh 8460 that led by as many as 29 in that game yeah one of the worst beatings that Ive seen that Duke team taking a long long time number 22 in the nation that looks like the definitely an upward trajectory for this squad the BC this is their seventh game this season against the ranked team two and four with wins at home against Clemson and Virginia Tech they swept the Hokies this season with a win on the road Wednesday in Blacksburg turnover Joyner Applause thats just that I mean those are the points you really have to avoid and thats 15 turnovers 24 points off those turnovers for the wolf pack 26 points for Joyner 10 of 14 from the floor and five made threes Zachary Applause its been two points versus three points break points for NC State join her on the handle so this is after a serious struggle just two of 14 against Virginia Bob came right back to Joyner Burns around Mighty who recovered I just got some good length now a pretty good recovery I thought that burns had him sealed on the spin Applause joiners over 20 points for the eighth time this season empty possession there for NC State Applause four players of double digits in this game including Joyner with his 26 heres Madsen he thought he got fouled he got hit with no whistle Music Applause himself into trouble trying to get it back to post deflected out of bounds and itll stay with the Eagles Take a timeout with 2 30 to go and Regulation and NC State in front this puts the surf and surf and turf savings at the fresh market for the vast majority of this game after building a 12point halftime lead and that guys sitting on the bench drarkel Joyner 26 points Mike just three shy of his season high of 29 yeah the backcourt has been fabulous and really for for Kevin Keith this game couldnt have turned out better not just with the win but being able to get Clark with the rebound right there pretty good minutes on the floor Music four different players to double digits told you about Joyner Burns as 18 Marcel with 13 sir quavion Smith has 17 Clark again second three Kevin keeps calling timeline hes just trying to get people in the ball game Music between a pass going to come in Music perhaps past the sophomore from Reidsville North Carolina yeah on the other side for Boston College Clinton post no longer in the game fourth straight game with 20 points or more for the Eagles Kelly Madson NC state has been dominant both ends of the floor defensively having a terrific game and then putting up looking at 90 points right here on the road they are second in the league in scoring but this is well above their season average of about 7858 Clark got it back for cell with the time and the release and another timeout he looks good but he takes that threepoint shot Mike Applause so you know thats basically all hes taken in this game eight of his nine field goal attempts from three and hes five of eight Music five made threes just one shy of his career high for made threes in a game his day is done yeah it was an afterthought getting 16 points he was the fourth option in the offense after youre starting back court and burns the ACC taking note of NC State one of three ranked teams out of the conference Thomas came up short Applause so NC State Mike is going to improve to 206 105 in conference play Applause Up and Under move from pass Ernest Ross is there too strong foulis called Applause Im an NC State deep ball Club theyve got weapons theyve got scorers speed defense all the ingredients if Tom if you add threepoint shooting to that now theyre not going to consistently go out and shoot 50 from the three but still I I mean if if thats an extra layer on it thats this is a really Dynamic offensive team theyre only real deficiency is from the freethrow line 72 percenters a team is 13th and the ACC did not need the free throw this afternoon the Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina upcoming schedule for Earl Grant and Boston College ah and thats a big game for Pitt as well to stay in that uh top four at the top of the league and its just you know its amazing Virginia number eight nobody in the conference seems to be talking about them but they just keep playing Virginia basketball and keep winning a big game against Duke today hits one four in a row as well how about uh what Jeff Capel has done there after that one and three start their team looking pretty much like a A in the NCAA tournament team Virginia Miami and the NC State team right now the ranked teams for the ACC Ross defensively rejection Applause little erratic in the closing seconds as we run up and down the court here at County Farm Applause Music anytime you can go 500 on the road in the ACC youre doing some exceptional work and thats what they will be right now yep with the win today and anytime you can come to Boston in February and have a few 50 plus degrees youre also ahead of the game as well certainly you are its always great though to make this trip back to the Commonwealth Applause CJ Pena was at the freethrow line for Boston College Applause so NC state has now won five of the last seven meetings between the teams after losing to Boston College at home a season ago the only scheduled meeting in the regular season goes to the Wolfpack 92 he took the 62 for Coach Keats Music well those are the type of uh winds you love on the road time you get this one put away early got some people uh you know especially the biggest beneficiary of this whole thing may have been Jack Clark today and getting him support time good to see him burning back up and down but uh I mean Joyner Smith you know maybe no doubt that theyre the best back court in the conference right now team points for the big man DJ Burns Joyner LED everybody with his 26 and five a threepointers the pack as a team Mike made 15 threes
