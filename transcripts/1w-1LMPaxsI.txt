underway with the Wildcats getting the opening tip A lot of new faces but some important holdovers as well including Otga Ooway Kuckys leading scorer from a year ago but an immediate turnover And thats exactly what Louisville wants to do Whenever Otega gets the ball he has to see a lot of bodies a lot of Louisville bodies Tell people what they need to know about the point guard freshman Mike El Brown Jr Mike El Brown Jr is a star He He can really handle the ball Excellent passer and a fantastic shooter And a foul at the rim on Ooway after a strong drive by Ryan Conwell One of the transfers coming into Louisville He was at Xavier a year ago They wanted to get him the ball going to his left Hes a lefthander And coming off that little wide pin by Sander Fu that allows him to turn the corner He is big He is strong and very versatile He can really shoot it too Better than 16 a game with the Musketeers last year Better than 41 from three And Pat Kelsey went into the portal Jay and brought home a whole bucket full of shooters Well Isaac McNeely who transferred in for Virginia 240 career threes 41 career led the ACC in threepoint shooting last year And Conwell the same number of made threes in his career but he shoots a lowly 40 for Mc for his career How can he look at himself in the mirror Yeah How can he talk to McNeely Kentucky a great offensive team a year ago Mark Hope feels that they are tougher and better defensively than they were last year when they went to the Sweet 16 Well one of the reasons the guy with the ball Denzel Aberdine who came in from Florida excellent defender Shot clock running down Colin Chandler whos the leading scoreer in the early going for the Cats Offensive rebound and the put back wont go for Brandon Garrison cheering And whoever gets the ball for Louisville off the glass can take it and go Conwell Yes Getting back in transition is not good enough You have to get back with the mindset to collectively stop the ball cheering Aberdine as Jay mentioned a big part of the Florida Gator National Championship team starting for the second time in three games Baseline drive for Oay for Kuckys first basket Boy Oays got such a quick first step The defense couldnt recover to get to him Brown McNeely very quick release but cant hit the corner three And a strong rebound for Mo Diabate who transferred in from Alabama Chandler for three And what a start he is off to this season Colin Chandler is a different player Outstanding athlete Had a huge dunk in one of their exhibition games But hes a different player than he was last year Remember last year he was coming off a 2year admission a year under his belt and he is looking outstanding Mike Kell Brown Jr knocks it down Now I thought that Isaac McNeely is Louisvilles best shooter but Pat Kelsey told us yesterday he goes Hey it might be might be Mike El Brown He can really stroke it All we know is theyd be out there for a while if they had a teamwide competition They are such a different looking team with the perimeter shooting than a year ago They take good shots but are conscience free Terrific shot fake by Colin Chandler who can really drill it once he gets his feet set And Brandon Garrison needs to get up off that screen Youve got to be right on Mike El Brown Jr cuz hes going to pull the trigger Chandler the cut and the kick and a corner three will rattle out for Diabach who can shoot that Didnt shoot all that many of them with Alabama last year but made 12 of the 26 Conwell wide open on the wing for his second three of the night cheering Just a great fade screen by Sandanda Fu that opened it up for Conwell This is an excellent fade screen shooting team cheering Louisville 2 and 0 and theyve been in triple digits in each of their first two games Aberdine with the response for the Wildats And look how quickly even after a made bucket that Louisvilles getting the ball up the floor And thats part of the game plan right Push it as much as you can Put as much pressure on this Kentucky defense as you can Brown Not this time Tipped around And Aberdine down with it for Kentucky The Wildats dont mind pushing it up the floor either Oay gets tied up and it will be a held ball and the possession arrow will give it back to the Cardinals Ryan Conwell did not go in to swipe at the ball He went after it with both hands That was like a defensive back almost trying to punch it out of your hands Watch He goes with two hands and just grabs it Look at the strength to tie that ball up because Ortega always is strong himself Multiple substitutions Jay for both coaches Right now each of these teams appears to be comfortably 10 deep Theres Jaylen Low the transfer from Pit You can see hes got that right shoulder wrapped up Missed the first game of the year Came back in the last one Its his nonshooting shoulder How about Mike Brown doing it from deep and then getting into the paint Boy great screen up top but that body balance is just excellent a little bit stronger than he looks too and finished with the left hand cheering Dangerous crosscourt pass low right back to Ooway and the three rattles out and over the back or no its going against Louisville Itll be Javon Hadley of the Cardinals called for the foul An intense energetic start to this long time until the rivalry renewed Jay in 1983 And everyone is better for it This this rivalry should be mandated by law They should play every year no matter what cheering Low Beautiful feed And what a baseline cut by Diamont Well there you can see Jaylen Low and his feel for pick and roll He did a great job They were trying to force him to his weak hand but he wouldnt allow it Got to his left and just drew the defense just beautifully done Theres a block by Ooway but the ball bounces back to Louisville Javon Hadley Ali Khalifa and theres the guy you cant leave open if youre Kentucky is Isaac McNeely The Virginia transfer knocks it down and Khalifa such a good passer Up top again another assist for Low This time its the freshman of Malachi Marino from Georgetown Kentucky Boy Jaylen Low comes into the game and all of a sudden two lob dunks for Kentucky Khalifa for three Too strong and the rebound down to Diamate who does everything Alabama folks know that cheering Now numbers for Louisville Twoonone McNeely Hadley and a goalending pull on Marino Well thats an old school break fast break The ball never touched the floor Jaylen Low is going to really change this team with his playmaking ability Lefthander throws it up Gets two lob dunks in a row for Kentucky transferred from Pit where he was third team allac last season and Mark Pope feels with some changes in his shot selection that his efficiency is going to go way up as a wildat Yeah he was a guy Mark Popes eyes lit up when we asked him today Is he a guy you really targeted in the portal And these two point guards Brown for Louisville and Low for Kentucky have a chance to put up big time assist numbers this year Heres Aberdine What a find he was As he lays it in he was not a starter for Florida but thats only because they had the best back court in the nation last year Hed have been a starter for just about any other team in the country No question Bring such tenacity on the defensive end Theres nobody he cant guard Boy Kentucky running that action out of the middle of the floor thats so difficult to guard Kobe Rogers number 11 into the game now for Louisville A strong drive but unable to finish is Adrien Woolly a transfer from Kennesaw State Another guy who can really shoot it And a foul underneath on Rogers Looks like he had two hands on Marino And that basically is an automatic whistle He got caught on Marino on a switch And just as the ball went up he just kind of went in to Marinos body I dont Im not sure Marinos going to make that catch for a score but the foul bailed him out More changes Pat Kelsey just swapped out four players Mark Pope a couple again Both teams very deep as McNeely comes up with a steal Excellent help side Brown a battle on the glass and Aberdine wins it Boy Kentucky has really improved its personnel defensively This is a really good defensive team Yeah Louisville has improved its shooting and Kentucky has improved its physicality and defense low Another great find and thats Andrea Yelovich a sophomore from Croatia with a jam They jumped him with a double and he just passed it right out for an easy bucket What great vision boy Brown not shy Line drive three No good Patient Prior into the game Tips it back out Got a switch Prior trying to back down low Kicks it Brown drives it and Conwell has to get it off And now it belongs to Kentucky Yelovich takes a bump and finishes And the Cats have the lead And that was a basket scored off great defense Forced a late shot in the clock long rebound They turned it into an easy basket Conwell around and out and Louisville has cooled off after a hot start Boy this has been a track meet and I dont think its going to end anytime soon Jasper Johnson a freshman from Lexington The lefty too strong on the three and Prior down with the board for the Cardinals Jasper Johnson is a talented scorer and clearly has no fear Dad and uncle both played football at UK Smenda through with the flush to put the Cards back on top Mike El Brown Jr doesnt project as a freshman does Hes great great poise with the ball and Fu an older player played four years in the German professional league as now Low who is having an unbelievable start here tonight has a chance for a fourpoint play Just came off a little pin down screen and he came off firing turning over that right shoulder Jaylen Low was a scorer at pit Now hes game nine of 14 from the field six assists on the game overall for the Wildcats And again coming off the bench tonight but that is because of that right shoulder injury Again its his nonshooting hand Theres no question And maybe as soon as next game Jay hes the starting point guard for this Kentucky team I would think so but Im not sure it really matters honestly I This team with the the minutes they play cheering probably projects a little bit like Mark Popes 1996 national championship team I mean nobody knew how many minutes anybody played on that team Its just they were really good and they won the title Yeah Pope talked about that when he looks at box scores after the game in terms of point distribution It has that 1996 feel for him as Sander Fu lays it in for Louisville Boy how about that pass by Mike El Brown Jr Draws a double Little pocket pass for an easy bucket for Fu Thats just beautiful Nearly a steal for Woolly Low turns it over Its Conwell and he draws the foul after Kuckys fifth turnover already in this game Louisville doing a great job in the gaps Jaylen Lows first turnover of the game to go with those three assists But watch just coming off this little handoff draws two defenders and then just puts that little pocket pass right on the money to Sandrew Heres Conwell who is off to a big start Fourth school in four years for Conwell South Florida Indiana State Xavier and now here in Louisville played for Shawn Miller at Xavier last year before Miller took the job at Texas So he has a very good understanding of the packline defense which Louisville plays Three preseason first team all ACC cheering The Cardinals picked second in the league behind only Duke and they finished tied for second with Clemson last year Pat Kelsey in his first year as the head coach here just had a great season totally turned around the program And now as they say Jay theyve moved the goal post Expectations are skyhigh here in Louisville Woolly just got caught on a switch Hes got Garrison down low Low the drive blocked by Fu What a great job of moving his feet cheering Woolly And another goalending call Count the basket Woolly got to the basket just so quickly Transfer from Kennesaw State But after this switch Low thinks hes going to take on Fu F might have fouled him there but was able to wipe that away And just a really strong drive to get past two Kentucky defenders and get all the way to the 10 Just so many more offensive weapons for the Cardinals Last year they didnt have this many weapons Plus as you well remember they played with a lot of injuries There were games where they maybe only had like seven players that Pat Kelie could throw out there Both of these coaches can go 10 11 deep right now and they can shoot it from so many positions that really opens up the floor You have to pick them up beyond the threepoint line Low has gone to the bench Aberdine at the point now Cany Roots forces him to put the brakes on Just fabulous helpside defense by Roots Diabate too strong off the glass cheering So so far Louisvilles been the more physical team Chandler got a piece of that and here come the Cats Good transition defense there by the Cardinals Aberdine wide right long rebound to Fu Brown YES WHAT A talent he is And great patience by Conwell cheering and applause Let everything set up then found Mike El Brown Jr in the corner who was ready to fire when he caught it And all of a sudden its a 90 run Aberdine air ball cheering Brown again cheering And well short on this attempt Ball still loose And finally its tied up Coming up next another great game We will send you to Spokane Itll be number 23raton and number 19 Gonzaga A great early season test for both Graham coming off a game 191 for the Zags against Oklahoma And Greatton led by Owen Freeman a transfer from Iowa who had 19 points in 19 minutes off the bench in their season opening win over South Dakota Owen Freeman stepping into a difficult challenge of trying to replace Ryan Pulkrunner one of the alltime greats at Kraton Kentucky needs a bucket Good cut by Ooway and a foul on Conway Looked like Conwell was saying Hey he was falling He was stumbling without my help But he does get a whistle He did help him a little bit He grabbed him Theres no question that was a foul But a really good cut by OA to help out Diabate when he needed it 15 foul on the Cardinals The Wildcats have committed just two Boy Diabate is going to be such a nice piece for Mark Pope this year He went 30 with Alabama against Kentucky last year Nice rebound by McNeely So many of these shots are under pressure for Kentucky Conwell stopped by Oay whos a terrific defender Khalifa an excellent passer with the ball There it is cheering Everything but the finish But as you were saying that is one of the things Ali Khalifa really brings to this team Well hes not quite Nicola Joic but he does pass it extraordinarily well And his teammates know it If you make a great cut little step and go for Ryan Conwell And Khalifa right on the button to pick up the foul Khalifa played for Khalifa transferred in from BYU sat out last year after knee surgery So this is his first year as an active player here at Louisville And again theyve got just such different looks with the big guys that Pat Kelsey can throw out there between Fu and Khifa Both coaches have a lot of lineup flexibility Jaylen Low back in there to try to ignite the Kentucky offense Chandler was looking to do some damage Khalifa having none of it Rogers and the foul going against Ooway of Kentucky cheering The pressure is being applied by Louisville in transition Every stop they are running to the other end Mark Pope is not going to like that Like Pat Kelsey Pope is in his second year on the job and they had a great year last year as well Had eight wins over top 15 teams tying a D1 record went to the sweet 16 Khalifa lays it in and this is now a 130 run for Louisville Boy really good execution of the out of bounds underneath Khalifa set a screen and then he was wide open The three wont go for Diabate The catch cant buy one right now Conwell and Chandler down with a rebound away couple of years with Oklahoma and now in his second year with Kentucky as Khalifa stepped out to hedge but hes called for the block Now watch Khalifa sets a screen here and immediately seals off Mo Diabate which is not easy but came right back to the ball When you set a screen thats often times when youre going to be open And he knew it By far the earliest this game has ever taken place Generally over the years historically it had kind of been as you well know Jay leading up to Christmas once before in late November Never has it been this early Never has it been before the Louisville Kentucky football game People in these parts talking about that all the time But for college basketball fans around the country what a great early season treat this is Well Jaylen Low on that last play did a really good job of using a shot fake and thats what I think Kentucky needs to be more mindful of Louisvilles really jumping into him A shot fake can be really effective Kentucky Sunday afternoon well have two great womens basketball matchups for you 10th ranked NC State host number 17 TCU at 1 Eastern on ESPN And then on ESPN 2 number 22 Louisville taking on Clemson Both games are also available on the allnew ESPN app Brown with the ball Top 10 recruit projected as a lottery pick One and done kind of guy Almost 30 points per game last year as a high school senior and hes just as good at distributing Behind the back pass to Khalifa And look at the bounce pass into Codwell It doesnt get any prettier than that Boy its one thing to make a great cut but when you have a big guy like Ali Khalifa that can deliver a beautiful pass Thats just fabulous basketball played by Louisville on that possession Now Chandler with a back door cut and the weak side follow by Yelovic Boy look at Louisville push the ball up the court First field goal for Kentucky in better than five minutes Little stop and go Turn around by Brown Hes got it all right now Boy how much game does Mike El Brown Jr have getting after it on defense as well Low gets free and that is going against Louisville Conway Boy Alli Khalifa just does a great job almost with that handoff used him his body as a screen and then hit Conwell and just beautiful pivot and turnaround jumper over Marino Khalifa sits the foul on Conwell his second He sits and freshman Malachi Marino is at the line Mr Basketball in the state of Kentucky a year ago a McDonalds allAmerican as well a guy who had 18 points and 10 rebounds in Kuckys win over Valareerezo four days ago Yeah hes a leading rebounder right now for Kentucky Hes developing his offense but a terrific pick and roll roller Can get all the way to the rim You can lob it to him Hes shown a lot of potential early on in this season Had only made three of 10 free throws in the first two games but made both of those Well hes got a good stroke Padley got a strength advantage on low but then kicks it out Woolly hits the three Boy that was beautiful Just tracked him down They call those Barkleys I dont know why cheering Chandler misses the corner three A doubledigit lead and the ball right now for the Cardinals Five and a half to go first half Hadley with the left How did he corral that ball Well it looked like he was losing it the whole way And a timeout for Mark Pope all we dont need to worry too much about what KYs doing We need to be great at our system And he talked about transition rebounding physicality and toughness being a warrior in the gaps And theyve tilted the floor in their favor Seems like theyre going downhill Kelsey the ACC coach of the year a season ago One of the great yeartoyear turnarounds for a program in his first year on the job O Marino keeps it alive but its wrapped up by Hadley ahead to Brown Two more cheering This has been a clinic by Louisville in the first half Low left it short on the front of the rim and back come the Cardinals again Brown You betcha Michael Brown Jr absolutely dominating this game Aberdine with a tip in for Kentucky and grimacing on his way back down the floor on defense catching up to McNeely Woolly left alone and the Wildats catch a break there Hes a good shooter Well its surprising to see Louisville miss Its been like a video game for them in the first half Marino with McNeely on him Lays it in And now Brown will slow it down just a bit Hes got 15 points and three assists already And Pat Kelsey will use a timeout cheering Oh Mike El Brown Jr He has been absolutely spectacular in this game What a freshman class it looks like it is around the country this year And Brown is a big big part of that Not just a shooter not just a passer He can drive and get to the rim take a bump as well Theres a guy who knows a little bit about hooping for Louisville Donovan Mitchell in the house Couple of great years here for Louisville Now a sixtime allstar at the NBA level The Cavs have a night off And is he having fun The 13th pick of the 2017 NBA draft Played two years here at Louisville Only averaged about seven points his first year playing under Rick Patino and just exploded his second year and we know the kind of NBA player he is Hes a a superstar Brown was the most outstanding player at the FEA 19 and under World Championship in Switzerland uh this past summer Im sorry He was the leading scorer for Team USA AJ Deansa whos now at BYU another stellar player from the freshman class He was the most outstanding player Could have been Deansa could have been Brown But Brown even on that level playing against some of the best 18 19 year olds in the world Shawn was great And boy are Louisville fans thrilled to watch him Likely only have for one year but he is going to be an incredibly impactful player here for Pack Helium This is the deepest freshman class of of truly outstanding talents that Ive seen in my 31 years at ESPN That doesnt mean that the players at the top are the best youve ever seen Theyre spectacular But the depth of great freshman I I think is unprecedented Those are the top five in terms of incoming rankings this year The SC next top 100 And how deep is this class Mike El Brown Jr is not on that graphic but obviously deserves mention with any of those guys with the kind of start hes off to But boy you are right They are special and there are a lot of them Thats the first Cardinal turnover of the game Chandler with a nice look and a three for Otega Ooway to get it down to 12 And one of the first clean looks that Otga Ooways had in this game and not surprisingly it came off a turnover a way put his name into the NBA draft then withdrew it And one of the things he was told he needed to work on was the threepoint shot Take more of them make more of them So it wouldnt be a surprise to see that be a bigger focus for him in his senior year Well he can make threes Hes got a little bit of a windup in that shot I wouldnt call it a hitch but it takes him a little while to get it off But one thing with him you cannot allow straight line drives and you have got to make him play in a crowd Brown got caught in the air Oay anticipated it picked it off and lays it in cheering Well thats where Ooway is so tough where he has an advantage Just lowered that shoulder and shot Isaac McNeely back into the stansion Truly outstanding at both ends of the floor Otga Oay and hes got it down to 10 McNeely misses the three and Oay the rebound cheering Aberdeene with A DEEP ONE GOT IT And its a very quick 80 run for Kentucky Boy this has been a game of runs So how is Louisville going to respond by giving it to Brown letting him create and he draws the foul Thats his third Kentucky ratcheting up the defense getting a steal off Mike Brown getting caught in the air And then Denzel Aberdine I dont remember him pulling the trigger on shots like this last year at Florida but hes playing without fear right now boy And they cut 15 down to seven in less than a minute Although now Brown is at the line Has Brown even broken a sweat Doesnt look like it The foul was on Colin Chandler Its his third Hes pleading his case with Ron Groover to no avail Chandler will sit and Jaylen Low returns for Kentucky did come on very nicely at the end of the season and Mark Pope telling us this morning what a big jump he made over the summer and he is going to be a very big part of this Kentucky team this year This is a really important last two minutes of this first half Can Louisville stretch this lead out or can Kentucky get it down to a possession or two Low turns the corner Nice find and a chance for three Great patience and a shot fake down low by Diabate Mo Diabate transferred in from Alabama there in that dunker spot along the baseline but effectively using a shot fake We talked about that earlier Shot fake gets Hadley in the air He couldnt do anything but foul but couldnt stop Mo Diabate from finishing the play Another guy they got in the portal is we mentioned Alabama So that means he played in an Elite 8 last year a final four two years ago Aberdine won a national championship last year So Jay Mark Pope has brought in players with a lot of great postseason experience Well I think if you took a poll of Kentucky players from last year and said Whos the player you least like playing against They would have voted Mo Diabate And now theyve got him McNeely good fake Weak side follow goes for Khalifa and all shut up set up by the shot fake You got to come over from the weak side that opens up the offensive glass if McNeely misses it cheering Oay trying to shake Conwell cant do it cheering But good defense by Conwell He really fought through those right over the top of that screen then got underneath as well Hadley switches on to Aberdine Aberdeene from 17 cant hit it and its down to Hadley and a wise decision Did not have the numbers Another great feed but a block by Oay Well that saved the bucket What a great cut And then he has it knocked away And back come the Cards In to end they go in and out for Brown And its down to Kentucky What action Low penetrates and kicks Aberdine for three And they got it down to five cheering And now Louisville can hold for the final shot of the half Is this any fun Im exhausted Want to leave yourself a little bit of time for an offensive board Brown the drive scoops it up and in What a first half What a great play call to end that first half Just the half So they are down seven with the Cardinals getting the first possession of the second half cheering Brown with 20 the high score They move it around to the perimeter looking for a good look Hadley out to McNeely Conwell got him going early in the first half cheering Conwell for three Yes Boy a beautiful twoman game Hadley had Chandler on him in the post Thats a mismatch but especially with Chandler with three fouls and a terrific pass out Boy Louisville doesnt catch the ball ready to shoot They catch it to shoot and make you take it away from them The Cardinals now 8 for 21 from threepoint range Aberdine absorbs a little contact and knocks it down Hes going to have a big big year in Lexington Well he played great for Florida when he started Whenever there was an opportunity for him to start he really picked his game up averaged 144 points per game in five starts last year McNeely open and that is the one guy you cant leave open if youre Kentucky Well Kentucky getting caught on switches Chandler wound up on Fu and he needed some help And when that help came off you leave a corner shooter that shoots 42 overall cheering Oay with seven in the first half Did turn it over four times though misses the three That was a settle Now a steal This will not be a settle The slam for Ooway Boy one of the few turnovers for Louisville and turns into a turnover for a touchdown Ooway might be as good as anybody in the country at doing that Getting a pick six the other way F rolling to the basket to lay it in But Mike El Brown is having fun out there and Kentucky needs to do a better job of getting pressure on him so its not quite so fun The first sellout here for the Young Center in 6 years Better than 22000 are here The mass majority of them obviously wearing a red here tonight and theyre having fun as well cheering Aberdine tried to draw the contact Comes up empty Used the shot fake Hadley did a really nice job of not fouling there Conwell with a transition three and the foul is on Hadley of Louisville The crowd thought it was going to be on Diamate who looked like he extended the right arm Pat Kelsey cant believe it Well the foul was before the push off So you watch Hadley just grabbing right here Hes got his arms grab wrapped around him and then he got pushed off Number three on Hadley but at least for the moment he will stay These are two competitive physical guys Hadley and Diabate cheering And Diabate wins that battle Boy last year when Dioate played 20 minutes or more he averaged 13 and 10 in just under two blocks cheering Garrison thought he had it cleaned but hes called for the foul Garrison just his first Sander Fu a junior from Germany He has really good feet and an excellent hedge defender Hell shoot 22 years of age four years in Germanys top professional league classified as a junior Seeing more and more of this players coming over from Europe after having played in professional leagues but still gaining eligibility Speaking of professionals Wednesday stared ESPN double header has the Magic taking on the Knicks at 7 Eastern And then how about the late game the Lakers and the Thunder at 930 Eastern time Ernie Kenny Charles and Shaq tip off our coverage at 600 Eastern time Theres a guy with a vested interest Andy Ames is one of many NBA executives in the house here tonight watching the Cats and the Cards Former Celtic and former Toronto Blue Jays Thats right Well done by you cheering Nowhere to go for Diabate cheering but on him offensive He just didnt have a lane Crew did a really good job of just being there in the gap cheering So Louisville with the ball and an 11point lead and another Kentucky foul This time its Aberdine Well as the game gets more physical and its going to keep getting more physical you have the opportunity on drives to draw those fouls These fouls are starting to pile up a little bit for Kentucky Brown to Fru and another three Itll be Hadley That is Louisvilles 10th main three of the night Boy Louisvilles big guys are good passers Oay fouled on the drive number 14 Thats his first The Louisville guards are not at all afraid to give that ball up in the middle of the floor on a short roll to their big guys Sandanda Fu making a really good decision to get it to Hadley And zero hesitation cheering FUs now got three assists Khalifa has got two And I think one or two more of Khalifas passes led to fouls and free throws Youre right Both big guys have been a big part of this offense and Fu gives you a big guy that can move his feet and he can switch off onto a guard You havent seen much of that in this game but there are times when hes in the game that Louisville could switch one through five Makes them more versatile defensively Mark Pope just swapped out two of his big guys as he brings Malachi Marino back in andrea Yelovich who quietly in limited minutes in the first half went three for three six points Well Yelovich knows how to play off the bottom of the rim And now Brown is caught behind the play Its five on four Oay left the floater short Got it back Johnson misses the three And here come the Cardinals And now they have numbers Woolly blocked Boy great end to end action in this one Itll stay at this end of the floor Boy Louisville had or excuse me Kentucky had numbers after Mike El Brown went down to the floor and came away with nothing And a nice play by Jaylen Low That saved a basket Nearly four minutes in Louisville has added five points to its lead from halftime Up by 12 Looked like that ball might have gone off Louisville Yeah theyre going to theyre going to look at it You can challenge these now I thought it went off Louisville So the new rule or one of the new rules this year out of bounds plays always they can only be looked at out of bounds So out ofbounds plays is one of the things that coaches can challenge and in fact its the only way for the officials to go look at an out of bounds play It has to be initiated by a coachs challenge The idea Jay obviously is to reduce the number of reviews and speed up the game And now is strengthening is better or looks to be better than it has been the last couple of years Oh I think its way better than it was last year I mean well get a great barometer in the ACC SEC challenge Of course a Louisville win here in this game would be a big one for the ACC The SEC the powerhouse in the country Last year 14 out of 16 teams going to the NCAA tournament Woolly behind the screen knocks down another three Louisville now with 11 made threes on the night Just really good action Conwell curling right off of Khalifa Youre worried about him getting the pass And then Willie just steps right behind and knocks down the three Low slips as he turns the corner Yelovich finds Jasper Johnson Way too strong on the three Thats one where you shot fake and drive Weve talked about the shot fake but that was a challenge three by Jasper Johnson In a game that is this electric with everyone flying all over the place a shot fake can be incredibly effective as an offensive weapon Johnson a freshman from Lexington a top 20 recruit and a teammate of Mike El Brown Jrs on team USA at the FIVA U19 Yellovich doing a good job to stay in front of Brown Conwell cant get away from Owe Khalifa forced to put it up and gets the offensive rebound and Brown is down Mike El Brown Jr is down behind the play and grabbing his right leg cheering cheering And maybe you hope maybe this is just a cramp as he is up on his feet He is limping but at least he is walking off the court under his own power A very good sign Long rebound and Khalifa shoots it right back out to Brown Yeah it looks like it may may be a a cramp Its hard to tell but there was zero contact Yeah he might have been feeling it even before he got the ball back So hopefully it is the best case scenario cheering and some pretty good circumstantial evidence over there that it is indeed a crank So thats good news Ooway tipped away by Khalifa Gathered by Conwell and Marino down with a rebound for Kentucky Low The look ahead to Oway He cant finish it but he did get fouled and will shoot a pair Boy what a turnaround I thought Conwell was going to go right into Jasper Johnson and draw contact Instead he tried to avoid it Wound up hitting the deck himself and couldnt finish the play And that led to a run out for Kentucky And thatll send Ooway who has been was voted as the preseason SEC player of the year Thatll send him to the line for a couple Well heres our ACC Network Friday night mens basketball double header Itll be fourth ranked Duke hosting the Sycamores of Indiana State at 7 Eastern and then number 18 North Carolina and NC Central Both games also available on the allnew ESPN app Carolina with the high Jay of beating Kansas and then the low of the Seth Trimble injury suffering a fractured left forearm undergoing surgery and clearly will be out several weeks We dont know exactly how long but uh may not return until conference play Yeah what a huge blow for North Carolina Seth Trimble is the Tarheelss best individual defender and hes really the engine in my view of their transition game and Carolina was fantastic against Kansas in the Dean Dome That was a great win for the Tar Hills Rogers to inbound for Louisville A 14point lead Theyve led by as many as 18 Kentucky got it down to seven at halftime McNeely and Louisville now 12 for 29 from threepoint range When Conwell was trying to back down his defender that was a great job by McNeely to cut behind and make himself available Aberdine with the answer and hes got 18 to lead the Cats Hes been the one keeping Kentucky in this one Isaac McNeely is a guy of whom Pat Kelsey said I used to lie awake at night worried about how to guard him when McNeely last year was with Virginia Kelsey coaching Louisville So instead of keeping him up at night you go get him in the portal and make him one of yours And a really good screen by Javon Hadley to give him that little fade right behind the play Aberdine switches on to Hadley Marino comes over to help Rogers gets a piece of the paint scoops it up and in Boy a fabulous shot fake and drive by Rogers The 63 red shirt senior from Cincinnati who played under coach Kelsey at Charleston sat out last year recovering from an injury Conwell and hes fouled cheering Boy hes done a nice job not only being aggressive but getting into bodies and getting into the paint He got into the paint and played off two feet Instead of just going off one and trying to throw up some somewhat of a wild shot he played off two feet and thats what drew him that foul to number three on Diabonte will send Conwell to the line for a couple You know on any given night Pat Kelsey may have one of his shooters whos cold but hes got another guy and another guy and another guy he can turn to to try to find shooting This can be an elite shooting team and theyre so good off fade screens but Ive been more impressed with their defense Theyve been in gaps Louisvilles been the aggressor on both ends of the floor throughout this game And Conwell may be bleeding so hell get a little attention cheering Boy how fun is it for folks in this town which is a basketball mad city to have this program back where were accustomed to seeing it be and how quickly the turnaround came under Pat Kelsey Like both these coaches Mark Pope and Pat Kelsey are fantastically emotional and positive and they both injected this positivity music into their programs and this belief and youre seeing this belief realized upon tonight for Louisville But theres still a long way to go and the Cardinals have now matched their largest lead of the night at 18 Conwell makes the free throw Are they going to take him out or just work on it again Theyre going to take him out and bring Woolly into the game Adrian Woolly back in for the cards replacing Carlin Now Louisville coming with fullcourt pressure and they got it And off the rim just a little bit short on the reverse by Rogers It will be Kentucky ball The crowd is asking for Pat Kelsey to challenge and hes going to earlier Mark Pope challenged It did not get overturned So they lose a timeout lose a challenge And now Pat Kelsey will try one back in for the Cards Mike I think theyre going to win this one I think that was off the right hand of Chandler It hit Diabates leg first and then Chandlers hand Out of bounds ball is Kentucky ball Louisvilles taking a timeout to challenge the play Yeah definitely hit Chandlers hand unless it brushed the leg of Rogers but hard to see that But again the call on the court matters The call is Kentucky ball So do they feel they have conclusive evidence to overturn it Its conclusive I think thats conclusive If thats not then why bother challenging anything Didnt look like it hit Rogers The spin on the ball didnt change or anything So they might win this one What a better system than we used to have when every time the ball went out of bounds the last two minutes youre over there looking right So Mark Pope cant challenge anything the rest of the way If Pat Kelsey wins this one he will retain one challenge but its not infinite After review the call will be reversed Out of bounds to Louisville Louisville will get their time out back and have one challenge remaining So the Cardinals get the timeout back and still have the challenge because they were right Fingertip right there Brown looks okay He is back in the game Its going to be him inbounding So clearly it was a a cramp They got him hydrated and good to see him back on the floor cheering The pull up And he is fouled by Garrison and will be heading to the free throw line Boy after coming back in the game with cramps he doesnt even hesitate 16 music And how about 16 fouls on Kentucky in 7 minutes and 36 seconds here in the second half And what that means is that Louisville has to continue to be strong in driving the ball put Kentucky in a position to foul The way he is flexing his leg hes probably still feeling it a little bit Its not like it has completely gone away but obviously he feels good enough to get back in there and his first two points of the second half Hes got 22 on the night cheering and it is a scene right now here at the Yson Well Hadleys doing a great job on Otega wouldnt let him catch it cheering Oay got Hadley in the air but Hadley recovers cheering Right now Louisvilles helpside defense has been really really good Theyre in gaps after that shot fake Mike El Brown comes over Hes right there And just that just being there slowed a way down so that Hadley could recover and block that shot cheering And it tells you how good their defense has been Theyre on a pace to score well over a 100 points And its their defense that has impressed you most of all No question I mean thats what set everything up I mean its one thing to score but theyve made it really difficult on Kentucky to score Drew keeps it alive finds Woolly And the rebound down to the Cats Chandler Nice touch pass Garrison lays it in and one I dont know why you foul there He had an advantage You let him go 18point lead Louisville 1132 to go Over half of the field goal attempts for Louisville and theyve only got three turnovers on the game Thats remarkable you make more threes at a higher rate and you dont turn the ball over I mean youre going to win the vast majority of your games Thats pretty good recipe Yeah And this guys a pretty good part of the recipe as well Mike El Brown Jr having himself a night with 22 points four assists one turnover No look pass to Woolly Battle for the rebound is won by Garrison and a foul is called on the play Itll be on Conwell his third Kentucky basketball What a great look by Brown Just a fabulous pass It looked like he was going to try to send it out to the corner but instead found Woolly out top Who can lead Kentucky offensively Cam Williams is into the game a 68 sophomore a transfer from two lane He has gotten minutes here and there in the first couple of games for Kentucky Not many way from the corner and of all people low with the offensive rebound and he is not getting up He may have hit the back of his head on the court when he fell Well maybe his back maybe his tailbone Well hes looking at the official saying Come on man Thats not a foul Oh thats got to hurt He will stay in the game as Aberdine returns out there with Williams Garrison and Chandler Mark Pope searching for a combination right now Garrison a good passer as well and a switch Low drives through kicks it out Deep one for Williams Got it So Mark Pope puts him in and he immediately knocks down a three Well hes a three and D guy from T Lane Had 14 double figure games last year He brings length and athleticism Conwell with the answer and its 13 made threes right now for the Cardinals Well Louisville can absolutely stretch your defense and if you close out hard to him they can shot fake and drive And a three in the other end for Chandler And a timeout of the floor as we have just moved past the midway mark of the second half and Kentucky trying to find a way to hang in there with Louisville But every time they make a shot Jay it seems like the Cardinals come back down and knock down a three Well those two threes by Kentucky sandwiched around Ryan Conwells three That was a big one for Louisville And Spider Mitchell loving it Im showing no matter how Im feeling Louisville has been knocking down threes left and right against Kentucky When you get two on the ball Drew passes it out to an open shooter Then the reversal ready to shoot when the ball arrives Then Adrien Woolly the lefty knocks it down behind the screen Over half of Louisvilles field goal attempts have come from three And Mark Pope at Kentucky has a goal They Kentucky set a record last year for threes at Kentucky And hes got a goal He wants to get up 35 good ones a game Louisvilles going to do that before we get to the 5minute mark Willy behind the screen from Fu Defended by Williams Good pass Canai Roots through the offensive rebound Roots has had a couple of big games in the early going this year Louisvilles first two games quiet tonight but they are still having a great night And they get another offensive rebound Then just too much on that screen Tripped up Aberdine Boy you get three opportunities for Louisville They come away with nothing there because of the screening foul Big Neely back in for the Cards replacing Pretty impressive stuff on a number of fronts for the Cardinals Well especially when you look at those turnovers forest and compare it to if you count that last screening foul as a turnover So what is four turnovers now overall for Louisville Thats incredible given the pace of this game Yeah the ball security has been excellent Low into traffic and its out of bounds Still Kentucky ball out of bounds by Fu is a hes a difficult guy to get a shot over Does a really good job of moving his feet Doesnt give up on the play after Brandon Garrison just rolled him down the lane and still able to block that shot cheering Williams out to low Chandler pulls up for three and hits Boy right in the grill of Sandanda Fu He was right there with pressure on that shot Chandler with his third three of the night cheering He looks like he has taken a major step forward from a season ago McNeely into the paint finds the spin and the finish Again Isaac McNeely playing off two feet in the lane was able to pivot and deliver that pass along the baseline to Fu Thats just beautiful Drew trying to stay with Low the step back three and Kuckys got it down to 10 Boy the shot making in this game has been elite Conwell will try one Not this time And Chandler soarses for the rebound Big possession for Kentucky here 8 minutes to go Mismatch down low but its low for three Garrison the rebound Aberdine And cheering the follow by Williams who has given them a real spark here in the last few minutes Time is out on the floor and a timeout on the floor Ooway and the rest of the cats feeling like they are getting back into this one And its Cam Williams who didnt for the game between Louisville and Kentucky And both teams had 10 games under their belt This year theyre playing with two but still this has been a really highlevel game It seems like this is a February game or a March game not a November game And a couple of times Louisville looked like they might just run away with this thing but Kentucky gets back into it Its down to single digits with a lot of time left on the clock Think Louisvilles got to find a way to touch the paint Give themselves an opportunity to get fouled Next foul either way sends the other team to the line McNeely wide open and Mark Pope before that shot went up was so angry that McNeely got an open look but they were fortunate that he missed it Stolen away by Hadley Well Hadleys made some really good defensive plays in this game Missed their last game Was in concussion protocol but looks like himself here tonight Khalifa pass Thats his fourth assist but hes been more valuable than that passing the ball Mike El Brown passed out of that double team and Khalipa in the middle of the floor What a beautiful pass and cut Theyve got 20 assists on 29 made field goals Aberdine elevates and hits and hes got 20 Hes been so aggressive offensively known more as a defender Mike El Brown Jr when he got trapped out top didnt panic just back dribbled and Khalifa just hit a running Javon Hadley Just a fantastic passer Thats threading the needle and then some They call him the Egyptian magician And thats why cheering Brown knocks down the front end for his 23rd point of the night Dont go anywhere after this one Theres another great game coming your way Itll be Kraton and Gonzaga Speaking of ranked teams they are both ranked and it is always a scene in Spokane Itll be a great game with Dave Blending and Shawn Fargo on the call a little bit later on tonight Well the best thing about being in the kennel is getting to watch Gonzaga play basketball The second best thing is the Davenport Hotel applause cheering 10point game Low keeping the dribble alive away and Khalifa holds off Garrison for the rebound ahead to Hadley who has it rejected What a block by Cam Williams Boy that saved a bucket right there What a few minutes off the bench for Cam Williams Aberdine trying to shake McNeely Cant do it cheering Garrison back to Aberdine And McNeely called for the foul Isaac Boy McNeely did a really nice job of stopping that drive and staying in front But talk about a bucket saving block Not only getting in front but quick off his feet That length and athleticism we talked about with Cam Williams is a three and D guy coming into Kentucky from two lane cheering Well one thing about Cam Williams too Dan hes tough to screen and when you try to screen him hell just run right over you And again both of these teams are so deep Williams didnt get in the game until a few minutes ago He was the 10th man into this game for Mark Pope Mark Pope made an analogy to us today when we were talking about the death He said its like walking into a great music studio Youve got every toy and bell and whistle And he said the trick is figuring out how to make sweet music beautiful music by making all the parts fit Its its a good problem to have but both of these coaches have a lot of different ways they could go about their rotation And its great when your drummer can shoot Brown and a good rebound there by Williams doing a little bit of everything right now for Kentucky A bucket here makes it really interesting and itll be Aberdeene back to the line That wasnt the shot that Louisville wanted or needed on that possession They didnt move the Kentucky defense at all Number four on Isaac McNeely So he will sit and itll be Adrien Woolly back into the game for the Cardinals That takes out an offensive weapon Not that Woolly cant stretch the floor Hes a a good shooter But McNeely is the most dangerous he and Mike El Brown Jr the most dangerous shooters What a portal pickup Denzel Aberdine is for this Kentucky program Misses the front end though but he got it back Missed again Boy they had a great opportunity to get it maybe down to six Well first Marino kept it alive but then Khalifa for Louisville Hadley misses the three Williams in transition Nice pass Marino the assist from Aberdine And theres a lot of clock left in this game And its down to six And now Pat Kelsey wants a timeout Boy what a change in fortune to be aggressive but you dont want to just settle for a three I felt that Michael Brown Jr settled for a shot that led to a run out Oay on Brown right now They get it in to Hadley cheering Back door cut Hadley the catch Turned it over low for three and Hadley corrals the rebound That would have made it a onepossession game and a foul on Oay and that will be number four on him Just as important he sends Louisville to the foul line for the cards At the line for the number 14 it will be Adrien Woolly at the line The Conference USA freshman of the year a season ago with Kennesaw State Averaged almost 19 points per game and shot 50 from the field overall He does such a good job of changing pace and direction And one of the best things about him coming into Louisville was his ability to draw fouls and get to the free throw line Mike Brown Jr has gone to the bench Probably just because were getting near the under four timeout Give him a a bit of a breather Kobe Rogers back into the game for Louisville And the friendly bounce on the front end applause Youre right He He never looks like hes been you know playing at a game this pace He just always looks calm and hes not sweating at all Sweating I dont think he has any sweat gloves They should look into that One of two and the rebound to Chandler cheering Something out of the middle of the floor I think is what Kentucky needs here Deep one for Chandler and he got screaming it cheering His fourth three of the night and its a fourpoint game What a big time shooter Colin Chandler is cheering Crossover by Conwell Cant shake Chandler Rogers into the paint Conwell for three And a big offensive rebound for Woolly but a held ball and the arrow is given it to Kentucky Thats the kind of fight Kentucky needs to show for the remainder in the game and they put some real game pressure on Louisville down the stretch cheering Pat Kelsey has brought Isaac McNeely back into the game Hes playing with four Otga Ooway has four for Kentucky Hes on the bench Low at the controls Wants a ball screen Goes the other way Drives Kicks Chandler open Nope We have a whistle and a foul before I dont know how anybody can hear a whistle in this place right now And its number four on Ryan Conwell Boy when Marino goes out to set that ball screen it was really high And that gives a lot of room to Jaylen Blow to get downhill and really put pressure on the Louisville defense They Its Kentucky did a really good job of spreading the floor on that possession So it is low at the line He is three for three from the line tonight Has nine points and five assists cheering The second time in the last couple of minutes that a Kentucky player has missed the front end of a one and one Low did it here Aberdine did it a couple of minutes ago And weve got three minutes to go Brown with Fu on him Drives him switches hands lays it in and one Well he knew he had the ability to drive because Malachi Marino the sevenfooter switched out onto him Its one thing to get past Marino but its another to finish with that left hand over the twohand challenge from Chandler What a beautiful finish by the freshman That is big time And they really needed that He is a special player having a special night That is his 27th point cheering And theyve got it back to seven And theyve got this crowd on its feet again Boy what a turnaround The missed front end of the one and one to the threepoint play by Brown Jr cheering Chandler into traffic finds Aberdine who snakes his way into the paint and hits Really good shot fake on the closeout by Hadley that let Aberdine get into the middle of the lane And thats a careerhigh 24 points for Denzel Aberdine Brown again and he got grabbed and will shoot a couple So if he didnt get grabbed F had a dunk Boy its so hard to stay in front of him He can go left as easily as he goes right And weve seen from these finishes Mike El Brown Jr has a spectacular left hand for the guards Mike El Brown Hell shoot through cheering How impressive is it for a freshman in his third college game to play at this level in this kind of an atmosphere against this caliber of opponent I mean he hasnt changed expression He looks like hes just at a shootound Tomley makes them both And its back to seven Kentucky trying to do something it hasnt been able to do in the last 15 years as they were down 20 earlier Got it down to four Its seven now In and out for Aberdine And its Louisville Bull But great ball movement by Kentucky They just couldnt knock down the open shot And Louisville now can afford to take a little bit of time You dont want to take the air out of it but theres no rush This was used earlier to drive Conwell behind the back still has the dribble and hits screaming Boy thats just bully ball right there cheering Aberdine quickly answers at the other end but trading baskets not good enough right now for Kentucky That same set that Louisville just ran was what they ran to end the half How deep they are Canai Roots averaged 18 per game in their first two games Their leading scoreer he did not he has not scored tonight 11 minutes Kase Prior has barely played tonight 2 minutes in the first half but theyve got so many weapons Theyve still got 95 points on the board Conwell gets it over finds Hadley And again they can exercise a little patience Denzel Aberdine is not going to let Michael Brown get the ball Conwell the kick McNeely the three The rebound What a lord by Sandanda Fruit Thats how you win games right there And you can tell they love him chanting out his name as we are now into the final minute of regulation and they can sense it here at the Yum Center cheering Thats a winning play right there by Sandanda Fu Number four on Chandler will send Conwell to the line Boy after all that phrasing of free throws is that an announcer jinx Thats an announcer Theres that is indisputably an announcer jinx Even though it was delayed and even though theres no such thing laughter cheering Maybe there is such a thing Missed them both Louisville ball And you cant challenge it Kentucky lost their challenge earlier so thats gone cheering Boy Hadley would not give up on that offensive rebound opportunity Theyve got a really strong combination of skill and grit And I think you could say the same for Kentucky This is an excellent Kentucky team but boy has Louisville come to play here tonight From the opening tip Louisville was the aggressor And thats what Pat Kelsey talked to his team about We have to be great at us And if this is who us is for Louisville the Cards are going to win a lot of games cheering Just the physicality and the toughness that Louisville showed cheering throughout the course of this game Its put them in a great position to win this one A few free throw makes here Theyve missed three in a row now would be helpful Donovan Mitchell and everybody else on their feet waiting for the last 44 seconds to tick away But they do have to make a couple of free throws and not let Kentucky get too close here But right now for Louisville its about not allowing threes and not fouling Four in a row theyve missed after being so good until that point cheering and low stepped out of bounds Good job by Ryan Conwell to angle him out Showed his hands did not foul Low will sit Ooway is back in for the first time in a long while after he picked up his fourth foul Hadley will dribble it over and hes fouled by Chandler Thats going to be number five on Colin Chandler But you really dont have much of a choice Got to put him on the line and hope they keep missing applause Thats pretty cool Donovan Mitchell and Mikel Brown Jr Hadley back to the line as low will come back in Chandler fouls out But while weve talked about Ryan Conwell and Mike El Brown and rightfully so Javon Hadleys had a really good game defensively Hes fought on the glass made great cuts Five in a row that theyve missed Crowd cant believe it He cant believe it Hes missed the last three Six in a row They should have this game totally salted away already Ow Spins forces it up and its Louisville Maul with 183 to go Really well executed by Louisville Taking away threes not fouling Time out And a timeout taken by Pat Kelson applause his energy in high Dont be surprised to see somebody go long here There goes McNeely Inbounded to Conwell and the immediate foul And its number five on Ooway He becomes the second Kentucky player to foul out Dont some places when you miss two free throws in a row you get like a chicken sandwich or donuts or something Imagine how much wed be taking home the last few free throws Lets see if they can put all this silly jinx talk to bed right now laughter Thats right Youre the one Yeah hell shoot Seven consecutive misses after they had been 20 of 23 beforehand Dave not a faint laughter cheering Jasper Johnson back in the rebound down to Hadley and they can run out the clock right now The Louisville Cardinals are for real folks A big time win over Kentucky 96 88 here at the Yum Center Keep an eye on them this year cheering
