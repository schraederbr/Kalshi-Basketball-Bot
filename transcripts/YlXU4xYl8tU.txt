you said it pat Kelce said yeah but his defense has been fantastic over the last handful of games Notre Dame at home in the white Uniforms Louisville on the road wearing black and it is Cardinals basketball to begin the day theres an example right there of the play that Terence were just made to get possession of the basketball a Louisville team thats one three in a row theyve won 12 of the last 13 that Scott inside He Got swatted Away by Kevin Ji Music look at the Notre Dame starting lineup theyve got a big three of Burton Shrewsberry and Davis who averaged 51 of their 74 points a game this is Shrewsberry curling off the screen sir mohamd spins into the lane six to shoot for the Irish Shrewsberry got to get it up step back with one on the timer he drills it there you go that whole possession and Marcus Burton the accs leading score at better than 21 points a game doesnt get a touch Shrewsberry in a late clock that would be a Tempo basket for them theyd love to slow this thing down a little bit Notre Dame lville meanwhile more up pace Michael shrewbury says he knows they want to run today as Chucky Chucky hebburn is short on the three offensive rebound by James Scott hes so good on the glass hurn for three this one short again two good looks for him but emptyhanded Marcus Burton here he is with the basketball right here leads the ACC in scoring right now open look Corner three mohamd sticks it early five nothing start for Notre Dame at home against Louisville whos just a game and a half out of first place in the ACC Terrence Edwards Jr Off the Mark part of the Louisville starting lineup that has looked the same for a majority of the Season really tough to get an offensive rebound against Notre Dame theyre one of the best defensive rebounding teams in the league and its because of their schemes on defense you see Louisvilles first three possessions are three triples they havent gotten a piece of the paint yet and thats by designed by michah Shrewsberry defense Louisville team that shoots the eight most threepointers in the country so they attempt a lot of Threes the way it is mAh Shrewsberry said theyre going to hit a lot because they take a lot well Duke has made the most threes per game and Louisville is right behind them in the ACC by percentage by tth of a percentage Applause Point almost 2 and 12 minutes in Louisville looking for its first point to the itll come from rain Smith on a straightaway three well Chucky heord sets that up with a snake behind that middle third ball screen and a hard Roll by Scott and a lift by Smith its well done by the Cardinals 88 of rain Smiths field goal attempts this season have come from three you know what hes out there to do Davis great patience cant flip it in with the left when they are matched up that is going to be one to watch Hadley for Louisville and Davis for Notre Dame Smith again he got it Applause again you cant give him any space you really have to close the cushion on him quickly they went two and A2 minutes without any points but backto back possessions with the rain Smith three and Louisvilles got its first lead of the day Burton averaging 23 a game in ACC play hasnt scored yet this is Mohammad all the way to the cup tough finish how about the Freshman sir Mohamad getting his fourth start in the absence of Matt Alo whos out with an injury its five early points too for Mohammad who averages less than three a game jumper is way short from James Scott James Scott one for six now on the season from outside the threepoint line oh Shrewsberry bit of a heat check it falls through Applause step back three this is Terren Edwards Jr rims out strong rebound from ji underneath for the Irish they have shot a lot of Threes early on is that all theyve taken besides the block shot at The Rim one twopoint attempts and eight field goal attempts toight blocked yeah seven of the eight have come from behind the threepoint line for Louisville Shrewsberry extra pass to the corner mohamd short this time and hebburn flies in for the board with j and Scott all tangled up heurn in transition goes off the window theres a twopointer for you yeah Chucky heer downhill always proving second in the league and assist this point right now its 62 a game but he can call his own number anytime Pat Kelce called him just a Flatout winner a true leader and professional Shrewsberry curls elevates for three wont get the bounce and O Scott and Jai again you just talked about it they Collide underneath on a physical play but about five Boston College on Wednesday night has not scored the first five minutes yet his Irish up a bucket against Louisville they get a touch for Burton here Burton has tremendous quickness feed Shrewsberry who connects on a three well Michael Shrewsberry came ready to play he has got three triples already in the first half two games ago he went scoreless on 0 of eight from the field but hes had a couple great bounceback games since he has a great change of pace into the rhythm of his shot Noah Waterman who just checked in flies by the defender and flushes at Applause home and then Burton loses it out of bounds and second turnover for Notre Dame he just loses the handle unforced mistakes the last thing you want if youre Micah Applause Shrewsberry Chu heer really accelerating off that Zoom Music action Javon Hadley one to shoot backing out a Defender thats a tough finish inside thats a much better possession for Louisville they get a couple of sides everyone gets a touch they operate through the dunker spot they get the ball the middle of the floor such a good job of manipulating the rotations you know theyre going to shoot a lot of Threes thats what they do but when they get downhill and get to the basket Debbie it opens up that three even more they put pressure on you at The Rim off the bounce and with their cutting theyre not a low post back to the basket team but they do put pressure on the rim so does Tay Davis his second field goal in the early going pass intercepted by Applause Burton Burton hits the Music three thank you Christa as we welcome you to pel Pavilion in South Bend Notre Dame and Louisville in the early going about seven minutes in its a sixpoint lead for Notre Dame over the carts and Noah Waterman sticks a three five quick points off the bench for him nobodys taken more threes in the ACC then Louisville Notre Dames made four here in the first half early pulls him within a possession Bren Shrewsberry kicks Good Feet on a pick and roll Garrett sundra trayi with the wall up on the Baseline really good job by tayori closing that space and Shrewsberry on a contested three wont fall Davis and Waterman Collide its a foul on tay Davis mean you talk about Walling up and defending oneonone Louisville doesnt always bring two to the post or to the block treor did a great job of standing him up Pat Kelce year one at the helm of Louisville he has orchestrated the best turnaround in college basketball this year after going just 8 and 24 last year 3 and 17 in the ACC this team is 196 122 in the league and just a game and a half back of first place Duke remember Noah they started six and five in the league and theyve won 13 of their last 14 hes done a remarkable Coach of the Year kind of job at Louisville only loss in that stretch coming against Georgia Tech about two weeks ago Hadley with the left wont get the bounce both of these coaches are so good about calling the iso and trying to take advantage of switches manipulating switches and then going oneonone Burtons great oneonone Falling Away over headb bur but its too strong yeah Chucky is one of the best twoway point guards in the country just named to the Nay Smith list midseason Applause list Edwards tried to bounce it into Waterman but its taken away here comes Burton with a full head of steam squeezing between two Defenders thats a really good contest Waterman Euros knocked away from him thats Julian rooper who got a hand on it hes trying to say it went off the leg of waterman but it St he was the CAA coach of the year last year at College of Charleston immediately has Louisville back to relevancy rain Smith already a couple threes shovels off to James Applause Scott Edwards pester three to shoot Edwards isolates backs down to the defender puts it up at the horn and hits what a great job of clearing it out letting Terence Edwards go oneonone hes playing the best stretch of basketball right now in his Louisville career 21 1 half a game over the last five he has been unconscious including a 21point game against NC State on Music Wednesday loua really chasing hard around all that screening action trying not to switch right now five on the shot clock buron rejects the screen two to shoot kicks Roper hand in his face too strong thats Terrence Edwards he made the accs leading scorer Give It Up R Smith transition rims out and J skies for the rebounds yeah you talk a lot about the offense of Edwards especially recently but defensively so good R Smith that time got a hand on it Burton and Edwards blocked Applause Music it can I Ruth really good true freshman season for Louisville head bur spots up cannot leave him Applause alone just under 10 m threes a game for Louisville and right now theyve got four G on a quick 80 run to take a twopoint lead hurn tis it away Ruths up ahead and Chucky head bur in transition with a finger old Applause finish a timeout was granted to Micah Shrewsberry who I dont think wanted Music Applause one if that was an inadvertent whistle are you allowed to substitute as Chucky heurn scores two off his defense well so no timeout Michael shrewbury said I didnt want it so they end up saying okay no timeout we play on either way its 10 unanswered now for Louisville Notre Dame who started seven for 11 from the field has missed five in a row and Javon Hadley is called for a foul trying to get over the screen Gregory Nixon on the call with Roger SS and John gaffing Applause Music Applause Mohammad having trouble getting it in they do finally to Davis this is the matchup Im excited about right here Davis and Hadley why because I think theyre two incredible athletes that understand their role and theyre very explosive with the ball in their hands theres a switch by Louisville Bren Shrewsberry who already got three threes today tough contested two Hadley had the defense on him Hadley sticks his chest right there into Shrewsberry and doesnt let him have any Music space mismatch Hadley kicks Edwards thought about the three see I would boomerang that thing right back there you go adley still have the mismatch kicks to Edwards short on the three ruths had the offensive rebound it was swiped Away by mohamd stays with Louisville those are the situations where you recognize the IQ that Louisville plays with like Terence Edwards he does put the ball on the ground a lot sometimes doesnt go anywhere but when he does make a decision and he goes somewhere with the ball hes really tough to defend and Hadley just kept shaping up to the pass all Louisville right now on a 10 run from down six to up four in the matter of a couple minutes Edwards poked away from him by Burton shot clock tips down to five Padley great pass inside to Waterman extra ruths from the corner buries it playing Inside Out get through that Baseline to that short Corner area really good time and score recognition also already five liable threes on a 130 run theres a reach and foul against Terrence Edwards Jr I like m Shrewsberry putting Tay Davis on the top of the floor to initiate some offense Banner hanging in the Raptors its great to see him for the game definitely is his Notre Dame Fighting Irish on the bad end of a 130 run right now and they put an end to that with Tay Music Davis Tay Davis one of the more improved players in the ACC this year hes up almost seven points a game from last season Noah Waterman catch shoot off the skit passes off the heel and shrewsburys got the rebound for Notre D five white jerseys on the defensive glass part of the reason why theyre the best defensive rebounding team in the league Burton Applause kicks Burton creates separation got hurn to fly by and hits the short Corner jumper Music Applause this is the pace Louisville wants to play at they want to make it up and down knocked away stolen by Julian Applause rooper good d by rer now Burton darts into the lane oh get it to fall hit every part of the rim and then he gets called for a foul after the Hadley rebounds Burton two hard dbes to the rim just spins out oh and he just gets caught and tripped up with Hadley unfortunately for Burton that fouls on him and its also his second yeah and thats why I think he hesitated to get up because he knew coach shuz bear is going to have to take him out 648 to play in the first half and your leading score the conferences leading score goes to the bench I think its as long as its a one possession game here you see how when we get under the 4minute mark where Notre Dame is Music Chucky heurn with a hesitation gets to the Lane Waterman circles around for a corner three its too strong and J carals the Applause Applause rebounds T Davis so good at getting to the cup leans in really good defense from Scott Applause purn nice move to get to the Lane Waterman thought about it the Roper stays right on Ry Smith no help in the Gap there knocked away its rer with the defense again shrewsburys got a twoonone gives it to Imes missed the Applause layup thats two close shots at The Rim Shrewsberry going deeper into his bench early in this half he told us he was going to have to get a bunch of guys in he liked the Finesse and the speed of the game he was going to have to play a few more guys earlier Edwards slapped away from him again nearly forced the turnover R Smith Fires for three swirls Applause out Applause numbers Bren shrewbury has three threes in this first half Applause nice G screen right there two thats where you get numbers right there two against one with rain Smith caught having to guard two guys really good call by coach Shrewsberry he pointed that out from that whole possession to line it up thats what youre trying to get you can get numbers in transition Noah but you can get numbers on either side of the floor youre always looking to get that numers advantage two on one three on two this is what Im talking about right here goes through it right here Louisvilles got two on the ball rign Smith jumps out and thats a two onone over on the strong side of the floor Roper wide open doesnt make it I know the result is a missed shot but thats a really smart play from Bren Shrewsberry too turn down a good shot to get a great one well the only only unfortunate thing is its a 23 shooter over there in the corner and rer offensive rebound fresh Applause Music reload that burn Works off the screen and theres a reach and foul called against Tay Davis the number 12 tar Hills highlight the Thursday night ACC networked womens basketball double header as they take on a balance car attack against Georgia woy and Syracuse at 6 Eastern then Carly winsell in Virginia hosting Stanford should be another great night of Hoops thats coming up Thursday with an ACC womens double header North Carolina with a onepoint win over NC State this afternoon in Chapel Hill big victory for North Carolina over a top 10 NC State Applause team two to shoot hurn floats it up and theres a push in the backat called against d so backto back fouls against him and thats three Chucky heurn told us in Raleigh on Wednesday that he had to spend a lot of time with James Scott learning how to consistently throw the lob not that he couldnt throw it but he didnt throw it a lot at Wisconsin he threw a lot of pocket passes but boy they have connected all year James Scott has 55 dunks on the season a lot of those coming from Chucky heurn and michah shrewbury was talking about that with us after their shoot on this afternoon saying that theyve got such good Shooters they shoot a lot of Threes but the second you come out just a little bit too much they throw a lob up to Scott well James Scotts got to work on his free throw shooting and I know he is because hes been in the gym not a very good free throw shooter at less than 44 but he shot 50 at the line that time well the percentage is going up Applause Music sir Mohamad bounces inside to sundra sundra didnt even look at the rim three is Off the Mark that time from kesn Hadley bounces to Scott and a foul going up sends Scott to the free throw line on the other side to Terren and Suzanne and little Trey he he showed up right at the start a shoot around today they went at 100 this afternoon he came in separate from the team and when he showed up there was a big Roar of Applause for him walking in the brand new father of Terrence Edwards Applause Jr well Burtons back in the game with those two fouls now leading score in the ACC kzn attacks down the Baseline really trying to attack Closeouts trying to create rotation look at that beautiful textbook two hard dribbles into the rhythm of his jumper its all you really need when you get into quarter Court no is two strong pounded dribbles they were 0 for four from the field after he checked out but as soon as he comes back in Burton Mak makes it happen for himself so you take the ball down to the Baseline you flatten out a little bit and then on the top of the floor Burton attacks Chucky heern with two strong dribbles and a beautiful midrange Music pullup P bur loobs up top for Scott onehanded Jam Chucky reads the second and the third level as well as anybody the first level is whos guarding you the second level is the first level of help the third level is the second level of help he just had which is usually at The Rim he just had the deflection too to force the turnover Hadley short on the three and Burton skies for the Applause Music rebounds tipped it away but right into the hands of kesn Burton pulls up elbow jumper almost banked Music in Hadley has the size Advantage double team comes over Edwards extra pass HB bur back to Edwards open three offensive rebound tayori Edwards the reload this one he gets such an unselfish team they turn down good for great Applause and Notre Dame doesnt give up offensive rebounds very often Louisville really working hard on the glass good back door find nice feed by Mohamad on the cut back door true freshman with the pass to Burton and a quick answer for Notre Dame some of those quick hitters that Michael Shrewsberry runs comes from his Boston Celtics days that was a nice one how about a little Zone by Notre Dame to change the rhythm of the game here first time weve seen it from the Irish comes with just over a minute before halftime Edwards in the middle of that zone squeezing between two Defenders its a jump ball possession arrow gives it to Notre Dame good help from behind Micah shrewsburys team had lost three in a row before a come from behind double overtime win against Boston College on Wednesday I think it was an important coaching move to put Burton back in the game when he did even with those two fouls Burton feed Shrewsberry curls off a screen too strong on the three but an offensive rebounds Burton elevates from the mid range wont get the bounce sir Mohamed on the inside and the Freshman making a really nice impact in this first half sir mohamd from Meyers Park in Charlotte North Carolina won a State title as a junior missed a good portion of the beginning of the season with an injury but hes really come on getting his fourth start doing a nice job on the weak Side Music Glass first free throw swirls out looking ahead to next Saturday afternoons trip header we got Georgia Tech in Boston College starting today at 2 Eastern followed by Chase Hunter and number 23 Clemson in Dallas taking on SMU and we cap cap off the triple header with Virginia Tech and Miami empty trip that time for mohamd and the lead stays at three for Louisville another great coaching job by Brad Brownell at Clemson that is a veteran team thats hungry to win and went to the elite eight last year rign Smith for three Off the Mark Shrewsberry Taps the rebound out and its whos got it for the Irish now R Smith takes about 10 threes a game so hes going to keep shooting him oh hes at five right now hes right halfway at that one timeout taken by Micah Shrewsberry sixpoint game right before halftime Music Music the war the war got a fun first half here inside purcel Pavilion in South Benz you got dance moves like that Debbie yeah I sure do well take your word for it sixpoint deficit for Notre Dame trailing Louisville 25 seconds before halftime as the Irish have one final possession and try to cut into this sixpoint deficit Notre Dame jumped out to a big lead but Louisville used a 130 run at one point about halfway through the first half to take a lead theyve been in control since well theyve done a nice job turning Notre Dame into a jump shooting team theyre not getting anything in the paint or really at The Rim buron gets all the way to the rim against H buron finishes through some Applause contact Louisville takes its use it or lose it timeout 72 to go J Scott right here R Smith Applause Smith Rises for three got it right at the horn you have got to be kidding me L Shrewsberry has got score with 11 Notre Dame led by as many as six in the first half but Louisville used a 130 run to take a sevenpoint lead and thats where we sit at the start of the second half Cardinals a game and a half out of first place sitting behind Duke and a half game behind second place lemson R Smith offline on the three Burtons got the rebound for the Irish really good tone Setter though with that possession because the acceleration the speed in the quarter Court the Cadence offensively is the way Louisa likes to play and it led to a wide open triple with the guy you want taking it and this is the guy you said you want Notre Dame to get going T hes got to get aggressive looking to get downhill trying to use his athleticism and his instincts around the rim hes got the ball with four to shoot attacks into the Lane cant finish J the offensive rebound his dunk wont go but there is a foul against Louisville and its against James Scott his third and thats a great tone Setter for Micah Shrewsberry team because you want Tay Davis to start to be punishing with the ball in his hands hes got this big strong body hes got the ability to play explosively off the bouns and he only has well he does have three personal fouls so he does have to be careful Music first free throw bounces through for Kevin J I mean Marcus Burton needs some help Noah he scored the last eight points to the half for Notre Dame with two fouls thats why I thought it was a good coaching decision by Micah Shrewsberry with two fouls to put Marcus Burton back in the game well you see the numbers there for Davis a big jump to 15 points a game but Louisvilles defense has held him in check just four points in the first half Applause purn leaves it back Noah Waterman left alone for three it grazes the side of the Applause rim Davis crosses over lost the handle and he gives it away you can see though he is trying hes looking for his own right now this match Hadley pass deflected Away by ji great help by ji to bring the double to the Applause block lob inside and Hadley was working so much post positioning that he was out of Music bounds wow that was interesting right there I mean I he posted him right into the band and then Chucky threw it out of bounds I think heurn was asking for a foul or something down there but that was an awkward looking play to say the Applause least Notre Dame team that has a chance to crawl into a tie for ninth in the ACC top nine teams get a first round by so plenty to play for if youre the Irish down the final stretch of the Season yeah see Notre Dame much more aggressive you want to try to get it into the bonus if you can thats two team fouls in less than two minutes see if you can get to the bonus get to the free throw line Notre Dame currently sits in 13th but there are four teams ahead of them all right around 6 and8 6 and N the opportunity to climb up into that grow Louisville meanwhile a half game back of second place Clemson a win tonight they reach a tie and possibly one game back of first place Duke top four seeds double by next group of four gets one by bottom three dont go which is new obviously the expanded AC only 15 of the 18 teams make it so not everybody gets to make the trip to the ACC tournament T Davis had some blood that was for the stoppage both teams utilized it like a timeout thats called putting him in jail right there Burton snaking behind that boss screen he gets another ball screen with eight to shoot Barton isolates Smith kicks TRW Berry Corner three he hit three threes in the first five minutes of this game Debbie has not scored six it is risky to help on the strong side corner especially with Shrewsberry in the corner but in a late clock with some duress under the shot you know he was really good accelerating off those wide pined downs and zoom action in the first half especially when he can get to his right hand had 16 against Boston College the other night it was a really good bounceback performance after he went scoreless the game before Pat Kels Club trying to make it wins in 14 of their last 15 after losing the ACC opener to Duke this team has been on a Applause Music roll hes Hadley rolling down Burton to the block whips it Cross Court Waterman elevates for three its off the heel of the rim and mohameds got the board Waterman certainly hasnt shot it as well at the this part of the season with that thumb as he did at the beginning part of the Year Davis inside wont get it to fall through but he earns a trip to the free throw line really nice Flex cut on the Baseline and you can see Michel shuberry is trying to get Tay Davis going right first couple of possessions off the bounce now hes got him cutting off the ball and hes ending up at the free throw line hes been playing some really good ball recently 16 points a game over the last four has taken massive jumps each year Debbie when he was a freshman at seen Hall averag just under three points a game comes to Notre Dame averages nine a game that average has jumped from nine all the way up to nearly 16 in his third year hes 67 at The Rim and thats why coach Shrewsberry is running that set right there to try to get him a quality catch inside where he can punish his Defender Notre Dame scored the first four of the half theyve pulled within a possession just over 17 to go really good defense from The Freshman Mohammad R Smith does not need much space he swirls in a three R Smith had under 17 to play Notre Dame down six with the ball this is Davis Roper shut off on the Baseline circles into the lane spins thats way off the mark but he got his own Miss shot clock does not reset for to shoot Burton deep three airb it and thats a shot clock violation thats a great 30 seconds of Defense from Louisville everyone in the ACC tries to pick on rain Smith they try to post him up they try to take him off the bounce and Pat Kelce knows he does a good enough job and he gets help when he needs it as an undersized guard hes a better Defender than people give him credit for and hes improved that part of his game a lot this year Applause look at Michael Shrewsberry guarding rith in the corner you dont even help youre youre not face guarding him but youre not in a position to help HB bur curls off the screen for three no I mean theres being attached to someones hip and then theres what Shrewsberry just was to Smith screen for Davis they get him going downhill on Smith Roper extra pass to the corner and it hits the sideline its a Notre Dame turnover under 16 to play inside pcel Pavilion Louisville up six and sharing it with his son and dont forget about Ruthie and Caroline who Im sure are home watching right now Lisa his wife is here with Johnny today Ruthie and Caroline can ball too well Louisville fans likeing what they are seeing up six under 16 to play trying to make it wins in 14 of their last 15 and pull within a game of first place Duke in the Music ACC Davis battling on the Baseline Notre Dame has yet to hit a field goal in this second half all four points from the line two to shoot back door cut Davis got the defender up got it plus one Tay Davis second half Micah Shrewsberry getting him involved three fouls in the first half 14 minutes Four Points much more active here in the second Baseline Cuts back door Cuts hes gotten him off the ball in the first half he was initiating on the top of the floor a lot hes getting off the basketball right now and hes working without the ball to get himself free to the rim completes the threepoint play Im telling you Debbie its like you know you know something about the game of basketball first thing I asked you at halftime what stuck out you said Notre Dames got to get Tay Davis going well hes too important to what they do and and Marcus Burton cant carry it by himself youve got to have everyone involved when youre trying to take down Louisville its Terrence Edwards the other way for Louisville with the three Burton darts kicks Row for three wont get the bounce see thats KY you know your personnel Jordan Julian Ropers not a threepoint threat hes only a 23 shooter so youre going to make him make one before you adjust right back the other way Hadley with a physical finish down low and Louisvilles lead stretches to eight and heres the thing Noah Louisville comes at you like the floor is tilted and when you do that in transition you put a lot of pressure on matching Applause up Burton behind the back nice Applause handles Shrewsberry fall away from 15 feet rattles Down and Out ripped away by Roper thats the kind of plays that Julian rooper makes right there that is a toughness play ripping it away from Hadley hes got his team another possession Chucky hurn called for the foul on Burton I mean hes got Chucky in jail hes got him on his hip and hes not letting him off off his hip thats a foul you have to call Music that you watch right here ball screen in the middle rain Smith is sort of in drop and B just draws a foul thats five team fouls remember I said this was important for Notre Dame to get to the free throw line as well Noah well Burton hits a contested three rattles it through Notre Dame cuts it to Applause five adleys got the mismatch on Shrewsberry lowers the shoulder hes battling down low and there is a foul against Bren shrew you usually go one bump two bumps if you get to the third bum theyre probably going to call it Applause watch Burton right here just get a little separation from Kai Roose look at that last dribble he pounds it to get into his vertical jump shot its really well done hes got 14 to lead the way Smith side steps the defender thought his open as hes going to get Applause jumping out to switch Davis works his way into the lane wont get the roll it is last Touch by R Smith B stays with the Applause Irish he Davis has some blood on his shorts thats a great take right there he just got a finish the play I dont know why guys dont use the backboard when theyre getting all that contact around the rim hton lost it taken away by Scott really good read by James Scott Edwards thought about it drives hes got two move Applause it at bur swings it out Edwards shot fake leans in leaves his feet gives to Scott lowers the shoulder plus one James Scott scored a basket and it wasnt a dunk with his off hand watch this pass by Edwards hes kind of stuck in this corner he just jumps and drops it off and James Scott keeps moving into his vision really nice job really well done oh you see the mask that hes wearing that was actually created by Louisvilles engineering school after last week he had a facial fracture lost a couple teeth up front they were pulling bone fragments out of his upper lip went to the dentist one day after it happened he texted Pat Kel said Im going to be ready to play on Wednesday night he was and yet he got a little bit of help from the engineering school at Louisville as well with the bucket back the other way Pat Kelsey said 2 of college players would have played in that NC State game on Wednesday night because he suffered the injury last Saturday he texted him from the dentist chair and said coach Ill be ready to practice tomorrow and Ill be ready to play in the game Wednesday and Pat Kelce said lets pump the breakes a little bit lets find out what our you know the medical staff has to say we wont make any decisions right now but sure enough Scott was ready to go on Wednesday night Notre Dame needs to keep attacking on this end theyve now got five team fouls they they drawing five fouls on Louisville Edwards one of two kesn the rebound kesn could help too finding some shots hes a really good threepoint threat could space the Music floor 10 on the shot clock Davis looking to isolate five to shoot Barton with Smith on him darts right past him gets into the lane and throws it Applause out another Debbie to that after the turnover from Burton coach very Broad in man he wasnt yelling and screaming about the turnover but instead he was making it a coaching moment thats what a teacher does he made it clear he needs Marcus Burton to get it on to the next play really nice job of Pat Kels situational offense oss Baseline out of bounds sideline out of bounds I call those blobs and slobs a lot of coaches call them that so good at the execution because he dictates exactly the shot he wants and he gets the shot he wants from all the analytics and scouting that his entire staff puts forth in their effort in their prep he told us today he is singularly focused on every possession and every play because he in his prep he never wants to let his guys down he never wants to make sure never let his guys down not be prepared you asked him have you allowed yourself to really enjoy what youve done in the turnaround that youve had at this point and he said I I cant because because if Im not fully getting our guys prepared to play Notre Dame Im not doing my job right he goes Wednesday nights game feels like its 2 years ago were past that were not to this weeks game we are solely focused on Notre Dame and nothing else so he he calls it the Revival right its the Revival well do you know that next week the Louisville fans are going to be able to select their seat for next season already okay we havent even finished this year and theyre already having a select the season events in the Young Center for next years season ticket holders thats how excited the fans are and what a great job Pat Kelce and his staff and this team have done in galvanizing and rallying one of the Blue Bloods of the game that has been dormant for a little while you know now its back and if youve been in the building while they are jacked up and the way they play its exciting crowds are great and I I just cant believe that theyre colleting seeds for next year already were not even done with this year thats how the Revival has gone Davis gets into the lane left to short there is a whistle against Louisville on the shot from four wins two years ago to eight wins last year to one win away from 20 already this year for Louisville just a game and a half back of first place in the ACC and an extremely strong tournament resume Debbie well I mean you just have to look at the four quad one wins the 29 in the net lardi right now has it projected as a seven seed and Dana Brown the sports information director for Louisville who does a fantastic job had a great note in her notes this game its been 111 years since Louisville has won five Road games by 20 or more points 111 years I know I read that right you did and theyre all against ACC teams too its not like they were doing it in the early portion of the Season well that just speaks to how well Notre Dame has played here tonight and theyre getting to the free throw line in the second half theyve limited Louisville to one shot no offensive rebounds in the second half and Tay Davis is getting to the rim hes got to start finishing hurn does stretch the lead to nine for Louisville as were approaching the halfway mark of the second half Davis backing down the defender hops in the Music lane chck staying home moving his feet picks up the foul it is before the shot foul on the floor but it is one and one coming up for Marcus bton see and this is great for michah shrew right you got you got basically 10 minutes to play theyre in the bonus they have a chance right here as a 74 free throw shooter team to be able to put some points on the board right here to help them continue this comeback Burton hits the front end of the one and Applause one 0 for two from the free throw line in the first half was Notre Dame now theyre six for eight make that seven for Applause nine game high 18 for Marcus Burton who averages an ACC leading 21 per Applause game p bur uses a screen from Scott got left alone and he connects they do a great job go single side nak side Twan game and Chucky heurn has plenty of time I heard Luke Hancock the great threepoint shooter in Louisville history talking about being patient that was an example of the patience that Luke was talking about Burton off the screen for three that is way off the mark tror the rebound for Lou Edwards lob Scott well it worked timeout Micah Shrewsberry and they have given him a incredible Foundation to build upon but its not just the play of Cooper lately tyres Proctor in the last five games is averaging just under 20 points a game and shooting 49 from the three point point line they got a lot of good stuff going on right now and John Shys got him peing at the right time Shrewsberry curls off the screen thats too strong rebound tap to Burton but he cant save it inbounds goes back to Louisville Duke has a one game lead in the ACC over Clemson and possibly Louisville as well if the cards can win tonight they jump into a tie for second with Clemson Zone by the Irish we only saw one in possession of this in the first Music half Scott skips Edwards drives Baseline its a good time to go to it with rain Smith not on the floor really good lob was knocked away Davis has it Notre Dame has numbers Tate Davis all the way to the cup Banks it Applause in tror and transition bucket plus a Applause foul Kadir trayor sprinted I think it took him like five steps to get from one end of the floor to the other its a great find up the court too by Chucky this is the team speed of Louisville because Notre Dame scores at the rim and Louis takes it out of the net right and quickly he on the other end so fast Applause Music Applause trayor completes the threepoint play Music this is kesn driving Falling Away over Hadley left it short wull running Applause again immediately he was looking for R Smith and Marcus Burton did a good job of picking him up this time he finds Hadley for a corner Applause three largest lead of the evening for Louisville Music Applause Notre Dame needs an Applause answer Burton steps through kicks kesn spots up Applause no Hadley again backto back threes for Hadley timeout Notre Applause Dame its a formula that works it does work I mean their percentage is up to 33 so they have shot it better lately and part of that is because Terrence Edwards Jr has shot it well Notre Dame on the other hand has not shot it well in this half just four of 15 from the field Louisvilles got its largest lead of the game and Het burn forces the turnover Hadleys got the hot hands this time its short on the floater got his own Miss kicks it out Smith to reload wont get the bounce and theres a foul on the rebound against Notre Dame I dont know how Hadley came down with that rebound and had the awareness to find rain Smith actually I think rain Smith has missed more open threes tonight than I have seen him in a long time I was in the building last year at the college Charleston when he made nine and then he had another game where he made 10 yeah hit 10 against SMU this Music year hes got it now fires way short he definitely has a neck shot mentality and Pat Kelce expects him to have that Pat Kelce was asked after last game if if there is a light thats greener than rain Smith and he said if you can find a color green thats greener than green thats how green his light Music is kzn bounces to mohammd slashing to the cup he got the bucket and one really good play after the play if you will this is just a really good job by Notre Dame staying active and moving without the ball good cut by Mohamad to get to the free throw line as well and that is something that Notre Dame has done much better here in the second Music half Irish now 10 of 10 at the line after 0 for two in the first half 10 of 10 in the second half that is Scott hits head bur off the flare hurn circles into the lane got it put him at the line for one more they check every box does Louisville excellent point guard play a connected tenacious defense the ability to change the rhythm of the game at any point with their offense or their defense they put put pressure on the rim without having a low post game with a back to the basket and they shoot it tremendously well the NC State game they shot 64 from for the game 58 from the threepoint line and 91 from the free throw line I hav you dont see many teams that do that Burton with a physical move into the lane goes off the window I mean Burton just sheds Chucky he bur on that one Applause adley swings Davis pestering Music Applause Edwards Smith swings it across Court Hadley swiped away from him he was the last to touch it Notre Dame Applause ball the womens lacrosse season began last weekend and coming up this Saturday as our first ACC Network game with number nine Virginia hosting 18th ranked Stanford at clockner stadium in Charlottesville coverage begins Saturday at noon Eastern 900 am Pacific under five to go Notre Dame down Music 16 Burton draws a whistle I mean Marcus Burton has been tough off the bouns hes been aggressive all game Michel Shrewsberry put him back in the game in the second half with those or in the first half with those two fouls and then he scored the last eight points of the half for Notre Dame and he has been aggressive since well he came back at the beginning of January from that knee injury and in 12 games since Debbie hes gone for 20 plus 10 of them there was really no rust to shake off whatsoever and hes coming off that career high 32 from the double overtime win on the road at Boston Music College Boston colleg is last week played five overtimes they lost in three overtimes and Syracuse lost in double overtime to Notre Dame still Notre Dame has not given up an offensive Rebound in the second Applause half except for the last possession where R got that three off so one one offensive rebound even though the stat sheo doesnt reflect Applause that Im here Im right there see if Notre Dame has one late push in them down 14 approaching four to go bir wants to isolate Smith oneonone he wants to get that corner three from Shrewsberry mohamd kicks Davis one more Shrewsberry elevates miss it KZ need the offensive rebounds pass deflected out of bounds itll stay with Notre Dame after the timeout 351 to go Louisville closing in on their four hockey assist if you will CU he sees the floor so well Chucky heurn sees all nine players on the court Shrewsberry the floater in the lane no got his own Miss and the follower wont go either Shrewsberry has not scored since those three triples he hit in the first five minutes of the game he got off to an electric start Notre Dame jumped out to a sixpoint lead but he has gone quiet sense so has noted aame quite Applause frankly skip Open look Edwards short rebound chased down by Shrewsberry Burton kesn yes Here Comes The Press first time weve seen it today for Notre Dame and they got to put it on down 12 with three to Applause Music go theres a whistle against Notre Dame its called in the freshman sir Music Mohamad his Music Applause third Michael Shrewsbury yelling at his son bra to Sprint off the floor we dont walk at Notre Applause d Edwards hits the front into the one and Music Applause Applause one this wasnt the prettiest of stars for Louisville Debbie but they used a 130 run in the first half to take a lead and theyve been in complete control the entire second half mohameds three swirls out tror the Applause Music Applause rebounds Louisville takes a timeout 245 to go and I talked to Paul B and cardi our ESPN recruiting expert and he says Micah Shrewsberry team as Javon Hadley looks like hes going to the bench something happened off the ball Michael Shrewsberry recruiting class coming in has three top 100 guys and according to Paul bardi Jaylen harelson is a McDonalds allam with Incredible upside Ryder Frost is the best shot maker so things are going to be looking up for Michael Shrewsberry with a talent thats coming to South Bend next season in the recruiting class and same thing you could say for pack Kelce Mel Brown Jr is a top 10 Prospect in a McDonalds AllAmerican and a point guard that will play in pack Kel system next season so both these guys have hit the recruiting Trail and brought in some high level freshman theyll hit the portal as well but theyve got some good freshman coming in so what youre telling me is two teams that are going to be good next here yes free throws coming up for Applause trior misses the front end of the one and Applause one Davis battles into the lane its swatted but a foul sends Davis to the free throw line dont forget that nothing but net crew with Justin Walters and Company is coming up next immediately following our game with 225 left here in South Applause Music bent they really made it an emphasis Notre Dame did Debbie in this second half to get Tay Davis going he got to the line a lot he was getting shots on the inside but just not quite finishing everything down low I thought he worked really hard without the ball and you know hes going to hes going to have to be able to be a little bit more physical around the rim to finish certainly has a physical frame to do so here comes the full court press off the made free Music throw R Smith has to call the timeout one of the Hadley wants to go play again purn saves it in they avoid what was nearly a turnover Edwards gets into the lane bucket and a Applause foul good pump back show and go Applause threepoint play for Edwards gives him 14 leads 15 for the Music cars Davis spins in the Lane wont get the roll they have had several like that today for Notre Applause Dame thats who you want to foul is James Applause Scott just a 44 free throw shooter for Louisville well you gave him 44 because he made one earlier right hes really less than 44 so Im with you hes up to 44 okay he might be down below hes below 44 Applause now one for two trip and the fans were wanting free nachos behind us but they didnt get it Burton for three wont go rebounded by Scott after Shrewsberry hit those early threes Louisville did a good job not allowing him a lot of space running him off the threepoint Applause line five and double figures today for Louisville all of them between 10 and 14 points very balanced scoring for Louisville hurn Stripped Away by Shrewsberry Applause Shrewsberry in transition buries the Music three final minute 13point Louisville lead take some time rouville fans in red across the way on their feet clapping a road win for the Cardinals and Chucky
