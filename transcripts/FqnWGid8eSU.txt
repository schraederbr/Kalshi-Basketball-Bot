essentially a coach on the floor for Coach young the opening tip controlled by the William and Mary tribe theyre in the white and the reason is the Hokies want to keep that good luck going this season Brian Oliver with those orange uniforms and again you saw that they had luck in ACC tournament again come out there how about this electric crowd tonight on the Sunday s trying to go Baseline they drop it low it bounces out once had the position offensive foul against William and Mary Collier picks up the flower those starting lineups brought to you by your local Toyota dealers as we get it rolling here in the first half Virginia Tech 20 in the season to Win Thursday on this floor against Lehigh they shot 53 as a team to get the 7852 victory Applause how about that that move by Maddox good job by months being able to realize that Doubles going to come not trying to force it on the swing Maddox had a nice finish at The Rim Maddox who shot 51 from the floor a season ago the Junior from Bowie Maryland out of Oak Hill Academy in the Commonwealth of Virginia Collier on the drive lets go the other way thats one of the things that you talk about with Justin Muntz is his ability everything again hes going to get a lot of high life of being able to score but being able to move his feet also and absorbing that contact you see that move by Maddox being a little step through on the Finish known for being a dynamic score so we hided highlighted Collier at the top of the broadcast Brian he is out with the two personal fouls hes got to go to the bench for the tribe Applause number 12 rice has picked up the foul for William and Mary his first and so Colliers on the bench piece of the offense sitting on the bench there Collier spent two seasons in the ACC at Pitt played 44 games yeah thats a three but zilling knocks it down and the Hokey fans are going to fall in love with this guy because big body can stretch it shoot the lights out of him on the heart the graduate student to transfer from Wright State in Ohio knocked away pokeys going the other way with Couture Padula lines it up and knocks it down and this is the guy for the for my wife saying Padula who is stepped up his game you see the Hokey Nation letting him hear early they dont start Padula who got six of 13 from Beyond New York in the first two games knocking down to second three and as many trips down the floor and again you see a good ball movement and you see pin down allow and Purdues about the Doula be wide open knocks down that three the sophomore from Edmond Oklahoma while we have a moment its time for tonights keys to the game theyre brought to you by your local Ford dealer what you got Brian Oliver Michael Monte that both teams depend on a lot of for William and Mary admit a job of defending the three and for Virginia Tech you want to pound that ball in the paint youve got two bigs that can get it down there and attack that rim can also shoot the three so far theyve knocked down a couple and have an eightnothing lead from Mike young in his fourth season 21st overall as a Collegiate head coach 355 career wins we had a great chat with him prior to the game Brian yeah and hes excited about his ball club with the pieces hes got returning to some of the new guys a team that always is picked Midway of the pack and then by the end of the season hit this drive thats exactly what he said last year it took a little bit to get some traction as the season went on and then all the way to Brooklyn New York where they defeated Duke in the championship game of the tournament 8173 after beating Clemson Notre Dame and North Carolina in the semifinals of last years ACC tournament Couture Applause great pin down action again you saw Justin must realizing that William and Mary is going to come and double on the post didnt even forced it wait for the pin down got a wide up open Hunter Couture but a knock down three out of bounds to Virginia Tech Applause again watch the action cross green must realizes theyre already coming waits for that pin down Couture is one of those guys if you allow him to see daylight you can cancel Christmas and go ahead and count that three he shot 42 percent from Beyond The Arc last season made 83 threes to lead the team and attempted 199 threepointers for Hunter Couture foreign Maddox is one of those guys man that he really came on in the second half of the Season came up big for them in the ACC tournament youve already seen him get off with a good start Mike why he said Mike young said that he put in the work over the summer and its really showing off early Virginia Tech has launched four three balls at Mid Hall so far in the first half so silly with the kick medulla and the first Miss from threepoint distance in the game for Virginia Tech racing down the other end of the Court Mullins came up short that rolls off over the top Brazilian and the other Couture one on Three foula gets the tribe youll realize that when Virginia Tech is going to get those stops and you see Hunter Couture putting the ball on the floor Defenders got to be able to slide his feet if youre on the side its definitely gonna be called a foul so thats the second foul against Tyler Rice so he heads to the bench for the tribe so he and Collier both picked up a couple of early fouls in this first half here at Castle Coliseum foreign Applause and he came down awkwardly he is behind the play trying to shake it off Applause that rattles out garasinski with the Miss mutts hit the court well keep it at this end of the floor Applause wherever you realize this Virginia Tech team is a team that can knock down to three amazing start Splendid 140 run Warrior one Lehigh on Thursday Brian theyve already made four in this game and this 140 run theyve come out and theyve used it by getting the spacing rotating the ball and again hot shooting already four for five behind the arc a little bit of everybody being able to get a touch and weve talked about one of the things about this team outside of Defending and sharing the ball they are going to shoot the lights out of it already to a hot start and you see hokeys five for seven field goals and four of them already threepointers their first game of the season last Monday we should mention they made 14 threes against Delaware state in 9557 Victory they shot 28 threepoint attempts in that game and knocked down the four teams Tom famous more impressive is it the blistering defensive stance that theyve had William and Mary cannot get anything at The Rim and thats what you get for Virginia Tech theyre going to pressure you on the outside follow you inside theyve got limp with their bigs theyre going to challenge shots and then theyre not going to allow you many Second Chance opportunities thank you Lynn Kidd number 15 into the lineup for the Hokies and Jay Collins is also in there number two in Orange Applause the silly to the bench hes got a three to his credit shot clock at 10 Music face on the dribble and now Nelson deep into the shot clock needs to recognize and shoot whoa and sometimes the best one is better to be lucky good sometimes Tom ends that run for Me Maybe it allows them to slow down but the pace from Virginia Tech has been smothering defensively Maddox tour needs a little bit of help and the shot clock at this end is down at seven Applause missed from Collins another chance the tour in rhythm and this is the thing that with the length of Virginia taking and Mike young talked about theyve got bigs that are athletic give you those second opportunities and theyre too good for that you cannot give up second and third opportunity because you got a guy hunter Couture that again if you give him a chance to set his feet you might as well go ahead and get canceled Christmas on it and honestly Nelson misses Couture had struggled really in the first two games just two of seven from distance yeah but the times that youve seen him you know that that wont last long because with their offense how active he is hes going to get his opportunities and God is a gym rat Music Applause shot clock at 10 Brian Collins midrange weak side mutts over the top tipped out of bounds and itll stay at this end of the floor according to Les Jones on top of the call Applause heres tonights Hardees star to watch this is Sean Padula 61 sophomore guard and you look at it earlier in the season has upped his production already 19 points a game impressive five assists this is kid Applause its one of the guys that Mike young is talking about with his young bigs and just the fact that how theyve been acclimated to a system you see Padula coming up slow and then another Applause that was Nelson again Brian after the Kid jumper at this end yeah Nelson has come in and giving them a shot in the arm when theyve struggled being able to knock down a couple of Threes coming off the bench for the tribe Music Applause Music closed on Padula he gave it up Collins knocked it down and obviously Shooters are going to make shots but when you see how the ball goes from east to west by Virginia Tech they dont allow the ball to stick in one position it goes in and out that ball is popping and allows them to be able to shoot it Mike young is going to give his guys a lot of freedom to throw up those threes especially when they deliver on the defensive end first points of the game for Collins on a threepointer Nelson on the drive and he beat everybody to the goal how about Andrews Nelson is coming off the bench with a quick eight points in his Virginia Tech 22 Anders Nelson eighth foreign graduate student whos been in double figure 73 times in his career Cooks hope finding the range get a nice little rhythm hes snotting his head was like yeah Im actually feeling it tonight he has moved on from those first two games where he made just two threepointers hes got three threes and nine points for Couture a turnaround too strong from White but Doula had 20 points tied his career high in that win against Lehigh in the most recent game for the Hokies that was at home thats kid awkward twisting shot nice move because again he took his time he realized that no doubles gonna come he aint able to get pound the ball inside and this is another one of those things for for Mike Youngs team you get those bigs to get this experience in this nonconference its going to come up big once you get in the conference play first game of the season kid had eight points 10 boards against Delaware State career highs both for the Clemson transfer we got four five guys going to the floor trying to get to that basketball Applause throw the ball into the big fella allow him to be able to turn and use that height again its been all Virginia Tech early the first half shooting a scorching 67 from the floor prior to the game the unveiling of the banner the championship Banner for the ACC tournament a season to go first one in school history and the first time they made it to the title game of the ACC tournament well if you remember how they were able to get that that Championship came up big had to play against Duke and Carolina and then they had guys that stepped up and matured throughout the entire year and when I was talking to Mike young earlier I told him last year I remember his team last year was picked in the middle of the pack they slowly got that Rhythm at the end of the season and it was a a thing of beauty for them to come together and win this this ACC Championship Hunter Couture was connected on 33 so far the most valuable player of that tournament last year in Brooklyn he had 31 points a career high in the championship game against Duke for the senior from Orlando Florida who had originally signed with Wofford thats where Mike young was and then he came to Virginia Tech and so did Hunter Couture and things have worked out quite nicely I would say that they worked out pretty well for them both its working out nicely tonight as well from threepoint range seven of nine for the Hokies Maddox dropping it low oh the lineup potit is the goddess really got Mike young really giddy because how big and agile he is I mean he look at it he is built like a linebacker a very agile around the rim the Junior from Reidsville North Carolina and that is Nelson again and Nelson has brought his Agame again all 11 points with William and Mary have been by Anders Nelson keeping them somewhat close in game Wilsons got three threes as well Mullins brings it up Chase Lowe is in that lineup now for the tribe hes number two Nelson launches again it was online you know that was he checked milajo Poteet had the board he is six nine 265 pounds and a transfer from Rice hes played a lot of college basketball Applause angular rebound tapped around and taken by William and Mary about 250 miles due east to Blacksburg Music William and Mary in Williamsburg Virginia and if youre William and Mary thats what you cannot have those unforced air errors because again youre already not being able to run your offense by causing the smothering defense for Virginia Tech and a Virginia take on the other end theyre clicking on all cylinders and you see them being go inside and out weve already highlighted how theyre shooting the three ball and we look at their offense its just help its just going back and forth Dane Fishers the fourth year head coach 3449 hes also been in the system of George Mason Williams College in Massachusetts Ryder Bucknell great chat with him prior to the game as well trying to keep Virginia Tech off the boards and theyre able to do it in this instance soon here comes Nelson so Nelson now 74 times in his career its a double digits in scoring long rebound taken down by Collier whos back in with those two personals Music Applause Mullins they work it into the corner and thats the best offensive set that theyve had because they saw the penetration getting the ball over good rotation to not down that three right now this William and Mary team averaging 123s a game again taking their time to be able to run offense you want to chip away at this lead Ive already cut it down to 15 Dorsey had that last jumper Maddox look at Maddox and you see how the improvements from his game this is the guy last year was really streaky it seems more under control knocking the three ball down you see being able to be patient to get inside the midrange you know what that guy right now I mean really Nelson is coming he has brought it with him already 13 first half points and again what looked like Virginia Tech running away William and Mary starting to find a look at their offense medulla against two Defenders foul against the tribe on the drive by Padula Mullins picks up the foul so for Doula at the free throw line he was 90 Brian a season to go for the strike didnt start any games or played in all 36 for the Hokies last season for purdullah the sophomore guard one of the things youll notice is how hes picked up his game but then looks like hes bulked up a little bit since last year as well and now a message from Works Nitro meet Works Nitro powerful gas like power without the gas fueled by powershare batteries to give you the power to outperform whats up a couple for Padula he was nine of 17 from the floor but made just one threepointer in the win against Lehigh thats Dorsey who went down Applause Gabe Dorsey for William and Mary there was some contact there and hes shaking up see its like he caught an inadverted elbow by zilli on that pick there the officials are going to review that as they attend to Dorsey so the officials are discussing the previous sequence we got a good look at it like but silly was just trying to establish some defending position but he ran into Dorsey and it was being ruled the flagrant one Brian well I guess it does not matter what the intent was because again you see above the shoulders see right there Dorsey coming over and then basically reach him right out there and catch him in the eye so thatll be free throws in possession Music its Roger Ayers talking with both coaches Music see facility talking to his teammates again it looked like he was reaching out Les Jones whos coming over to talk to Brian and explain Music yeah based on the replay it looked like Vasily was just trying to slide defensively put that right arm out and made contact with Dorsey so so Brian has the update for us so he did say that they are going to go with a flagrant one because the elbow a high elbow What looked in there and the replay was maybe the hand but he said that theyre going to go with the F1 with their High elbow something Applause flagrant one on bazilly saw Dorsey could sign that he walked over to that tribe bench sitting next to his teammates now but silly with the flagrant one and two lines Nelson to go to the freethrow line to shoot two the free throws on the play group one Applause oh Andrews Nelson right now already up to 14 first half points 14 of the 17 hes take him out he should really take he just missed a shot Dane Fisher should really take him out and there was nobody guarding him theres nobody on the lane Applause Music tribe maintaining possession but not for long Brazilian deflected away on the Run Maddox medulla the kickoff but silly the three and how about the unselfishness by Darius Maddox you saw a fast break realizing they penetrate kicking out he saw Sean Padula set up a silly for the three again this team is already playing third game as if theyve already missed season four zilly had a double double in that first game last Monday against Delaware State 30 points 10 points was 12 of 16 from the floor and thats Chase Lowe nice move by low realizing that he could have opted for the three realized he had whats in the paint being able to get inside and spin off nice little athletic move career high 60 the basketball that was much for the Hokies going to the floor with low the arrow right now favoring the tribe first 14 points of our game belong to Virginia Tech were early where it may look like the Virginia Tech was just going to run away with it but little by little well even Marys been able to chip away at this thing theyre a feisty ball Club theyve been scrapping to get back into this game and even though 17 its like theyre trying to find a little bit of rhythm they are one and one on the season they played Thursday against MidAtlantic Christian out of North Carolina thats off the glass and good nice money nice move by white and again Virginia Tech they have to be able to honor Nelson and pick a role white being able to roll and dive and get that basket theyve cut this thing down to 15 tribe scored 116 points in beating MidAtlantic Christian out of division three the new South Atlantic conference the no look with zilly able to catch and shoot again we highlight Justin mutts and what he does begin you real he realized that the double is going to come had patience waited for the right time to get it over to basilia again this is a guy that does so much for this team and its not just the scoring in the defense its just the assistance of his teammates hes got eight points white in traffic knocked Away by months Couture knifing down the lane going for style points thats another one of those things by Couture that you dont really pay attention to is his ability to get to the rack hes a Defender that can shoot the three but you love the fact that being able to stay under control and get that run to rim side of six minutes to go in our first half Tom wormy Brian Oliver our outstanding ACC college basketball production crew with you here in Blacksburg as they raise the banner tonight after last years ACC tournament championship Rock was down to three white offensive glass tangled up with vasili hes going to pick up the personal you can watch The Patience by Justin months he already realized the double is coming takes his time he gets the ball over the facility Billy does a good job of gathering himself in Finish those two already showing early season chemistry Brazilian to the bench hes got two personal fouls eight points in total for gazilly hasnt missed the shot three for three a couple of Threes case the Miss out of that corner for William and Mary mutts mutz has not scored yet but heres the thing is that hes basically set up his teammates cases got to understand that Hunter Couture is shooting the lights out of it youve got to stay at home and force that double to come from the weak side tour now Brian with 14 points and watch him walk away to the point where he sees that the con hes already gotten his his legs set and then musk does a good job of realizing hey youre the hot hand right now Im gonna feed you again you see Honda Couture five for six field goals already 14 points and four of those made field goals or threepointers four of five from Beyond 20 feet 22 feet one and three quarter inches away underneath drafting way nice back cut back screen there karasinski on the Finish to Virginia Tech you got to make sure that you call a switch on that whole communication that last time Couture around the edge Music its the entry that got knocked away from Kid transition game coach Fisher talked about this Brian can they convert yeah you see the try being on the battle back ass hop Kaczynski doing a great job of penetrator Mike young not happy tries to slow the momentum calls a timeout Tyler Rice who averaged seven and a half points last season for the tribe knocking down the three again you see the penetration they kicked out trying to get that ball over the rice rice knocks it and getting knocks it down again we talk coming in this game that this William and Mary team averages about 12 threes they were slow at being able to get their their Rhythm offensively but as of late have fought and scrapped to get back in this game Music they also played last Monday lost the Navy Virginia Tech 7852 win against Lehigh 23 wins last season they went 119 in conference play they won as the number seven seed at the ACC tournament Im sure with Mike young in that timeout is telling his guys hey we have weve got to stay in front of the ball we dont want to allow them to touch the pain and break us down to the point where were gonna have to help and give those guys uncontested threes Couture holding the Finish scouter reports Hunter Couture can shoot the three if anything you want to make sure that you force someone else to shoot that you dont want to give him the opportunity because again hes an amazing amazing role right now five made threes in the first half for Couture and the tribe throws it away foreign slide that and get it if he sleeps he says his feet then like I said hes one of the quickest he got one of the quickest releases in the ACC so against Lehigh on Thursday Virginia Tech did it on the interior with 40 points in the paint tonight three ball 10 of 15 for the Hokies from Beyond The Arc in his first there is a Timeout on the court Virginia Tech in front on its home floor this is your secret to an easy Thanksgiving 1962 the 60th season of basketball inside this facility heres something we might not have expected its a big lead for Virginia Tech and mutts is not in the box score as far as points are concerned he does have four assists yeah but if you look at how they shot the lights out of it 10 for 15 12 assists on 17made field goals its the other little things that hes done we talked about that that his value of his team is not just the scoring but the defense trying to defend inside couldnt do it against White nice nice move by white again Nelson doing a good job of being able to not only score but try to get his other teammates involved Applause that is an offensive foul thats a mutts good job by karzinski being able to play good defense against he move his feet get there we have the benefit of Replay well thats one of the reasons why Im sitting over here next to you and I dont Im not out there with a whistle in my mouth Les Jones rainy stions Roger Ayers better in crew tonight Nelson trying to shake Padula he is cooking I mean really if you look at what was kept them in the game is their and Nelsons come out already hes got 16 up at 30 Applause nice move must realize that the the double was not coming white count was in a holding pattern nice move to use the rim finish that off so much breaks through in the scoring column but Doula brings it up Applause kid he got fouled went for the power dribble and well earn some free throws a lot of times for point guards you want to make sure your bigs are rewarded for running you see that last time kid getting right across the arm a lot of times you dont want the bigs to put that ball on the floor youd rather keep going if thats something that hell learn especially when youre playing with a good point guard your shots for kid on the line coming up on the Toyota halftime report left first half highlights and stats from this one highlights from Youngstown State and Notre Dame the other game of the ACC schedule and a win for the Irish and well check out scores and upcoming schedules in the ACC just getting rolling 20 2223 alongside Ryan Oliver Tom Murphy 235 to go in our first half 34 back into the lineup for Virginia Tech Music stay with us on the Toyota halftime report not the front line for Virginia Tech so T kid oh yeah theyve got two other guys in Brazilian and much that round out Applause in a congested area Noah and this is one of the things I think for William mirror that kind of threw them off was when Collier got those two early fouls that forced them to have to defend solely on white and now have him back out this is the guy again you look at being able to get the ball over to him and down low talking about his footwork absorbing that content nice finish Applause Collier finishes off the old school threepoint play and now karasinski comes back in for the tribe Nelson leads the way with 16 points the tour has 17 medulla on the handle has five including a three its one of 10 made threes in the game so far good penetration with the step back under control Applause Couture guarding Nelson shot clock inside of 10 degree of difficulty good defensive possession by Virginia Tech 63 shooting in the first half as a team from Virginia Tech Music Applause Poteet trying to establish position gets the entry Music Applause Inside Out actually see what team realizing that he didnt have anything Maddox again having a really good first half shooting the ball and lovely hes playing within himself 14 points in the first game of the season for Maddox against Delaware State foul at the other end and that is going to be matters since his first first on Maddox inside of a minute to go in our first half but all Virginia Tech they are 11 of 16 on threepoint attempts five made threes for the tribe in the house Mullen shakes the defender and hits it see Chris Mullen being able to get a little bit heard the crowd looks like he gave gave Maddox a little bit of a chicken wing there but nice penetration step back Music Applause Mullins by the way is also a transfer from Rice hes wearing a tribe uniform Poteet and the Hokey Orange medulla inside the line same result he let the offense come to him this first half realized that his teammates had it but hes a guy again averaging 19 points a game thats how hes getting his burn love how under control he is foul before that game clock runs out Tommy you realize when you know Purdue in his second year look how patient he is realize he can get there pull up jump shot doesnt over commit nice elevation on his jump shot I love what hes been able to do and you know playing and the backup roll allowed him to be able to understand Mike Youngs role and what hes expecting of a point guard but off to a great start running this ball club and the 57 points the most and a half so far this season for Virginia Tech Hunter Couture down there the Crouching Tiger position there playing defense trying to slow down Anders Nelson Couture and Maddox double figures in the first half and thatll end the first 20 minutes 5735 Virginia Tech is a team shot 66 percent of that first half at the door LED everybody with his 17 points Nelson at 16 on the other side for William and Mary have time to straight ahead Castle Coliseum I mean Mike young Steve it was Couture and Maddox they got the double digits Couture was five of six from Beyond The Arc 11 of 16 as a team threepoint shooting coach young in a conversation with les Jones and the balls in play for the second half so Im glad that youre with us for ACC basketball from Blacksburg Virginia and the most points in a first half since 2017 for this hokey team must be the orange uniforms I most definitely yeah no a call you just picked up his third wow and I was actually close to saying that in order for the tribe to get back into this game they need to find a way to establish them and it seems that hes going to have to go and sit Applause you see Dane Fisher questioning that cause but for the tribe theyve got to find a way to be able to slow down the hot shooting of Virginia taking a threepoint and keep being Scrappy and try to chip away at this thing Collier has three points he also has three fouls and Maddox got fouled on that trip to the rim Darius Madness being able to knock down that three he was able to sell that because again youve got to rush at these guys because obviously theyve made 11 of 16 and his ability not to settle and being able to get to the rim definitely one of the things that like I said Mike Youngs got to be happy with this team so Collier with his three personal fouls while rice right behind him just picked up his third personal for the tribe Maddox in the first half was two for two on threepoint attempts so rice comes out Nelson in thats not a bad exchange considering Nelsons production so far in this game for Coach Dane Fisher on that sideline for the tribe at his fourth season a graduate of Ithaca College Applause Couture took a tumble and Nelson took it to the rim Couture shaken up momentarily see Hunter come up limping and Lopez him like he may have was that ankle trying to walk it off lets see penetration but Nelson right there you see oh a feet get tangled up between Nelson and then basili Connor Couture being able to like hes going to try to stay in the game he was coming up the floor and Coach young looked at him and the tour shook his head no I want to stay in the ball game mutts trying to establish position a lot of contact with an offensive foul thats its going to be on mutts and karazinski doing a good job of being able to threequarter Justin mustard not allowing him to get that ball can you see much trying to get establish this position down there again with the hot shooting from Virginia Tech they havent been able to actually get him going on offensive end the tribe started the first half Brian o of nine from the floor and then they shot 61 percent from that point on sometimes so it took a little bit to heat up thats a nice soft bounce and that drops for Dorsey this is how you chip away at that lead again you get some stops on one end youve had two offensive possessions where youve gotten or been able to run your play and again this is something that you do you got plenty of time run your offense medulla in front of his own bench Couture the passing going back and forth youre not for youre not rushing any shots you hit the lane you let the ball touch and it stands and you end up with an uncontested shot by Padula Poise and confidence from Padula and Couture White Applause karasinski Off the Mark again watch the position the ball and you see the penetration and then you dont stop there kick and wide open and then thats textbook basketball because again everyones getting the chance to eat you penetrate the Gap Force the help and then you get a wide open shot isnt that a great look from that camera right on the roof it was see the play develop see how the two teammates work together this time its Brazilian from Padula Music its the first Miss from threepoint distance for brazily Applause Mullins his Avenue was cut off momentarily by the defending of Maddox bazilly with the help D and he pulls it down and saves it on the Baseline Maddox oh what a finish nice high pick by Justin mutts and then Maddox gets it and then Petula comes up with a steal foreign Nelson Music long rebound to Nelson I like this game within the game between Nelson and Padula you see this going back and forth and medullas a tough kid hes going to accept that challenge defensively but hes also going to go back at him offensively too karazinski Baseline and his contact on the drive third foul on mutts Applause Music karazinski has come off the bench for four Dane Fishers team and not having Collier hes giving him some valuable minutes whats is coming out John Camden number 11 is into the lineup so mutts just one of two from the floor and two points Music out with those three fouls Camdens a red shirt freshman from Downingtown Pennsylvania the arrow keeps it with the tribe good show by Grandpa silly realizing that guy comes out the Baseline you trap him and Couture doing a good job that perimeter foreign Applause Applause ERS Nelson is showing that he can just get a bucket and good kick out facility coming up short with that one Camden hustled for the board the zilly on the Block Music nice move up Brazils lift hes got the capability to shoot the ball from outside not really dropping from the night love being able to get him downstairs with a nice finish medulla goes down Nelson goes down foul on Padula we talk about a guy can do everything realize hes got a little smaller guy if you call it that the silly finishes Virginia Tech still holding a huge lead up by 25 this is your secret to a deliciously easy thanks you and I couldnt really hear as much because of the crowd and how electrifying has been they know theyve got something special potentially trying to defend that ACC Championship you know the one thing Im sure that they want to amend from last season Brian was the early exit from the NCAA tournament they lost in the first round of Texas 8173 and that was played in Milwaukee Wisconsin they would have preferred a deeper run made by some of the other teams in the ACC two to the final four Miami to the elite eight Duke in North Carolina at the final four Carolina in the title game Collier trying to get back in to establish some type of Rhythm you see the penetration you see what looked to be they call that a block they did on campus first yeah and hes out of the game right now hell go to the bench area for Mike Young Music Applause Music no ball and the arrow favors the Hokies again the orange uniforms were from last years semis and finals against North Carolina and Duke at the ACC tournament tournaments going back to its roots Brian this year in Greensboro North Carolina for the 70th ACC tournament in the 29th time in Greensboro North Carolina Brian Oliver the 1990 MVP of the ACC tournament Georgia Tech is the Champs in the win against Virginia in Charlotte North Carolina right yeah absolutely fond memories oh good tour he beat the buzzer when all else fought fails too and hell get you a bucket good defensive possession by the tribe but then again get the ball over the hunter Couture by the way Brians team at Georgia Tech in 1990 all the way to the final four you know Denver Im going to slide through that cool 50 50 better be more than that Mr NBA money thats money from Nelson talking about money Nelson has been that guy that from the tribe has struggled to find some offense especially with Noah Collierville on the bench the career night Maddox against three Defenders almost beat him off watch out to be able to be agile enough to get that rebound and then come up with that finish Elijah Poteet Applause 33 games last year as a player in rice a lot of times Biggs Will Follow the Ball realizing he can go to the other side again you look at that front line for Virginia Tech you know the bazillion and then months is going to give you a lot but otit is another one of those guys along with the other guys that they have its going to be interesting for Virginia Tech too strong off the glass white knocked it away from brazily goes right back to the rim and attacks it moved by white to be able to come up with that offensive rebounding the putback Brian just think about what Virginia Tech has done over the last several seasons 143 wins over the last seven years tied for the best stretch in school history and Mike young has been a big part of that so is Couture as he misses that attempt Applause coach young in his fourth season on the bench case the Miss Couture the board by the way with the win last year in the ACC tournament Championship Mike young is 60 in conference Title Games he won five as the head coach of Wofford in the Southern Conference when you showed how hes been able to turn this program around since hes been here you know and it says a lot about the fan base here at Virginia Tech and being able to win that ACC Championship and talking to him pregame he thinks that this chain this team may even have a chance to be better than last last years team which for me is really scary you saw that Banner hanging in the rafters its next to the 1979 Metro Conference Championship banner and the 1996 Atlantic 10 West Division Championship banner and alongside of it the 2022 ACC tournament Championship Banner raised tonight inside Castle Coliseum theyve been waiting a long time for that one yeah again it goes back to sports milk the orange unit again unfilling their Championship Banner packed house Applause first time in the championship game last year and they won it against Duke went to the NCAA tournament for the 13th time Applause three hes coming off that pin down wide open and again hes talking under 13 minutes oh nice move by Petula Couture back to Padula directs a little traffic Applause oh thats just nice you saw how he was able to freeze the defender put a little bit of step back Motion in again uh I love how hes matured from last year hes definitely taking command of this team Applause bump on the Baseline as MJ Collins defending two in Orange and you watch Shopper door you see freezes Defender right there and gets a little separation he knocks that down and tell that his confidence level is definitely going off another notch this last year so thats 15 points for Padula three of five from three he is one of four players in double digits along with Couture also on that list is Maddox and Vasily right now theyre on the bench for Virginia Tech Music tough shot and a bucket Chase low hey good move on low being able to move the defender took him left and used his body spent back to the rim shop trying to stay in this stay in this game conversely William and Mary has never made the NCAA tournament three times in the NIT Collins was denied at The Rim so last time they went to the NIT was 2015 they lost to the first round of that tournament here against Virginia Tech 8579 big Collision Poteet went down Applause the big fella coming over absorbing the contact saying you know what this is all muscle for you baby great Hustle by our staff to dig up those nuggets and some famous William and Mary alums theres a banner of a famous Virginia Tech Alum hanging in the rafters as well maybe well get to that in a second DC for three this is mutts Maddox even though Virginia Tech is still up 24 weve been married doing a better job with their offense 74 11 in the second half 63 percent got to continue that offense to run but you got to continue to get these stops White against kid tough Fall Away well defended a good Memphis and contest by Keith though white tried to get a little separation Applause Jay Collins all the floater and the runner you saw mutts right there and he flirted with dropping it off to freeze the defender been able to keep a little little energy going to the rim and be able to finish off foreign Applause kid was trying to rip it away you want to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer its coming up in just a moment so the ball stays with the tribe Nelson on the inbounds hes still their leading scories up to 22 points now three made threepointers as well foul was called on Collins second on Collins Music Collier has been held in check Brian with just three points as Padula hit the floor and he just took another foul the Doula comes over and takes that charge Music thats his fourth so Collins just picked up his fourth on that play yeah I thought that he actually had uh mutts going to the middle without the foot crossover it seemed like hes going to come out never really got any kind of offensive Rhythm early foul trouble picked up his third right at the beginning of the second quarter and now just throwing his fourth so Collier just three points in the game if William and Mary was going to hang with the Hokies Collier was going to have to contribute unfortunately his contributions have been personal fouls and right now is on the bench crossing the 10minute threshold of the second half Mullins and Nelson Applause looked like Dorsey might have stepped on the sideline Russ Jones was right on top of the call and what youve seen all night Tom is that Virginia Tech has frustrated William and Mary by not allowing them to be able to hit the paint the times that they have theyve had success in it but for the most part being able to keep them out on the perimeter and then at last time forcing the turn coach Fishers team made 16 threes in the win against MidAtlantic Christian theyve made six on 16 attempts tonight against Virginia Tech which is connected on 14 threepointers Padula lightning quick and into the corner shot clock at 10 for Maddox Applause Nelson waiting for reinforcements on the break Applause thats at least three feet behind the line hits the front rim and falls for Gabe Dorsey and Dorsey getting a friendly bounce that line is 22 feet one and threequarter inches away he was about 25 feet away and just enough on it just enough bustard from Dorsey Padula seems to never run out of energy High degree of Fitness preparation from Padula Nelson picked it up second on him two shots for Collins The Freshman from Clover South Carolina two of six from the floor six points for Collins these are his first free throws of the evening 75 from the line last year that was third best in the ACC and they were the best threepoint shooting team last season as well in the conference track Brian they made 319 threes second most in school history up against the 2019 team which made 327 and thats white for two its a lot of threepointer thats a lot of three but again you realize a typical Mike young team talked about is going to defend theyre going to pass the ball theyre not going to turn it over and youre going to have guys that can knock down that threepoint shot theyre going to give you a lot of spacing Applause surround guys that can shoot it play defense and Biggs like potique thats what a soft little jump hook thats the recipe for a win for a big dub number 34 in Orange heating up some space and scoring down low 34 in Orange and number one in the Pokey fans Dorsey Gabe Dorsey with a three for the tribe 8058 7 45 and rolling here in the second half Tom wormy Brian Oliver our outstanding ACC college basketball production crew

19 Padula foreign thank you Padula was 90 percent a season ago for head coach Mike young such success at Wofford College in Spartanburg South Carolina he was there for 17 years and won five socon

get this one Music second on pagula you see Walden be able to come down and a little reaches down for comes across the arm again Tom talked about how good Virginia Tech has been throughout the night weve been married still tripping away at this thing they had to be Scrappy thank you foreign thats just the fourth attempted free throw in the game for William and Mary and now its a hockey line change for Virginia Tech and the tour zilly Padula also MJ Collins in there for Virginia Tech with Mullins at the free throw line Applause everyone 8266 the tribe they won just five games Brian all last season four of those were in conference play in the Colonial Athletic Association silly a nice kick out by the months because again it has not had a great offensive night could have been trying to look out for his numbers realize he was double team he kicked the ball out to basily making the right play 13 points for brazili karasinski basket and foul Collins ended up on the floor for the Hokies is the nice move by karazinski realizing gets the ball out nice painting you see Collins a little late probably still in that area but then on the other end watch the recognition by months double team realize hes got a wide open facility Brazilian knocks down that three Rollins goes up for it Dorsey as well he saves it to Nelson Applause need some help drops it to White white scores nice move by white and again this lead has been cut down to 15 Applause tribe is doing a great job being Scrappy and being able to turn up and be more efficient on offensive end brazily Applause miss out of the corner Music Mullins defended by Padula white in the paint knocked out of there by bezilla shot clock at 10 for Nelson Music remember Couture went down earlier in the half it appears that hes back to full strength was favoring an ankle brazily mutts kept it alive Couture driving against two Defenders and hell learn free throws the second effort coming up from mutts Music um youre doing a good job of being able to go and crash the offensive boards you see great ball movement and you see Hunter Couture going down Ill throw up that contact again good defense coming over in here how about you silly on the back end of that coming up with a big block to slow that run Virginia Tech led by as many as 28 points in this game that was in the first half Hunter Couture was a 72 percent freethrow shooter a season ago he started every game all 36 of them double figures 17 times and as we mentioned in the first half 31 points in the title game at the ACC tournament against Duke and he was the MVP of a season ago and playing with that kind of confidence early on in this season Brian well you see the fact that his ability to knock down the three is cotton better putting the ball on the floor to be able to get to the cup Applause only Mullins fourth on Collins Couture by the way is made six threes in the game hes got 22 points leading scorer for Virginia Tech and hes up to 181 career threes 10th in school history for Couture Mullins at the line foreign ERS The Fray for the Hokies Maddox has 14 points and Mullins connecting from the freethrow line 8772 four minutes to go in our second half Music Couture Padula have him a ball movement you saw them being disciplined running their set a lot of times you move the defense like that and make them shift why dont get that Widow medulla three 20 points now for Padula 16 made threes in the game for the Hokies Applause 18point lead Collier foul against Virginia Tech that was much who hit the deck foreign raises a bridge the banner and my man Padula was like you know what Ill add to that pokeys led by 22 at halftime Colliers at the free throw line for William and Mary we told you at the top of the broadcast these teams have played a lot of basketball against one another this is the 118th meeting all time but the first in 2005 between the programs Virginia Tech has won three in a row in the series that started in January of 1917 by the way your era is my arrow so what do you mean you finished it with 19 no no thats thats a totally different subject value hits the second one we were talking about Dell Curry and Chris Mullen and Brian Oliver 1990 MVP of the fantasy tournament thank you for clearing it up I dont want anybody to think that my error was on the 19th Im Class of 91 so yes Im right in there mutts with a handoff shot clocks down to eight all the way across the Couture catch and release a good pass by months and again you you realize that hes a superstar in this league but hes not forcing it you know hes Let The Game come to him realizing that tonight is the night that theyre going to double him and hes making the right basketball play William and Mary shooting 67 percent in the second half as a team 44 of the first half for the tribe shot clock to seven Collier couldnt spin it off the glass came away good defense by Kid Virginia Techs a 45 shooting in the second half they were 66 percent in the first half when they built a 22point lead it was as high as 28 Music Couture Padula Music great ball movement he saw Padula pass up a good shot for a better shot Applause see Mike Young so there is a Timeout on the court were just inside of two minutes to go in regulation and the Hokies are out in front of the truck its bowtie senior from Orlando Florida he had only made two threes in the first two games Brian just told you and as we showed you graphically he is six of ten from threepoint distance in the game tonight but heres the thing about this team is that you know Hunter Couture had a couple of games we didnt score well tonight is the night that you have just in months hes not going to score you want to have guys that can still step up for you because its going to come in the gut where youre going to need all of those guys to play big next game coming up for Virginia Tech Thursday at home against Old Dominion and that is actually the start of the Charleston classic where theyll play three games in Charleston South Carolina two oclock start on Thursday Applause Applause Awards a big man Cameron gets out and allowed to get that finish Applause in defending also into the lineup Camden Johnson for Virginia Tech hes number 10 in Orange so with 112 to go Mike young going to his bench Music Chase Lowe is at the freethrow line Michael Ward Noah into the game Applause I thought it interesting when we were talking with Mike young early and asking about his nonconference is that with having you know so many new guys does he have a different approach to the nonconference hes like no Brian Ive got to win all of them because again for the league and for NCAA and strength of schedule its important that you that you beat these teams because again when you look at only three teams uh in the ACC that are ranked its important for other teams like a Virginia Tech to be able to step up early that was doya on a walkon for the Hokies trying to hoist that three a longrange goal probably to win the first eight NCAA game since 2007 for this Virginia Tech program remember they lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament last season thats deflected away that hit up above the backboard near the clock on top of the backboard doiat a freshman from Roanoke Virginia thank you Johnson number 10 in Orange hes also a walkon had played 10 minutes prior to tonight hes got the basketball and he gives it to Camden a little Camden to Camden combination cant collaborate in the sense because Camden Johnson is number 10 John Camden is number 11 and thats a threepointer for milkwright Jake milkbright who had 21 points in the win against MidAtlantic Christian on Thursday this is going to be a win tonight 9477 average Indie Tech is 30 a strong showing by Virginia Tech defense hot shooting they pretty much took a command of this game early down by a great night by Hunter Couture 22 Point halftime lead results in a 9477 victory over the William and Mary tribe Couture
