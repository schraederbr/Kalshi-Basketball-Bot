say your belief system is nothing but a thought youve been thinking for a long period of time he had 26 Im sure he believes he can do it again all right so we are ready to go and away we go from the Watco Center in Coral Gables this afternoon a new looking starting five for Miami featuring Matthew Cleveland AJ State mpre Divine UGA chuku Brandon Johnson and Lyn kid Miami in white Presbyterian in Black the officials this afternoon Tony Henderson jbelle Spearman and Anthony e a leftand hook shot rolls in for lin kid and the Kings yes and thats good to see l king get ly kid get going early a lot of this offense is going directly into him in the post if her first shot to go I know its going to breed a lot of confidence for himself and his basketball team Stuart mincy along with Harvey parish and Scott the starting five for Presbyterian St and miny can really fill it up as that three rattles in and out in the loose ball Miami comes away with it into the hands of Matthew Cleveland ball down low for Lynn kid recorded the second double double of the Season against on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden hes got four early points for Miami a minute in you know ly kid when hes not double team I think hes almost Unstoppable its just when that double team begins to come it makes him think about that pass if Im Presbyterian Im double teaming Lyn early cuz hes going to keep getting bucket after bucket if you dont averaging 11 points a game this season is Lyn kid had 14 and 12 at MSG the Mecca on Tuesday a loss for Miami facing Tennessee they lost 7562 about the close clest anybodys played Tennessee this season and what frustrated coach Len Anga so much Miami was within six in the second half but again they just let it slip away you know what that happens sometimes fing on threepointers some offensive fouls certain things happen thats why you dont want to be too close against the better teams in the country theres no room for error personal foul was on Matthew Cleveland his first team first Im loving this Presbyterian offense if you look at theyre running a floppy action floppy action the two bigs line up on the Block and guards come off those screens its going to have Miami moving on defense and really get your guards going on offense early miny shot was no good a zone defense for Presbyterian as Johnson gets it down low to kid now he pops out hell fire away for three and that was too strong and missed off to the right Obie Stewart down with the rebound for Presbyterian trying to go coast to coast and he had it blocked but he was fouled at the rim and hell go to the free throw line if you watch that play you kind of want to stop transition early kind of re back pting a little bit on that play now allows the guard get downhill for a layup in transition you never want to be back pading you want to kind of stop the ball and get that foul early instead of getting the shoot so Stewart goes to the free throw line where hes a 73 shooter this season and that one rolls in Quinton Ferell is the head coach of Presbyterian a small School in South Carolina in a Clinton South Carolina enrollment just under 2000 kids man got a sharp hairline on the Mi I got to get a get me right even steep thats we call those coach frells in his sixth season 54 victories and 108 losses for the Presbyterian blue hoost this is his first crack at being a college coach as Brandon Johnson throws it away in the back court Divine ug chupu was going one way and the pass was going the other you know I I I blame both of these guys on that pass I think Divine should have caught that but usually you know when youre behind defense you need to be behind the offensive player he need Divine needs to be back more so when that press comes you want to be behind your your player thats still need the Music ball Miami with a turnover their first of the afternoon jarian feeds it down low to Caleb Scott the big forward and throws it down in he said I want some of that action too great move rip over the top two feet stop clam jam 68 senior forward and a transfer from Georgia State heres AJ State McCrae his three is no good and the big strong Caleb Scott comes down

over the last minute Lind kid into the corner State McCrae is blocked by Scott but a foul was called and AJ State McCrae will go to the free throw line for a pair you know I would love to see this Miami team be a little bit more vocal out there you make a shot you know tap your team in on the butt get them going say pick it up you know look at other teams they come in theyre super energetic theyre super happy to be here I think we need to be in more gratitude on this basketball this University Miami basketball team and Miami utilizing a different starting lineup this afternoon no Nigel pack for Miami and Presbyterian without a key player as well that would be Jonah pierce the senior forward out of Sanford Florida hes been out since before Thanksgiving when he was at the starting lineup Presbyterian had Kobe Stewart Cory mincy and Jonah Pierce all averaging double figures as that one rolls on in for State McCrae miams within two little over three minutes into the basketball game here this afternoon as miny works with the left hand St McCrae trying to poke it away Parish the third into the corner handoff three no good Brandon Johnson down with a rebound and now he nearly threw it away with Matthew Clevelands got it hell spot up for three that rolls in and out but Divine UGA chuku Soares in hands it off the Lin kit hes spinning and Johnson thought about a three now hell drive and he rolls it up and there with the right hand off the glass thats next move you know Brandon Johson is a big time threepoint threat so all he really needs to do is show the ball once theyre running at him and he can get to the b a big bite and can finish roll the B doing more of that Miami stops the bleeding it was a seven nothing Run for the blue hoes tied at seven 4 minutes in up and off the glass and missing with a right hand layup attempt was Jamari Harvey the senior out of fille North Carolina chance now for Miami to retake the lead and thats going to be a foul on Cory

on offensive glass right now and now Caleb Scott whos a bit bigger is going to check back in and presumably be tested with trying to keep the kid in check SC will go to the scores table kids first nothing but the bottom of the mat L kid has a very very unique ball placement on his shot look at look how his hands are on the ball when he shoots he doesnt really have his whole Palm on the ball or his whole fingers on the ball great rotation that goes in you cant change it but its very unique he is shooting nearly 95 from the free throw line this season and he missed that one and that rolls out

Miami leads by eight Music right now four for four from the field six rebounds and almost 12 minutes to play cant beat that coasting towards another double double which would be a thir of the Season Jaylen Blackman just had Matthew Cleveland wide open down low underneath the bucket couldnt get it to him the ball was tapped out of bounds by the blue hose so it is Miami basketball with 19 seconds on the shot clock 849 left to play in the half and now instead of Blackman itll be Bea to take it out for Miami and he gets it into black Paul Jo Bay is into the game for Miami now Blackman has a wide open Matthew Cleveland who works inside he crushes it I love when Matthew Cleveland gets downhill on straight line drive one of the best in the country getting the ball downhill finishing off two feet

very good from the free throw line this season got that keep playing through Lyn kid you got to hes going to be a staple in this offense you know for the foreseeable future of this season these are the type of games that give you great confidence going into your next game so keep feeding the ball keep letting him learn how to play When the double team comes thats something I say he needs to work on but when he gets it with no double team thats almost a guaranteed bucket every single time Gams are six of their last six from the field now Scott shouldering Lin kid he Soares with a righthanded hook shot its good two big bodies there Scott is not backing down man he is not backing down he want all the smoke shutout out Matt barn and stepen Jackson he wants all the smoke you got to feed him back loose ball kid picks it up hands it off to UGA chupu The Freshman out of Texas trying to find somebody five on the shot clock State McCrae with the left hand into the paint spins up with the

Harvey hands it off to King blueo working a long way from the basket now miny directing traffic he bombs one away no good Jaylen Blackman down with a rebound three or four Miami Hurricanes soaring for that basketball defensively and they turn it into a triple on the other end of the floor this is the jayen black with that un REM me want to see when they br him in from ston look at him as a dynamic score and a confident scorer you can see without a nigal pack he can go in there and play his game 445 left to play in the half pway down low for Scott double Applause team and now King steps back from the free throw line oh and he buries a jumper and hell try to convert a threepoint opportunity he was fouled going up by state McCrae I King with the step back and one you hear me another look little push off same leg same hand step back with a little skip a little extra skip to that got to finish your breakfast though think he going to make the free throw I was a batting man Id say yes but hes a 57 free throw shooter this season must youre not a better man I think I might change my tenor like I told you he was going to miss it off to right so King cannot convert the unconventional threepoint chance Miami leads by 13 now the blue hose will crank up the pressure defensively down low for kid who gets double team s Matthew Cleveland from the free throw line great P thats a professional play right there take a one two dribbles in the paint raising over guide thats where hes great when he gets in the paint and elevates over guys look in the country at that small forward a

of momentum going for the University Miami Hurricanes Great Stop hopefully he can throw that momentum and hope he prary can come down and get another the basket was certainly the right call as well the fifth foul by Miami press pan has been charged with six now Scott down low on kid three on the way the South Pawn no good Stewart with the Miss and now Jaylen Blackman nearly had it poked away UGA chuku lefthanded drive and he finishes on the other side of the rim with a right hand Beautiful Finish beautiful finish by Divine I want to see more of that he hasnt really been that aggressive to attack in the basket went largely unnoticed in high school down there in Texas he was ained by hakee elijahwan now miny in the paint thr it up with the right hand again thought he was fouled and he missed the shot Kanes lead is 14 but under a minute left to play as uuku slips one down low for kid who looked right spun left had it blocked and it falls into the hands of Brandon Johnson who dunks it and Miamis lead is 16 with 27 A2 ticks left to play here in the half well step aside well take a break with him and be right back got a couple of points this afternoon it came off that last dribble drive there Jen great drive we caught about an inside reverse legay when you have the ball and the defender on your outside of your body and youre able to turn your body put your body on defense use that inside hand and go up for the layup beautiful move by Divine thats one of his favorite shots you watch previous games he loves getting to the paint and finish on the inside of his right hand and he is about as quick as you can come by he is so darn good when he puts the basketball on the floor so precipitar appears as if theyd like to hold it for the last shot it is into the hands of Cory miny near half court 15 seconds to go Miami leading by 16 mincy guarded by UGA chuku and he hands it off now miny has it back drives with the right hand has it poked away and it rolled out of bounds Blackman if he kep that thing in he had a wide open look on the other end of the floor as time winds down but its Presbyterian basketball side out with 4 and 12 seconds left the best Ive seen Blackman all year and its not just the way hes scoring its how active he is on defense how active he is with his hands how book hes being meny with two down low clock expires in the first half comes to an end here in Coral Gables this afternoon Miami leading 4933 thatll be next Saturday J Matt conference yes shout out to the max shout out to Sienna SS lights camera action and away we go here in the second half in Coral Gables Miami opened up as a 19 and 12 Point favorite this afternoon they lead by 16 as we start the second half kid with 14 Johnson with 13 Miami out rebounding Presbyterian 197 jumper fading away Cleveland good Matt does not miss that shot when hes able to rise and Elevate on his jump shot its very very hard to up mincy slings it down low for Scott who elevates with the left hand and that rolls in right over top of the fingertips of Lin kit Scott Scott with a little Shake of his head like man this man cant guard me Scotts got eight four six from the field look for Lyn to go right back at him right now up top for Matthew Cleveland and then he lays it up with the right hand off the glass and he go to the free throw for another its a great pass arine a very confident pass thats not an easy pass to make when you had an athletic guy like Matthew Cleveland he can go up and get that and he was going up for an alleyoop but he had Kobe Stewart right there on his backside Miamis lead at 20 as Matthew Cleveland converts the threepoint play hes got nine mention Caleb Scotts name who just made that previous bucket the big fella down low for press Presbyterian he leads all Presbyterian players this afternoon with nine the Presbyterian blue hose maybe if we get a chance well tell you a little bit about that nickname yeah Ive been Ive been wondering about that before we wrap things up as Scotts got another hes got 10 and he was all sorts of covered up by Johnson and kid boy hes a big strong D down low about that skying for an offensive rebound strong strong strong thats an animated big fell Im sure look like he looks like a character yeah hes playing out of his mind right now as well on muscle from head to toe as he misses the free throw was too short he scowls as he backpedals back down the floor if I was Presbyterian I might just continue to feed the big fella down low a weaving offense here for Miami 10 on the shot clock ston McCrae with the left hand goes up with the right gets fouled hell go to the free throw line Great Tech you want to have players on your team that can attack the basket when the shot clock runs low this the second time weve seen AJ get to the paint either finish layup or Draw the foul you want to see that from your starting guards in the lineup AJ line AJ State McCrae has three points this afternoon an 83 free throw shooter this season is State McCrae the red shirt junr out of Sanford in the Sunshine State KS have two Florida transfers this year not from the University of Florida but State McCrae out of sford and Jaylen Blackman the senior out of ston Music KES Lee back to 19 that was nearly thrown away but tracking it down is Harvey heres Cory minsu the canes have kept in check this afternoon he sails that into the third row he Im that guy that stands out a shot you got to shoot that you got to stand up and shoot yeah you got to stand up and shoot that might as well you dont get many of those chances right yeah its probably the only chance you ever going to get and then if you knock it down youre own sports center yes nothing to lose right we wont show you if you airball it uku had it Stripped Away Great take by theine but I would love to see him push the ball out in front of him when he picks the ball up extend those arms so that defense cant get their hand on the Basketball Baseline out of bounds they get it into kid working off a couple of screens state in M Craig now lobs it down low for Johnson whos going to work on Stewart Music now Cleveland with three down to two spinning firing in a foul and thats going to be a foul on Brandon Johnson an offensive foul with a push down low look like he got a bit too much of Cory miny shoved him out of the way I like to himit being aggressive you want to you want to see your players being aggressive youre up 19 stay aggressive keep your foot to the pedal well and I would imagine that Miami head coach Jim Lena is okay with an aggressive offensive foul as well way too many times this season Miamis been outrebounded theyre giving up way too many offensive rebounds on the defensive end too many Second Chance opportunities so youre going to show a little aggression coach probably okay with that huku nearly traveled and now Cleveland throws it up off the glassine when to get into that spin move they cut it off yeah great balance by the mind to find an extra pass he met the requirement of the two steps and went airborne right into the chest of his Defender and while he was up there he found an open man and another lease on life for the Kings who lead by 21 and the officials tightening things up here early in the second half already the 13 foul look at this he goes well you know what he almost I think he might have really lost it get smile young kid just happy to be out there might giving the young man a little bit too much credit that with his back turn to the basket he found the Man passed it to him I think he got stripped away and it landed in the lap of ly kit in the corner Harvey for three was it tip no well maybe but the air ball regardless now Miami will push it State McCrae threw it away he was looking for ly kid its a tough play you never want to jump and pass you want to kind of land on two feet and make your pass good for Parish thats his third for the Miami Applause native its a big c uh supporting section behind this you heard the the Roars is Johnson got fou on his way to the hoop and theres 1559 left to play here in the second half well step aside Miamis lead is 18 good action

ball game this afternoon in Miami canes with a commanding 17point lead but Presbyterian jack is not going to go quietly theyve really and aggressively started to pick things up offensively here in the last couple of minutes for sure you know games like this you dont want to have the opposing team lingering around because when the game gets close its tough it gets really tough on you but you know Presbyterian is not stopping like this like we said theyre down 17 theyre playing theyre down seven and they inbound it and now in the paint Caleb Scott goes up and hes going to the free throw line he was looking to dunk that thing from thec logo he about MJ he was p with the right handing but to the left look where he took off right from the logo I dont understand why he just didnt dunk it he didnt have to go underneath the ball I feel like he thought thought he was going to get hit in contact and he did ultimately get hit he ends up with the free throw line Brandon Johnson getting set to check back in for Miami having a great game right now 10 points and his free rebound rebounds Now link kid will check out and now Miami doesnt have a whole lot of size out there theyre pretty darn even there with Presbyterian bunch of small boys out there get out transition I I would love to its a speed lineup everybody can shoot the basketball everybody can attack the rim curious to see what

the ball goes witha who got bodied up with the left hand that didnt roll and it rolled off the front of the iron its a great take like that tap and thats a travel but theyre going to call a foul and the bucket is good I feel bad for betho on that play it was a great take didnt quite finish and they scored in transition but I love the aggressiveness by Julio so Peterson will go to the free throw line for one more opportunity as Parish will check in for Presbyterian Matthew Cleveland check is for be Paul Joe Bay will check in for Matthew Cleveland Applause actually Clevelands going to stay and Jaylen Blackman will take a seat and after its all said and done the free throw is good his lead 19 and the blue hose will continue that pressure defensively uku with a screen from Joe Bay who goes strong to the rack thats what you want to see you want to get in the game get right to it Paulo Bay little pump little Le made it look very very Music easy Paris works on huku hands it off Stewart bombs away for three that was halfway down Kobe Stewart thinking what Applause gives now Divine had it poked away and then he fouled Jaylen Peterson 36 left to play good defense real good defense couldnt get that snatch back to the legs fast enough see what hes trying for one thing I will say about Devine doesnt turn the ball over much no thats his first turnover the day Miami with four turnovers in the afternoon to Presbyterians 2 now jayen Peterson the Richard sophomore the georgo will go to the line for a one inone chance and he Nails the first and hell get the second Applause second free throws no good Presbyterian has not been very good from the charity strike this afternoon shooting just 60 six of 10 and that is a 10c violation Joe Bay and uku couldnt get it over in time thats a turnover in the fifth Miami A little sloppy here for the canes Applause sloppy coach LGA was contesting that that was not a 10second violation oh counts it seemed to be good look down low and a bucket there for your boy I King this game is not over no theyre up 18 8 minutes and the momentum is looking like prep preparing Presbyterian way thats thats a tough one its getting a little sloppy here for Miami and that was blocked down low Jo Bay had a good look now heres a three thats too short the following is Miss getting it back out is Harvey and now its down low for Jaylen Peterson thats a dunk for the blue hoose and Jim Lena takes a timeout with 741 left to play in the game this Presbyterian team is not stopping you got to get those 5050 plays you cannot let the other team get that and finish that follow the Miss and a dunk well be back probably a 10minute stretch or so yeah the energy is there and theyre down 16 you need to have that energy you got to have that energy and Miami is lacking it right now you want to see a little bit more energy going in to close his game up Miami a minute ago got called for a 10second violation they get this one over just in time and they go back we said at beginning of the game scientists Define energy as the ability to do work you aint got no energy cant do any work Cleveland down low for kid who spins still spinning finds a wide open Brandon Johnson there we go energ picked up some real composure there by link kid great composure definitely seeing some enhancements in his decision making out of the double team Miami head coach Jim L immediately popped up out of his seat celebrate that dunk now walking into a three and missing is Harvey kit down with a rebound and the canes can get back into their half court offense ston McCrae Works off the screen kid wants it down low still wants it now hes got it now and Scott this has been a good matchup all day kid finds a little room o thats a beauty the left hand off the glass if you dont bring that double team he can reverse pivot def fence on the other side great move great move elevating and missing is parish and here come the kanes in transition looking to run a little bit State McCrae bombs away for three way too short almost like he intended to do it with UGA chupu right there underneath the right underneath the hoop now Cleveland bullies his way down low that is good hell go back to the free throw line give him 20 with an opportunity to make it 21 I love when Matt Cleveland gets the ball with his back to the basket in the paint very tough to guard back there hes usually bigger than a two guard and probably a little bit stronger than three man with his high release its hard to stop that man thats a pretty move there by link kid off the glass with the left hand great move by look at this one1 ISO body too little too small all that any game LeBron shugs too bad King iris is not out here to have anything to say about it so 21 for Cleveland Miamis lead is 23 and thats a turnover last season Matthew Cleveland was the leading score on multiple occasions and he scored 10 plus in 22 games last season that bucket is good for kid Matt Cleveland has G this te some some some added energy hes getting loud hes screaming hes flexing you got to have that when you need your team to get energy and this energy does not stop now this is going to propel them to the rest of the season easy little dump off there for Brandon Johnson on that Baseline Drive doesnt get much easier than that kid with the Finish Kane scored 113 points in their opener against fairlight Dickinson backed that up two games later here against C and state at home at 93 they got 87 with five and change left to play this afternoon heres miny got a relatively quiet day but he spins there and connects nice hes got 14 miny needs to be way more aggressive right now try to get his team back in his basb game being down 23 Running Out of Time quickly we head towards our final media time out of the afternoon again down low and Link kid have it swiped away in transition miny had it blocked by state Applause McCrae one thing about McCrae he gives you a lot more than just offense hes very very strong defensively super athletic reminds me a lot of Drew holiday boy his leg buckled there too that looked really ugly fortunately hes okay now driving and finishing with the right hand is Applause Peterson it would appear as if the canes will indeed snap that seven game losing streak that started back on November 21st when they went to the Shriner childrens Charleston classic and Charleston South Carolina a great shot great pass by Divine made it simple Double K throw back to your big for three Brandon Johnson now the leading score for Miami with Applause 22 theres a foul on the floor and thatll send Carl Parish the third to the free throw line when we come back final TV timeout of the afternoon Brandon Johnson hes got 22 bombs away and he connects for three Brandon Johnson with 22 points for the Miami Hurricanes this afternoon 9 of 11 from the field that is a quality day partner quality day and hes letting the game come to him if hes open for the three he shoots it he gets the three someone runs out as one dribble going to the basket for a finish or dribble off to his teammate great game by Brandon coming off his last game thats what you want to see coming back stronger than ever the transfer from East Carolina is eight points shy of a career high that he established last season when he had 30 against the now ACC SMU Mustangs on February 4th 2023 so that would actually be two years ago its good to see a guy like Paris that went to New Orland High School come back and get a chance to play in front of his family you know some of his coaches shout out to my guy King was used to coach him and its good to come back you know back to Miami and see your especially for the holidays holiday season absolutely great present Cleveland uses the highsc screen passes it to Johnson who tried to get it down low a kid but it was taken away uh turn over by Miami its their seventh of the afternoon Stewart hands it off little head Fate by Wilson Johnson guarding parish and he hands him off to Cleveland Parish on the left wing now he drives and a little float over left hand good thats tough with the left hand thats a strong finish over Matthew Cleveland wrong Defender tough finish I couldnt see with with the coach there was that off his left foot too well I dont know that was a great saw High arching lefthanded finish need to replay of that finish now they get it down low for kid who spins had it taken away he spun right into traffic thats why he got to bring the double team to a dynamic score in the post that L kid miny dribbling still dribbling still dribbling now he stops Stewart for three on a line thats a heat seeking missile that he buries they still playing I love the way this this Presbyterian team is playing theyre not stopping because theyre down theyre still fighting to the final buzzers well this is an opportunity too even though youre down 17 points you might as well work on some of those late game situations
