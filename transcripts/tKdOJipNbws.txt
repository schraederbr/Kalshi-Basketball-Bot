here we go Virginia Tech with it to start Grant basily trying to kick it out for Darius Maddox and a turnover its a lot of Cooper pushes finds the freshman and Jason Hadley starts the score Brazilian looked like he was shocked to see a double almost a triple come active hands for the Gophers allowing a run out for an offense and struggles to score the half court Good Start see the starters for the Hokies shot Padula the sophomore point guards the leading scorer at 17 a Game Hunter Couture 42 from three for his career Music starters for Minnesota it is a very young team under Ben Johnson in year two bunch of freshmen out there talat Cooper is the transfer from Moorhead State hes the point guard ly over Max tough shot all four for Gene and Henley from Ontario California its a tough shot I mean contested fading away hell live with those percentages not in the go first favor but again a nice start from Minnesota locked in in this road environment watching Virginia Tech offensively is so fun to watch they are so smooth they attack the boards and Justin Muntz draws a foul on the Gophers I love mutzs approach when that ball goes up he has a warranty he attacks that class look at the empty space in the eyes I was waiting to find that thing nobody locates a body on The Versatile big hes long hes athletic he moves laterally well dude that allows him to be one of the better offensive rebounders in the ACC first foul on Dawson Garcia good on the first preseason all accs second team sixth year senior and he fits in so well in this community in this atmosphere and you mentioned it off the top Mike young adores him that is an active statue that is a lot of different stats being stuck on a sheet kind of guys you like to play with dont need the basketball to have an impact its not a note one of two players in the country averaging that stat line or better here in the first few weeks Music drives automatics we got a pink Bend but dont break defense for Maddox there beat off the bounce can recover Music from all three levels traveling the call on months and another hokeys turnover plus a little eager on the catch one of the challenge The 67 Freshman see if hes willing to play physical basketball needs to be a little bit more composed before he delivers a basketball move soda 42 their best win over cow last week did overtime out in Southern California then had a loss there to UNLV the other loss at home against DePaul this is a matchup to watch right here Hunter Couture 63 on a 67 Jamison battle who is the everything scorer for this group just getting healthy just getting his win and thats what Dawson Garcia can do he is versatile he has to assert himself early in this game he has to hunt shots to alleviate some of the pressure off of battle to be the lone dog first year back playing for his hometown team started his career at Marquette and Carolina last year for Dawson Garcia Maddox on the drive on the Baseline with a tough finish Applause I like that from Maddox he struggled to shoot the basketball from Beyond The Arc doesnt settle for a look there eager to drive it get the best possible look seven a piece far first three minutes Cooper got by Padula to the rack slow and steady Music Cooper on the inbounds on the Minnesota like young well drafts fourth year at the helm the ACC tournament champions last year in his third season dudes one of the best coaches in all college basketball programs have an identity these guys respond to them you know what kind of basketball youre going to get from this group I mean hes a joy to be around really enjoy every interaction I have with Coach young whos got something really going here in Blacksburg Music you told me today you think Mike young maybe the top 20 coach in the country is that it stand by a couple hours later check with me before you throw those things out there sometimes I say it in confidence and its a hot take but thats when Ill go publicly Applause Music Garcia looking for an outlet finds Cooper seven to shoot the point guard on the drive got Stripped by mutts and cant recover The Duel in the takeaway Jewelers stepped in at the starting job this year storm Murphy graduated from last years team and medulla is confident hes a guy thats got the swacker the confidence he likes having the ball in his hands making plays and right there just no respect to get up in his face makes him pay told us today at shooter out yeah as as anyone Ive ever coached he said it borders on arrogance in a good way I love having a basketball player hope to be a timid guy out there on the floor battle wanted one from way downtown he does have that kind of Rage settlement though battle needs to challenge the defense run off some screens make them work find an advantage dont just sit there by catch and shoot for well beyond NBA range but Doula nearly turned it over but zilly and Garcia went diving and the arrow will give it to Minnesota doing it with their defense so far just getting started in this ACC 10 challenge in Blacksburg Applause Music by a pair their only loss last Sunday against the College of Charleston seeing his team offensively struggled to knock down shots these last three games and I remember this when I played for Mike brand Notre Dame offensive minded groups that are Elite was spacing and shooting theyre never going to be concerned with the struggles there offensively because they know the talent on the roster and how theyre good there what will draw the ire defensively the effort on the glass those type of things promotionally defense thats been the bugaboo in these last few games coach young wants to see A Better Effort there and I have seen in the half court theyre just not taking care of the basketball allowing some runouts Five Points off turnovers for the Gophers here early yeah a couple of turnovers for him that has been the meanwhile for Minnesota in the early Governors yeah I love the effort here the energy from the Gophers out of the game I mean its a group thats not used to being in a hospital Road environment against the P5 and they look calm and collected early they bring two more freshmen into the game including Pharrell Payne who has a bright future Mike I love this kid he is so raw look at his body thick muscle walk athlete remember the name Pharrell Payne that guy is going to be a force in the Big Town 255 as a freshman I think coach black wants him on the football field on gridironment span Ford all right hes hes in the right spot coach Ben Johnsons got a good one there battle attacking the closeout of Couture to foul on Hunter Couture his first calls for the basketball shows hands competency Cooper to deliver it moves it and how about battle gets it back to him in the dunker spot right there catch and fish I said to Ben Johnson today he was under recruiting why he said three words people are stupid so true got me out here on ESPN Applause off the screen from Payne drobing for space Garcia on the offensive glass and its blocked by facility Applause Music all the pushes and backs it out Mike young wanted to see more from Grant bazilly 21 in white the Wright State transfer on that defensive end now he lost the handle and he was the last to touch it the same amount of turnover on the roster in year two but the difference so much of it is Young this year where as it was a lot of vets and transfers last year yeah I want to go back to that play though from Brazilian on the post great effort on the shot block but you catch down low you got a five inch Advantage keep it high so Cooper the guardian stripping you got to win those oneonones down on the low block every single time Mike if I catch on a low block against you Im hoping that thing Im not keeping it low for a mouse like you to take it first thats my only chance five foot nine good defense on the interior from Lincoln out of bounds with 41 to shoot a very Mighty Mouse Applause Music how about Lynn kid hes coming on strong second year at Virginia Tech after transferring from Clemson he played played eight minutes down the stretch last time out on Friday you know so active in that game they rode him down the stretch over basily just because lead kid was just that good in that act good length to him physical has really worked in the weight room on his body as well four to shoot for the Gophers look at the tour battle with no breathing room against Hunter Couture when coach young talks about Couture in months whos this light about him because these guys are everything he wants in Pillars of his program just the effort just get into him I got this best score on the Gophers just uncomfortable the door comes off the screen gives it up for butts trying to drop it off and paint tips it away paralysis by analysis he had two two unselfish thats got to be a scoring play to draw a foul for months he cant thread a needle in the interior like that too much traffic be green other Virginia Tech turnover Music Boris Samuels zero and maroon is coming to the game the Dartmouth transfer for Minnesota Carrington another freshman gives it up to Garcia poor to shoot Samuels working on Couture forced into a top two back iron and the rebound snatched by Kid Music Applause butts off the bounce working on Payne he is the king of the pivot down there Minnesota wanted a walk and instead butt straws are foul mutz was determined to give back and get a shot off after that last possession he has the ability at six foot seven to push it in the break one of the alluring traits of him as a basketball player I thought he was working overtime there could have moved it but like the wherewithal to say Im gonna get a whistle but he does first foul odd Payne and months back to the line hey tomorrow six four games in the ACC Big Ten challenge including a double header over on ESPN 7 30 Eastern Illinois hosts Syracuse then 9 30 number three Virginia visits Ann Arbor and Tangles with Michigan both games also available on the ESPN app how about the start for Tony Bennetts team how about those whose in the face of just terrible tragedy for that basketball team to Rally around each other bring some positive when that that that that school in that that town in Charlottesville really needed it they won the best preseason tournament free Speakman twoway player and Armand Franklin looking like the Franklin from the Hoosiers with the sharp shooting ability Music great trip on that Friday Sunday swing pots Miss Bull and now he commits an offensive foul taken by Jameson battle for the Gophers Russells out of control I do know that second Team Battle was anticipating that second end of the hoagies with that left shoulder battle was in just good enough a position to take that he was not impeding any path to write call top energy and emotion so well youre sensing hes a little amped up early on early on I think hes trying to do too much offensively hes in a little bit of foul trouble so hell sit him I also think it helps for him to get into a more steady mindset here early Music blocked at 11 8 minutes in Josh Ola Joseph another freshman with a strong take at Brazilian that is too easy theyre trying to challenge Brazilian every time on the catch theyve identified him as one of the weaker Defenders on the floor right now my account was saying hes got to adjust to this physicality at this level Maddox cant tie it up and Carrington runs down the rebound really good start for the Gophers Music three freshmen a transfer and battle on the floor for Ben Johnsons group they probably Gophers Im trying to get bazillion to pick and roll try and see if he can defend Carrington can stroke it this fires from deep and MJ Collins was out of bounds on the rebounding action so Minnesota will have it on the other side Music Minnesotas come to play early on driving the basketball challenge is very young heres why six turnovers for Virginia Tech in the first nine minutes of basketball nearly half of their possessions theyve given the basketball away and when theyve given away Mike the Gophers have been opportunistic on the other side nine points off of turnovers when you turn it over at that rate its takes away your ability to find a rhythm offensively that is always Advantage the opponent the Gophers have a belief now hey we can guard we can translate like translate that into offense and thats why they are competitive and leading in this game currently what do you like about what Ben Johnsons building but he wants to get quality guys he wants to win this state he understands the importance of doing it theyve got a ways to go there but he wants to get quality guys that want to come out here and master their role understand what he wants here and thats coming its only year two theyve done all this so far first nine minutes with just one bucket from Battle and Garcia and that is a foul battle down to the spot Music looks like hes yeah you look like you said I like to call it Ill take a charge there I like the mindset from the door coming help side to take that charge thats a high basketball IQ play defensively battle is still scoreless Minnesota by two Music Angel Poteet the rice transfer body Bruiser scores his first two a lot more depth in the front court for Virginia Tech this season even with the loss of Kevin Aluma Music foul away from the ball OT was bodying there with Pharrell Williams Music to Hoagies check it out Garcia checks back in for Minnesota now we were told pregame that Garcia a little bit under the weather Ben Johnson found that out during shoot around yeah I feel like symptoms look this is his demeanor so its really hard to tell hes kind of got that sometimes he presents about him where hes kind of lackadaisical so its hard to read on body language yes we were informed hes playing under the weather today thrilled the three earlier now back into the game for bet Johnson Music working on Couture with that push offensive value in the yard bar to dictate space and that is because of the ball pressure once again Hunter Couture he aint the most athletic guy but he is athletic what he has is a is a desire to be great and get up in you never takes a playoff high motor thats what caused the turnover in the arm bar it was over his big space hes got all sorts of experience too matched up with the Freshman Henley show this theyll go to his zones five percent of the time but bazilly can shoot it and stretch the floor Brazil has made the most threes on this team if theyre gonna go Zone you have to have an awareness of the most capable shooter in the lineup and it is the big fella I was knocking him down at a high rate too to go along with that volume Carrington off the screen from Garcia who wanted it back Ola Joseph makes his first Collegiate three but Brazilians understanding the Scout sayola Joseph doesnt shoot the three ball but you dare him after a couple possessions to take that thing springy freshman from Brooklyn Park 20 minutes Northwest of the barn Applause Music for the Hokies its saved by Poteet and then a great find for Maddox who swirls it out offensive rebound potee carving out space gets the roll Music of the activity from Poteet he is really injecting life down low thought he shuffled his feet there should have been a travel but yet still big fellow held scoreless in the last few games coming out here and giving his team wife 265 pounder relentless Garcia slipped for the cutter Ola Joseph spinning that is smooth but a misfire from Garcia and Collins runs it down Applause Maddox quick first step and he draws a foul odd Henley Minnesota Music six nine whatd you say he is 65 its all muscle he has got bodies flying off and theres some young guys in the lineup in the interior for the Gophers theyre not used to seeing an upper class and put together like this hes got guys bouncing off and hes chasing the rebounds hes making good reads on passes as well screen for Couture back out for months Music Shiloh with Poteet hes got the size advantage and he goes to work and hes got a half Music to poet Josephs giving up about 70 pounds there in a couple inches thats a favorable matchup for potique down low and Johnson then wait around hes got Corel Payne at the scores table ready to check in at the next availability the foul away from the ball with eight to go and how about the minutes off the bench from the big fella Ill tell you right now you cant spell poteets without eat that young man the easy bucket studio for how many overtimes of Carolina Alabama I left and I was able to make it home significant drive to watch the conclusion in the fourth overtime of that game what did not make your flight here to Blacksburg last night did not took the drive from Charlotte to Blacksburg put on a couple Tunes listen to some hoes got some DMB in there Chris Stapleton I covered them all before I got here a Clyde listened to all types of music before I knew it two and a half hours was done I was good just like that just under eight to go first half low scoring first half between Minnesota and Virginia Tech and the Gophers get a much needed Bucket from Pharrell Payne just checked back into the game double last Monday against Cal Baptist 15 and 13 first Minnesota freshman with a doubledouble since Daniel oturu medulla could muscle it in past Cooper tell you what pain didnt even know how good he is and how good hes gonna be Cooper pulls up knock it down in a Minnesota foul rebounding action on Brady gotta let him play a little bit down low why do you say that about pain that he doesnt even know because its so wrong that body hes just starting to figure out how long how strong of a guy he is and the punishment he can put on interior Defenders athletic he can change ends look Im not saying hes bam out of Bio by any stretch of the imagination wait different skill sets but bear was very wrong when he came in Im not saying hes gonna be bad but Im saying he can have that type of presence at a measured level here for the Gophers Ben Johnson told us he got the job went and saw him the very first weekend and said wow and then some other Big Ten teams started snooping around and then Johnson got nervous and thats how recruit it goes you want a guy to keep keep being forgotten about this one of the guys that got to win in state Maddox was good on both free throws and Cooper responds with a bucket its a trip Applause you put pieces together for the Gophers you get the pains you want to try and find those three four star guys and keep them as a part of the go first program thats how this thing takes off theres no reason not to want to stay and play in Minneapolis not want to play with the investment they put facilities there for the Gophers addicts on a step back on a Miss Cooper clutches the rebound Music Cooper drives floats it up top for pain Cooper very methodical with how he gets to his spots hes got some uh some Derek Harper in him from the Knicks back in the day like gets to his spot methodically a doula responds for the Hokies Music Applause Music hes not overly athletic but he understands the high IQ guy where he needs to get to gets two feet in the paint defense commits goes upstairs to paint got a pretty good look for Garcia but back iron Couture the rebound hes by three The Duel in transition all the way to the cup thats unacceptable defensively you got to commit to the basketball before it comes across the timeline Sean Padula making him pay Gophers fighting but the Hokies with the counter thats what they do reminds me of those Nova guards he plays in a triple threat position fundamentally sound Elite with the basketball plays off too and makes the right read but understands what the game and what his team needs in moments and hes delivered like that all season I like storm Murphy last year and he was great for this team they put up a banner here they won the ACC tournament but I knew once it got passed over to Sean badul theyd be just as good because he could play look at that cutout thats the confidence were talking about my cell phone in my hand when theyre going through layup lines important at me I thought hes asking me to take a picture I have my light on hes telling me to turn the flashlight off Music thats his second offensive foul on battle still scoreless it is his third game back from preseason foot surgery trying to get in a rhythm still art hedge from Garcia medulla moves in Couture rebound Maddox and back out for butts and now Padula understand theyre jumping gotta make that quick move duel does a good job there to get that basketball moving take advantage of the defense and it provides a nice drive good defense from Garcia who went straight up and then Maddox hits the deck for it and the arrow will keep it at this end very impressed with the Gophers there I mean they are showing the double on Padula so the Hokies very astutely move that basketball but the Gophers recover well and get on the ground for the loose ball thats a nice counter offering from a defense knowing what they want to do but not letting an advantage get them despite the fact theyre being aggressive defensively you said its called the jump when they come out with that second guy yeah when the baller comes or jumping the ball youre bringing two to the ball handler seeing if you get rid of it try and generate a turn over there theres an advantage if you move in quickly shot clock winding down and brazily gets bumped different language Music good job theyre attacking a closed out from Brazilian they understand hes a shooter so theyre going to close out with a sense of urgency understanding with his skill set he can blow by and attack the rim good read there from the big fella second foul out Garcia as well puts the silly at the lot to time all conference at Wright State on the horizon League scored more than 1200 points in his career and he steps into that starting spot vacated by Kevin Luma knocks down ball seven points the margin thats as large as the lead has been on either side here in this first half Music Garcia sets the high ball screen and now Carrington turns the corner Cooper on the drive top following not there and Brazilian one arms the Reba Music 70 run the last two minutes medulla cant add to it and a soaring rebound from Carrington where do the Gophers go for offense its a great question I mean Garcia out there on the floor in Battle Run these guys off some Springs theyre Elite Shooters thats a catch with the defender right in front of you Kate is a big body sets of screens Couture got a tip battle wins it back Carrington Rises too strong the last to touch it as physical as clean as singlehandedly great Advantage for a shooter like a battle like a Garcia they need to run some action to get them rubbing shoulders off a big screener like that to find some advantages battle is one of the best players in the Big Ten now hes still recovering from injury that foot hes still gaining his conditioning but youve got to provide opportunities for your best score battle and scoreless here in the first half and Petula a goal 10 nearly swatted it right out of the air hey assistant who sends us to a timeout inside the final four in this first half and shot the goal is cooking Sean Petula low on the defense asleep spent the win off Garcia hey looking to bring it I dont know I want The Bigs to be fed its all about having success here twotime ACC Coach of the Year coach Greenberg as for this play right here thats not a goal ten you think still going on that balls still going up thats not a goal time thats an elite athlete blocking the shot and that kid is going to be a star Im telling you right now buy stock early in his Miller so coaches rising up for the jump shot I dont know about coaches jump shot I know hes the coach I know he could analyze I dont think coach has a jump he sees Cornett on the Block we gotta watch what hes saying because Ill have another Studio cutter to take a shot were just hanging in the balance medulla off the best I think gets the wall s Applause Music in traffic not sped up like finds is talking about the studio those were turnovers early because they were playing fast Padula never falls into that kind of category hes always in control Music cant respond kid the rebound its all Virginia Tech headed toward halftime Music post entry for kids but silly and knocked it down its okay thats good offense and its because its spurred when hes got good offense and let them knowing youre locked in defensively weve trying to be more active you block a shot like that youll make coach young happy playing off too and made that Nova guard comparison heck Mike yeah approach Mike young likes his guards to play a similar style it starts with guard play theyre getting it on its ends with Padula currently and how about bazilly as well because this coaching staff has challenged him early on this season to be more physical and to defend they will show that on film to him on repeat he has that ability when he locks in and provides the fight battle is still scoreless now oh of three and every shot he takes is a tough one Music Couture off the wing back for Padula Cooper is fronting Brazilian with a size mismatch there but doloff the hesitation on Garcia get the roll oh that is gorgeous for the door Glenn Watson and play one of nine kids one of nine kids hes gonna find his pain the offensive rebound and a chance at three and it stops a 130 run Washington always in control dribble drive against length doesnt foreign Music Defender so whats he do pauses use the rim the guard and get something I watch pain this right could be special Master Your Role now here coach Greenberg say this a lot be a champion in your role his is winning on a backboard Rim runs being that screener as well as the dive guy thats what you do early then you expand the role Music as well here in Blacksburg pokeys up 11 Applause Music is it pizza at all its cheese so crispy loaded with pumpkins and just 699 enough for two price for one new Pizza Hut melts to 699 in two seconds Eric will realize theyre gonna need more space got to sell the house oh open houses or skip the hassles and sell with confidence to Open Door request a cash offer at opendoorcom Music Mike young told us today about his point guard shampoo doing he thinks hes the biggest cat on the Block hes talking shot about his confidence he said he had youth coaches growing up who would say hey that confidence is what makes you the best its also what makes you the worst for great Charisma about I had a chance to Chomp it up with him enjoy the banter back and forth hes ready to take over as a point guard of his quad and he showed it early on Music Justin in midair Ive been impressed with brazilis aggression is probably the best way to determine here on both ends the shot block but hes been driving that thing not settling for the three ball Joseph bought earlier in the rebound he played the percentages there oh and Joseph hit one earlier lets see how many of those he can do play often is the right play working on the Baseline Brazilian moves it in for King backing down on Kane the kid scores for the right hand everybody wanted kid and play off the other shoulder because there was Daylight he wanted to get into his move thats repetition thats where he felt most comfortable when he delivers got a career high 11 off the bench on Friday lead is 15 in the final before halftime Cooper much needed triple hes got nine here are the first half he did that to stop the bleeding how can they close out here for the Gophers to make this a game you need to stop you ve got time to get something going the other way but you gotta rebound clean six and a half second difference between game and shotgun of the side comes from kid majula between the legs whats another get it to go paint the rebound 10 seconds for Minnesota like paddle right there John McMahon brought to a spot to get a walk young man Cooper has to force once up to six foot 11 in his face poor execution battles gotta run to a spot and call for it you got to be a star you got to think like one yeah your shots you got to go find him a big opportunity Miss from the Gophers 174 run for Virginia Tech to head to halftime you heard from him earlier its true player in the ACC this season very early I understand but took control of this game scoring in a variety of ways to study the ship and build a lead for the Hokies all right here we go second half action underway Minnesota and Virginia Tech 12 point margin Virginia Tech closed that first half on a big run Key by tazula after a back and forth beginning to the first half offensive Rebound with the stick back not there for the seventh quarter trayton Thompson off another Jameson battle Miss he remains scoreless for the Gophers I like the touchdown load of Brazil brazily early on foreign Applause Applause Music ER guy whos playing down low undersized and it wasnt overly physical move play on that should be a basketball move and finish six of the seven hokey turnovers from their bigs from bazilly and mutts who had three early ones battle has got to get going along two missiles theyre not quality shots he hasnt got a good look yet contested or no shot at all majority of this game third game backing back before this season surgery he told us today that the foot feels great maybe the conditioning a couple more games before hes back at 100 in that regard step back three lets go over Garcia Music battle crafty handle and now Jayden Hadley Applause Garcia just one bucket himself he knocked down a three in the first half out for battle yes sir three point faster maybe they can get their start going now nice to see him get the ball go through the basket here in the first minute of the second half if you want a chance your star has to be great the second stanza you know what he told us too hes got an ooze confidence he cant show his frustration with some misses as mutts answers but on a young team thats a big key for battle and I havent seen him use that confidence thats been the problem why its a doubledigit deficit going into the break was because he hasnt been that Alpha Minnesota is needed here on the road he hasnt been getting frustrated when he does Miss right I want him to be frustrated hes not getting looks he ran off the screen right there thats what you need to do he found a good look just couldnt convert him now you go back and guard the more sequences like that the ball will go in the basket because thats what he does and they are Force feeding him out of halftime they need some Music Thompson aint physical 210 pound seven footer gets tagged with a foul against him yeah then this is this is the idea Inside Out game with Garcia battle thats the formula for Minnesota and needs to be now here you run off the screen from Thompson Thompson did a fantastic job getting a body on Couture whos been up in him all game long just couldnt convert screens like that off a rugged Defender to get you a clean look and build momentum offensive battles taken for the five gopher shots since halftime these first two and a half minutes oh butts missed the bunny becomes a bear if you leave footwork to get in there its compunctuate Music Cooper line a lot of the scoring in that first half Garcia keeps it alive along the sideline he tore defensively man Master Class Im not biting on the head fake move in your feet commitment to guarding on tense five to shoot Garcia three swirls out tough shot he gets no good offensive rebounding opportunity and pain can be a guy that can punish a man Music plus seven on the boards Billy spinning on Cooper Applause hes got nine that matchup is six nine for six four we call that the mouse in the house that is a winning play every time offensively for the Hokies that matchup cannot continue on in this second half for Payne and bazilly went up defensively and it does stay at this end of the floor talk about being connected as a unit defensively Kane catches one two three three guys converging on him like piranha and murky Waters to make a play really stepped it up defensively tonight this battle on a cup right in front of the face instead lead shot clock for Cooper with a lot for team and hes blocked by bus theres a lack of creativity on the offering when paying attention thats where the raw shows face hell be able to as he evolves catch that ball playoff to a string but be able to be more creative with the delivery to the basket hes having the shot blocked twice thats where the young Talent can grow handle from Couture but it rolls off the rim so its like having more more looks to throw at us who he is I mean in high school at 69 you catch that youre hoping on whoever in college Justin Watson lead Defender hes throwing that thing back in your face short and hes showing some tired legs Manchester played him 36 minutes in 34 minutes his first two games back that was not the plan going in Applause Music formula we saw early in the first half turnovers allow a rhythm for runouts in the open floor Music its a lot of Cooper out of Roebuck South Carolina and a third hopes turtle Music Emily hits the gas and then blew a tire and hopefully hes all right Applause hes got a relay some early on in the future why didnt you do it that way what I proposed I was not merely as composed not execute as a level but just as much is defensively in this ball game tonight dont believe me take a look at this sequence here coach young says much as best defenders have approached beautifully Illustrated right here shows hard on the ball screen recovers back to his guy a wildly athletic mutts collects blocks the shot without Fallon you dont see that six seven big they can guard one through five on the floor that is an invaluable piece in the game of basketball Direction its going now dont believe me look at the NBA Boston Celtics come to the NBA finals Boston guy Mike Monaco because those five Defenders on the floor interchangeable pieces that is a hot commodity as you watch the game currently Mike young says just months he thinks hes the best defensive player in the ACC Music better be if its the best one hes ever coached yeah his first point since halftime after 13 in the first half Applause Music Garcia is it along for battle whips one in for pain now working on Poteet and thats thats a new look motique is one of the more physical Defenders youll see in college basketball ping moved him around with relative ease that is a freshman that is when you look and go oh this ceiling is a very high one how many freshman picks do you see 255 a foot good weight theres an intimidation Factor broad shoulders hes got the length ah I feel a pretty reverse Music Applause congratulations just go sit your seats out right side of your screen there they are the happy couple stamping people up and press row high fives strong Brazilian tapped away tell you what Im doing Im taking my woman home after she says yes thats just me oh there it is again he had a lot of people oh hes got the family there hes got good all right hell be good for Life throughout the family hes good I just got a lot of people to take pictures here where her nails done though they look like they were done hey Perfection does that indicate she was expected Music you talk to me if you have your nails ready expecting a proposal sure I didnt know where you were going but like youre saying nothing about to learn buds on the drive oh got it back and blocked by pain third effort is good for months almost saw a casualty wow that was impressive Music here chance that would have brought this place down 15point margin just over seven into the second half Cooper wants a screen from Ola Joseph shot clock winding down another Runner too strong Cooper got his Miss got it to go twopoint faster thats good but 55 thing within striking range in the second half theres just not enough offensive Weaponry for them to keep up in the game I mean if you got 12 minutes left here 36 points its going to be a consistent struggle for the Gophers to reach an eclipse 60 points a game this year thats just where they are Couture quarter three got a 191 career triples at Virginia Tech Virginia Techs used to having three four guys shoot over 40 for three right now its just but Doula and and Brazilian once you get Couture in there Maddox then this group starts to look like who we know them to be wall on the entry for kids Music he wanted the champ he wanted to end the game and call it right there on the spot on a nonetheless if at first you dont succeed dust yourself off try once there are four spacers around him everybody understands their role on that team theyre gonna locate a block out theyre gonna make the extra pass theyre gonna help side take a chart theyre gonna do everything to win unproven backcourt proved itself this past week thats the best team in the country right now five second count forced by the Hokies on talab Cooper whos better youre looking at me like Im crazy alone is going to foul out everyone in the country found out Dukes pigs with the quickness I went to the bathroom came back two guys were out of the game dudes got a size 20 shoe not impressed by that Music at The Rim Music Applause 18 point lead for the Hokies Music somewhere to go battles got three points on what are they shooting Garcia with three points as well one of six from the floor and currently on the bench Music shoot pain away you got to find pain as the dive guy there youre not scoring for the perimeter you gotta get that pick of the roll and fine pain is the dive guy let him complete the play medulla down kid battled on the boards but Carrington snatches it and you gotta run a transition Chase easy ones you cant score in a half court he had hardly seen any transition Pockets from either team both teams play at slow tempos and Coopers got a chance at three I like that call AJ decided with the right call there on the low block fastball on Brazilian section number three Sean Padula his first 13 pounds Music second half per minute its a right call thats a good move from Cooper down one two line 55 to Mom Cooper not only that I think he was under I think he was in a ring too Music Applause Cooper to the line its got 1310 for Minnesota Music for Ben Johnson after transferring in from Moorhead State Applause staring into the teeth of that Applause mutts runs down the rebound Lots Music Applause still a long way to go in this one 10 and a half left second half the margin 16 hard heads from Poteet theirs finding the Roman this time again it was Cooper again it was pink and that right now is their best option to score the basketball theyre not getting it from their best offensive guys theyre not getting it from Battle theyre not getting it from Garcia a big screener like Payne and being a dive guy at least is getting you something to then make them guard inside to then open something outside and this is the second worst shooting team in the nation from the freethrow line Virginia Tech an attention to detail a culture a programming they practice free throw blockouts in their walk through today you dont see that the reason why they practice that they know those balls are going to be careening off come free throw shooting with the Gophers so be ready to fight and rebound Applause Music you cant leave money on the table like that Mike you just cant and he said he tries to be hands off with his team in terms of talking about it because he can tell that it is such a mental thing so you practice it for sure thats one thing but try not to make it bigger than it is yeah its just its just another thing that doesnt help a group that is Young its in year two of Coach Johnsons tenure and those are unforced errors if you will you got to convert it a better clip than 55 and pain is really a guy that needs to think hey my future is going to see me at the line a lot and thats where Biggs becomes special the ones that make their free throws and to your point you noticed it about the Hokies right away and shoot around that they were practicing more than any team ever would on that absolutely and its attention to detail finding advantages in a game or taking away what could become a discipline a couple quick fouls on Josh Ola Joseph for Minnesota Music foreign Music one of five shooting four points for Darius Maddox 13 and white Ola Joseph tried to stick with butts but he scooped it around him I mean this is the Freshman being outclassed by a guy whos played a lot of basketball here patient Fred asterlike with the footwork to find an advantage in an angle day for months Music Applause and his weekends feature college football lineup uh conference Championship Saturday starts duties theyre not ABC with the Dr Pepper Big 12 title game Kansas State TCU then for the American Title UCF and Tulane and then in Primetime ACC Championship Game Clemson North Carolina events Sunday ESPN news Eastern the exclusive

awesome to watch protein short he was falling away through the contact shoveled out for Collins to knock it down Music Applause its over to Ola Joseph drives off the shot Peak and on the floor foul drawn by Ola Joseph absolutely Ive been impressed tonight with basilys defensive effort we know about the offensive skill set the threepoint ability also been impressed with how hes put it on the deck this young man is is putting on an effort defensively that has to please coach young in terms of what hes doing out there theres a commitment to that side of the basketball that side of the Court they wanted to see that whats that do for the Hokey ceiling well when youve got a guy who can guard alongside mutts as youre booking Biggs then youve got guys coming off like kid and Poteet provides a death I mean this is a group that Prides himself on defense youre not going to play for Coach young unless youre gone Music by Henley hey you only played Seven Minutes in the second half in a very close one possession back and forth game Friday here hes gonna get time on the floor because hes so good offensively Music and what this could do under coach young but when he guards I mean they got to keep him on the floor then battle runs down the Maddox Miss and battle pushes nobodys gonna like that that move from him and then hes not back in position and gives one on get back big fella and guard A Creative Advantage by trying to reach in a backcourt Minnesota has not been able to get out and run very much at all and that was their only hope generate turnovers make this game a one where you can run a little bit get some of those runouts they did that early by forcing turnovers thats been eliminated and the Hokies are really guarding the half court Couture Quick Step by Cooper Garcia went straight up Cooper was there as well and Minnesota claims the basketball on the other side just under eight to go in Blacksburg in the ACC Big Ten challenge I like that cop hey look coach knows some people just have all the luck Anthony Blacks got the hair Daddys got the game some people are just blessed but hes really exploded on the scene with the week he had during Feast week a volume guy put an efficient one so whats your volume 36 shots for leaky black for Caleb love excuse me okay thank you you know what I meant 36 shots from Kayla I wish my man leaky would take 36 I love that guy Im taking 36 shots is out of control and one defendant Bill Walton on the call for a horror overtime game it was a heck of a game and while Carolinas popped down to 18th in the country and we just be just fine theyre one of the best teams in the country two close losses won by combined seven points were gonna be all right Aaron Fox talking about Kansas he was talking at halftime about Grady dick I mean what an impressive freshman coach self said hes the best shooter hes ever coached you how many guys coach self has had in terms of talent but he played Underneath Him so smooth Garcia banging and kicking battle comes up short again Maddox the rebound Music Applause and Johnson said that to us the day about battle that maybe a little bit rhythmwise offensively with his legs he could sense that it was the first two games back yeah you know we asked him about the foot injury said its not the injury itself its a battling backing position terms of Rhythm and conditioning and when that comes hell be more of a factor on the floor for the Gophers I really enjoyed our visit with Jamison earlier today sharp young man yeah Garcia spins that one out doesnt the floor how about Garcia V wow and how he fits with battle and fits with the Gophers in his first year I think for me its Garcia understanding how tall he is what length he truly possesses 611 and I think understanding in 611 youre a matchup nightmare when you play a little three in some four use that to your advantage and I dont think thats clicked with him yet Id like to see them motor bumped up a little bit more the talent is there I just think the mindset needs to elevate over top 50 recruit first McDonalds AllAmerican to play for the Gophers since Chris Humphries about 20 years ago on three short for Cooper Music attacked the battle today he said yeah Ive known Dawson Garcia for so long same AAU organization and during covid they worked out together nearly enough as well uh Wisconsin Badger whos a standout those three really grinded together working out developed a bond its very very talented players 17th tell you what watching the Hokies and I knew they were a superior team coming in heavy favorites double digit favorites coming in does this be like the seventh best team in the ACC to you no Music I dont know who votes on these things I dont get it good defense by mutts pick behind the likes of Florida State I think everybodys shocked by whats happening on Florida State right now and Coach Hamiltons too great of a coach for it to stay alive though oh big block by Ola Joseph Von much Music Chelsea spins on basily the Freshman can muscle the past Brazilian yeah Leonard Hamilton dealing with suspension with injuries a lot that theyve had to endure early on this season their first eight games now you gotta do with zakiri on Wednesday Music job by Ola Joseph staying in front Music have to shoot months to the Baseline rolled off and last touch I think by pain and indeed and I think theyre right up there and he Notre Dame could surge if they put it together this old piece is there theres some young Talent then he marked his hammer at the point guard spot I looked at Notre Dame and Virginia Tech has two teams that could surprise for two more hes got six six seven does a great job of playing before the catch he wins The Battle Before the basketball makes it to his hands a lot of contact there now he does get black for the foul with Pharrell Payne whats right here just catches High post off his third its supposed to be pushed off here he prefers that because he has the ability to make it worked the mutts make some pain thatll probably do it for him tonight Music Applause it helps to have guys like Monson Couture that have been here for so long that you know what youre going to get foreign its one of his career highlights to at this point in their careers coach months and Coach Couture because there is so much mutual respect between those three and its easy to see why as much as hes left coaching him me working over the ACC up on Covenant because when I speak with such high praise for the Hokies program its guys like that have played such an integral role over first few seasons with Coach young they embody what hes about and you know how I feel about Coach Young Music top 10 depending on who you listen to easily thats all Im saying hes one of the elite coaches in college basketball Frankies never knew anybody Justice played by play guys youre number one so I can Brian Custer in a couple days yeah oh the Josephs spinning again cant work past the silly butt and its a Virginia Tech foul Music Ohio State and Duke and Durham and then out of Bloomington North Carolina and Indiana Im curious to see two bounce Backs from Duke and North Carolina and inside ACC bias there its just going to do kind of took on a couple losses Carolina took on a couple losses how are those groups going to respond Carolina is an old girl I expect them to have a better showin this early in response to some some uh some pushback as opposed to a Duke group that has a long way to go still very young 11 new faces go there I deal with Trace Jackson Davis and honestly in that environment Applause very good Indiana team Big Ten has looked apart early on some really good freshmen out there twopoint game under four to go second half Virginia Tech trying to get to seven and one and kick off the ACC Big Ten challenge with a win for the ACC and Payne spikes bazilly out of the Hokies bench look out ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires foreign Music Chris Collins reunite up in Evanston and the Big Ten gets his first home game here on night one of the ACC Big Ten challenge near Blacksburg Virginia alongside Jordan Cornett Mike Monaco with you our entire crew behind the scenes the Hokies have controlled this one after really the first 10 minutes of this game its been Terrys businesslike in the adjustment from the struggles early on to take care of the basketball settled in played their game took total control 201 Minnesotas number one Joshua Joseph hes got 14 of them all right so we talked about Northwestern weve seen Minnesota here and actually you love Purdue what else stands out to you in the Big Ten be here to watch Michigan State in a couple days Michigan State very well could be a final four team its so early you dont say any of that with confidence when I say that I say theyre a really good basketball team and one of the better teams in the country its Tom bism but theyve got players on that Squad Ill get them in South Bend in two days Indiana is a very good team Purdue I already said is the best team in the country I was always dangerous I look at the Big Ten and say theres a lot of threats this year when there wasnt one dominant team coming in how about Illinois theres another Squad Wisconsin its a loaded Big Ten once again now coach Ben Johnson the Gophers arent there yet talking with Coach Johnson look hes a gopher he knows what it takes to win he knows what he has he knows what he wants to do hes been on some great staffs hes the right guy its gonna take time its gonna take time hes only got two scholarship players back who played last year on this years team he told us today Virginia Techs a lot like Purdue but when he says that he says Ive got a guy and a half who have played Purdue before Isaiah Keenan that guys in uniform hes not hurt he gets back from injury thats a 610 two guard that shrinks the floor that changes a lot the Young Guys got to get healthy the young guys got to mature in this program and the Gophers will start to come around theyre not there yet but theyll get there under Coach Johnson is Keenan who suffered a torn ACL same need that kept him out last year and the way Ben Johnson put it to us today he was really ascending before the injury and then he got Parker Fox as well torn ACL for him too hes now had injuries to both his knees the last couple of years and has yet to play for Minnesota so hes transfer again Isaiah is a different speaker much hard talk about pain you look at Isaiah you look at pain I I like Henley and what he can be here theres a core young group but Im gonna put it on Battle and Im gonna put it on Garcia in the meantime those guys have to come out there with a mentality that theyre gonna go take Hearts when they step on the floor theyve got to be that its asking a lot but for them to go win in a very difficult Big Ten those guys have to go out there and hunt theirs and quite simply that didnt happen tonight Music six points for battle on two of ten shooting five for Garcia here we were told at shoot around today under the weather dealing with some flulike symptoms and for battle just his third game back from the foot surgery right before the season started Music now 216 to go Mike young goes deep into the bench Camden Johnson the walkon you saw enter the game Music and white giving it off to the Freshman Collins Music oh the dish for kid wanted to go back to that same shoulder cancer play quality minutes come conference play hes going to be a guy that factors in its going to be an important rotation piece these arent that right Applause pokeys shorthanded as well theyre still without their stuck freshman top 50 recruit and the ESPN 100 Rodney rice and John Camdens got an angling hey tomorrow six more games for the ACC Big Ten challenge Music right there in the middle thats Rodneys right now an ankle surgery he was moving around pretty good and shoot around in pregame tonight combo guard play the one I think hes probably better off with the one to play off the ball but then when you go Couture and rice thats a very strong perimeter what coach young likes to do spread you out keep an attack here with space Bryce adds another element there in dimension crowd Watts the walk on Johnson the trigger not a scoop too strong neared by the Gophers Music Carrington connects three times Applause well take it as well Music your research to new heights Music what butt cheek says to be job well done you did the work tonight just in butts it starts with months it starts with Couture the Dola very talented bazilly very talented but these guys are the guys look at this I mean the guys got three degrees including two masters already hes brilliant basketball look he can make a lot of money doing this hes gonna make a lot of money doing anything I dont know Mr and Mrs mutts but hat tip to you working on The Bachelors not a doctorate he said he did consider going for Dr mutts His Brilliant would have been a lot to deal with in a basketball team but he said at some point hes going to call himself Dr Jay necessity not too much sounds cool too Applause whatever it is to be successful and thats the fun part of covering Collegiate Athletics well know him as number 25 on the Hokies and a great basketball player but the story is about these special young men and women in the sport being able to tell those stories is the coolest thing one minute before the impact hell have on the road Applause Music place has always been great to me Music Ola Joseph Music I like him now when I came for that first football game a few years ago I started putting Metallica on my Spotify I was like please have me hype there you go Im going to sleep a good laugh Music 20 seconds youre youre young and surprised bro your nights still young not for me Im holding the preference uh your words not mine not only still coming up top of the

you hate to see him and now a hell ball it sticks with Virginia Tech with point eight left and the Hokey faithful does not like the way Minnesota is approaching these final seconds Applause foreign Applause Music Applause Virginia Tech made quite the statement here tonight a balanced effort led by their older guys settled in late to get the job done guarded in the half court just a better team
