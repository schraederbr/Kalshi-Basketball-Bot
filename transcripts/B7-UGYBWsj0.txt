Brun low for Virginia Hell take for Stanford and the opening tip goes to the Cavaliers Don Hall with the basketball transferred after three excellent seasons at BYU Nice bounce pass in the paint and really nice work around the rim and it wont go down For a minute there I thought I was looking at Kevin McCale out there on his moves Very solid low post stuff Everything but the hoop And Grunlow is only a freshman He was a big fella down there that couldnt get that one to fall Heres Oy They double team trying to trap him Hes going to see Virginia uniforms in his sleep after this game They are really locked in on him This guy can shoot it man And he drains a three That is Benny Geler He is a 44 threepoint shooter And thats what a guy like Okore does for you He opens up so many other things You get locked in on him and you may forget about guys Applause Thats Ditter Hes a leading scoreer for the Cavaliers And they loop it inside again And a takeaway by Stanford Geler heading the other way Both of these teams will play at pace so they should be able to fall into that very comfortably Applause Bak parro with a ball He is a presence and a good bounce pass Good catch down there and then finishing underneath his heel Ill Ill say the catch was the best part of that That was very tough But you see I love bounce passes in the paint and theres so much easier to catch Malik Thomas coming off a 20point effort And the win over Cal to start the week and theres Ditter splits defenders for the first basket by Virginia I tell you not only is this a tall team up front but very athletic very solidly built too I mean Derritter is 23 years old so not your typical freshman Yeah I mean both of these teams certainly have a European flavor to it Virginia in fact has players representing five different countries Heres Oi Yeah I think shes going to get warmed up He decided Im not going to drive Ill just take a few steps back and launch a three Thomas with a left hand How slick was that Thomas spent the last two seasons at San Francisco where he was the first team all West Coast Conference performer the conferences leading scoreer a year ago Late double team that time by Virginia Good dig in by Thomas And hell take able to somehow corral that ball and lays it off for Geler And do that without traveling on the floor too Applause 74 Stanford in front through the first three plus minutes of this one from John Paul Jones Arena Applause Don Hall the BYU transfer and thats his first basket Talk about a big guard who could go inside and absorb contact but Ryan ODM thinks he may be their best playmaker leading them in assists solidly built his Don Hall Close to 200 lb Grew up in Utah Played three years at BYU Two of them as a starter Battled through injuries a season ago Derritter is saying you might want to take a look at that one Both teams with substitutions The local product checks in Chance Mallerie for the Cavaliers He wears number two And then Bugana Onienu coming off his best game as a Cavaliier He had nine points or 12 points and nine rebounds against Cal And Ryan told us yesterday I mean he thinks 3 to four minutes is about as long as he wants guys playing out there if theyre playing the right way Shot clock goes off coached by one Ryan ODM became the first in history to beat a one seed in Virginia and then they go next year and win the championship Well thats great play out of a timeout back door cut Well yeah you got everybody lifted along the free throw line and a take away and one They love that pressure Its amazing how they how quickly they transition too You score quickly then they get right into the pressure defense Heres the play off the top And you see both big guys out Theres a lot of cutting lanes inside a lot of good passing lines Oh Ditter drains the first one And hes been struggling Thats about the only wart in his game is that 61 from the free throw line And in games hes normally missed his first So maybe thats a good sign This is Jeremy Dent Smith a transfer from Cal State Dominguez Hills over the last three years And pass a little too strong for Apara Backto back turnovers now for the Cardinal Music Ditter going to get a breather Hall checks back in Thomas will go to the bench Its going to be a little like calling a hockey game for you We got line changes with UVA every so often Of course youd say that Ive never called a hockey game Thats all I need to know I mean right off the bench theres no fooling around there from Devin Tillis as he lets it fly This is Mallalerie Boy they like his game Hes only a freshman Lewis little fade away and too strong and Cororey with a rebound He does not have a basket or an assist so far About to change No And I tell you what in there its going to be interesting cuz hes going to be seeing two sevenfooters throughout the game Uni Enzo is he they dont lose anything with him coming off the bench as a shot blocker Applause take away and the layin Ryan Agarwal the transfer junior out of Coppell Texas Applause Music Were talking about Okori without an assist or a basket So far he was in on 40 Either assisted or scored 40 of the final 42 points in the win over Virginia Tech You know you throw the ball back out toward half court and it gets picked off Almost impossible You know unless Mallerie gets a miracle play right there Very difficult to stop Well what a coach this guy is Came from Washington State Kyle Smith 56 years old out of Houston Texas 16th overall season as a head coach Colombia with San Francisco and Washington State And how about that for the big fella Yeah on hes hes probably a little bit farther along offensively than Grindol and then but great pick and roll inside They do such a great job of keeping everybody lifted So he spent his first two years at the University of Kentucky I mean he was a fivestar guy coming out of high school and probably you know I know didnt play that much but probably had some great workouts in practice You know just picking up valuable time there Theres a good look And its tough for a big guy Youre running away from it to make the catch turn around have the awareness and he also kept the ball high He played a lot of Kentucky his first two years And then went to Kansas State last year Didnt play much there but off to a good start with the Cavaliers Had another shot clock violation Second of the game for Stanford Well before that ball comes in Gilers got to get Thats the point guards Its his responsibility to let people know what the clock situation is Well I mean they do have one of those right above the basket right Well yeah but you should be surprised how little guys look at that Yeah Yep I hear you Especially guys off the ball But you you know as a player youve got to have that internal clock Shot clock at five And that is deflected Thomas going to have to put it up and does tell you both teams been pretty good game coming up with the 5050 balls and then rejected at the other end Man he is a force They have two of them back there If you come to the basket youre going to have this happen a lot against UVA Yeah heres the uh the deflection and then just the awareness following right in and then down to the other end You got a guy who can clean up a lot of mistakes Great help defense He had a game earlier this year He had eight blocks in one game against Butler Eight in a game O Corys going to have a look here maybe on the out of bounds play You know its interesting with with him with Okori is you know here we are almost eight minutes into the game He hasnt you know really done much but hes not out there pressing anything You know some guys will get really antsy to score They got two on the shot clock Hes going to He doesnt know I mean its unbelievable that you would be in an inbounds play Im not sure that coach Smith knew about the shot clock at 21 I think he thought if the ball was knocked out of bounds by Virginia she may not have gotten another 20 And hes hes still Well you can understand why hes upset because the ball clearly was last touched as Mallerie drops him the little onehander You know the thing I like about about Malor a freshman who really knows how to take care of the basketball And as a point guard coming in that young its usually something that doesnt work to well together Oh Cory Shot clock at 12 Got to be a mismatch somewhere You got Ditter on Giler Shot clock at three Tough shot there Wow Geler bails him out And uh I I cant remember three shot clock violations And that may that goes back to the Tony Bennett era Applause This is something that Kyle Smith was really concerned with The offensive rebounding of Virginia Well its a sixpoint game I believe Thomas 15footer short and Stanford pres prevents an offensive rebound by the Cavaliers Among the nations very best in offensive rebounding is Virginia In fact first in the ACC Yeah they get 40 of their misses which is just I mean that is unreal Thats as high water a mark as you can get Shot clock at five Well Cory going to let it fly Not even catch an iron Thats a four shot And theyre not double teaming in the post So a lot of time went off the clock with the indecision Applause Thought about a back door cut there to Lewis Instead its Hall Boy Ditters got just such an incredible body He draws a foul Some of the highlights from that team They lost to Dave Modems Wake Forest team in the semifinals in Greensboro Thats a match up against your beloved Blue Devils Got an upset Virginia did and Carolina at home Yeah that team had a lot of offensive firepower Junior Burrow was their leading scoreer that year He averaged 18 points and nine rebounds Harold Dean an outstanding player there Cory Alexander and of course Curtis Staples a great freshman on that team So Ditter who we mentioned earlier struggling at the free throw line only at 61 Hes hit all three of his attempts today And an eightpoint lead for the Wahoos Applause Our he will draw the foul And thatll go against Malik Thomas There was help coming on the other side but he dribbled He deni he went away from the screen and that allowed him to get into the paint area Applause Music I tell you if they can screen if uh Stanford can screen with Grunlows guy out top it takes the shot blocker out of the lane Opens things up a little bit more Okorei leads the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring He ranks eighth in the NCAA and he is yet to score a point in the game here today You and I next week a peak ahead will be in Clemson Boy what a nice start the Tigers are having in Miami Just win after win after win Jay Lucas getting a head coaching position down there after Jim Larenega had so much success Stanford switching up now Playing a little zone Trailing by seven exactly midway through this opening half How about the sevenfooter And the tip up there is good And I think that was Ditter Theyre giving it to Malik Thomas But how about that You got a sevenfooter taking a three and then a guard inside getting an offensive rebound Well they just corrected it They said it will be Derritter who got that tip I thought it was him that had the hand on it He has six And then 789 And theres a three by Geler Hes almost singlehandedly keeping him in it And that was that was guided in by the backboard It looked way offline He was a great story He was a priority walkon and playing in his 65th game here today in a twoyear starter Tip in there again on the offensive glass Mike Yeah its just and you know and in the zone very tough to block out and its much harder to rebound out of a zone than it is out of mantoman Music Brunlo getting his first basket Okorei kisses it off the glass and hell go to the line First field goal for Ibuka Okorei the freshman out of Nshawa New Hampshire Heres the look And what he does is he draws the contact And its funny Grunal didnt come over as a shot blocker that time He just tried to take up space and give it a threepoint play opportunity Kids an unbelievable story His mom and dad migrated from Nigeria They both went to Harvard and he had signed originally to go to Harvard to play for Tommy Amar there And you know wasnt getting a lot of play cuz there were guys on his high school team Brewster Academy so well known scorers everywhere very rarely ever shot the ball So he was really under the radar and has an unusual routine at the free throw line I dont know Ive ever seen it He doesnt take any dribbles He gets the ball steps up and just shoots Applause Lewis not there Virginia shoots a ton of threes They shoot about 28 of them a game and make 10 Derritter Another offensive rebound and a foul underneath Like to remind you coming up Tuesday NXT on the CW is all chaos and no mercy Joe Henry takes on Dion Lennox in a no disqualification match WWE NXT Tuesday 8 Eastern 7 central on the CW So let me do a little math for you Tom that Virginias 10 of 20 Of the 10 misses theyve got seven offensive rebounds That is tough to overcome I think thats 70 Yeah that very Wow Its that Ohio University math Yeah Yeah I know when you were reading that Miami of Ohio thing you kind of paused No I love that I love it Thats our rival So thats okay Although theyre one of what three unbeaten teams left in all of Division One basketball Applause Ditter red hot So too are the Cavaliers Offensive rebounds and already 10 for Ditter who averages 16 per game He is a native of Belgium He played on their U8 team their U20 team that finished fourth in the European Championships And I mean to tell you you talk about put together man Well you got two the two guys from Belgium playing each other Hell tell you now Well we talked about that you know you include the United States Brought up earlier five countries represented on this UVA roster Good head fake Couple of them in fact right there against a shot blocker Hakaro will go to the free throw line He averages 15 a game and he has not scored Applause Well you know the the games that he has struggled Tom is the ones where he hasnt shot the ball well And uh three times under double figures six of 28 in those games So I mean hes still looking for his shot but some nights just not there Well he gets them both here A solid three or free throw shooter so good chance to go and get some rhythm Yeah hes right around the team average This is a great not good great free throw shooting Stanford team at nearly 73 And this thats a battle I thought they really had to win in this game this afternoon But you know what To their to their credit Virginia is defending without fouling Its not an issue in this game Okorei comes across the lane and gets the roll How about that Hes going to be a problem Yeah How much How much you want to bet that hes going to be in double figures before we get to halftime and he didnt start scoring till the 8 minute mark Yep And hes up to six And it the lead for Virginia is down to four Mallerie for three Applause That was a good box out right there Well to to step over and to go up with go up with your right go up with a strong hand Just a very athletic finish coming right at you A nice friendly roll nearly and it is a turnover for the Cardinal Theyve had some struggles against this fullcourt pressure Virginia hadnt gotten into it a lot Well yeah Stanford if you take away the three or the shot clock violations and the turnovers in full court theyre not doing too badly Applause Under seven minutes to go Hall an open three And thats off the mark And thatll come away to O Cory Hes going to the rack You knew that And now hes up to eight Yeah And uh ju just really nice job taking the contact Offensive rebound off balance but he was bumped was Tony Oso Hell go to the free throw line So 634 to play until halftime Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Its a twopoint game here Well the interesting thing is Tom that what Stanford has done gone to that zone packed it in Theyre really challenging Virginia to shoot from the outside and thats not there for them in this stretch Onioso is a 72 free throw shooter That was a nice throw Were watching practice yesterday I Hes got a very nice threepoint shot I mean that its not showing up so far in the season but just watching a very nice form Really nice stroke So he gets them both and hell take a seat Geler comes back in for Stanford He leads the Cardinals with 10 The Cardinal with 10 points Music Yeah its uh pretty much the two guards and nobody else has stepped up so far for Stanford O Cory gets his own rebound for got another offensive rebound Shot clock at nine Ryan ODM is in the double team over the sideline Shot clock at three Akara and another the fourth of this half for Stanford A shot clock violation But see I hate that call because Virginia gets the ball They take a break away from Virginia on that shot and he had possession of the basketball but its just something they got to call and um you know it now it gives Stanford a chance to go back and set up defensively They do the same thing in the NBA Well do they Well no They theyll let you if you continue to play You can you can play on in that situation Okay Paul looking for a screen Geler able to step through it Applause The freshman Mallerie scoops it up and it will not go And then Okore is going to win the race to the ball and will lay it in And you said it hes got 10 Yeah And nobodys going to catch him in a foot race And uh he was behind everybody in Virginia and wound up ahead Hes got their last four baskets to make this a twopoint game And Mallerie answers at the other end Chance Mallerie from right here in Charlottesville St Ans Bellefield School the schools alltime leader in points steals assist and wins Well they needed that One of eight from three up to that point in the game Maybe that loosens things up a little bit in the zone Little jumper and not going to be there And the rebound of the Cavaliers looking to build on a fivepoint lead with under five to go Corys jump shot has not been there He scored all his points on layups Boy UVA is so active on the offensive glass You brought that up before we ever got started I mean they get a hand They dont get the rebound They get a hand seemingly on everything Yep They are they are hyperaggressive on this end And even like right now if if they dont get the ball theyre in full court pressure mode Applause Music Applause You know you go back over the last 49 games Last 16 years only 49 times did Virginia score more than 80 points Over 16 years They have 13 games already this year and theyre averaging almost 87 per night Well I will tell you one thing though That national championship team Tony Bennetts highest scoring team You got to do both Yep You got to do both You got to do both And this Virginia team is actually ranked top 30 nationally if you look at the analytics offense and defense So theyve got both ends of the floor covered Yeah I mean its an entirely different style of play Yeah I think its safe to say around here everybody loved adored Tony Bennett And who wouldnt right I mean as a human being and as a coach but this is just something new and something different You still win this way too Yeah Those two years the one where they were number one and got beat and then they they they could score the basketball Kyle Guy um you know they averaged I think 73 or four points which for his teams you know youre beating youre holding people to 50 All right So you get Aar headed to the bench He hits one of two from the line 409 to go until halftime Thoughts about this one so far Mike Jaminsky Well I think Stanford is really um they theyve survived a little bit of a knockout punch early Uh the zone has really brought them back into the game It Its taken away the inside scoring where Virginia was doing most of their damage in the first eight His coaching career at the University of South Florida And how about Tom 17 years as an assistant for Ryan ODM So he paid his dues and worked his way up Well both of these guys have uh both him and Kyle Smith They have really really paid their dues to get to to this place where they are now in Atlantic Coast Conference basketball Great defense there by Stanford The reason they did not stop it there is there was already a takeaway Geler is red hot today and hes still hot He has 13 in a game And that was actually pretty good defense by Hall Stayed with him kept in front the hand up Just seeing a huge basket Oh you want him to take that shot Yeah you live with that Well he was eight of 28 from threepoint land coming into the game So now what 10 of 30 Yeah thats I mean its you know great shot Um but still if youre Stanford you prefer that to anything else Or nine of 30 He missed one made one in the game And theres a trip that will go against Sam Lewis Applause Music That is for all Americans Thats News Nation Push through the left the right get straight to the facts Katie Pavage tonight Premieres January 19th 10 Eastern 9 Central on NewsNation You can find it Go to newsstation nowcom Cant wait to see her Yeah She was formerly if Im not mistaken from Fox News Yep Fabulous Fabulous job Um and I think its great that Virginia has been able to get to the just under three minute mark before getting into the penalty Uh you know that plays to their favor but now is a stretch when Stanford theyve done a nice job clawing their way back into this game They sure have You mentioned they were right on that border of taking the knockout punch and found a way to push through it Switching to that zone defense Great head fake and a travel So now the Cardinal a chance to tie the game even take the lead with a three with 245 to go until halftime And there have been a number of opportunities in the paint area too where Stamp or where Virginia has not been able to finish Im not sure what Agar Wall was doing there He Tony Bennett comes here from Washington State Well still trying to get the ball in bounds after the timeout They finally do Agarwal is going to put it in the safe hands of Okori They got too many people buried along the inbound lane Crowd wanted a push off Yeah And that probably had a pretty good argument there So 230 to go until halftime Virginia with the ball and a twopoint lead But I think for Okor if you can make him settle for threepoint shots thats a thats a win defensively Ditter taking it to the rack Nicely done You know what going left and then coming back with his right he goes right into the player He cant get a block shot and he real close to getting a threepoint play opportunity I think Giler number five is going to get a little more attention at halftime with the uh scouting report Shot clock at five Oh Corys going to have to go up with it Man is that sucked Its a little patience and when youre on the shot clock is on your back youre in the lane and you know he just bited his time Well its one out of three now from threepoint land for a Grun Lo The crowd is booing Step back three O Cory he hit that gamewinning three to beat Virginia Tech earlier in the week when Stanford finished on a 141 run They were down 12 with 218 to go And you know I think being out here being out east getting acclimated to the time has really helped them plus playing a game Hes been the threepoint threat for Virginia so far Yep Thats his second threepointer Chance Mallerie He averages 11 per game He has eight Down to the final 40 seconds The crowd was booing Looked like Virginia got away with one there And then the left hand underneath and Mallerie will track it down Basically not even a second differential So this will be the final shot of the half Now the the the big guys for Stanford struggle to score the ball Hell had a couple of great looks at it inside that time and couldnt convert Applause All right here we go Theyll start it up with nine seconds left Mallerie with the ball and into the lane Got bumped Hell go to the line with five seconds left until halftime And coming up on the halftime show presented by Subaru love Its what makes Subaru Subaru Well check out whats happening around the Atlantic Coast Conference Get a recap from game one of our double dip BC and Louisville with Tom Wormy and Seth Davis And Ryan ODM talks about his family influence on his career and his time in Charlottesville as a kid Thats coming up on the Subaru halftime report You know its Mallalerie has made some really mature plays in this game and he did a nice job drawing the foul in the paint area Hes hes very solidly built too Now hes one of the shorter guys on the team at 510 Applause Comes from an athletic family His grandfather played football in Blackburg Virginia Had two sisters at Lake Collegiate Sports One played soccer of Randolph Min another lacrosse at Howard Well the good thing for the Cavaliers nobody in foul trouble for the second half Only one guy has got two fouls Watch out for Geler Hes been the hot hand and thats his first miss of the half So Virginia finishes a half on a run It got down to a twopoint game Five nothing roll get started noon Eastern 9 Pacific only on the CW Looking forward to getting down to Clemson Well you got a you got quite a backto back weekend going there partner You got that game and then the national championship game Maybe maybe maybe maybe its its you got to reach deep in the wallet You know how I am with that Applause All right Stanford with the basketball This is Agarwal 4134 and Aggerwall in and out Applause Thomas going coast to coast and had it rejected but hell go to the free throw line Full head of steam and uh just very aggressive all the way from the back court taking it all the way in See none of the big guys back for Stanford two shots Virginia 131 when leading at halftime this season Their one loss They only have two of them That was the unbelievable game against their rival Virginia Tech Triple overtime And then the other was the only game they lost when leading at halftime and that was against the Butler Bulldogs in bad mot One of two for Malik Thomas Boy Virginia Tech has been on both sides of it this year so far with that win and then the loss to Stanford and heartbreaking You know youre up 12 with 2 minutes to go You think were going to finish this and then it was the Okori show He finished with 31 in that game Had a three with three seconds left Tough shot by Geler Yeah thats what you want to make him And then he picked up a bad foul trying to make up for it right there But for Geler if you can drive him off the threepoint line defensively and make him go into the into the middle like that for a tough shot thats your best bet defensively Ritter came down hard Wondered if he twisted his ankle he sort of gingerly walking That is a big strong dude man Or did he strain that groin or did he get it around the groin Yeah I you know he seems seems to be on the mend Um are you ever on the mend Yeah good point But this uh the zone has been really good for Stanford Its its taken away scoring in the paint area Theyve really theyve really limited second chance points Applause Wide open and then passes it up to get it to Ditter Shot clock at seven Lewis dribbling picks it up Shot clock at two and just throwing it up there and almost having it go as Thomas How about Geler boxing out That was a great defensive sequence for Stanford A par using that wide body gave it up and able to lay it in as he his second basket Crowd wanted a either an offensive foul on Aara or a travel Watch here Watch the uh watch the elbow Theres the little bit of a It was really quick and tough to see And then the finish Theres the look again Not and he had that ball knocked out of his hand going up for the heel tape for the finish And he finishes a threepoint play By the way thats a second foul on D Ritter Not a big deal necessarily with 1831 but well see how it plays out Well you know for him I mean he can get into the second half of games not in any foul trouble That thats going to be huge for this team going forward Fivepoint game and Thomas had it knocked out of bounds by Okori This has been a sound strategy for Stanford Theyre challenging Virginia to make shots from the perimeter Really Mallerie and Der are the only two have answered that Shot clock at 10 Applause Now at four and again Thomas going to have to force it up there and Geler comes away with the rebound They have numbers Apara pulls it back out Yeah that was pretty good transition defense by Virginia Long range and short by Ger Not sure thats a shot Stanford wanted there Well and he surprised his team with that shot And you could see that with the lack of transition defense You dont want to surprise your team with a long three Okorei flips it up there Lefthanded defended beautifully by Virginia Okori wanted the foul Theres a look Hes turned around Hes Hes asking for the basketball And when the big guy runs the floor you got to reward him Tom I mean I think the entire Stanford team Yeah Now theyve overruled the call and they say the ball belongs to Stanford The Okori shot attempt was deflected out of bounds So theres 21 on the shot clock Smith was all over it He doesnt miss much Applause Hey Applause Music Applause had it rejected and Mallerie lays it off was blocked but out of bounds once he tried to feed the ball off was he Well and this is where youve got a guy a sevenfooter you can play oneonone He no double team help needed inside Grunwell with a nice block in the play and he ignites the fast break And Im wondering if uh he injured his finger Oh yeah hes got blood coming out of his eye Must have taken an elbow to the eye underneath there and hes saying I got drilled under there to one of the officials I mean that is some kind of cut right there Thats not just some little scrap No but you know what It probably I mean its its a cut and but when youre bleeding like that it looks like youve been you know hit with a brick And it looks a lot worse Trust me it looks a lot worse than it is Applause That it was tough to It didnt look It looked pretty harmless there Just a little bit on the elbow I think it happened before that before he actually got the ball Applause Lets Lets back it up a little bit Rob Reichley our director Jen Neil our director Rob Reichley our producer going to back this up a little bit Lets see Yeah I I bet its during this exchange somewhere here right No I cant see where that happened Oh hes already wiping it Yeah it happened even before that pass when they were jockeying It looked like Runlaw was trying to get over in three quarter in front Incidental contact So incidental contact after taking a look at it Yeah I mean you look at the play I mean there was not that was not a flagrant uh on you know on either side Guilt meanwhile is still in the Stanford locker room Theyve got to get a substitution in for him Music And thats going to be Aiden Cammon redsh shirt sophomore who played in 16 games eight of them as a starter a year ago He averages this year right around 19 minutes per game Sevenpoint Virginia lead Thats a kick Fresh shot clock at 30 or no 20 Ill be your pardon after the kick Music Applause Thomas tough shot and Apara the other way for the Cardinal needing a basket badly trailing by seven 315 through this second half A much better job Stanford on the defensive glass And thats as thats as clean a look as hes gotten in this game Our Applause and hell go to the line I you know I just think this team runs better when hes on the floor I mean he has really showed me this is a oneame snapshot but uh he makes some really good decisions Hes tough inside You got him and Hall out on the floor who are the two primary ball handlers Cam picks up his second Halls going to come out of the game right now but man for a freshman to come in and do it is impressive Hes got 13 for the Cavaliers Music Mallerie averages 11 and every game he has come off the UVA bench He had eight points a careerhigh seven assists in the win earlier in the week over Cal Stanford bleeding right now offensively one for seven in the half But for this team you know Tom starting doesnt mean anything I mean guys are going to play 20 25 minutes Thatll be an over and back of the Stanford guys Well hopefully Akar is okay He has three points He averages 15 But both teams ice cold to begin the second half And Virginia starting to warm up a little bit there Ditter his second bucket of the second half Stanford only one field goal made in the second 20 minutes and rejected by the big fella Shot clock at seven It never caught iron Shot clock in one And that is the fifth shot clock violation And Kyle Smith is beside himself over there I think its the most Ive ever seen in one game by one team And this is a great job Theres an art to blocking shots and not fouling You know Stanford gets the ball back but uh really has the clock on their back And I tell you what Mallerie did a nice job defensively against Aorei Bagger Wall with a rebound Got tied up with Mallalerie And itll belong to the Cavaliers 12point lead for UVA Well and again Virginia only one team foul so really positioned well for this second half stretch Valerie thought about it Going to take it into the lane And thats last touch by Stanford Your favorite board

shot not really there N0 run for Virginia fouled and Thomas cant believe it I dont know if they got Ditter If its him its his third Its on Thomas Thats his second Yeah heres the look inside These their guards have such great size and strength They can go in and finish at the rim Well thats what youre getting when youre getting fifth year guys You know you you got Thomas who spent two years at USC then two years at San Francisco Talked about Don Hall as well as theres another rejection and yet another and this time a foul But you know Hall played 3 years at BYU so these guys are 22 23 years old Heres the look And uh just you know great arms great presence defensively Applause Ger in and out Still only one field goal made in this second half by Stanford Applause Mallerie tried the alleyoop and Agarwal rips away the rebound Stanford needs to get something anything going on offense Down by 14 Applause Oy cant get anything going and hes the one whos got to be the catalyst Hes stuck on 14 points Offensive rebound right back up and headed to the free throw line will be AJ Rojosi who has not scored in the game He averages eight points and four boards a game You get the you get the sense that Kyle Smith is just searching for some combinations and somebody to come out and give them a spark Applause Womens hoops coming your way tomorrow NC State a powerhouse team again this year We have not seen Heelte return to the bench since he left with a cut just above his right eye I dont know if they if it required stitches and you know sometimes you can get by with a little butterfly mandate and and just keep it closed up White head makes it a 13 or a 12point game I beg your pardon 5139 as he hit them both Wither trying to draw contact and does from Geler from behind Geler saying you got to be kidding Music And Geler will leave in favor of Jeremy Dent Smith Music Well they this has been a little bit of a stretch Virginia stretched it out some but they really could have built a big lead up in this first few minutes Stanford just cant score Nearly a takeaway Odioso able to get it back And here is Hall Good ball Great ball movement there And Lewis pays it off at the end And how about Mallalerie the pass He could he probably arguably could have taken the shot himself but gave it up for a better look That lead swells to 15 in front of this sellout crowd in Charlottesville Okorei rejected Oso is a monster to try and get up anything against Shot clock at three And basically thats another one Its not but basically another It is Yeah And Kyle Smith is beside him there Theres one Theres the kick out Two Three Clear guy Great look Catches it in rhythm Applause Six shot clock violations And we still have 12 minutes left and Lewis stealing it Backto

undefeated this year season high eight in one of the two losses the Cavaliers have this year They lost a triple overtime game against their rivals in Blackburg and they also lost to the Butler Bulldogs That was a game Odenso had eight I dont think Ive ever done a game where the only double figure a player has had is in blocks Thatd be a first Well he tried to throw that one down Hell go to the free throw line And yes that is Heily as we mentioned whos come back into the game Odeno we brought up earlier hes got a nice looking stroke at the free throw line His shooting 72 two of two today 53 from the floor You know like I said hes hes advanced Um talk about he had a great game against Cal as you talked about earlier And of course uh he has in common one thing with Mike Jaminsky You know what that might be What might that be Besides being bummed out when you get in a hotel bed because theyre about a foot and a half short of your body We were talking about that today Player of the year in Connecticut Yeah Music Some decent players coming out of the home state Absolutely Applause Calvin Murphy not too bad to go in the wayback machine Steve Young Dorothy Hamill Boy he has just been a tough afternoon And the the last time he suffered through this they lose He had seven points in the loss to Notre Dame Well that was one of those games where neither team could hit water falling out of a boat That was a 47 to 40 game Then they came back the next game and beaten Louisville Applause to Ritter just muscles his way in I mean he got locked up with Roosi Ritter is a man now Again theres no double team coming down Hes the deritter sees that hes looking into the middle So he knows he can take his time back him down You get multiple dribbles like that and youre on an island playing oneonone It is tough defensively But Tom Stanford one of 17 this half 0 of seven from three Music Ger and Rojosi will leave And that is Apara whos come back into the game Well thats good to see Hes still limping around a little bit but hes out there And there are the numbers and they dont lie Five total points in this half one field goal And uh despite the lead Virginia up full court putting pressure on Stanford Well you got to give it up to Aar Nice left hand there by Dent Smith His first basket of the game I mean his teams down you know 19 points They were down 21 a second ago and uh and hes back out there Well and you know what Tom Sometimes you you react to an injury you dont know You think its really bad and it may not be as bad as you think which is always good But its great to see him backing out You know he he was helped off the floor Now hes out running up and down Ditter averages 17 a game He has 20 so far tonight Weve still got nearly half of this half remaining Applause I tell you Derritter is going to be a handful for defenders in the ACC because he is so strong and so athletic Akara too strong in the rebound to UVA Well the one thing we talked about with Ryan ODM is to not pick up the the silly fouls if youre deritter Maximize your time out on the floor Wow And Okore cant buy one Five of 19 from the field Well you you know hes not gotten to the basket much at all in this half Hes had to shoot jump shots Music Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday here on the CW presented by All State Youre in good hands This UVA team picked to finish fifth in the preseason media poll in the ACC They do have an ACC loss so theyre down the track a little bit so far Very early on but you know what You talked about putting this roster together Its a little more doable in this day and age with with the NIL And the other thing is is its opened up international players because in the past they would stay at home because they could play pro there and get paid Now they can come here go to a good school and and and theyve wanted to do that for a long time but it hasnt been an option for them So youre going to see youre going to you know all these schools have very strong international scouting teams Great point about the paid part Yeah And and you know and Brian ODM hes going to build this And the thing I like about him hes going to hes going to build it with character guys And the guys hes got in this team are character guys Thats uh its something he said yesterday is really important to him I mean they only have one scholarship player that is back from last year Theres a three in the corner by Dent Smith One they completely overhaul this entire roster and lose Maxim Renault who was you know all league performer and was in the running for player of the year Well you look at uh Virginia and what ODM has done 10 new scholarship players He got seven transfers two international imports as Hall lays it in and then the one local product in Mallerie and ODM was recruiting him at V at VCU So it it wasnt much of a stretch to get him to honor his commitment to come here to Virginia Three check in for the Cardinal A parro will leave among the three mentioned his fifth head coaching job You know he had a short stint as an interim guy there in Charlotte and then he went to Lenor Ry for one year UNMBC we talked about that stunning upset ironically of Virginia as awall hits a shot in the NCAA tournament a 16 against a one First time it ever happened Went to Utah State two years there NIT and an NCAA and then VCU got to the NIT quarters and last year to the NCAA tournament But hes the thing is hes had success at every school and hes been going hes been moving up the ladder steadily Well Titter can get things done in really difficult shot 745 to go Cavaliers that long away from a 14th win in 16 games on the year will fade away and that one is good by Malik Thomas We havent talked about him much but hes averaging when a team that is very balanced scoring 13 points a game So hes up to 11 almost his average Yeah that is second only to Ditter among all these Cavaliers And theyre missing a double figure scoring player in the transfer from North Dakota State and Jakari White I mean White now can do some things He had 28 in that come from behind win over Dayton Broke his wrist against Maryland Theyre hoping to have There he is Theyre hoping to have him back at practice this week Well and the biggest thing and its going to be an thats just a frustration foul by Alori but see Jakari White there Threepoint shooting is something that he really brings to the table Thats his strength 50 on the year You get him back and getting his stroke right You know isnt it interesting Mike though you know heres a guy in white right that he goes to the State College of Florida for a year coming out of high school in Orlando and there are a lot of guys on this floor that I could use this exact same thing to describe not all of them but then he goes to North Dakota State for three years You know a lot of times a guy sort of pigeon holed and and that is what you are right And now you get a chance to come to the Atlanta Coast Conference And I mean hes off to a great start And not only that not only what he has worked through but for Ryan Owns to find Yeah thats what I mean You know up up there and say you know and look theyve got some tough games coming up here Well get to Stanford schedule in a minute but how how about those backtoback games coming up on the road Yep You got uh at Louisville at SMU we saw beat North Carolina last week and then uh home against Carol They have four of the next five are on the road Its really heavily weighted home games at the end of the schedule but theyve got a rough stretch to get to the last five But meanwhile for Stanford well show you their schedule here in a minute Theyre in a run of playing five games four against ranked opponents And the drought continues for Geler and for Oy I mean you look at Stanford they just got finished playing Louisville Okay And then you had a game in between Virginia Tech Not an easy game You come here and play number 23 Virginia And look whats next at home where theyre undefeated by the way Yeah and uh then got a trip down to Florida for those two schools But you know what Just speaks to the league this year and how much improved overall it top to bottom Music This is a vastly improved Atlantic Coast Conference so far here in 2025 during the primarily nonconference schedule the best the ACC has been in nonconference play in nearly seven years Well and just also in league play the uh better competition is going to help everybody Applause Shot clock at three Thats Mallerie and Stanford with a rebound 6minute mark trailing by 22 You know last year was a a situation where a win didnt help you a whole lot but a loss really hurt you in the league Thats not the case this year I mean you look at a quad one win for example Now Stanford is undefeated coming into this game 30 in quad one games Virginia has lost to Virginia Tech and Butler but you know you look at Duke you look at Carolina you look at Clemson playing rugged bruising schedules and none the worst for wear And there is a three knocked in by Cameron Grant the red shirt sophomore out of Lakewood Ohio right outside of Cleveland Okay on the year now hes nine of 33 from the floor Hes eight of 32 from three He doesnt see the paint very much No thats over the back against Oneno Applause Music Uh Duke you know so far has clearly been the you know the leader of the pack at least in the clubhouse so far Only one loss for the Duh Blue Devils We saw Carolina you mentioned lose at SMU last week Clemsons a team were going to see him next week Im looking forward to seeing them Unbelievably tough schedule and theyre starting to put it together Yeah And Brad Brownell is now hes the elder statesman in the league from a coaching standpoint and really has done just a great run Applause look at some of the numbers in the net rankings Yeah I mean youre youre top 50 and youre in really good shape And there you see a bunch of team I mean NC State the lowest at 36 Louisvilles got to survive some injury issues right now Music Applause Yeah Louisville playing very much shorthanded here the last six seven games and theyve lost three of them Applause Shot clock at four and stripped out of there by Geler Neither Giler nor Okorei has scored yet here in this second half Wow You can look how physically they are playing Geler Applause The thing Ryan ODM talked about was his team is a little handsy defensively picking up cheap fouls and theyve done a much better job of not being that I think any anywhere off the bus that Grant is in range Applause big deal But it is a big deal Thats 61 for him Its a big confidence builder hopefully But meanwhile for Stanford five of 27 from the field here in the second half Six of 28 after the nice little jump hook by Roos his first basket of the game Earlier today winners in the ACC Syracuse over Pit Louisville beat BC here on CW NC State blew out Florida State down at Tallahassee And Miami another win beating Georgia Tech by 10 Yeah I I tell you for the two new coaches of Ryan ODM here and Jay Lucas down in Miami really kind of I dont think any some of the some of the preseason pickers didnt see this Ditter now with 22 down to the final 245 and Mallerie leading the charge the other way Four on three Thomas Applause Thats a pretty nice play right there by Dent Smith falling out of bounds and bounces it off the I tell you for defensively too what theyve done with Okorei 14 points I dont think he scored in the second half Five of 20 from the floor 0 of six from three Well Okore and their losses from threepoint shooting 0 for five against Seattle one of six against UNLV 0 for six against Notre Dame And we talked about getting shut out here in the second half after 14 points in the first half And that drought still in effect for Oori and Geler Applause Hey with 33 on the back end of that defense and you brought it up Mike yesterday we were sitting here at practice Man thats gamechanging stuff and then you then you can come in behind with Grunglof I mean you got two rim protectors back there I I did the numbers with those two combined You put that for the five position 17 points 12 rebounds and five blocks on average Pretty dog on good out of that one position I dont know how many number fives here are around the country with those numbers Yeah And and you know what And and you know its interesting that Ryan talked about seeing whos going to finish games and uh you know number 33 is in there at the end Now this games pretty much been decided Music Well he was you know what Tom He was good for like 8 minutes I mean didnt score early Then he had that one stretch where he was just able to get out in the open floor get to the rim get some easy layups But it has really been tough for him to get any kind of clean look here in the second half And again look nobody here is beating this kid down He is a freshman I mean uh you know he is having a great season 30 or more points in three of the last five games Sometimes youre just going to live with nights like these from a young player Well and Frank I think he is he is too little talked about I mean hes he gets kind of lost in the conversation with the freshman that are around the country but hes having as good a season as anyone Down to the final minute and 15 seconds here in Charlottesville They had a huge crowd today Sellout crowd even with the students gone Saw some of the alltime greats in Virginia basketball history at the game here today on this reunion Saturday Applause Keeler going to try and end the drought Nope Applause Well the crowd doesnt like it but Ryan ODM just turns and walks down the end of the bench Hes not going to be screaming and hollering at anybody with 53 seconds left Hes not going to be asking for a Well theyre going to take a look at this on replay Crowd will go crazy those that are left and theres a ton of them left Well and we touched on it that this style a little more exciting Yep You know like No doubt about it Tonys teams won They won but they they grounded out They played they were tough defense If you got to 50 against their teams you were doing well This is much more open much more fastpaced The fact to get all of these new guys on the same page so quickly really speaks a lot to this coaching staff and its the entire staff and Lion ODM will be the first one to tell you you know Griffs been with him forever going back to their days as teammates in college at Hampton Sydney and hes had a lot of these guys with him for a long long time Well you know what was cool yesterday in at practice he really lets his assistants do a lot of teaching out on the floor you know its not just one voice him droning on all and all all the time You know something that I thought was really interesting is youll take a look I mean this this is a blowout game Um but you know uh what I found really interesting that he said yesterday cuz Ive never heard this before maybe you have You know a lot of college teams for those that may not be in the know you set up your schedule and youll have an assistant coach handle the next game scouting and then the next game youll have another assistant and the next game another assistant And pretty much almost every team lays it out that way And ODM said after all those years you talked about him as an assistant coach he said I felt like have to review the challenge has been successful Virginia basketball Okay UVA get the ball um that he said Hey look I felt disconnected in some games if I wasnt the guy that was responsible for scouting that particular team in that particular day And so he said We have everybody involved in scouting every team we play Mhm Well the counterpoint to that that I saw was Jim Larenga who would have one assistant handle the defense one he had offensive defense coordinator and he had one of his assistants do all the scouts So that they heard they you know that was just his interesting thing Yeah So I mean you know different approaches to it Were down to the final 38 seconds Two of Hampton Sydneys finest over there on the bench for Virginia Its exactly right Ditter Another offensive rebound for the Cavaliers and now theyll come close to running out the clock Fourth opponent this year Virginia has held under 60 points in a game So as Mike mentioned earlier they are among the nations best not only in scoring offense but also in scoring defense and took on one of the best scorers in the country and really did a nice job on him But uh there was therell be a lot of better days for Mr for Cory Yes indeed And for Stanford basketball Smith is an outstanding coach And that is that Derilla is going to be stopping by and visiting with us here in just a second Our final score from Charlottesville Virginia
