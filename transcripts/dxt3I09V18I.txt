winning that championship a locked in look from Tony Bennett trying to win a share at least for the sixth time in the last 10 years thats incredible that is incredible that thats why hes a future Hall of Fame coach I mean theres no doubt about it he just continues to win still very young in his career and hes going against a very good uh upandcoming coach in Kenny Payne whose Louisville team is here on the road in the regular season finale Jaden Gardner won the tap and Virginia controls in the second meeting between these teams Virginia won the first in Louisville by three in a tightly contested game hey Clark on senior day thats his vintage basketball for Virginia right now get a curl cut get a flare cut for the man that passed it in that case Kihei Clark get him a player three couldnt have drawn up the open play any better if youre Tony Bennett see the Louisville starters Brandon Huntley Hatfield returns to the starting lineup the big man five in Black the Tennessee transfer Applause here he is matched up with Ben vanderplas and Huntley Hatfields two strong rebound Gardner usual starters for Tony Bennett great backcourt you love when Clark Beekman and this guy Franklin are connected and Armon Franklin draws a foul and thats thats exactly what they do Armand Franklin when hes on the right side he loves to go left this gives him an opportunity on that side to get to that left hand off that curl draws a foul I liked early on well watch as this continues to happen Mike I think Louisvilles got to run their ball screens higher theyve got to force the fours and fives of Virginia to come out and guard them they like to get after that ball screen where L Ellis likes to take on the screeners defender the higher it is the better itll be for Louisville today because they need to get some Pace in that half court offense because Louisvilles at their best when theyre in a driving kick offense and they have not done that consistently but thats when theyre at their best Kenny Payne who put it to us this way about that driving kick and the continuous offense we cant have the one pass shots and the no pass shots you got to keep moving him hes exactly right and what happens sometimes is theyll take three steps forward and two steps back three good possessions and then have two bad ones because they get away from whats working and that drives you nuts as a coach Ellis missed it after initiating with that high ball screen within the flow of the offense and heres Virginia already up 50 less than 90 seconds in freeze beatman the junior Pops to vanderplas can knock it down and the rebound hauled in by Mike James the redshirt freshman well Virginias going to get that curl cut theyve had it three straight possessions theyre going to get it all afternoon because Louisville is trailing that screen and not bumping as much when the man curls which is going to free up Vanderpumps nice shot by Withers they need him to play well today they need him to be in in double figures both ways points in rebounds the average is nine six foot nine Redshirt Junior from Charlotte in the one on one he got it to go in the midrange great setup Virginia is so good at planning their foot setting up their cut running their man into a screen and theres Franklin going left to find Gardner swirls it out you love him in that spot I love him thats a rare Miss for him in that area he faded a little bit but hes as good a 15 to 17 foot catch and shoot shooter there is in the nation beefman picked it off Clark off the shot fake probing Gardner the trailer Armand Franklin knocks it down inside out three very good basketball play Gardner didnt have the shot makes the kick out to Franklin thats one of the problems for Louisville late closeouts Music Music rich thank you very much we welcome you to Charlottesville Virginia for Virginia ranked 13th in the country and Louisville alongside Tom Green Mike Monaco with you its the Cavaliers up 82 early on on Louisville with the whos trying to win another share of a league title Tom here in the AC theres nothing like it at winning a championship never gets old even for Tony Bennett because this could be his sixth its its your program its your team its an individual day each and every day to get to this place and theyve got to finish it off inside of this twohour period to get that Championship that they worked so hard for from last spring thats what you play this regular season for sitting at 145 in the ACC tied at the top with two other teams Miami and Pitt who meet later today so with a win Virginias got a share of what would be their sixth conference Crown in the last 10 years theyve still got time run it again go up again theres L Ellis the accs second leading scorer and Ellis draws a foul with the shot clock winding down not a bad play theyre con Louisville right now wants to get that ball screen up around 28 30 feet away which is really really important now okay taking it on which he was able to do hes got to come tighter off vanderplas right there and not allow him to catch up if he does that hes got an N1 but right before that he tried to split the Trap hes got to not only try to trap at times hes gonna have to try to take on the big man because when LLS has been able to attack the drop coverage and an attack the screeners defender hes been way better and right now hes gonna have to navigate that trap up top thats something you said to Louisville head coach Kenny Payne in his first season of course and cards going through it at 2 and 17 at the bottom of the ACC but thats one of their keys where the ball screen starts and then flow offensively against Virginias great D absolutely because Dale Ellis has got to get downhill Louisville is not good when they play off zero one or two passes when they move the ball it gives them a chance to drive long Closeouts to make the next pass to get an open three to get an offensive rebound position when they start trying to do it too fast thats not good Armon Franklin this is from Deep Ryan Dunn in Off the Bench with an offensive rebound 13 in white the very talented true freshman now theyve gone Zone on the offensive rebound theyre trying to match back up now they sit back into the Zone this is where theyve got all awareness Clark to Ryan Dunn they are so good Kihei Clark is so good at not only finding Cutters but finding dropoffs and what you cant do whether youre man or Zone okay is you cannot just watch the ball and allow people to get open behind you Kihei Clark at the controls one last time here in Charlottesville fifth year senior here on senior day so he got recognized last year for it didnt go through the pregame ceremonies earlier today as Gene Gardner gets a block on L Ellis who recovers has to get it up and he does but he got fortunate because thats not a good shot okay you have the roll you have the throwback with your left hand unless you cant take a challenge threepoint shot and be in this game on the road at Virginia theyll check it at the monitor when we come back so many places across the country its senior day and it is always a beautiful sight and emotional as well as it was for Jaden Gardner a great player here in Virginia the last two years well senior day and and hes such a good player he was really good for Joe doolitis Carolina hes been very good for Tony Bennett here as I said one of the maybe I think hes the best 15 to 17 foot catch and shoot type player in the elbow range senior day before the game is hard it is hard all right and when you oh my goodness my goodness he looks 10 there right a guy who went through Senior Day last year yeah that was his second ever game how he looked Kihei Clark oh yeah dont let that baby face fool you because that that guy is lethal when it comes to winning when it comes to scoring delivering the ball making the right play Jaden Gardner turns around and knocks it down just by the way housekeeping wise they had a long look at the monitor during the commercial break and they ruled a shot clock violation that Louisville did not get it off in time with El Ellis so they Trail by eight well that was that was lucky to get that rebound because you just cant take a challenge three over two people like that you know play and take on the ball screen youve got the Defenders coming up high utilize the space that theyre giving you just come off the screen and play shot clock winding down heres JJ trainer you think he is a big key for the cards today and now Mike James slashing on the Baseline and he gets the roll with a tough take good drive I dont think they can live in the shot clock right now okay I think theyve got to look to score somewhere in that 1412 10 Mark uh on the clock but thats a great move by Mike James he didnt Panic drove it out of the corner good finish they go back to man now first meeting between these teams in Louisville there was no Zone you were curious to see if Kenny Payne would go to some Zone hes shown a little so far well I think when you come on the road its so good to be able to mix it up but at the end of the day theyre such great fiveman movement with Virginia youve got to mix up what theyre seeing because right now weve probably seen 10 11 curl Cuts all right already in this game and they are so good not only at the curl but then theres a screen happening on the other side of the floor which is where they get their back Cuts so theyre going to back cut you and theyre going to flare screen you across the top off those curls you you dont want to chase that all game you sound one of the curls from Gardner at the elbow and now Ryan Dunn at the line hes got to stay on the line dont walk off the line Ryan stay on the line you know players so many times they either fade back early or they fall forward early rather than staying in their shot plant your feet shift your weight hold your follow through dont walk off the line what a bright future Ryan Dunn has and the future has arrived here in Charlottesville the guy was a late bloomer amazingly he couldnt dunk until his senior year of high school does a nice job yeah he stayed on the line his feet he shifted his weight kept it there and he didnt fade forward or backwards there you go take it on this is where Louisvilles did their best they had to close out didnt drive it right away Kamari lands but still got it freshman number 42 in our ESPN 100 with the bucket thats a very good play they got Isaac McNeely whos got to become better in the closeout game hes an outstanding offensive player for a freshman but hes got to get better guarding the ball and and right there they took it on no wasted dribbles right now by Lands by James thats a positive for the Louisville offense Applause we can hear him back it was such a great finish he never dropped the ball caught it above his shoulders kept going great pass the fifth year senior from Argentina who they call Poppy Applause theres Sydney Curry going to work on caparo and back out to lands with 10 to shoot now Ellis off the bounce on Beekman one of the best defenders in the ACC and its an offensive foul on L Ellis Music watch The Vision on this pass its just like Ping Ping the pass is made immediately all right never dropped to said never wasted it threw it right there great role because theyre getting caught all right in no mans land on the screen theyre not staying with the roller theyre not taking away the curler and thats what happens they recognize that probably out of that timeout knew what they were going to get you like the way that Virginia was flowing offensively in a win Tuesday over Clemson and that is Franklin again hes got another three in an early eight point well thats why Kenny if the game plan is to mix defenses its the way to go because they are so good at coming off screens and Louisvilles trying to Trail those screens and if youre late at all especially on the Baseline the one place you can really move screens is on the Baseline all right and and the bottom line is youve got to recognize you trailing are you sure are you going over the top you cannot be late Music 10point margin shot clock winding down on James had it roll off the rim and it belongs to Virginia when we come back with the Cavaliers up by 10 early on now Franklin does a great job of coming along the Baseline on this all right as he takes off you see him come off he doesnt hesitate theyre late the screen moves up on James theres no communication on the sweet switch rip the New York Lights ACC mens basketball tournament that tournament is is so strong and itll be that way this year I mean when youre when youre putting people in there theres a lot of people everybody has something on the line and and the bottom line of you can advance your seating and high quality wins is big great move by Kenny Payne changing it to Zone here I like what hes doing out of timeouts now they just got to be active the one the biggest weakness of Louisville this year has been their hands theres not enough impact on the ball not enough pressure on the ball and when they trap they dont deflect enough ball Club theres a good one right there theyve got their hands up good hands Vision theyve got to take Vision away from from their opponent from uh Virginia today Music accs second leading scorer again out of the game right now and Fabio basili true freshman 11 and black is running the point after getting some run earlier this week for Louisville in the Tuesday loss against Virginia Tech curry with the shot clock winding down yet again capro on him but silly voice and its the second shot clock violation forced by Virginia and their 24th this is Big Time oneonone defense Virginias elected not to go with the double team right now to create the turnover to create a turnover like that and oneonone defense let me move his feet cafaros moving his feet her hands the hands are active Currys got to try to go buy him attack one of his feet and go buy him but in that situation there was nowhere to go when youre just dribbling the ball thats where theyve got to make an attack great minutes by cafara even though it on the turnovers for Louisville it has been a problem All Season at times Kenny Payne has said thats the elephant in our locker room the turnovers and Virginia will force you into the most of any team in the ACC and then they take care of it as well absolutely I mean that thats thats what theyve got to do I mean when youre when youre turning the ball over and Id say the same thing about tough jump shots they turned into like live ball turnovers McNeely nested from Deep and it belongs to Louisville when people play like Francisco caporo just played like that it just raises not only the energy of the team but the entire building youre the Ovation he got early in the game I mean people love when people are just blue collar getting after it and and the defensive masterpieces that Tony Bennetts been able to put together over years is very highly respected inside this home crowd done cleared the Miss from lands hell Elvis almost took it away from Kihei Clark team Murray is into the game as well 10 in white sophomore who got some minutes earlier this week in that Tuesday win over Clemson McNeely you said known for his shooting finds Gardner in that midrange spot its its just it goes straight up but hes done such a better job at Virginia is hes he never wastes dribbles he drives in a straight line the spin is efficient but a lot of times like that he doesnt even dribble he just goes right up and shoots the ball tremendous touch tremendous feel from from close range different than the guy you remembered at East Carolina a few years back thats going to be big today theyve got when you get a foul by gal Ellis just did with the court spaced and now you create a oneonone down the middle of the floor thats good offense all right when youre trying to drive on a set defense thats not good offense that kind of ball movement they made a couple of passes he gets fouled you can live with that the library so Ellis goes to the strike the foul the First on Kihei Clark hes shooting 86 percent from the freethrow line averaging 20 in the last five hes got to have a great game hes got to have a great floor game scoring game but a tremendous leadership game another full day of college hoops over on ESPN as well plus the app top teams teams 12 square off at four Eastern Texas and Kansas in the top 10 Showdown then we told you about Duke Carolina and then 10 Eastern the top teams in the Pac12 number four UCLA trying to grab a number one seed against number eight Arizona Music North Carolina the second team out according to Joey Brackett so that is a crucial game at Chapel Hill oh theres no question and Duke is playing better Duke is playing better that game will not only come down to the rebounding but it will come down so much the North Carolina shot selection especially from the perimeter and will they find bacon and compete Nance not only facilitate scoring but be a good passer in the highlow game Gardner goes to work on the inside for Virginia he just overpowered him inside and they come out of the time Id like to go into the Press by Louisville but you have to put up more resistance at The Rim you have to have more impact on the ball more resistance at The Rim in a postup situation Cavaliers have made six of their last seven shots the lead is a dozen and Louisvilles got Zan Payne Kenny Payne sauna walkon 23 and black into the game in this first half too strong from him and Gardner in the rebound yeah and see what whats theres nothing wrong with that drive whats wrong is Louisvilles not getting to the offensive glass you cannot assume that the ball is going to go in on a drive to the bucket at least get one or two to the glass before you sprint back this is where they cant get stagnant and stay in this game theyve got to continue to get movement and not try to turn this into a oneonone driving game on the face up short so if youre Louisville against the tempo Virginia please how many would you be comfortable sending to the offensive glass oh you gotta get I would say two but again heres the situation dont be in no mans land Sprint back trainer no no offensive rebound one and done for the cards not a bad shot for him hes been playing better uh hes got some versatility uh he faded on that shot but thats an open three that he can take they cant be in a hurry its a long game ago went under the screen nearly couldnt make them pay theyve got to run when they can run get into the secondary break then this drag screen just like this who goes two on one back to Beekman for two see thats Mike James get back Mike James get back and try to break the player dont assume that its a layup that thats what happens in the turnover you cant have a twoonone and then if a guy jogging back to get into the play Cavaliers are rolling up 14 after the strip and the score were in Charlottesville great hands hes got to be stronger coming through that trap all right Tom Green you want Louisville with high ball screens for L Ellis but why doesnt this work well this is why its 10 to zero and points off turnovers all right Trader is right there set the screen now LS has got to do a better job of getting his left foot in the line of the screen but theres an old term called The partnership of screening its on both guys but Trader sets the sets the slip the slip so L Ellis never has a chance to take on vanderplas he could split it if theres a screen he could take him on hes not strong enough with the ball theres the Trap theres the bucket and Mike James has got to get back into play youre on the road you got to sell your hustle out on every play its part of six turnovers for Ted Lloyds yep Virginia has cashed in they lead by 14 again with a win today the Cavaliers clinch at least a share or share rather of the ACC regular season title with whoever wins in the Miami pit game later on tonight in Coral Gables good offensive possession open three thats where Withers has got to go straight up he has a tendency to fade to his left when he misses great set right here Uconn and Kevin Ollie went to a national championship that was their main action back in the day when they had Napier and boat right and thats a great double screen action that the Virginia has been using more and more lately they doubled the post on Huntley Hatfields and forces turnover out of the hands of Withers yeah well beekmans has got a quicker hands as anybody in this gym right now but when they throw it to him like that thats an easy steal Louisvilles just got to get back to the baseball analogy quit trying to hit home runs and hit some singles keep it simple keep the ball moving all year long and I know this drives Kenny Payton that snap nuts the communication defensively has not been good and the switching too many times the switch is called by the man being screened than by the man thats actually setting the screen which is where it should be called James muscles in on Beekman and Mike James will go to the free throw line as we watch this play now this is just absolute Brandon Huntley Hatfield steps up for no reason all right whether he was going to switch whether he was going to help on the curl thats a complete miscommunication as we can see from him going back theres no need to step up like that if youre Brandon Huntley Hatfield all right theres no need all right if youre going to switch it thats fine but theres no need stay with your man bump the curl he didnt even curl stay with yours thats where they carve you up because they find a way to hit the slips we chatted with Kenny Payne pregame today he was upbeat he was positive but again he used the same verb weve heard him use throughout this season that hes trying to drag guys along in year one taking over his Alma monster hes not used to that hes not used that as a player he wasnt used to it at Oregon he wasnt used to it Kentucky hes not used to it with the Knicks and that takes time but I was really impressed with how upbeat he was he knows exactly where he is right now but I think hes got a pretty good handle on what hes got to do to get it better and theres no doubt its going to start when this season ends its going to start getting back in that gym immediately with that team Franklin no dice from deep but then its off Devin Reed and why the way for Louisville they just got to town yeah here in the Commonwealth of Virginia a few hours ago they didnt take off today until 9 AM because of the weather and the tornado warnings back in Kentucky last night they kept getting delayed so you see how this day has played out for them well thats that part of the country great slip by Beekman that part of the country is going through it thats I saw 475 000 homes without power in Kentucky last night there were deaths I mean its just tragic and its sad on so many levels so theyre probably very fortunate that they were able to come but again sometimes that changeup of energy can help you it hasnt helped them take care of the basketball better today but theyre playing hard theyre just not playing efficient with the ball and the communication defensively has been whats been their problem throughout the season and thats something that you can control you may not be able to control that youre not blocking all the shots and getting all the steals but you can control your communication on switches and and and playing the ball but seeing your man which is so important to do defensively the bucket by Mike James was the first made basket by Louisville in more than eight minutes and now Huntley Hatfield forces the Franklin turnover thats a great defensive play by Brandon Huntley Hatfield he stayed with his man they thought they had to slip he gets his hands up theyre running the other way James got bought no foul called Ellis Rises cant hit yeah he faded its a good pass he faded hes got to get a bigger step hes actually too close to the threepoint line there hes got to get more of a step because hes a left right shooter but hes got to hold his follow through not fade back the Junior got to the logo right at the free throw line and itll stay with the Cavaliers about good shot they are so good in the midrange game Virginia they are so good at the curl game and what makes them so unique is they are very very good catching the ball on the right side and being able to curl with their left hand theyre not a onehand team by any stretch of the imagination screen the screener Music and now Clark off a screen with Gardner posting and a mismatch on Kihei Clark off the bounce on Huntley Hatfield the kick for McNeely got a good block out there from James but he gets whistled for a foul on the rebounding Action cleaning out van vanderplas well that was such a good play by Kihei Clark because what happens a lot of times they switch Brandon Huntley Hatfield into five on him too many guards will settle for that shot right he does a great job driving him here comes the help he makes the kick out its just a missed three but that was a great decision by Kihei Music and a long career of good decisions from Kihei Clark closing it down as we told you here in Charlottesville as Gardner went to work couldnt muscle it up and here comes Louisville down a dozen theres a drag good screen three swirls one out and vanderplast the rebound Id like to see an L he had the screeners man in paint he likes those defenses when theyre when theyre dropped off take them on and attack the rim but its an open three you can live with that but you got to try something right now to get get to that foul line all started with a better screen similar to the one even broken down earlier driving kick for Beekman yes had a look back the Louisville bench from the normally quiet race beakman well hes got a lot of Pride and you know he does hes got a lot of improvement his threepoint shooting has improved every year since his freshman year here under Tony Bennett in Virginia and thats the one part for him to be the NBA player that hes destined to be that hes got to become more and more consistent at a good answer from Mike James whos got nine and when you talk to this Louisville coaching staff they Rave about the redshirt freshman Mike James his work ethic and how they would have five of him if they could well thats the bottom line for them is that hes got to get better because he hes somebody you can build through not maybe build around but you can build through and that was a very good shot they got the ball reversed they made the next pass thats the way Louisvilles got to be in this game Virginia by 12 and I saw him do it with numerous people but uh every tribute that you have and I saw Wally Walker before the game and its alumni weekend Im sure there are some phenomenal stories uh and remembrances of him but thats my remembrance how this legendary coach treated a mid20s assistant uh and just made me feel like I was a coach right like when youre in your mid20s and youre doing this job and you got a legend like that thats good to you thats awesome stuff like you belonged no question but I think thats why his players loved playing for him its beautifully said Brian Dunn commits the foul on Jalen Withers in a late shot clock scenario low scoring first half as you might expect number 13 Virginia against Louisville at the bottom of the ACC with Virginia setting its sights on what would be another ACC regular season Championship theyve got five in the last nine years thats amazing and its just a model of stability with with different groups uh Tonys done such a phenomenal job of integrating young with his older guys I mean youve got a guy like Kihei Clark thats been through it and Reese Beekman thats been through it and you bring in an arm on Franklin you bring in a Jalen Gardner you bring in Ben vanderpost and it just they just come together the system is so strong with room for improvement and and uh theyre playing good basketball right now at the end I know they had some they havent scored as easily and some of that is because they dont create a lot of turnovers at all and the other part of it is because theyre not getting into foul line as much had those losses to Boston College in North Carolina what a cup what a fine done for big men thats where theyve been so much better offensively are those weak Side High Wing slot cuts off baseline or middle penetration driving kick lands in and out Clark the rebound Virginia runs Music its where the communication cant drop you got a minute 30 if youre Louisville trying to finish this off Applause the skip for McNeely saw the note 12 assists on 12 made buckets for the Cavaliers see this is where the hands theyve got to be up get your hands up put pressure on the ball Clark gets fouled good drive we see this now they come out of the timeout okay all five are moving theyre in the elbows they run a curl cut with Franklin he rips it or Beekman does a good job going left and there is the cut by Don and in their case its not the weak side Wing as many times since the weak side elbow and its very very hard to guard its very hard to guard because you watch that ball at all and youre not if youre not biting up your cutter and knowing that your cutter is coming to the rim its a dunk just like that you know so many teams get their weak side cuts from the threepoint line and they do as well but they are so good coming off that inside the arc elbow area off that off that drive Clark good on both great freethrow shooter in his career hes got five points to go along with three assists in this first half and its Virginia by 15 not enough space oh my goodness he got it hell has got fouled he got it got good heads up played by Ellis on him but the hands werent a little bit tight I think he was anticipating the drive and then lifted him up all right hes got his hand on him thats a good call good smart heads up play by oh Ellis well they say its on the floor Ellis was pleading otherwise and its the second foul on Kihei Clark so he goes to the bench with 55 seconds until halftime well now you got youve got to get a lab or youve got to get to the foul line you cant come out and take a quick jump shot you got to trim this lead down the best that you can with under a minute to go dont want an empty possession here if youre Louisville JJ trainer going to work on Ryan Dunn tough shot over the top from trainer good play very good play and you know whats amazing about trainer okay he does such a great job of scoring for them outside on on out of bounds place its just amazing how the ball finds him on Baseline and sideline out of bounds Music and coming on recently last four games averaging 13 per McNeely hoists Applause great action Armon Franklin going left delivers the ball what they do so well is move on each others penetration theyre in constant movement on that perimeter Ellis hath controls in the waning seconds around the corner he lost it and that is a businesslike first half from Virginia with a lead crown on the line watch frankly the attacks left hes got Hatfield he doesnt settle they flip into the elbow thinking theyre going to stop the ball McNeely slides right behind him open three yeah the points off turnover 121 uh if they didnt have the ball movement that would be the story of the game Louisvilles got to be much much stronger playing through traffic playing through contact on that pick and roll and theyve got to do a better job of facilitating those screens can fewest points in a half at any point this season for Louisville with 20 it down by 16 entering the second half Jalen Withers with a strong drive and he draws a foul very good possession they got it reverse three times they hit the paint twice they make the kick out they get a lefthand drive to the rim thats what you got to do you have to do that and and the ball screen game has got to become more efficient for them but right there they started it without it and if theyre moving the ball like that problem for Louisville has been they dont stick with whats working for them and the players break off and do their own thing and you cant do that and be successful talked about getting touches and reversals thats something that Kenny Payne chatted with us about earlier today that he is starting his mornings with passing and ball movement and cutting without dribbling I thought that was unbelievable what he said that that they go in at eight oclock during the season and and as I said to Kenny as a coach you never want to delegate what you enjoy doing the most and long before Kenny Payne was a head coach long before he got the reputation as a great recruiter he was known as a Player Development coach whether it was in the NBA whether it was Oregon and even in Kentucky theres a lot of millionaires running around the NBA right now that were touched by Kenny Paynes development and that is going to serve him well as he builds this program Clark can knock it down good closeout from James but the offensive rebound from Armon Franklin yeah no hit on the on the blockout thats a very good action that they run theres a double ball screen sequence in that for Virginia a senator earlier Kevin Ollie ran that was his basic play most used play I think going to the national championship game years ago but Louisvilles got to block out I mean weak side rebounds youve got to block out 51 is the edge in favor of Virginia on offensive rebounds and then vanderplas forced the steal Ellis runs it down for the cards James short it belongs to Virginia thats an example right there use your left hand thats what whats going to happen in Player Development for a guy like Mike James you didnt have to swing it back to your right hand just use your left hand and score the ball Penny payments fired up he wanted the call going in favor of his team along that sideline Music Franklins got ten hes the leading scorer for Virginia he got honored here on senior day he does have a remaining year of Eligibility if he wants a fifth season here in Charlottesville watch Gardner on the slip there it is oh yeah because he set the flare and theyre backed off it they got away from his body and because theyre playing the flare with two people which just allows to slip and and Gardner is so good at the elbows I would never leave him at that elbow I mean I might run a boxing one from 15 feet in Im Im joking but you cannot let him play free hes too good Withers thats how far away goes yeah youre not gonna youre not gonna make a living on that shot but thats something that they needed to stem the tide now theyre going to Bear down and get some stops here Withers was on balance when he took that shot tough to be on balance with a turnaround but he was so Franklins got 10 gardeners got eight its been well balanced there it is again yeah falling away no boxing on this stuff but were gonna have to do something if were Louisville because theyre playing theyre theyre both playing the ball and then theres nobody rotating over youre not taking anything away putting two people on the flare screen trainer on the offensive boards goes diving forward and rescues it out to James they move it for Ellis short from Deep trainer underneath with a putback that we see it right there that is one of the weaknesses theres three things and if Virginia is going to make a Deep Run theyve got to get better at number one theyve got to close out better and not jump stop they not not pop their feet theyre too easy right now at times to get beat theyve got to be better with the weak side blockouts and theyve got to get better guarding the ball one on one on movement mob for trainer down to Withers cant follow his own miss good block out this time for Virginia and Franklin gets fouled by Withers very good but again thats where youve got to go up if youre not going to dunk the ball use the backboard give yourself every chance to make the shot Music look at the play okay misses it all right takes a shot yeah inadvertent going for the ball just trying to make a play on the ball so Virginia Armand may not agree with that when hes feeling in his face but he was just trying to make a play on the ball it goes back to work offensively and Louisville in the zone yeah back up which is good keeps them compact shes got to get the hands up Music Shuffle the feet and walks with it all right so Virginia you said rebounding rebounding weak side especular blockouts for sure and Closeouts Closeouts they have a tendency right now sometimes and Franklins got to get better at this Gardners got to get better with this they jump stop okay they close you out on a long closeout and they jump stop which is too easy rather than coming up sliding their feet smudging them and then taking the first dribble when you jump stop its really really hard Deputy balance to get back in front and take the first dribble oh see I think Ellers could do this more I think Ellis could take on the big more and create fouls like that rather than trying to split not a bad play by alos Virginia is in control early on was emotional on Senior Day pregame and he has gone to work against Louisville yes I almost teared up watching him tear up but he is he is playing at such a high level he sets the screen right there theres no help when youre defending the screener okay you have got to do a good job of staying connected to that man because it allows a slip and vanderplas does more popping Gardner does more slipping and and theres no ball pressure and theres no connection to the man it makes it that much easy and they are so good at reading each other at Virginia that plays like that are just a normal part of their offense how much of what you have seen from Tony Bennetts offense today and on film do you like and give you confidence going forward toward the NCAA tournament I like it a lot I think they could do even more with Kihei and the ball screen because what he can do is he can see and he can develop they do such a good job of of making the next pass all right on the drive from the wings or on the drive from the corners but I think I think its good I think they need Ben if theyre going to make a run Ben vanderplas has got to be a good threepoint shooter for them from that Five Spot five in white the sixth year senior of the Ohio transfer as Gardner faces up for two more and for vanderplas Tony Bennett again reiterated to us pregame that vanderplas is dealing with back issues that he has been dealing with for a few weeks at times during the last few weeks hes had a brace on the bench on his lower back when he checks out of games and Tony Bennett told us he thinks vanderplas is getting better and that would be huge because hes a connector for them well look at him in his stance right now look at how hes playing hes down hes moving hes sprinting out of the pick and roll trap to get back in the paint great cut great cut by LLS nice pass Lance kept his eyes up very good pass but but vanderplas is is a weapon he he so many times theyll curl off of him and hell step back behind for a three because the Defenders are trying to play the curl he can really make people pay he creates even better spacing for the Virginia offense when hes making threes Gardners cooking right now gardeners like in the gym shooting by himself right now theres no hand up all right you know what hes coming with youve got to get your hand up and challenge the shot but hes so good in that midrange area and then Kihei Clark doing Kihei Clark things just hounding L Ellis and forcing Ellis to use a Louisville timeout early on in this second half this North Carolina is in the first four out you see the second team out right now behind Arizona State but Tom Green if theyre going to win in Chapel Hill the keys for the heels are what right now tonight its going to be shot selection and I think theyve got to go inside to Bangkok Pete Nance has got to take good shots right he did a very good job on Gardner last week Gardner did not defend him to the level of what Virginia needs him to be but there cannot be a slew of bad shots that turn into runouts for Duke because that plays right into their hands 30 ESPN round two and that great rivalry that clock winding down El Ellis and a whistle away from the ball and its a foul Brandon Huntley Hatfield in the post that was starting to be a good position Im possession I should say they got the ball reversed played out of the poster with Mike James those are the kind of turnovers that just hurt you you come out of a timeout you drew something up its on the way to working or getting the look that you want and it doesnt happen 10 turnovers 10 buckets as well for Louisville its the unforced turnovers its one thing to turn it over in a trap its another one to turn to turn it over on a screen Kihei Clark out of the game right now Zone again for Kenny Payne beekmans had a great day seven assists without a turnover for two and white Franklin tried to hit that one from Stanton caparo kept it alive to mcnealer Cafaro is going to be open on a drop off this guy just keeps coming well thats thats having a pretty good teacher to watch and Jayden Gardner right and being in that situation for Dunn to make that shot because theyre going to need him to be a player like Gardner is he had to play the other night against Clemson he blocked his shot took off ran the floor got a lob on the other end very very good play for Ryan Dunn Curry gets the roll for Louisville Music Ryan Dunn 10 points five rebounds against Clemson Tuesday second most points hes had in the game this season and he had been quiet the previous half dozen games McNeely knocks it down plus a foul just a beautiful three his shot is so compact gives the shot fake takes the dribble stays in the motion of his shot foul I mean he when McNeely understands the level of Defense hes got to play for Tony Bennett he is going to be so much better in this program because he can shoot it they call him iMac from Poco West Virginia takes more than 70 percent of his field goals from three cant stamp it Curry the rebound falls back off the line faded off stay in your shot shooters stay in your shot go forward not backwards sounds simple but you got to do it yeah and you got to remind youve got to remind them to do it you got to remind yourself to do it those are just little fundamental things no one goes to the foul line with the intention of missing but its the reminders that do the deal oh that is a deep one for Ellis came up short good battle on the boards and Fabio basili with the putback yeah they had three on the glass they come up with it its a tough three but they get on the glass and and come up with it facility the six foot Four Freshmen from Orlando has now played in the last few games after not being in there for Kenny Payne for about a month Music comes to get it shot clock at 10 McNeely Ellis straight down him done same spot missed it wide left better shot challenge but hell eventually get that hes got a slip and get his hands up even quicker to create more space when he makes that catch done the rebound quick threes that that you dont need those right now theyre open but you need to get this game to the rim where youve got a chance to get to the foul line the 16point game with 11 30 to go youre not going to get back in theres just firing one pass threes nearly slashing and finishing again thats vintage Virginia basketball a curl cut come off tight can attack off either out of either Corner when they hit that curl very good finishing seven for McNeely Music Applause trainer lowering the shoulder on done carving out space and scoring off the glass thats one of the things that Kenny Payne has done a very good job of especially in the last couple weeks if you can get a postup ISO off movement its good and that that was very good they drove it out of the corner got into the running postup theres no double right now finishes it was only a matter of time because theyre losing sight of him down low underneath good heads up play by Franklin to drop it off now lets stop the ball screen trying to attack kafaro James drives on Franklin caporo helps James turns it over yeah theres nobody down there except the longest defender in the gym and thats the Baseline you dont need to drive it to the Baseline its so easy in this day and age to find Talent its easy to find players hes got to find people that will absolutely play the way he envisions Louisville playing hes got one coming in and Caleb Glenn from Vladimir and then the other one tradition never graduates they have one of the great traditions in college sports let alone college basketball with so many pros and the nil is a big part of the game right now theres no doubt about that and Louisville should be able to compete with that they need to remind people that they know how to turn out great teams Pros people that have had success outside of basketball and that tradition of that program those former players have got to Rally even more to help as time goes on I think they are but its going to be so important for them to do even more as they build this program back up you can change a roster way faster than you ever could before in college basketball when you look at this roster who are the first guys you would say I need to retain these guys they have to be back next well it depends on Ellis wants to test it and see what what hes thinking that I think right now theres no doubt everybodys going to improve if you have a great spring and summer but I would start with Mike James and JJ Trainor and I really would those guys are young theyve got to be theyve got to be core in this Brandon Huntley Hatfields got to get better hes got to get in great shape not good shape great shape up and down the floor develop more of a perimeter game uh theres Improvement levels that everyone at Louisville can get to and it really if youre Kenny Payne right now youre not waiting for them to come in the gym youre assigning that time like this is when were getting better and you dont leave it up to people you make them better than you see where you stand and then as you recruit youre recruiting constantly to how you want to play not just to whos in the portal not just to what they want nil not just whos recruiting them what do they bring my team that can help me win at Louisville you said you would take a couple of days after the season but you truly mean like five days and then its back to individuals exactly what I mean yeah I dont think youre coming off this season yeah they can break later they dont need a week I guess you got to take a week I take that back youve got to take the time whatever that time is with the the NCAA is right now Id be ready to go the next day no doubt in my mind I know theres a little bit of time off but thats how youre going to find out whos with you right who wants to get better if theyre not about getting better I dont know how you stay right but thats the bottom line with the program Music gets fouled and connects on the first hey our NBA Saturday primetime game on ABC and the ESPN app great one of the Eastern Conference Sixers and the Bucks who have won 16 oh coverage starts with NBA Countdown at 80 Eastern five Pacific saw the Sixers earlier this week I did I saw the Sixers in the Mavericks it was the game where uh Luca and Kyrie combined first time in Mavericks history for over 40 Tyrese Maxi was unbelievable in that game because they were down 20 plus and he brought them all the way back but that game will be phenomenal Joel embiida look up I think hes got 15 hes got 27 and uh just amazing how easy he scores like clockwork Giannis is back bucks still rolling silly off the shot fig finds Ellis knocks it down and L Ellis with under nine to go connects from Deep hes got 14 and its down to 15 that was a very good possession very good driving kick possession ready to shoot it L Ellis has got to trust that catchy shoot more just like that hes been off the screen eight assists no turnovers Clark short done battles on the boards but basily whisks it away Ellis drives and draws a foul Is got to get better hes a guy coming down full head of steam you gotta take that first dribble its easier said than done but thats going to be the next step for him for Virginia to continue to be the Virginia that Tony Bennett has made this both McNeely and Dunn have got to improve their defensive abilities be more active with their hands be better guarding the dribble be more physical around the bucket if they get caught in a poster by take the dribble you mean stop the ball and drop that him from getting by you take a bigger first step underneath and theres one of your guys JJ trainer on the second effort for Louisville he can do things he really cant consistency has got to become the number one goal for him at Louisville moving forward because he shows flashes trainer definitely shows flashes Junior whos got the biggest role of his career this season its a kick on basily and with eight to go in Charlottesville Louisville is hanging around down 13 and John Paul Jones Arena hey Clark who Cavaliers fans know was a onetime UC Davis commit and then D committed and Tony Bennett had been looking at someone else on the recruiting Trail but he felt that wasnt going Virginias way anymore so he reengaged with Kihei Clark and he called the UC Davis coach Jim Les about Clark and Tony Bennett started to think hey maybe the small guy has a role that type of player and that type of body and then theres something to be said about a player who wants to be at your school thats the biggest thing because he has represented this school in this program on the court in such a way he makes everybody better with his presence because he delivers the ball hes become a better shooter if you go under the pick and roll hes going to take it and knock it down he leads the team in free throw attempts he just makes the game so much easier and I think what great leaders do they make everybody feel safer because theyre in the game with them now most teenage guys 21 theyre not guys hey man you make me feel safe but you feel better when hes in the game might be something more like thats my guy yeah thats another word for Im better when youre on the floor Kihei Clark has made teammates that way for five years and now playing in his final home game in Charlottesville and game number 157 of his career and hes the guy that opposing coaches always single out in the handshake line post game and talk about in the post game press conference well he just means so much to the program and he won a championship at a young age but he epitomizes what they want to do on offense and defense and and uh rarely gets rattled its very very hard to take Kihei Clark out of a game by pressure good pass Rob for Gardner from Beekman thats what thats what Virginia needed thats what this crowd needed that is not what Louisville needed was a back screen lob for Gardner Louisville had got it down to 13 we have less than seven to go in this second half again Virginia eyeing a share of the ACC regular season turn the pressure up look at the pressure making everything hard theyve got to get back to taking on that ball screen the Kihei Clark has turned it up on LL Ellis here initiating in mid court with four to shoot why do they all rallied to the ball they forgot about wheeler underneath great play by Alice because Kihei Clark was locking him up great play Music Ellis who has had so much on his shoulders this year for the cards 14 and that dime to Roosevelt wheeler vanderplas got wheeler in the air and finished the curling slip added again they get great movement they always set that screen up with their footwork they forced that screeners man to make a decision that was the wrong decision Vander plus wide open great job by Clark he opens up a little bit Ellis keeps his eyes up the whole way finds wheeler behind it as they all rally thinking else going to shoot it but theres nobody to play vanderplas on ball side they have to rotate across leave their feet so hard to guard them in a twoman game so hard to guard them you cant always try to take away the curling and then a good sign from Ben vanderplas he stamped the threepoint play he stayed more than an hour after the game Tuesday with his recent free throw woes working on free throws after that win over Clemson well Tony said to us before the game that hes worked on on where he releases his shot what Ive seen from him because he was in the 70s back in Ohio he falls back off that line too much and he falls early and so that hes not giving himself a chance to to get a bounce I mean stay in your shot he did a better job of that right there Mike James back with two hes into double figures with 11 the red shirt freshman from Orlando Music slip again Gardner nearly automatic from the midrange if youre Louisville understand time and score not a time for a quick one time for a good one get to the basket is that a good one no no a turnaround from 17 feet you can make it but youre on the road and momentum was starting to come your way its still a 14point game with five minutes to go you need to get something going to the rim or get something in the paint that opens up a kick out three not a turnaround jump shot house Clark hey UFC 285 tonight from TMobile arena in Vegas another stack card two title fights long awaited return couple years in the making for Jon Jones who has packed on the pounds main card starts 10 Eastern on payperview prelims eight Eastern on ESPN ESPN Deportes and ESPN plus to get the main card in English and Spanish go to espnpluscom Applause Franklin off of curl Franklin off of curl going left hes so good going left out of that right corner he came over to say hi to you in the game know him we tried to recruit him when uh when I was in Georgia when he left Indiana Ive known him a long time hes a young young player when I was coaching at Indiana but this is one thing that they do such a great job of they get set up in the corner they set their cut up all right he curls they bring two men to the ball so trainers trying to play the ball as well when when Franklin has struggled he has not finished through his eyes that was a great play Ill finish him through your eyes taking moderate contact but going up strong in either using the backboard or getting it over the top of the rim great great heads up fundamental play from Franklin Through Your Eyes means what through your eyes you score through your shoulders you you separate with your feet but when you go up to your shot like that basically becomes a reach layup because youre trying to reach over the defender to get it over the top of the rim you cant drop your eyes early especially with contact you want to finish with your eyes watch the ball go through the net or watch it go off the backboard but a lot of times guys drop their head when they get hit because theyre bracing for that contact and then that drops their eyes James his threepoint play gets it back down to 13 more than four to go second half Virginia leading here at home park with a shimmy and a step back on Ellis he wants a deep one cant knock it down rebound basili and momentum for Louisville with the basketball it is youve got to get a good look if youre Louisville this is where you figure thats a good look s great defense great defense this is where Louisvilles got a chance dont dont lose hold of the Rope right here keep a hold of the Rope as a team we talked about that with Kenny when it starts to go wrong you still gotta hold on you still got to keep coming right now its a 13point game with three and a half lefts Clark attacks trainer counts is for done theres finishing with your eyes and theres never dropping your eyes on the drive and thats one thing Kihei Clark does a phenomenal job up he plays with his head up he keeps his eyes up and he can make something out of nothing in this case finding the man cutting underneath on the Baseline great play by dunk he and Beekman have combined for 16 assists for Virginia foreign ERS wrap around for basily shot clock in three its James attacking and James draws a foul thats a good play thats a good play its Virginia youre not getting ready for these cuts and screens and back cuts and constant movement in the in a walk through in the ballroom at the hotel youre just not doing it and I think they get through the first game it serves them well because theyre so hard to get ready and people say well they played them all year no you have but you havent been preparing for them for days on an end and and thats what they are so good because they play offs each other so well in the cutting and the movement game what do you like about Duke right now uh I like I like uh Whitehead I like the way that hes playing I think roach has got to be phenomenal for them I think Proctors got to get back to being the guy that hes been all year because hes surprised from people but hes efficient I I love I like their energy and I like the fact that I think they in in a tournament setting theyve got some depth John Shire has said going into the big matchup with North Carolina tonight again 6 30 on ESPN that he does feel like theyre playing their best basketball at both ends of the season and that they have found a new level before that match up with the heels well theyve gotten better their players have gotten better and theres no doubt that was a foul it wasnt called Gardners not going to lose the ball like that very often but Im trying for the guys back in the studio theres going to be Phil Im trying but theyre not listed you know when you get a Virginia game that it probably isnt going to fill the twohour window no youre exactly right now if you get Virginia and Notre Dame you might not even be on for an hour and 45 because you can do a college basketball live show back into back at the studios in Bristol yeah Kevin Connors is warming up the engine right now hes a hitting Jordan cornet and down yeah theyre there though those those two are those two are getting ready to go get ready to break down some games that they didnt think they were going to have to 202 to go here in the second half with Virginia up by 15 and El Ellis to the free throw line once again where hes six of six hey unload a day over on ESPN and the app we told him some great matchups couple top 10 Affairs Texas and Kansas who has already won the big 12 UCLA and Arizona and then tucked in the middle Duke Carolina thank you uh bacon is on the line when you get two free throw misses in Charlottesville and they got it did we get something too Ill take mine shipped to the house in Florida overnighted to the Sunshine State precooked Ellis with a couple of Misses at the stride Franklin Goes spinning and attacking and through his eyes finishes no question it took the hit theres not enough to call about but he just a test left so well in any and he and he doesnt waste dribbles thats where Arman Franklin has gotten so much better the dribbles matter theyre not wasted theyre out in front and hes in an attacking mode Applause dont seem nearly forced a turnover and Mike James finishes and hes up to 18 with a chance at another threepoint player he he when he develops a consistency in his shot when he gets game recognition decision making he can post up he can get to the basket in the sense of off the drive hes got to become a better cutter he can make he can make strides threepoint play indeed for Mike James full court pressure on Clarks inbounding so we want Chase the senior walkon Chase Coleman Tony Bennetts bench when you talk about senior day you wonder about the future Armon Franklin hes a senior hes got another year and Reese Beekman is a junior hes top 40 in our ESPN NBA draft rankings what do you think of those two games well I think Beekman um I dont think theres any question I didnt be executive say something to me this week talking about Virginia and I quote he said their kids tend to overachieve their draft position because they do all the little things and thats from an MBA exec that thats won a championship so he knows what hes talking about bottom line is when you get a Virginia guy youre going to get a guy that has the fundamentals that knows the value of both ends that knows the value to be a teammate know that Beekman will bring defense we got to fill out our ballots for the ACC Awards he might be my vote for defensive player of the year in this conference well hes improved so many things he has very good lengths good hands by Franklin one thing that theyre so good at Virginia they do make they they go after that ball they get in the gaps they go after the ball Applause a minute and three seconds away for Virginia from a share of the ACC regular season title it would be the sixth in 10 years for Tony Bennett and at Virginia the previous 60 years it was five ACC regular season crowns and hes trying to go six and ten years what hes done in his coaching career obviously is playing career but his father obviously a legend I coached against him my first year at Marquette the second year he decided to return Brad Soderberg took over Tony deserves a lot of credit for what went on at Wisconsin when he was an assistant coach there with the recruiting that they did of Devin Harris the recruiting that they did of a guy named Kirk Penny who really enabled or allowed Beau Ryan to play his system at such a high level Tonys a Hall of Fame coach I mean he just is I mean theres hes one everywhere hes been hes done it with with Improvement hes done it with with unselfishness and they just keep getting better and theyre committed to how they play inside of a minute to go caparo commits a foul on Mike James got a little tug of war going right now between the 16 000 people here that want Chase to come in and theres Tony Bennett going to do it would you hear it when you were coaching absolutely you cant avoid it oh yeah you can hear it you can hear coaches that say they dont hear theyre not telling the truth now you locked in or are you living by it here it comes he heard him Tonys gonna break a smile at some point not yet but hes going to break us down at some point and look whos coming out he hit Clark one
