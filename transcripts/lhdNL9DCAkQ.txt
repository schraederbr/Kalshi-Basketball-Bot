Jamal spearmans got the ball in hand then Allen Luben takes the tap hes into the starting lineup but Dorian odw CA wins it and here come the jackets in the old golden start on the road trible hand off up top for Nate George the Sall point guard from Toronto and off to the leading score Lance Terry and here is by Dono preseason second Team all ACC on a skip for Luke OBrien a CH clock onward cze post entry Dango the face up on Luben couldnt get the jumper to go starters for North Carolina team thats been scoring a lot and conceding a lot and Dr pal moved into the starting lineup Wednesday against Alabama and another lineup change for Hubert Davis like he said with the VY transfer vanen Allen Luben in strong Drive no finish for Elliot Kad starters for the jackets told you Lance Terrys the leading score at about game its a shorthanded Georgia Tech Team dealing with injuries to a couple of starters Nate George swirls one out offensive rebound and a follow for Dango you see here early both teams are trying to establish the ball inside and attack the rim the one advantage in this game you may say Tech Jord Tech has with their size is the ability to crash the offensive glass Elliot cadell no it hasnt been a great rebounding team for North Carolina so far something Hubert Davis has been reiterating all season and again with us pregame heres Dango fouled down in 14 minutes against Oklahoma on Tuesday and North Carolina forces the turnover heels want to run Dongo being really passive he had two touches in a row and hes passed both both times on the Block hes got to get really aggressive and assert Applause himself we mentioned the injuries for Georgia Tech fourth straight game there without Javen McCullum the Oklahoma transfer whos got a concussion he got smoked with a screen two weeks ago against Cincinnati and then kaasi Reeves the senior who last year hit 38 from three hes dealing with a foot injury mum is just one of those guys with a really great midrange game and theyll miss his scoring he has the potential to be a 50 4090 guy Z Trimble draws a foul on OBrien in transition except Trimble is nearly impossible to stop with his size his speed and athleticism theres not a better guard in college basketball offensively in transition coming down here you got to get back and Corral to him and I know you think Tempo is a huge part of this game nothing new with North Carolina but maybe even more so you think than normal for the Tar Heels I do because they you know for the first time in a long time Carolina doesnt have that interior pre ability to drop the ball off inside when they get half court and theyre relying upon their guards and being honest theyre all relatively small guards and so theres no interior presence Washington and P these guys are better on the perimeter so they dont have an interior pressence when the game gets slowed down and its in half court and they want to press Tempo which is something that Carolinas always done but when things slow down and as you start playing some of these better teams they force you on to play in the half court offense the Junior from Wisconsin set tremble good on both and Jaylen Washington 2 minutes in he ERS for ven Allen Luben and OBrien to the Georgia Tech bench with two early fouls heres Lance Terry back from the C injury kept them out all of last year how about anua only his third Collegiate three the 61 true freshman from Dallas do as they call him has that range you look at his percentages and hes not a great threepoint shooter hes one of those guys that star says he picks a freshman every year and he just lets him play and this year its do he says hes going to let him play through mistakes that only been two for 15 Jaden Musto the Blue Chip freshman missed and a foul on the rebounding action goes against anua must just checked into the game he didnt want his first shot to be a three but thats when you got to let go strength in his game is attacking the rim but thats an opportunity to D walk in one and you turn down a good shot to try attack the rim and take a chat where youre being challenged at the room theres Drake pal top 15 recruit The Freshman making a second consecutive start like we said RJ Davis the driveing kick kadoo off the extra pass no here is good look Music there physical freshman coming off a productive game against Oklahoma in that loss Tuesday in Norman back out of Dango to Strong kadoo off the bounce lays it in tough finish great job there by Ellie kadoo just pushing Tempo attacking the rim got to engage the ball and engage him a lot quicker than that Doug Dan thank you very much gentlemen and welcome to Chapel Hill as we continue the start of ACC play longside Randol chers on Mike Monaco for Georgia Tech and North Carolina Seth Trimble gets a deflection in the first four minutes it stays with Georgia Tech with 16 on the timer and Randolph if youre just joining us here after a close one down the stretch went the way of Wake Forest these are two teams very hungry for a win both teams are desperate for a win coming in different reasons I think Carolina struggling a defensive end techer struggle some as well but theyre missing two starters George hits at the expiration of the shot clock Steph Curry like sometimes its better to be lucky than good his Hees up a three theres Ian Jackson coming off 23 Off the Bench in North Carolinas loss on Wednesday against Alabama and North Carolina on this threegame losing streak granted against one of the toughest schedules in the country by four in the early going to Damon stmy Georgia Tech Team heres Duncan Po got Stripped by Seth Trimble and North Carolina forces the turnover when youre trying to pull off an upset sometimes you need things to go your way taking a shot like this by Nate George with a shot clock running low gives you a chance to do so Tech up four here Chapel Hill for the tall heels its what Hubert Davis said to his pregame nothings changed this team has to defend and he said rebound as well to get to the level that they want to and he said to us today its time early fourpoint hole against Georgia Tech who picked off a bunch of big wins last year in year one for Damon STM on the flats RJ Davis came around the screen got the switch gives it up to Drake pal driving on Lance Terry and back out for Davis one for 11 from three against Alabama Applause theres Jaden mustaf very talented freshman was a huge get in recruiting for the jackets he went spinning pal moved it Terry drives went up for the jam got his own Miss cant follow po the third effort draws a foul and this is what we talk about with the problems and the issues that the ts are having on the glass and because you dont have Rim protection theres no fear to drive and when the big comes over its the guards responsibility to come over and crack down on those bigs and you see pow cleaning up the glass he and do cracking you know crashing the offensive glass they just dont have enough resistance right now and this that possession there is a microcosm of what the tah are doing well it puts Duncan Powell at the line and you may have noticed his hair its a duct tail drop shag he says and so naturally hes got the shagman tattoo on his left leg love it absolutely love it he has said I dont have many options for hair but I do what I can do and theres the tat because who wouldnt be called the shagman when youre rocking to drop Shack I dont have options either with my hair this to be all this season so maybe Im just missing the tack Davis turned it over and then Dorian angua couldnt handle the feed from Nate George tar Hills of course want to push heres Ian Jackson top 10 freshman in the country coming off 23 off the bench in the loss to Alabama Davis drives on mustaf had it blocked by AA Treno ran it down and he gets bumped and fouled by mustaf just a great start here by the yellow jackets just controlling the paint shot blocking at The Rim they have so much length that they four and five spots Ona comes over and blocks that shot Im I mean just his presence inside I mean he hes going to be able as the game slows down as he physically matures hes switching here hes switching on RJ Davis I mean Ellie CAD guarding the ball head finish byad Kad on the drive with the finish and hes got four of the six for North Carolina theyre trying to make him a score his his strength is creating for everyone else you can see the game plan is to make Elliot Kobe a score and not get in the pain and be disruptive with his vision mustaf musling on Davis pick and pop on witha already knocked down one three if you werent with us earlier Kau pushes beautiful cross cant finish and then ripped it away weve got a foul underneath on borian on rqua great drive there by Ellie kadoo he senses that theyre trying theyre not theyre not picking him up in transition hes attacking hes getting to the rim missed the layup a great job there stealing the ball drawing a foul well theres Hubert Davis he told us after the loss Wednesday to Alabama he went to bed at 6 am and then he told us he did something in practice yesterday hes never done as a head coach the entire team watched the entire game back it took him three and a half hours there was no cut up of the game they watched every single play together in a closed door practice that you can imagine was pretty intense Mike I cant tell you how those are the worst you dont like them as a player and you really dont like him as a coach and I asked him Ive been on staffs with coaches where weve watched them first thing in the morning and he said hey I didnt go to bed till 600 I wasnt going to punish myself having to watch that mess twice Jaden mustaf the Miss cadell pushing kind of casual pass tipped away by Duncan pal whos in there for Georgia Tech because theyre dealing with a lot of foul trouble here in the first seven minutes both Luke OBrien and Dorian anqua have two first half fouls for Damon STM off the lck given away by kado and Nate George pushes dishes pal underneath and the shagman finishes he had seen po play he very physical really good on the offensive glass and the defensive glass and also strong enough to carve out angles the Finish inside as you saw there hes coming off his best game in year one with Georgia Tech had a double double in the loss to Oklahoma it was a lot closer than the 15point final spread shot clock winding down Davis driving on by Dango wrapped it around for Jaylen Withers and another North Carolina turnover thats four of them Yellow Jackets are making Carolina the perimeter Shooters the the only person thats actually been able to get to the rim is La kadoo but theyve done a good job of challenging at The Rim so theyre not allowing that skip pass theyve been there to take that away and using their length trying to force thear Hill to finish over that length inside his teams met once last year and Georgia Tech got the onepoint win back in midtown Atlanta Lance Terry con next and the lead is eight for Georgia Tech in the first eight minutes talked about Carolina wanting to run you cant run if you cant get stops and you cant control the glass Kad for Luben tough to handle witherss kept it alive Jackson drives slices and finishes great job by the Freshman air driving a close out and avoiding the charge first points for Ian Jackson who you see was number seven in the ESPN 100 o highing in there with two first half fouls so they get the Stop and now Carolina can push theyll set up the half court offense and its an illegal screen set by Jaylen withs so Georgia Tech got the lead season they did I thought they did a great job theyre in a interesting stretch theyre just on the road right now last year they had the ACC SEC challenge they were home they beat Mississippi State and Then followed that up with a win against Duke this year they they had the same challenge in response but theyre on the road at 4 and four picked 12th of the 18 teams in the ACC in the preseason poll heres the Colorado transfer OBrien back out for Nate George heres by Dango theyre looking for him to get going at the start of his sophomore season shot clock winding down on lube and and Dango finishes I dont think theres a match up for him he just has to get aggressive I think he can turn and face a couple of times instead of trying to back him down he is really skilled in a different match up Jackson answers the Dango is such an important piece obviously for Georgia Tech and Damon STM said it after their loss Tuesday Dango knows he needs to be better he does and he he he told me he had to sit down with him right after the Oklahoma State I mean the Oklahoma game hes like look he got back like first thing in the morning you were in my office we need to have a conversation we need to talk about everything yes yes lets cut out the distractions focusing on being at the player we need you to be and that you need to be both ends of the floor kadoo driveing kick for a corner three Withers off Target Jord Techs going to live with those shots theyre going to let the Carolina bigs take those threes theyre worried about stopping the guards penetration and theyre going to live with their their bigs taking Corner threes pal does the same he misses withs clears it and Jackson pushes attacking offensive foul thats what we talked about Mike good teams or teams in this league are they Carolinas been great in transition offense since coach Smith was here and when you play against the first thing youre going to do when youre playing against Hills is tell all Five Guys you got to get back and force this team uh this team to be in a half court offense and thats what yellow jacket are doing a great job of right now mustaf took that charge and he is slowed and hobbled a bit reaching down at his right knee as he goes to the Georgia Tech bench so if hes okay get back in there hes been great the last three games for joria Tech averaging 16 points a game big physical guard pick and roll and Dango had it roll off and then Tyson and Washington both going for the rebound cant secure it and give it right back to the jackets when youre struggling on the glass you got to get two hands on the basketball do a g really good job defensively here Music and just unable to come up with it Lance tering though off the Baseline out of bounds drawn up for him trembles ahead of the pack tremble went up the ladder with bad Applause intentions you can see this coming when he caught this pass you knew it no one in front of him and Lance Terry is athletic but he is not as athletic as SE tremble great job there just being able to draw the foul Terry who created a poster on Tuesday you went about out of your seat in Norman Oklahoma on Tuesday uh nearly was on one but he did prevent it get saddled with his first foul putting Seth Trimble at the line all right so you got SE Trimble Elliot Kau RJ Davis three guards how do you think thats blending and evolving for North Carolina I think it takes time because of all three of those guys are better with the ball than their hands and I know theyre different players but I dont think people understand when youre a point guard you develop all your life catching Outlet passes not running Lanes so the the adjustment thats happening right now with these guys is how do you implement what each guy does well and make them come together and that takes time RJ Davis is the best of the three probably coming off screens Elliot kadoo is just an Elite pass first point guard and Seth Trimble is elad in tra denied by tremble on the love from George Koo pushes Tyson for tremble slashing dropping it off Washington underneath traveled with it and thats whats happening with Carolina right now when the guards drop it off inside Washington is just not comfortable there and Trumble just showing you his athleticism and great hustle to get back really talented twoway player I think hes the most consistent offense player both ends of the floor not just offense for the tar Hills this season but on the interior Washington is so much more comfortable facing the basket hes not comfortable inside amongst the trees and they got to come away with a basket or a foul in a situation like that Dango missed the jumper heals with it down by four Davis transition three couldnt knock it down and his struggles continue and then Tyson went battling for an offensive re B but he was out on the Baseline and it belongs to Georgia Applause Tech Carolina starting to push Tempo a little bit there trying to get out they trying to force Tempo good shot there and RJ Davis just unable to knock it down hes still scoreless 11 and 12 minutes in for North Carolina meantime TCH has missed its last five shots Terry rejected the screen jumper short cleared by kadoo and he wants the push tremble attacks left hand finish no ones better no ones better with a head of steem in transition youve got to give back five guys and coral caral not only the bow but get back and get in front of SE TR crowd to life Carolina forces the turnover tremble the hammer Seth tremble on both ends for North Carolina he has authored an 80 run and its tied at 16 in Chapel Hill its at ACC media day because most guys in his situation they transfer out and for him to stick around and they come back not knowing how things was going to go its just a credit to him and his work and what hes put into it and he has been rewarded hes rewarding the Tar Hill Nation with his play and hes been fun to watch and make no mistake about it I know RJ Davis is on his team but so far this year he has been the most consistent player and I think their best player Nate George misses the jumper and Georgia Techs scoring drought is approaching four minutes North Carolina looking for the lead good to see Jaden Musto back into the game for the jackets and this is what I said about the three guards the tendency for everyone when they get the ball is to dribble Pell tough shot and Tech is trying to force him in to shoot and they want him to take those shots because hes just so dynamic in creating opportunities for shots for everyone else the jackets have it trailing for the first time in this game a switch for Tyson on to Applause Musta off the bounce and a carry is called on the Freshman jayen mustaf sixth turnover for Georgia Tech you dont see that very often I had seen a Carri called in a really long time my first basketball game of the year I cant believe I just saw Carrie called yeah well thats cuz you were dribbling and thats why its really good to be back with Rand shoulders Ive missed that got to keep the honest my friend inside a 7even to go in the first half RJ Davis off the screen great job there to Fresh and made it a mistake on the offensive end to the floor and he was pondering the carry and in came back on the defensive end and made another mistake first made three for North Carolina theyve been 0 for six from deep and the run is 13 zip for the heels Trimble did he draw a tie up yes he did in the arrow points to North Carolina just another play by Seth tble impact in this game but the defensive end of the floor just a close out man thats just athleticism strength just taking it give me that he said in the preseason enough is enough its time to show who I know I can be hes always tantalized with his athletic ability he has but hes showing you hes so much more 63 plays bigger as Tech goes into the zone and theyll play man when he gets in the middle and they pass it out and RJ Davis went out of bounds on the sideline so thats a ninth North Carolina turnover both teams have been a little careless with the basketball here all right whats Georgia Tech need offensively to stop this run I think you got its by Dongo you got to get him the ball they love to get him on slips in the middle ball screen here and him rolling in this short Corner offensive foul its on Nate George creating off that pick and roll with Dongo you can see some of the guys who watch the NB guy NBA guys do this and Ido been Char been theyve charged him with a couple of offensive fouls the last couple of games of him doing that sticking that shoulder in it when Nate George at the same with him he made sure he hit the ground trying to C the officials to make a play Tyson two strong only four made threes this season for the Belmont transfer Kate Tyson brought in for his shooting Georgia Tech with it down by five Terry hiding behind the screen much needed for Georgia Tech thats a mistake there by Seth Trimble you cannot go under a ball screen on Lance Terry you got to go over the screen run him off the line hes a 40 threepoint shooter tremble attack the Dango close out too easy 10 for set tremble Applause D go one thing I noticed earlier that was an issue with the tar Hills defense as well theyre doing a better job when they icing the ball screen Penny on the sides the guards are more aggressive The Bigs are up and engaged as before they were laying off today theyre more engaged on that ice ball screen Washington committed the foul by Dango late shot clock when Dango was a little bit out of control yeah I think hes settling a little bit he needs to play talking about by Dongo attack the rim a little bit more hes really in the middle of the floor there hes got to do a better job of attacking them so the sophomore from sagol goes to the line fouled out Tuesday in a sixpoint game with 6 and a half minutes to go just four points four rebounds for the very talented 69 forward we told you preseason second Team all ACC 67 free throw shooter in his career hey coming up next our basketball triple headers capped off with Stanford and Cal in Berkeley Kyle Smiths Cardinal Mark matsons Golden Bears good to have League Play underway here in early December it is its times nothing like ACC basketball no matter what the narrative is out there its just historically been the best basketball conference there is and theyll respond this is the 7 second season of ACC mens basketball getting underway with conference play today back in their zone defense now you like that choice these few possessions of it I do this car this Carolinas not a great threepoint shooting team Jackson response to that he didnt care what I say but you give up those looks this freshman is shooting over 40 from three he wants to get in the paint but more than capable of knocking down threes he doesnt take a ton of them but the ones he take he shoots them at a high CL George created some space left the three short Dango the offensive rebound and Applause follow seven points to go along with four rebounds for by Dango thats what you want to see from both of those guys you want Nate George to be a little bit more aggressive hes a pass first guy like Elliot kadoo and you want to see both of those those guys be aggressive looking to score I think Elliot CAD has done a better job with Carolina George is still being a little passive on the offensive end Jackson Yanks it back on Terry too strong and Dango aggressive for the rebound You like to see Jackson there shoot the first one just made the previous catch shoot three Dango made a good catch but then missed off the pick and roll and then Duncan pal reaches in and gets tagged with his first Applause foul well Ian Jackson was huge with 23 points off the bench on Wednesday against Alabama and hes got a turbo shot of seven more in the first I remember the first time hearing as cool as the other side of the pillow and thinking wow like that is exactly what Ive always thought in the middle of the night as a child growing up and he just put it perfectly into one of his iconic catchphrases on Sports none better none better Legend well coming up on 3 minutes to go here at the Smith Center its North Carolina by four on Georgia Tech in the ACC opener part of this triple header here on accn Bo stop the hammer twohanded flush off the Baseline feet thats why you want to get by do go to ball in the middle of the floor hes such a really good passer so if you rotate over hes looking to throw it to the weak side Corner that time mustaf cut to the basket and was able to finish RJ Davis deep three second three for RJ Davis whod only been clicking at 24 from Deep so far this year good sign there great job by RJ Davis creating space Trimble is Relentless Dango lays it in from Terry on the flash for North Carolina theyve got 29 Points you mentioned this to me during the break every single one is from four guards for the heels yes no one in the front line is scored yet and thats been a problem and it forces you as a guard to feel like moves like this you got to create and take tough shots RJ Davis off the behind the back maybe RJ Davis is starting to cook hes got eight on a couple and the lead is five Terry the top scorer for the jackets used the Dongo screen and now Musta thats what I mean the difference in the ball screen defense now with the tar here theyre up The Bigs are engaged low clock here great job on the ball tough shot for Applause George tremble is fouled by mustaf is second RJ Davis we said at the top has got to be the star he was last year for Carolina did a great job there driving just sliding but hes getting back into form hes got to pick and choose with spots here difficult Runner there off the glass but he did just knocked down the previous three hes got to get going and start scoring at a high clip right now teams want him to score their goal is to say hey hes going to get his 20 but lets make him get 20 shots to get it he just needs to be a little bit more efficient and be selective in his shot selection RJ said this after the Alabama game he said teams are guarding me differently yes and a large part of that is whos not here in Bott and the shooters yes I can tell you from the other side and talking to the other coaches Amo Bott you had no chance against Carolina if you rotated your big off and amondo came down the lane a rebound teams were committed to keeping a big on his body at all times and it allow the guards a carine of free reign now hes gone teams are saying hey head stay stay home on RJ Davis make someone else beat us big follow from Jaden moop has it down to a threepoint Applause Music spread Davis got the switch gets it back wanted another Terry the rebound and he got bumped its a foul on set Trimble its his first those two got a little batt going on right now theyre defending each other they both are really good twoway players they attack you differently offensively Lance Terrys probably the better shooter of the two but both really guard Lance St just looked up at the replay and I think he knows maybe it wasnt the biggest bump from zth Trimble and they both just had a little chuckle about it hey hes strong like guy had to sell that two hardworking players who are a lot of fun to watch they are all right we got about 4 and 1 half seconds separating game clock and shot clock at the end of the first half with Georgia Tech with it down by three middle ball screen again George knifing and finishing great job there that time theyre not up on the ball screen allow Nate Jorge to snake that screen and get to a spot Jackson tough shot way off Target and we head to halftime in a one point game theyre searching for aners and with these guards theyre trying to drive theyre drawing a lot of attention and for these front Court guys you need to crash when they switch with the guards you got to guard them you got to dominate them on the offensive glass and just got to get comfortable finishing in traffic Terry comes around the screen risky pass and then kadoo threw it off of O bran for North Carolina going up against the jackets all right so we talked about the Georgia Tech injuries kaasi Reeds has the boot hes got a stress reaction in his right foot its not a fracture just needs a little bit of time to settle down but hes out for a third straight game and then next to him Javen McCullum out for a fourth straight game with a concussion but Damon STM said to us last night we think hes going to be back our next game next Sunday against Northwestern and welcome both of these guys back both of those guys are starters when they come back it just adds a lot of depth to this team and this team will be much so much better if they get in a conference play when they get those guys healthy and year two for David dmire heres Nate George sophomore who leads the ACC in assists per game rolled off and who touched it last looked like Washington so it does stay with the yellow jackets you seeing Nick George there hes driving theyre forcing him to score and hes got four turnovers and zero assists hes got to get more aggressive looking to score like he just did there hes looking for somewhere to go gets it into Dorian on with check Terrys been hounded by Trimble all game OBrien can shoot it back on 35 from three this year in for his career heres tremble draws Terry as you said theyve been matched up all day just nowhere to Applause go pal attacks and walks with it traveling violation uh Drake pal well one guy we havent seen from North Carolina and you wont see is Ty clock gave great energy Wednesday against Alabama but he got hit in his right eye and Hubert Davis was telling this pregame its getting better but you can still see some of the discomfort for Tai Cloud over there so hes not a go today and hbert Davis said he was number one for us in terms of energy on Wednesday he said number two was distant yeah he he brings a motor and a and a lot of activity hell be a welcome addition when he gets back Terry miss it from Long Range still looking for our first points out of halftime we talk about the lack of front Court production hell get some on the offensive Applause glass T CLW youre saying yes yes his activity on the offensive end hell come in and be able to catch it on short rows finishing traffic offensive glass Georgia Tech transfer who does not get the chance to square off with the team where he spent last season tough Drive Kido offensive rebound Washington you know he wanted to play in this game Davis tough shot against OBrian George pushes lob Dango had the mismatch with tremble and draws the foul two on set tremble thats the issue with by D he runs like a deer and when he gets up and it forces a guard to have to guard him and even if youre as strong and athletic as Seth trumo is its just a mismatch if he runs like a deer how would you say you run like turtle like a turtle at least youre still running thats great hey at a turtle Pace its better than nothing by Dango to the line off those nine points and seven rebounds we show in the first half hey tomorrow afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball triple header starts at noon Eastern Notre Dame and Syracuse then its SMU Florida State and it wraps with number eight Duke against Virginia Tech at Cameron how about ndes game in the midweek against Texas number four in the country the L ABY team won it in overtime and got 30 from Hannah hialgo she was so fun to watch oh she is so fun to watch I love her energy her enthusiasm and she is a bucket kadoo tough shot then all and Luben SS it out on the follow thats what were talking about with the front line when the guards are penetrating you have to because theyre attacking the big youre you as a Frontline player you want to get yourself involved here look thats Nate George there youre inside win the battle go to the glass you may not get a lot of touches or a lot of plays run for you but if you want to involve yourself in the game if youre J Washington V luin any of these Frontline guys crash the offensive glass get yourself going who do you think is most likely of the UNC front Court by seasons end to have the biggest role I I think itll be by committee all year long you think its constantly going to change I think its going to constantly be guys I dont know if I think eventually Jaylen Washington is going to figure his Niche out I think hes that hes trying to play inside and fill a role that I dont think he can just physically do and I think make that adjustment whether its Kade Tyson stretching the defense and allowing these guards to operate more in the paint because of his ability I think hell figure it out I think game by game itll be by committee all year long Terry drew p Georgia Tech couldnt follow Carolina runs up by one with Davis tremble initiates off the Luben screen tremble into the lane the kick out kadoo is out of bounds on the side line and thats 11 North Carolina turnovers three assists to 11 turnovers against 12 M buckets second turnover like that you know I I used to always I know theres some former players out there that I used to say when Im working them out the tendency they step backwards when they want to go forward and I would always say make that first step going forward and I would actually train them on the sideline so they can know that make the first step attacking the defense going forward and that backwards yeah it is kind of amazing how often you do see that call in basketball Bri on the drive good hands from set tremble rinse and repeat for Applause him this match in the post lubins got George trying to front tremble pivots and uses Davis for kadoo can knock it down Luben the offensive rebound thats how you get going we talked about it unable to get the ball inside when he had the mismatch with George on him inside thats okay you dont get it shot goes up get to the glass you see eight rebounds for the Bandy transfer vanen Allen Luben George skips OBrien stayed inbounds there along the sideline I think hes got a turn it face there you goo nearly ripped down the rim foul on Lous first he is a very tough matchup and he is answering the Bell here this afternoon here quick spin move there Baseline goes up to punch it nothing V Luby can do but foul thats all you can do but thats the the challenges you have by Dongo he is a force inside and his versatility for Georgia Tech Team hanging around first four minutes of the second half tell you last year wins against Duke in the ACC opener like today is for Georgia Tech Clemson in double overtime and in late January against Carolina so the wins last year you beat two Elite 18 teams sweet 16 team in North Carolina damid St said we might have had the best wins in the league yes but also said we were inconsistent against teams like I said and its unfortunate you want to take a step this year and then you come out and you missing two St at the beginning of the season and Miss significant time and this team would be so much better you know as they roll around in the New Years when they get the full compliment of roster of players Davis short youre wondering why the crowd rejoiced for two Miss free throws not just cuz it helps North Carolina but free cookies big block of Luben on Nate George RJ Davis went tumbling to save it transition three Jackson can knock it down and then Dango rips down a n Applause rebound George is really struggling hes got to play off two feet when he gets that deep tell often tell guards youre not going to out aete the length of guys when youre not Above the Rim player get there play off two feet mustaf lost it heels P Jackson finishes timeout damid STM the lead is five for the tar Hills no ones better at transitioning defense and the offense on F fast break to Carolina theyre already up 10 to add another two Carolina trying to pull away right now theyre struggling trying to fire their way and they got some things and challenges they have to navigate throughout this year but everyone does and be great to see I look forward to seeing who figures those things out slow start to the second half on both sides Georg Tech with just one point out of halftime 5 minutes in Lance Terry draws a foul on the drive so well step back toide 5 minutes gone by in the second half FS by five at the free throw line for the jackets back after missing last year with a persistent calf injury that forced him to red shirt told us last year that he first heard it in September tried to come back a week later and it popped while he was backpedaling during a scrimmage two weeks later popped again warming up and he told us he just hated it watching last year and he said Ive been injured a lot in college he had a broken foot he told us a gardener web then the next year a torn ligament in his toe in his same foot so hes unfortunately used to being in the spot he was last year needing to watch from the bench and hes had a bunch of injuries and to his credit hes just come back and competed and hes turned himself into a heck of a player jackets run down by three and Jaden mustaf went yoing by Davis who read it well RJ Davis Blow by a power for L thats how the front line of these tar Hills have to contribute caral space move when the guardar driving Luben is starting to give some really good production here on that front line hes the only front Court player for the tall heels to even score Terry cant answer from Deep tipped around and it stays with Georgia Tech yeah Van Allen lubins got five points and eight rebounds into the starting lineup today cant turn the ball over against these T here no one is better than him turning that defensive steals into offense on the other end Luben thats what you got to do with the front line and all of these guys got to do that guard you have three really good guards that are great at penetrating and put pressure on the defense play off those guys give yourself a better angle Terry oh that was filthy wow off the cross into a game time triple or to cut it to two should say and this game is being played at the tempo and Pace that the yellow jackets one Carolina wants this game up in the 90s possible and amua lost his footing and the foul is called its on ven Allen Luben how about this yank from Lance Terry great job there coming off he shakes up crosses it steps back to create more space and knocks it down hes a complete offensive player hes complete player General because he guards the other teams best player as well this play has been hes elevated his play during this stretch again we talked about the yellow jackets missing two starters and theyve relied on him tremendously career high scoring this year in year six collegiately for Lance Terry who reached a th000 points Tuesday in his career by the way third foul on Ben Allen Luben who goes to the Carolina bench watch the spin again fall back Baseline the hook didnt go and then a pushup on Dorian anua his third foul I think by Dongo is is backing him down too much I think he has a quickness Advantage just just turn and face and just drivve so instead of backing down going at the drop step face up and beat him turn to face I think hes quicker than the front line and that thats with his length be more effective for him if he did it that way hes such a really good passer if you try to rotate and help more Zone from Georgia Tech North Carolina by two s minutes in good pass for Withers Missed It Wide Open Jackson tried to hammer the follow George pushes kicks Terry wanted it Baseline Drive looking for a poster mustaf back out Terry the triple wont go Withers the long hit ahead Jackson in transition scoop wont go Davis is blocked can anyone put it home George transition three for a Georgia Tech lead just a frantic Pace there by both teams unable to capitalize on anything until George there with the block on one and comes down got to stop the ball you dont expect him to take that shot hes been struggling its a big time shot there and getting the foul at the end of the play is even a bigger bonus and they got it on Elliot kadoo fighting for positioning so on top of that you get the M three and then he got the basketball as well Baseline out of bounds turned over George wanted Dango and weathers the flush thats costly for the jackets thats a big swing there with the lead and you dont expect to turn it away for a pick six can Georgia Tech answer a skip for Terry cant connect Elliot Cano at the controls tried to whip one for the cutting Davis and its a turnover 14 of them for North Applause Carolina turnover on one in and ELO rewards his big man for running the lane with the throwing it down got a close one here in Chapel Hill in Fast Break points Im sorry 143 in Fast Break points and thats Carolina strength and if tech can just keep this game at this pace I think theyll be there to the end theyve got George Terry mustaf Dango and anqua on the floor for Damon STM coming out of the under 12 timeout here at the Smith Center in Chapel Hill Randal sh Mike Monaco our entire crew with moock got the switch from Withers The Freshman off the bounce tough shot and the foul called its on Jaden mustaf hes a big physical guard and thats a tough call there unless he extended his arm yeah the elbow in the face usually those blocking fouls Damon SAR has commented that he thinks its been an adjustment period for officials knowing how to officiate a guards physical as Jaden moose to and that maybe he hasnt got a lot of calls yet he has he says he doesnt think the officials know how to to officiate it because he is a physical guard is there hes looking to draw a lot of contact there great play here throwing a lob against the zone defense something thats been in a Carolina staple forever and they un aable to make that its just been that type of day in year for the front line front quarter of North Carolina I mean that is a must have for North Carolina thats a pretty good T there you got to catch that they get bailed out they keep it on this end shot clock winding down Jackson in the corner off the bounce on Dango with the reverse from Ian Jackson great job by the Freshman a known he has a shot Blocker on him uses the reverse layup using the rim for protection Nate George had it roll off got it back Terry hor HS Lance Terry ties it at 42 Second Chance points Yellow Jackets again up 13 to5 theyve NE gated the advantage that the tah has and the fast break points is why this game is tied up then Elliot Kau and Jaylen witherss not on the same page K will check out Seth Trimble returns for Hubert Davis that was a 43 from Lance Terry it came on the first assist from Nate George hes got tremble on Applause him Davis under the screen pick and roll Dango the Finish from George that time was SPAC in by Dongo taking that middle ball screen and finishing without a taking a dribble in here Jaylen Washingtons on the ground grabbing that ankle Junior big man who has dealt with injuries going back to high school left side of your screen Jaylen Washington right side of your screen I guess yeah it just comes down and lands on Dango yeah rose that left ankle have been a starter until today and Washington has piled up six rebounds in this one hes got a hobble up here with a little over 10 minutes remaining in the second half big an injury youll see how significant that ankle injury is because the one thing he does provide he provides length that you need with the front court right now of the yellow jackets with do and Bongo front line so now its Luben and Withers in the front court for UNC hand off Davis got on mua in the air and the goes 10 for RJ Davis Terry got free cans another fif three for Lance Terry those are the defensive possessions that Drive hbert Davis nights its its just he got two veteran guards back there in SE and RJ Davis and Seth Trimble and they dont communicate on the switch both St on the ball and you leave Lance T wide open for a three when he had already knocked out four of themo in reaching in couldnt pry it free from Davis Jackson nowhere to go with it uses RJ Davis driving on to mustaf left it short not a good shot there Terry wants another left it short tremble pushes Applause heels keep moving it tremble Rises knocks it down and its a really good shot thats the difference in those two possessions one three is one put up is forced and all time just reverse the ball to weak side Seth tremble doesnt take a lot of Threes but hes really good in take making the W that he takes shooting nearly 50 and now Dongo again goes backing down again drop step but he draws it foul and thats four on ven all and Luben so youve got Washington on the bench with a left ankle injury and now Van Allen Luben picks up his fourth with eight and a half still to go thats just thats just the issue that that Dongo forces you to do I me you know what hes going to do but hes such a really good passer you want to leave him oneonone and hes driving you trying to get middle you cut him off middle hes going to drop step and shoot that hook 47 all and by Dango to the line just two for six at the strip so far today go down the Applause first Drake pal comes in hell get Ben Allen Luben hes already at the table anyway before the the fourth on Luben now this Carolina group thats on the floor now are really really small so theyve got to be able to space you out and drive you off the bounce Withers can space and then you got four guards on Perimeter lets see if they change their offense be more of a five out let the guards get now he and finish the problem theyre going to have is on the other end they got to find a way to rebound against Jello jackets who have their starting front line in Davis got to the rim and got fouled thats the advantage you get with when you go small now you got five guys on the perimeter it actually helps these guards because they were able to drive the rim with little less resistance how often do you think we might see Hubert Davis go to a small ball lineup right now maybe out of necessity some but moving forward how much I think hes searching for answers and hes try hes got to get consistency out of that front line I mean they didnt score in the first half and right now outside of Luben you hadnt had much help you had had anything else where does it come from I think itll be by commit it would be game to game and theyre going to have to figure it out so this lineup it it can be really effective youre going to struggle some rebounding the issue becomes with a guy like by dongle whos on the bench his versatility defends guards but hes impossible to guard any other R so certain teams have players like that not many do welld deserved breather for B Dango but RJ Davis puts North Carolina back on top George driving and he got fouled on the floor by RJ Davis the issue with Caroline is that they show you possessions that they can be really good really Elite defending of basketball and then theres times where they get lazy and and you foul here and you youre already in a bonus in 8 minutes to go in this half and thats dangerous when you do not have a shot blocker because now if Im if Im Dam STM Im telling my guards and my bigs just attack the rim attack the rim crash trying to get us some offensive rebounds there just theres no one there to block your shot and so with 806 left seven fouls on North Carolina Nate George for his career 71 at the line Georgia Tech as a team today had missed six of 12 but then George makes both so Georgia Tech back up by one and now one we get a stoppage here from Jamal Spearman might have been checking on something with Dorian anucha perhaps one of the other officials Jeff Clark was in conversation with him and well get an inbound play on back to it eight to go onepoint game in the ACC opener and thats an illegal screen set by Drake po what Carolina was trying to do was with that match up get RJ Davis to hoping they would switch and get OBrien on to attack watch the elbow here left elbow from pal I mean this you just dont need that right when never its us he just lean out the elbow its definitely extension I thought you could have Let It Go footwork has to be coming around screens and he feels like hes a better player for that sitting and watching but learning those things last season when youre out you can use it the right way to get better and I can assure you from my red shirt year I spent so much time on those very things to improve and and Terry has done exact same thing shes gotten so much better so much more consistent in his play and he just comes off the screen there draws another North Carolina foul the second on Jaylen Withers so like you said its free throws the rest of the way for the jackets and the one inone coming for Terry Drake pal who had set that illegal screen in a small ball lineup so maybe something hes not totally used to doing he goes back to the bench ter to the line 82 for his career good on the first and you got Seth tro down at the spot blocking out pow and thats just where Carolina is right there and that one your basketball teams 13 in the second half for thats Terry of 19 total the leads three for Georgia Tech in the ACC opener Withers sets the screen for Ian Jackson good touch pass tremble from Withers thats where I think Withers in these front Court players of Carolina can be effective similarly the way Jord Tech uses by Dongo get him on short rows get him off the move facing the basket not playing with their back to the basket not spacing them behind a threepoint line get him on a move like that Terry backs it out for George Terry Rises wanted another but left it short kadoo pushes Davis pulls up back iron Trimble the offensive rebound he draws the foul and will go to the free throw line with a chance to put the heels back in front and when you push in transition like that theyre not allowing you to match up youre getting stuck in these different matchups when youre playing a lineup like Carolina has right now just switch guard a body everybodys the same theyre going to attack you off the dribble got to get matched up first foul on Bango puts Seth tremble at the line but these are the type of possessions that were accustomed to seeing with Carolina getting offensive rebounds and its just been a struggle this year because of that lack of size and they missing that that all American that big guy and Amando bot thats this is the residual effect that you see from a guy like him not being here just his presence on the offensive glass he wasnt he didnt run your offense D anymore but he still with a dominant force on the offensive glass Davis puts Carolina back in front seven to go in Chapel Hill George in and out rebound Withers Applause kadoo navigates with Terry hounding H and another tarhill turnover season High 17 of them today K great vision yes great vision and both of these point guards are struggling with turnovers today and theyre pass Force first guys and theyre looking to pass it but the way theyre being defended is theyre forcing him to score like that good take by George but he missed it and then Dango lands on the back of Elliot kadoo Ellie gado needs to take his time I mean by Dongo landed on him they got the foul on the rebounding action against North Carolina as well but a guards are now in just trying to batt theyre out man theyre out gun over off on the defensive glass because theyre so small and I think this is where this game will be decided here in the next 6 minutes and 21 seconds its this game will continue as the shots goes up can Carolina rebound so the second on Elliot CAD Tango to the line Applause double bonus hes good on the first lets have another look at the Hard fall and also cadoo getting tagged for a Music foul yeah the fell and took his legs from up under him wasnt intentional but its a Applause foul another double double for Bango hes got 15 and 10 and George in front again boy this one is not disappointed from the Smith Center it has not Jackson attacks too strong theyre going to leave wethers open wherever he is strong side weak side if he stands outside the threepoint line theyre going to leave him open hes got a dive and try to make a play no foul this time lot of contact in the post and then Davis to the loose ball Withers that time out of the corner kadoo behind the back and a foul called on Jaden mustaf he wanted the foul at the other end didnt get it and then he gets tagged for one of his own here defensively yeah he had his hand and there trying to reach positioning wise he was there great to see Jaylen Washington check back in the game he left with that rolling his left ankle seem everythings checked out good to see him back so he replaces Withers a little more traditional sizewise at least at that spot but still four guards around Washington still provides you some length and a fourth foul by the way on that reach in from Jaden mustaf Terrys Hawking Davis and a blocking foul on Lance Terry his third both teams are in a bonus now free throw shooting contest down the Music stretch youve seen that call go the other way at times but thats the right call its its a bang bang play so the one and one for the best free throw shooter in Carolina history RJ Davis put him in a b count it were wasting daylight waiting on this one to go in Im calling it early Laughter you got places to be yeah just just sunlight still out count this 55 54 Carolina Im calling my shot okay Freddys laughing at me over here but Im telling you Freddy its counting B it the lead goes back to the tar Hills 540 to go what a game George pal Bongo Terry and mustaf the five for Damon STM Dongo sets the screen for Terry who draws a foul on RJ Davis and this is what I was talking about before with them ice in the ball screen and and the mean by iceing is pinning you on the side Davis has got to get on that side you cant let him off the screen you see it coming you see him jumping there you got to get the early and whats happened theres been some communication issues with car Lina on that where the big is calling ice before he gets there the guard is driven downhill and Applause that time you dont call it early enough to guard you cant get to the top side like that a Miss on the first hey our Championship Saturday coverage from Charlotte continues coming up a couple hours from now 6 Eastern a 2hour pregame show plus a command center presentation of the game with all kinds of camera angles and real time stats you can also watch on the ESPN app so a split L for Terry we tied at 55 Jackson didnt get pal to bite kadoo for Jackson shuffled the feet and now kadoo on the drive wrapped it around for Washington thats what you want from the front line guys of Caroline let the guards do the hard work you got to come in clean it up that early in the first half Washington had an opportunity to finish he didnt that time he did his first points all day dangos got Davis on him pal trying to get it there and they do back out of a double po cant hit for three Techs gone five minutes without a made bucket Davis lays it in Davis went behind the basket and hes laid up the court Jord Tech unable to see it un aable to take advantage of it dangerous spot Damon star doesnt use a timeout here he is going to use it now 13 seconds into The Possession Carolina guards are leading away they struggle with their front line that hasnt changed and by Dongo Nate George has had had his moments but Lan Terrys been the guy and here he is with treble back on him and now George a switch for tremble shot clock below 10 on with chea had the mismatch didnt get it from George going off the bounce against tremble creat some space and the jump spins out Wonder to tried to get El on a post up great job front him in a post thats whats Difficult about bigs when you try to run play for him if you front it kadoo tried to wrap it around and thats his seventh turnover George no bite from Kau back out for Lance ter Tech in dire need of a bucket mismatch again and good interior passing for Dango great job by do freshman there I mean catching the ball fighting that last position he allowed RJ Davis to front him in a post that time he moved his feet got in front waited on the double team by Dongo won get an easier basket than that all season long so hes got 17 and 11 Terry reaches in and its his fourth foul one one coming yeah hu Davis is not happy with ell K telling him you got to be careful with the basketball Ive never been a big fan of Bounce passes on the perimeter myself I think you just he comes off there if hes open you you pass it right to the shooting pocket bounce passes on the perimeter are slow and it wasnt a bounce pass he just caught it I didnt think that was on Elliot Kau well maybe from thei the prior possession with that wraparound kind of onehanded yeah thats what hes getting on him about it possession slow just too many turnovers for him I got it I got it Davis the rare Miss especially on a front end gives it back to George Tech hey down by two you notice I didnt guarantee that time I I wasnt feeling it that time so I didnt guarantee it and now the jackets operate on rqua that is not the shot they wanted and it goes back to the heels he can make that shot he doesnt take a lot he hit one earlier in the first half and theyre going to force him to take that shot he did there three for 18 from long range Carolina with it up by two Jacksons got Dongo onut him around the Washington screen now RJ Davis five to shoot kadoo first three yes Terry on the rip through tough shot cant answer fivepoint game with two minutes to go quick shot there by Georg te you dont mind l t taking it a shot like that but that was relatively quick in the shot clock not much ball movement just one pass in a shot and your advantage right now is a by Dongo he has Ian Jackson guarding him on the defensive inter FL you know we the to Tomo big block with 36 remaining on the shot clock and Georgia Tech in a massive need of a stop Hubert Davis will take a timeout with 138 remaining in the second half come on back to Chapel Hill fivepoint game Music Music second game in a row North Carolina has struggled to shoot it from long range but in a time when it needed it North Carolina gets a big three from Elliot CAU great job there by RJ Davis coming off the screen Elliot cadoo shakes up forces the guard to tag and he knocks down a three this team is struggling theyre not a great threepoint shooting team theyre just not you need to make timely shots and ell gido has struggled taking care of the basketball but that is a big time shot up to making this a fivepoint game here and having the basketball this is a big possession here for both teams for Jordan Tech if you want to get back into this game to get it down to one a one possession game you got to get a stop here in the basket on the other end if youre just joining us or maybe youre tuning in looking for Stanford and Cal you can watch that right now on the ESPN app and then we will get you to Berkeley as soon as this one goes final here in Chapel Hill hes Randolph chers Im Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes had a lot of free throws in this second half Georgia Tech at 18 fouls as a team theyre in the double bonus and remember you got 36 remaining on the shot clock here for North Carolina with the jackets needing a stop set Trimble will key it in from the corner with 69 by Dango in front of him Applause I expect some type of fade screen or something for RJ D was the elevated doors here instead kadoo cant hit tremble in a bundle in an offensive rebound no need to shoot I wouldnt set a screen right now if Im join the tech Id switch hes not going to go early 6 seconds left just let him go IO Dongo does switch on to Davis step back wanted the dagger whos in last Touch by Georgia Tech and mustaf you hear coaches say it all the time two hands two hands two hands shot goes up you reach for it with one hand just goes off mustos fingertips gives Carolina 20 seconds and then Jackson blew by an unsuspecting mustaf boy Georgia Tech has had chances here you had 36 on the timer missed the shot gave up the offensive rebound couldnt get the defensive rebound and then Ian Jackson just goes right by mustaf this is what Carolinas needed because they theyre getting theyre awarding themselves multiple possessions on the offensive end of the floor something thats been a staple in this program that theyve struggled to do this year two free throws for Captain Jack I Jackson good on the first by the way fourth foul on Dorian Ona so he comes out Luke OBrien a better shooter comes in made or miss here if youre in yellow jacket you dont have to have a three but you just got to attack quickly right now as much as the score is your enemy you got plenty of time but youre also working against the clock here as well biggest lead for North Carolina its seven with a buck 11 remaining all right so you said dont need a three its OBrien George Dango mustaf and Terry George a tech only made one of its last 10 shots granted they have been to the free throw line a bunch George gets it and goes watch the ball screen with by doo doo spinning tough shot goes for by Dango its down to five hes got Music 19 this is where oh Kad nearly turned it over tremble just gets it over the timeline and crisis averted for Applause Carolina this is where you need to get it to RJ Davis Kad kicks Withers moves it attacks had it roll off final 26 seconds fivepoint game mustaf to the rim got fouled and will get Applause two Carolina left the door a jar on a couple of trips down to that end of the floor this is interre to see we see this situation a lot in college basketball with coaches and they make these decision a two possession game its 40 seconds star elected to let that position that possession play out they get a stop they come down now with a chance to make it a one possession game but its 23 seconds left so now you got a Music foul the officials now head over to the monitor Jamal Spearman and Ron Grover are having a look at what for now is called the third Davis last plays under review for a timing with the clock one of the best things in college basketball this year yes those announcements thank you Ron gr so theyre checking the clock in any event roughly lets say 24 the clock is correct 238 well say precisely 238 to go so you get free throws here and then you got a foul got a foul and you want to keep the ball out of RJ Daviss hand which they did on the last possession yes well I think it was more El do is just trying to just be a point guard give me the ball and get out of the way but I think in moments like that you want to get the ball to RJ Davis hes just like I said hes the best free throw shooter in the history of this school thats had a lot of great free throw shooters and hes been in a lot of big games hes closed a lot of big games and Id be surprised if cuber didnt draw up something to put the ball in RJ Daviss hand in the meantime Jaden MO off goes to the line for the first time this afternoon in his first ACC game of his collegiate career 79 at the strike this season for the number 66 recruit in the ESPN 100 hes good on the first Ibrahim Suare getting ready to come in hes got fouls to give so he replaces Lance Terry whos got four hes going to be on the ball to some type of full court pressure He hell guard the inbound to use his L to be distractive theyll try to create a turnover if they can if they cant then I think theyre fou after mustaf second is good threepoint game 238 to go Carolinas got two timeouts and they will put all 69 of Suare on kadoo who can run the Baseline gets it into Davis a trap along the sideline Davis tied up gets rid of it to Trimble whos fouled by OBrien Georgia Tech got the Trap but RJ Davis in year five stay patient thats the play of the game if Carolina holds on to win this game cuz you get trapped there he doesnt panic hes in front of their bench hes strong with the basketball there fine Seth Trumble thats why I said you put the ball in in in SE in RJ Daviss hands and you can live with the the outcome and right cuz thats why by regardless of how hes playing thats a great play right there by your veteran guard all right so now tremble you see six of seven today much improved for the season here on the first so it makes it a fourpoint lead with 18 seconds to go and well get a timeout taken by day tough schedule and in this day and age of college basketball you need some time to figure it out well unfortunately in todays game you dont have time you got to you just got to get it done and and uh everyones adjusting the new players and figuring out their teams and when youre Carolina youre just expected to be good youre not expected to have those type of situations tremble makes Bold fivepoint game 18 seconds to go George over the timeline got to go quick you dont have time to wait dont need a three but you got to go quick Terrys fouled by Luben so 5 Seconds come off the clock and Lance Terry can go to the line for two and then Allen Luben is fouled out as well thats okay I think if youre Carolina youre probably going to have to have put another guard in and and you need ball handling here you just got to make sure you get this free free throw if Terry is to miss the second Applause one ellot kadoo needs to get on the line right now theyre trying to make a substitute Lens got to leave the game with his fifth foul hean Jackson like you said replaces him the things you want to do in a free throw like this you want that one guy pinches and gets to shootter the other two guys G Gang Box up on the free throw line you got to make sure you secured his rebound if Lance Terry used to miss Terrys got 21 if youre thinking ahead of who you want to foul Jaylen Withers 72 for his career but really all five options out there now are pretty solid and probably not going to go anywhere near Withers if youre Carolina yeah theyll put withs will be a screen hell run hell run a fly pattern they wont have to worry about throwing him the ball go hes running a nine route hes gone you want to get it to RJ Davis in a threepoint game tremble a good free throw shooter as well like we said its into Davis its a trap and Davis made the right play again tremble into the front Court Jackson finally fouled by Dango and 64 is all thats left for Georgia Tech this what you want to do get the ball to RJ Davis be strong with the basketball great job by SE triple coming back to him shortening that pass throwing it up putting a freshman on the the line but if you want to put a freshman on the line in a situation like this you wanted to be this hey relax were up three we just need one and hes already two for two 14 for 17 it is rookie season and hes good on that so a fourpoint lead with 64 left and North Carolina trying to get to the Finish Line in the ACC opener and snap a threegame slide great battle by both teams but I think once youre in a conference play youre going to be in games like just throw the preseason rankings out of the window this is Conference basketball this is ACC basketball home ways challenging dont sleep on Georgia Tech when they get healthy oh God no they theyll be really impressive and theyll win a lot of games when they get healthy George lays it in at the horn and North Carolina survives Hubert Davis and the heel win their ACC opener and take down Georgia Tech that wraps things up
