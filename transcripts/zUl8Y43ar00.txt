home the only loss to Tennessee and away we go at the Yum Center Tommy morsy Tony Henderson and Ted Valentine on the whistle tonight here downtown Chucky he will start and heres Terrence Edwards and Old Miss opens in the manto man and they play a very very tough manto man Edwards was the sun Bel Player of the Year a season too at James Madison heper skips it across Waterman heres Edwards on the drive with five Runner with the right hand bounds away and Malik di the rebound for the rebels Old Miss in the powder blues tonight you see their lineup Morel Murray and padulla on the perimeter Davis and Dia inside for Chris beer here is padulla the Virginia Tech transfer 11 to shoot for Dia against rain Smith and the follow away no good air ball and here comes heon in the cards Smith number six starts for the first time tonight hes a transfer from Charleston where Kelce was the coach a year ago Hadley out of a double team in the corner skips it for headward Smith against padulla on the drive rare twopointer good West and that is very rare he shoots over 90 of his field goal attempts this year from Beyond the threepoint Arc but thats a a great move to get to the basket padulla out front three ball good sha padulla 18th triple of the Year oh miss fifth in the Southeastern Conference averaging 96 threes a game Louisville second in the ACC at better than nine game heres Waterman to try and answer strong and the rebound kicked away Morel collects for o Miss 54 of lols field goal attempts come from be on the ark theres a spinning layup by Dre Davis who started his college career here at Louisville of course his brother Tay plays at Notre Dame heon working on padulla Smith a catch and shoot and the rebound pulled down Hadley quick look here goes Edwards got Dia in the air will draw the foul first on Old Miss is the first on the transfer from Belmont Dia and theres a look at 51yearold Chris beard now in his second year at Oxford 2019 of course he took Texas Tech to the national championship game where they lost to Virginia in overtime his teams play a very rugged defensive style you mentioned they have a very effective threepoint shooting Bunch this year too Terren Edwards Jr from Atlanta a transfer from James Madison knocks the free throw down and an early substitution jamon breakefield the from Jackson Mississippi transferred after his first year at Duke into the lineup for Old Miss to replace Malik Di and I think that has to do with rebounding Chris beard told us this afternoon that his team cannot give up offensive rebounds and Louisville got to the line after an offensive rebound 540 Miss heres padulla with the drive and kick and a three ball is good boy Dre Davis has got five including just his fifth three of the year on the drive there goes heurn a blur to the basket first field goal for Chucky heer now these defenses West have to do a better job keeping their guys in front dribble penetration is going to kill you Murray on the runner thats Juju Murray the senior from the Bronx with his first basket he is a fabulous oneonone offensive player you have to prevent him from getting past you on the perimeter and that is much easier said than done Hadley working against Davis Edwards oh nice back up step back three away too strong Waterman oh its going to be a foul off the ball on Murray and Murray going to take his first thatll be the second on the rebels and there is Pat Kelce 49 years of age hired in late March to a 5year deal Dan hes been a coach 13 years head coach 13 years six times his teams have won or tied their conferences regular season he is a very enthusiastic coach hes a very good coach but of course the key to Great coaching is to have great players and hes trying to put together a program here hman got bumped on the drive by Davis and Old Miss quickly has picked up three team fouls and the First on Dre Davis Wes one of the things if you watch the old miss defense they really do an awful lot of switching and what youre going to see from Louisville is if they can theyre going to exploit that if they can get heper against the bigger guy hes going to try to drive if they can get somebody like Hadley against the smaller guy theyre going to try to post him up cars leading score at almost 15 a game heins got three and very quickly now some substitutions male Brown Jones into the lineup he wears jersey number one and Eduardo AFI a freshman from sou Pao in Brazil enters the lineup for om Miss he wears jersey number eight Wesson with all the injury problems Louisville is suffering Old Miss is going to have an advantage if this becomes a bench game Kathy tried to use the breakefield screen breakefield sizing up Noah Waterman here bounce pass inside catch layup rolls around and drops in David Barnes transfer from Sam Houston senior from Memphis averaging about 20 minutes a game off Beards bench heres heern shot fak Ste to the corner three away inside rebounded kick back out another one too strong Barnes and the rebels in the run just better than four minutes gone here in this first half the rebels with a fourpoint Applause lead Applause breakfield and a travel for m brown Jones giveaway by the rebels oh miss has got a fourpoint lead and the valano family so early on it has been a game dictated by threes and actually Louisville has more shot attempts eight but five of them been threes and theyve missed them all whereas Old Miss has been able to get it close to the basket which is why theyre five to six heres James Scott handling at the top see they they have a mismatch inside theres Waterman skip for Smith kfy closes now out front Hadley and he traveled with it turnover will be number one on the cards almost 5 minutes gone here in this this first half that was a great job by Louisville to create the mismatch with Waterman against Murray but Waterman when he caught the ball he fumbled it and wasnt able to take advantage and then when he kicked it out to Smith it wasnt a good pass and so he couldnt get the shot off and of course the old miss defense had an awful lot to do with that y David Barnes transfer from Sam Houston works with kfy and this is male Brown Jones inside against Scott had it blocked and a foul of called and I believe it is on James Scott Applause now Scott into the lineup 611 his first foul its a first on the cards and it gives us an opportunity to kind of update you on what is unfortunately a tough story line here for Louisville case in Prior it was announced yesterday out for the season with the torn ACL and then late this afternoon word came down that Corin Johnson who is the one of the best players in the Pack 12 year ago and Washington has been lost to a shoulder injury for the remainder of the Season Dan you see the two other guys that are involved here uh trayor one of those guys damn theyre down to basically what eight scholarship guys they have eight available scholarship players male Jones a brown Jones rather hit one of the two Im really impressed with the old Miss offense theyre spreading out Louisville and theyre having guys go oneonone there with no help Hadley cant get by padulla now going to skip for Smith quick throw into the corner Edwards will attacks into traffic hell draw the foul and that might be two on Davis now Edwards was a prolific scorer at James Madison last year and he shot the three very well he hasnt shot it that well this year but he is very effective driving to the basket and Dre Davis you know and Dre Davis picks up the foul and again Old Miss has a little bit excuse me male Brown Jones picks up the foul and Old Miss has an advantage theyve got more bodies Edwards misses at the line hes now 9 of 12 on the SE actually he hit two earlier so hes two of his first three and heres Dia coming back and thats the part I think you mentioned a moment ago the number of bodies that Chris beard can throw at Louisville Whos down obviously with some of these guys injured unavailable and Old Miss is going to come at you on the defensive end theyre going to play hard and theyre going to force you to play very hard on offense to get anything that you want fourpoint lead for the rebels padulla skips in the corner Davis launches air baled and last Touch by the cards says Ted Valentine so it will stay with Old Miss now you mentioned Dre Davis thats a couple of Threes hes taken now hes made one thats not really his shot although hes got the green light to take it but again you see Old Miss getting into the lane and creating a wide open shot opportunity twoman game with padulla and Dia Edwards trying to stay in front of padulla defensively theres a bounce pass Davis the catch and dunk seven for Dre Davis and again very easy basket on the inside after great offensive patience he for Edwards out front Chucky spinning against padulla Edwards or Hadley rler kicks back for heper hell now drive it all the way through Edwards launches Louisville cant buy one from the perimeter oh miss by six looking for more Dia put his head down went right to the basket and Malle Diaz got his first basket W its like a broken record thats what doing every time theyre putting their heads down driving past their men and getting to the basket lead is eight here for the Applause Music rebels heer inside Scott the catch and flush wow when you switch as much as Old Miss switches on defense you have that happen sometimes and thats Scotts game hes a dunker and hes a layup shooter padulla against rain Smith now Morel Murray on the attack through traffic cant finish Hadley runs it down T I think when you get the opportunity Wes if your Louisville you got to go and beat that defense heern Edwards rain Smith back rim Miss and youll take that shot every time if youre Lille heres padulla trying to get to the basket and dos the problem is though Wes if youre going to miss threes its going to be long rebounds and its transition opportunities for your off your opponent Smith is ice cold here to start the game now 0 for three from behind the line Louisville just three of their first 12 theyve missed all eight of their triples padulla for three Hadley the rebound think he want to push heres Applause Scott tend to shoot for the cards Edwards thought about it five to shoot Hadley had it punched Away by Davis 41 on the shot clock were going to have substitutions and more when we continue here at the yum Center Old Miss has built an early eightpoint lead on Louisville looking for in year one I think so too West I think its much too early particularly given their injury problems to declare that all the problems are solved at Louisville and this is what were talking about you see Old Miss shooting the ball very well Louisville 0 for eight from three rest theyre three of four from inside the arc but this is a team that likes to shoot the threes like to shoot them yes make them not so much theyre one the poorest threepoint shooting percentage wise teams in the country yep shooting just 287 heres padulla Baseline Scoops it into the corner Morel a nice pass out front thats breakfield and he left it short and the rebound pulled away and Kai ruths 68 freshman from our nations capital on the floor wearing number nine for the cards here in this first half he and Frank enam AB have uh have checked in Anam eBay is a transfer who originally started his career at Syracuse then went to Georgia now at Louisville Edwards on the drive took the contact couldnt find it how about that last Touch by Roose says Tony Henderson partisans In The End Zone dont agree itll belong to the rebels W this is this is the way its gone for Louisville tonight theyre really having a tough time on the inside that time theyve been pretty good before but you cant get your head down here the balls not going in the basket you have to continue to play hard on the defensive end and take the shots that are available to you heon front Court cards Trail by eight padulla reached in and turned over Chucky he who then commits the foul to keep Old Miss out of transition first on he will be the second foul of this first half on the Cards heurn doing a little bit trying to do a little bit too much with the ball out there padulla is a pesky defensive player hes not the quickest guy in the world hes not the strongest guy in the world but he really gets apy and he really plays hard and heurn that time just lost a little loose with that ball sha padulla the only player on the Old Miss Roster who had been in this building as a member of the Virginia Tech Hokies almost halfway done in the first 20 minutes 23rd ranked Old Miss six and one on the year theres the drive and score and Dre Davis having a bit of a homecoming game I should say Davis has played in this building also but in terms of another ACC player that would be padulla Davis has got nine in this first half Roose the three Waterman the rebound it got blocked by breakefield it will stay with the cards and right now heres the perimeter shooting stats coming in for Louisville damn that 287 is 0 for 10 tonight but theyre 318 in the country coming in thats out of 364 so thats not you would prefer you would prefer a little bit higher percentage than that its nice that you take so many but you got to make some Applause yep h eBay see theres a mismatch there he needs to get down in the post Edwards the runner boy the cards ice cold now three of 17 from the floor Davis front Court to the right quick hitter inside bares the catch and score Daven Barnes has got a pair of field goals here in the first half and the lead is a dozen Now for Chris Beards team and a Pat Kelsey timeout Louisvilles getting good looks but getting no return on the investment right now 12point lead for the back after a couple of tough misses so 2311 now with 908 to play and this is a danger zone here for Louisville they could get absolutely blown out of this building cards are just one of their last 12 the James Scott dunp one of their three first half field goals and theres a turnover to kapy and thats what Old Miss does they force turnovers they go down and they get baskets so better than four minutes without a point and an airball willll send it right back to Louisville Louisvilles got to do a better job taking care of the basketball and I think they have to do a better job attacking the basket Edwards heres Waterman now back door pass Hadley catch basket Hadley thats a great cut by Hadley and a good job by water and be strong with the basketball not allow the defensive pressure to affect it Murray skip across for kapy couldnt take Rus off the dribble and now Barnes working on Smith pushed it up wouldnt go Waterman the rebound that ball got punched Away by Dia and hell take it down and Hammer it Malik Dia with the steel and flush and a quick pass inside and here is Roose for three and we get a whistle and a foul inside Ted Valentine is going to tick it I believe for his second so a time out Rebels 23rd in the country heres a look the struggle is real for Louisville behind the line theyve missed their first 11 they have uh they went through a drought with the field goals they have four of them now and Waterman stays on the floor with Roose Hadley rain Smith and Chucky Hein whos got the basketball for Coach Kels Club heon on the drive Waterman in through traffic took the contact put it up on the rim and a rebound got pulled away by braefield he stepped out of bounds Rebels w a foul Tony Henderson says no breakefield lost his balance so it will get a fresh 20 for the vill W this has been an extremely impressive first half performance by Old Miss on both ends of the Court Louisville struggling to score outside and inside because just about shot is contested Music Applause Music yep Hadley threw it away to breakefield trying to go to Roose with it brown Jones for padulla now hell drive Waterman to the basket out of there comes Javon Hadley heern weaves through and and scores six for heurn its a 10point game with under seven to go and thats what Louisville has to do that was a bad shot by padulla you make oldness pay for that by getting the ball down the court before they can get their defense set and brown Jones is going to draw the Cardinal foul R Smith will draw his first third on Louisville Smith of course played for Pat Kel at Charleston he was the MVP of the coastal Athletic Association tournament a year ago and here is male Brown Jones to the line where hes 10 of 16 coming into tonight one of two so far pair of free throws for the transfer from UNCG first one is good dont forget the second annual SEC ACC challenge continues tomorrow and womens action is Wednesday and Thursday youll see vanderville Miami at 500 Eastern Mississippi State Georgia Tech then on Thursday Auburn and Virginia at 6 Eastern Florida and Clemson at 8 all on acc Network and of course on the ESPN Applause app so Brown Jones knocks down a pair of free throws the lead back to a dozen for the rebels and this is where Louisa struggled when Old Miss has set this defense they have been outstanding Music Applause heern hard dribble got it blocked out of there and here come the rebels again Morell skip for breakefield back to Applause Murray 17 to shoot Matthew Morel into the corner three ball from Barnes bounds away Roose Music Applause inside Hadley score the goal second field goal for Javon Hadley four quick points for Hadley lead is still 10 for Chris Beards Club but heurn takes it into traffic and Scott is open but they doesnt throw him the ball now on this particular occasion this is a great pass theres that mismatch with Hadley against muray and when they get that hes got to get the ball and convert and that time he did and were going to get a foul on Edwards prior to the jump shot well Edwards trying to fight through that screen right and and Old Miss has done such a great job at attacking off the dribble and attacking off those screens Louisville trying to be more physical with them but you can only be so physical particularly when youre standing right in front of the referee Miss is shooting 52 from the floor and leading by 10 Louisville is surviving shooting 26 Dan and yet to hit a three and 11 tries well they theyre very fortunate to be down simply by 10 points but this old miss defense has been very impressive yep heres heern out front against Barnes see the rebels trying to deny the drible drive of heurn and hell draw the foul from Barnes David Barnes commits his first that is six now on the rebels and itll send Chucky he to the line not heurn had to work really hard to get it in there off the dribble West so what Im going to tell you if you have to work that hard to get a score to get to the free throw line its going to be a long night pepper is I mean he he doesnt mind working hard but that oneonone stuff I dont know how far thats going to carry him particularly since if he does that a couple of times Old Miss is going to come and trap him yep he hit the first Barnes is out and kapy Eduardo kapy has come back into the ball game for Old Miss and for all were talking about Wes its only an eight point game yep cards could use a good five minutes though to go to the locker room Rebels have been very very impressive and theres Matthew Morell first points of the game and thats a very interesting point theyre up 10 and thats the first contribution hes made offensively he step back three got it Tucky heern now with 11 all of a sudden hes got Louisville last five sevenpoint game Morel launches too strong itll go out of bounds and be awarded to the Applause cards W Chucky heurn gets a great screen and we said Old Miss likes to switch and round Jones switched but didnt get up on heurn hes afraid he burs going to drive by him and by the time he gets out there to contest that jump shot heurn has a lot of time to shoot it padulla back in the ball game Morell on the switch heern trying to find room rain Smith airball never had a chance Smith now is 0 for four from three and I know Pat Kels philosophy is to shoot the three but that time Scott set a screen he was down on the low post mismatched against padulla and they never even look to throw him the ball lead is seven under four to go this building trying to help the home team get back in it Davis whos had quite a first half it continues 11 for Dre Davis and Wes how many times have we seen that Old Miss player on the perimeter drives maybe turns and gets to the basket Hadley caught it tried to put it up and will draw a foul were going to get free throws when we come back here to the Yum Center the foul is on Davis itll be his second youre watching the ACC SEC Music challenge has been the overall strength of the SEC and certainly youre seeing that tonight in those early results eight teams in the top 25 as Javon Hadley goes to the free throw line hes got five in this first half now for Louisville cards have been as close as seven after the early run by o Miss and one of the two for Hadley Louisville still really fighting it from the floor just seven of their first 25 tonight and one of 13 from behind the threepoint line West but theyve made three of their last six but doua scoop and a foul on Davis and I think thats the third on Dre Davis so the leading score for the rebels has three fouls in this first half and two Dan in the span of 14 seconds well this is a really tough shot by padulla and Davis just crashes to the bo now Scott didnt block him out you just cant run over the guy so Tony with a word of instruction on the foul for Davis and hell come out of the ball game as brown Jones will check back in for Chris beard now James Scott at the free throw line is 31 hes just four of 13 at the line Scott does most of his work around the rim which is why youd like him to shoot a whole lot better than 31 its great to get to the line its better to make him when you get there he too another player who played for Kelsey at Charleston and I know what youre thinking at home he you guys talk about how bad he is and he knocked it down like he was Koozie I didnt say how bad he was I said hes a 31 shooter thats a fact second of the one and one for Scott there you go he heard Bonner say he was 31 and its six which is as close as l has been a long time Murray poked Away by heern here goes Murray right back at him with the floater that fell off the iron slapped around last Touch by the cards how about Chucky heer he already leads the ACC in steals hes had one pick tonight but that time he almost got Murray and Murrays a hard guy to do that too padulla trying to win the drive to the basket and does again seven for padulla another drive to the basket now that was a tough shot this is a really big last two and A2 minutes of this half here is heurn stops Starts Now Edwards up front got caught at the foul line heres Smith heper off a Scott screen gets it to Edwards with five hell drive L Euro and score five for Edwards thats not the way you draw it up but that was a very tough offensive possession foul on Scott trying to help off the screen and thatll be the second on Scott hes the first card with two five on Louisville well again this isnt the play you dont fall down and then pass the ball to somebody but that is a great fake to draw Jabron Jones and then he goes right by yep Edwards is really good going to the basket Brown Jones a three he pushes middle of the floor turned over trying to go to Hadley now Old Miss an advantage Murray the lob and breakfield bumped and fouled by Applause heper second on Chucky heurn second card with two six on Louisville and itll be put in play on the Baseline heurn surprises Hadley with that pass now youre running in the middle court I dont know why you should be surprised but this is not much of a bump but that saved to dunk although thats the second foul on heer Applause Y pulla in for morels three heurn had a shot at the rebound and a foul is going to be called on Brown Jones nine on Old Miss first on the senior from North Philadelphia thats really a heck of a play by heper hes got two fouls and he runs in to battle for that rebound against the bigger guy and draws the foul I mean Louisville has not shot the ball well tonight but they have played very very hard and somehow they survived that initial Old Miss burst one and one for Chucky heern whos got 11 in the first half rattled around fell out and for heurn just his sixth Miss of the Year wow Ruth was coming in the game for him Wes to because hes got those two fouls now he has to be very careful he doesnt pick up number three oh my Waterman going to commit the foul on Brown Jones thatll be his first thats seven on Louisville Noah after the head fake by male Brown Jones just went tumbling thats one of those situations Wes when you play that packline style defense your big guy in this case Waterman he jumps out at the top to help off the screen and then hes got to get back to his guy or get help back there and that didnt happen two shots for brown Jones and the first one is good dont forget coming up on Saturday and Friday for that matter full coverage of the ACC football championship game with Clemson and LS or SMU starts Friday afternoon 300 inside access ACC pm and ACC h then on Game Day pregame during and after right here on acc Network and always streaming for you on the ESN out both of them fall for brown Jones all five of his points at the free throw line the lead is eight for Chris beards Rebels and the last thing you want if your Pat Kelce is for your team to go on another cold spell here Hadley on the drive scores it off the glassley seven for Hadley back to six ahead of a minute to go padulla rolls it down on the bounce pass for brown Jones seven to shoot Murray a three how about Juju Murray 17th three of the year is first tonight back to a fivepoint or ninepoint Miss lead on his fifth Point great patience and toughness on offense by Old Miss 14se second differentials as we wind down this first half Waterman with 10 to shoot Hadleys inside against padulla you got to get him the ball heern on the drive fallway good Chucky heer sevenpoint game with 10 seconds left Rebels can play for the last shot padulla spinning Edwards on the way up commits the Applause foul foul on Terrence Edwards will be his second its the eighth and they got to see if Ted Valentine Applause Music wants to look I think at the clock here right yes absolutely how much time is left when the foul occur right there the foul about 45 so were going to get free throws here right theyre going to put point four on on the clock padulla is going to shoot free throw so two shots for sha padulla oh miss is going to step away from the line let padulla shoot the free throws hes 84 on the year hes only missed three times in 19 tries padulla has been so aggressive today I mean hes played aggressively on defense hes driven the ball to the basket 1200 Parts score at Virginia Tech Applause he has stepped right into the lineup at Old Miss thats his eighth point of the half in his first free Applause Music Applause throw 110th Collegiate game for him tonight and he hits both free throws nine for padulla and Chucky heurn from almost the other end of the floor and Old Miss going to take a ninepoint lead here to the locker room and for the fourth time in the LA to get it to a ninepoint game but Dan Chris beard said something interesting about 10 fourminute games to us today it feels like Louisvilles got to play this thing in fourminute increments in the second half without any question Malik Dia four points in the first half working against Waterman back to the inside up with a left hand left it on the iron thats really good defense preventing di from getting any closer to the basket but again you have on open we have an opportunity inside for Old Miss Edwards put it up got it blocked got it back left it on the front third time the Char second field goal for Terren Edwards heres padulla the scoop and the roll 11 for Shawn padulla Edwards went for the steel at half court and after that he was backpedaling against padulla you got to be very smart here on the defensive end if youre Louisville R Smith just one twopoint field goal in the first half comes in averaging 13 for the cards Edwards out of a double team fights through and Ted Valentines got a foul shot clock was at five whatever happened was going to be frenetic for the cards instead they got bailed out by a padulla foul well you get an aggressive double team West and its awfully difficult to be sufficiently disciplined to not reach in and foul but Old Miss we saw the defense do that a few times in the first half they got double teams and it was tough to get out of them left alone Hadley a three rimmed off Waterman the rebound hes fouled on the putb and thats an area where Louisville had some success in the first half thats now offensive rebound number seven for Louisville Jaylen Murrays second two quick fouls on the Rebels Chris Beards Team 4 Six on the road a year ago they were 2 seven in their nine SEC Road games Waterman at the line for the first of two its no good Wes he comes into this game one for seven on the Year from the free throw line now one for eight Noah is playing in his sixth year from Savannah New York at his fourth Music school and the second one is good for his first point tonight played 109 games in five years and thats the interesting thing about both of these teams they have a lot of new guys but almost all of them are really experienced players Applause yeah and Murray bumped and fou by he thatll be his third yep first of the half on the cards goes to Chucky heern out of Omaha boy thats it thats one of those plays Wes if youre closer to the basket you might be able to get away with it but not out there at half court with the referee standing right next to you yep padulla to work heres di on the elbow if you will 17t shot bounds away look at Waterman he pulled it away from Edwards as much as anybody from Old Miss Applause heern working left side against Malik di Baseline in trouble slips it for Edwards right corner rain Smith now if you havent seen rain Smith before heres padulla on the drive and does it again 13 now for padulla thats thats great recognition by padulla because heurn has three fouls hes got to be careful heon on the drive heres Edwards a three front rim Miss Long rebound Murray ahead and the layup from Morel second basket for Matthew Morel Edwards right back atam will draw the foul thats on padulla thats his second Dan what I was going to say a moment ago is if you havent seen rain Smith all you need to know is 87 of his career field goal attempts are from behind the line and thats his first today but that was great ball Movement by Louisville to create that open three they havent had many wide open uncontested threes so the young man from Tasmania on the board as Edwards sees the first one Bound Away at the free throw line R Smith CAA tournament MVP a year ago at Charleston there you go percentage of field goals from three those are field goal attempts its just unbelievable Edwards missed both free throws and louville not helping themselves from the free throw line certainly not tonight the cards find themselves after those two misses 11 of 17 on the drive padulla and one on the Edwards foul sha padulla has got all hes got six of old misses eight here in the second half and thats the third foul on Edwards Hes been impossible to stop he may have dragged that pivot foot right there but he has been able to get by his man and get all the way through the lane we showed you in the first half in our halftime highlights how uh Old Miss was able to take the ball and drive it to the basket and theyve been able to do that here in the second half as well and padulla knocks down the free throw third free throw of the night seven and the half 16 in the game for Shawn padulla Applause three minutes gone Smith another three nope and were going to get a foul I believe on Old Miss Jamon breakefield his first Wes that was a very different threepoint attempt from the last one that Smith just made in that there wasnt any passes the defense didnt have to work and there was no ball movement they got to get the ball movement and get the open shots back to the larg lead of the night for the rebels and heper just drew another foul and this one is on David Barnes its the fourth foul on ol Miss second on Barnes now Wes one thing for you to remember is that heurn has those three fouls and when you are in foul trouble you can be careful lots of guys are very good at being careful on the defensive end but on the offensive end if you maintain your aggressiveness you got to be careful about picking up a charge heurn missed the free throw dont forget it a Saturday afternoon we get conference play in the ACC High Noon in Winston Salem Dan boner will be there for BC and Wake Forest and then Georgia Tech in Carolina in Chapel Hill at 200 presented by food line and then how about Stanford and cow why not thats the way you want to start conference play at 400 Roxy Bernstein will be on the call of that one for us out in Berkeley right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app oh miss had gone back to the biggest lead of the ball game a dozen been cut down to 11 after heper got one of two Murray for padulla breakefield calling for the ball in a mismatch against Smith foul line heres Barnes and the roll good third field goal for David Barnes the transfer from Sam Houston State another guy from the Memphis Area playing close to home in Oxford Baseline Drive Kay Ru went for the dunk and draws the Applause foul foul is going to be on breakefield its his second its five on the rebels and Kai ruths has got a little bounce to him Dan yeah he does but Im not sure Wes that that drive was the appropriate move the defense was slacking off I think he get the Ball moving once you have the defense committed but it was an impressive looking play Roose hits his fourth free throw of the Year James Scott checks in to replace Hadley Eduardo kfy has comeing to the lineup for Old Miss really impressed with the way Old Miss responded after louv will cut it to four in the first half and had this crowd going crazy y l has just been theyve had a tough time scoring and Old Miss has taken advantage theyve been very efficient for the most part back to an 11point lead Applause again there goes Davis Fall Away got it Boy Tough shot Dre Davis with 13 on his six field goal well one of the reasons Louisville was able to cut into that lead is Davis was on the bench in foul trouble kky nice job playing the passing Lane on the backside knocks it out of bounds itll stay with the Cards Old Miss their largest lead of the night now third over the table at you yes absolutely biggest lead of the night for Old Miss at 13 as we rejoin you live play heern working out of the corner breakfield there defensively and now the pass for Smith is stolen by padulla Sha to the front Court kick for clas three got it Eduardo kavy fourth triple of the year for for the young man from Brazil thats just great decision making by padulla on that fast playak Kay Roose directing the offense on the dribble Drive lost the handle of it out of bounds it will stay with the Cs another look at padulla here well padulla reads the play theyre trying to make a crosscourt pass and then his head up and he just waits for kfy thats what kfy does hes a threepoint shooter Applause padulla drove everybody back into the lane and then found the open threepoint shooter Padley spinning through the double team and foul going to be called here on Eduardo kavy West now Hadley got fouled there but that is a really tough way to get the ball close to the basket spinning through the entire defense in the lane theyve got to do a better job getting him in the low post where he can catch it turn and power it up to the basket against a smaller guy six foul of the half on the Rebels first on KLFY and Hadley misses the free throw tell you what cards came in shooting 71 as a team they are now under 64 after the Miss by hat and in a game like this well for the game West theyre shooting now under 66 from the free throw line Sho 11 from Beyond thepoint AR and theyre only shooting 34 overall so its really difficult to play against a team like Old Miss and just not be able to shoot the ball yep six 15point lead after he got one of two Morell hard dribble down the lane and the score Matthew Morell the senior from Memphis now with six and the rebels have pushed it to its largest advantage here at 17 and Barnes almost had that inbounds Applause pass Kay Rose staying on the floor for Pat Kelce here with Scott hebburn Hadley and Rain Smith and heres ruths for three thats great defense by Louisville they basically by Old Miss they basically triple team heurn forced him to give up the ball Scott the rebound hell turn and bring it up the Applause floor 18 to shoot here for heer Waterman and Edwards wait at the table for the Cardinals and Scott lost the handle on the entry pass from heer turned over by Louisville breakfield and the rebels in the front Court heern did everything right Scott just didnt catch the ball this great ball Movement by Louisville player movement side to side this is very difficult to guard a team thats that efficient on offense David Barnes backing down on Hadley scores eight for Barnes on his fourth field goal now that was a contested shot but theres no help hes able to get where he wants in the lane lead is 19 and a Louisville timeout so willll step aside at the Yum Center Chris beard in the 23rd rank Rebels even though its early in the season everybodys playing in a different position than they did in the first few games of the year heres what were talking about particularly K prior being out that has forced Louisville to make adjustments to almost every position heres Hadley tend to shoot for heper thought about it put it on the deck right back inside nice playmaking Javon Hadleys got his fourth field goal of the night and now double figures and thats exactly what I was talking about with Hadley if he catch the ball close to the basket and not have to dribble past four or five guys in there then he can be a very effective inside scorer s minutes gone here in this second half the lead is 17 skip over to the left side Barnes wants to Fire and hit a three fifth three of the year for David Barnes hes got 11 now he had 13 earlier this year against Oral Roberts he was scoreless in nine minutes in Saturdays loss to Purdue 20point lead inside Hadley hell feed Roose with the right hand Kay Roose first field goal freshman from Washington DC Pat Kels very excited about him as a player they can develop but hes going to play a lot more minutes now with the injuries you were mentioning a moment Music Applause ago tend to shoot for clasky Morell on the drive with a right hand Matthew Morell now with eight Wes with that little time left on the shot clock and Morel that far from the basket you just cant run out at him and let him drive by you thats what he wants to do Edwards on the bounce for Hatley nice turn against Barnes couldnt finish Morell the rebound youre not going to get a better shot than that that might be the cards night in a nutshell its a 20po oh miss lead and the rebels who hit five threes in the first half have added two more here in the second half David Barnes from out on the left the latest threat Music than most and the national championship of my goodness hard to believe now 41 years ago 42 next year its impossible to believe yep oh miss leading by 20 on the Drive Davis had it blocked by Scott and here is Chucky he front Court spin into traffic the scoop and the foul and that is four on Applause Davis first of the half on Dre seventh eighth now on the rebels W they announced that foul on Morel oh Morel how about that they sure did thank you Dan fortuitous one for Dre Davis absolutely you know heurn got to the Line West but it that drive is sort of this game in a capsule because its a very tough opportunity and thats what old misss defense has done they forced Louisville into a lot of tough opportunities which is why the Louisville shooting percentage is so bad Davis goes out of the ball game by the way with the three fouls as hurn hits both free throws another thing Old Miss has done West is theyve hung on to the basketball only three turnovers tonight and they came into the the game as the best in the NCA at protecting the ball averaging only eight turnovers a game Music yep out front heres Barnes Morel now and foul off the ball is going to be on Edwards thats four on Edwards three on Louisville in the second half heres what were talking about with old misss and you know not only do they turn it over very few times but they force a lot of turnovers which why theyre number one in division one in Morell off cut in the lane and Barnes shoved Scott to commit the foul third on David Barnes thats nine on the rebels so old Miss will send James Scott to the free throw line for a one and one hes got four points tonight one and the CAA all rookie pick a year ago James Scott from fville North Carolina to the Music line and the one and one too strong look at the rebound by Roose and then he threw it away to padulla Shas got help if he wants IT Crowd wanted to travel didnt get it heres breakefield almost stolen by Roose then a hell ball and Kai ruths did a good job of locking down Jamon braefield Dan Wes that really was a good job and Roose has played with a great deal of enthusiasm and energy coming into the game breakfield just sticks the ball out there and he goes and gets it yeah now remember braefield had 17 help keep Miss in the game against Purdue breakefield hadnt scored tonight out of the corner Roose missed on the three slapped out by Dia it will stay at the Louisville end of the floor and here comes Jaylen Murray back for Coach beard hell replace Jamon breakefield Jaylen Murray came in averaging 146 to lead old missing scoring hes only got a pair of field goals for five in the first half theres Waterman and that ball got deflected off his release now Murray and the Rebels the other way padulla the hesitation the drive and couldnt finish and a tap follow will result in a cardinal foul so Kai Rose itll be his first and thats four now on the cards padulla missed that shot but he should get at least part part of the credit for that offensive rebound because he drew everybody to him they just cannot keep him out of the lane Malik DIA to the line 7 for 11 this year started his career a couple of years ago at Vanderbilt then went to Belmont where he played last year with Casey Alexanders team so but this is the first time hes left Nashville yes well and he played high school basketball in Murphysboro so really he you know hadnt left middle Tennessee at all until he went to Oxford second free throw for Dia is good but we talked to Chris beard about this today and I think some of this conversation is applicable to where Louisville is Waterman the lob and Scott got undercut by Dia thatll cost him a foul thats 10 now on the rebels with just ahead of 10 minutes to play Chris beard and we were talking about transfers and the intentionality of them right guys that youre looking for and he said well yes but the process is not what you think it is heres Scott at the line for the first of two and you see these are the transfers padulla Dean Davis in the lineup tonight Brown Jones Javon Benson we havent seen yet we have seen David Barnes contribute tonight but Dan then he threw out the phrase well you know its kind of like speed dating and I went okay here we go and to a degree the intentionality process has to take place very quickly theres no waiting around when the portal opens for these guys no you got to CAU he said you got to get them right away and then you got to see if you get in their top three and get a visit and their Zoom call through traffic up goes Davis for the basket 15 for Davis now on his seventh field goal and they they continue to wear the Cardinals out inside yep Scott now for Applause heurn heres Waterman going to work got caught in a double down there Davis helped out heres heon skipping for Smith three ball away eight for rain Smith they get some stops and get three or four of those threes in a row then suddenly its interesting again 16point game and thats a foul on Roose he knocks Davis to the deck second on Kai Roose will be the fifth on the cards well he may not always be playing efficiently but hes playing hard he just ran him over Applause well and when you listen to Pat Kelce talk to his team today the one thing that this Louisville program will not sacrifice his effort thats going to Applause happen Davis launches the three and bangs it home wow seven in the half 18 in the ball game second triple of the night for Davis heres the Davis on the turnover hell take it down and dunk it home so now 20 for Dre Davis on his ninth field goal tonight and a guy who started his career at Louisville for a couple of years where he averaged about 7 and2 points in two seasons and tonight Dre Davis has posted a 20point game well thats what Old Miss wants to do they turn you over and get down on the other end and score theyve lost one game this year to Purdue the last time out and thats the only game this year where they had fewer points off turnovers than their opponent its a season high for Davis inside there goes Hadley couldnt finish got it back kick out for heer three bounds away Hadleys got to put that ball up yep pass on E EAS two for a three right under eight to play lead is 21 here tonight for the rebels and padulla saved it with six to shoot and heres Juju Murray to work hard drive and run with a right hand and breakfield and it will be oh miss ball when we continue last touched by the cards Chris Beards team leads by 21 when we continue tonight from the vill liner tomorrow night Janai broom off just an unbelievable performance in Maui well and Auburn is playing as well as anybody in the country and broom certainly fits that category too theyre just playing really good basketball thats going to be a heck of a matchup in Durham yep and of course the Blue Devils will be here to see the cards on Sunday in both schools respective ACC opener there is a long three that banged off the back rim Davis got the rebound Waterman will collect the rebound from behind his teammate Kai Roose back to Noah Waterman works all the way through slips it for Smiths three thatll spin out and a tough night from behind the threepoint line in a tough night shooting period for old for Louisville continues well Old Miss defense I think just has Louisville playing just a beat faster than they want to play that looked like a hurried three point shot even though he was open kavy a high arcing three is good Eduardo kavy who is a legacy in Brazilian basketball heres heer in a step back three thats good for Chucky heer champ his fifth field goal hes now got 19 in the ball game and he leads the cards in scoring kavy the youngster who just hit the three a moment ago Dan his dad rerio played in the 96 Olympics with Oscar Schmidt wow on the Brazilian Olympic team and of course Oscar Schmidt one of the great players of international basketball history theres a drive and score for Juju Murray hes got seven and and young Eduardo was on the under 19 national team and from the NBA Academy of Latin America and of course his dad an Olympian and played in the F World Cup so Eduardo knocks down a three and then Chucky heern shoots 35 Danny only had 10 threes coming in hes h a couple tonight hes taken only five from behind the line so there is a little bit more evolved to him than just a dribble Drive in dishout right but I think the dribble Drive dish guy the guy playing inside is his strength and I think if youre going to force him outside out behind the arc then I think that limits his Effectiveness because hes got to be a guy creating things not standing out there just shooting threes R Smith on the drive and that got deflected away theyll roll to the deck and Dia finds it padulla out of the right corner Murray and it drops in once again padulla makes a great decision in transition and Murray did a nice job just getting all the way out to the corner and creating a wide open passing Lane and a wide open Applause three ahead of five minutes to play in the game heper rattles out of three inside Hadley the stick back Second Chance point a dozen now for Javon Hadley hold Miss has done a pretty good job limiting Louisville in the second chance points category Louisvilles got some but not enough to be decisive padulla turns it over heres Kai ruse and Dre Davis commits the foul and that now will be no foul its just out of bounds I beg your pardon well this is a very optimistic attempt by Kai r i mean he he jumped way too far from the basket and Davis blocked it sure did out of bounds it went Trey Davis clearly having a terrific night in a homecoming game of sorts here tonight against the cards well hes tied his season High yep in points and hes been very aggressive on both ends of the Court heres rose on a reroute Baseline and the D so Roose now got Applause six and the lead Applause 22 Malik diaa the rebels here in this second half are shooting 65 from the floor again theyre getting great Applause shots and the Miss shot recovered by Scott and theyre closing in the Miss is closing in on 50 points inside yeah cley working against Brown Jones here goes Edwards into traffic lost it over the in line it will stay with Louisville 12 to shoot break in the action and the rebels in front just a lot of those hurried shots from Beyond The Arc and you see you see there they lead in the points in the paint category the inside scoring and theyre going to have two more right here so its now 46 26 yeah Malik DIA has had two Breakaway dunks tonight one off of Steel and that one off a pick in the back court almost bit on one there heres Kay Rus of three and Davis the control out for kfy Eduardo has got a sevenpoint night on his third field goal well the Bottoms out of the tough here West that you keep shooting those threes and missing them you get long rebounds and you get easy opportunities down at the other end and Baseline Terrence Edwards cant finish D of the rebound well o Miss is going to go home on Saturday and take on lyndenwood out of mouri Dan who is in their thirdyear division one play theyll begin SEC play on January 4th at home against Georgia Mike Whites team a winner over Notre Dame tonight and the challenge but they have a very interesting game on December 28th theyll play Memphis on ESPN two at FedEx forum and I would say based on what I saw last week from Memphis Old Miss in Memphis would be one of those games that the committee might draw a circle around on their schedule absolutely you know Memphis has had a pretty good start and Old Miss has been very impressive Noah Waterman back on the floor with Roose James Scott Javon Hadley and knocked out of bounds with 239 to go Applause and the rebels put it in play with a 26point lead you see in the upper right corner of your screen some of the games tomorrow on the womens Side Kelly graml and Ill be here at the Yum Center for Oklahoma in Louisville on day one of the ladies event in the SEC ACC challenge well join you from Louisville at 500 on ESPN 2 and Noah Waterman commits the foul second on Waterman sixth on the Cardinals and Jamon breakefield will go to the line Music first one by braefield rattles out dont forget Sunday afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball triple header starts at noon Notre Dame at Wake Forest and then youve got SMU at Florida State presented by Food Lion at two and then Virginia Tech and Duke from Cameron wrap up the afternoon on acc Network and always streaming for you on the ESPN app first point of the night for breakefield Dan and again he had 17 against Purdue yep I think that shows you the depth of this oldness team theyve got Five Guys in double figures tonight Edwards on the drive John bow has come into the ball game wearing number 10 for Old Miss a 72 freshman from South Sudan who played in the overtime Elite program in Atlanta and theres a foul on the drive its on breakefield well B is one hes one of those project guys this is his third game of the year only his fourth or fifth year playing basketball and you look at that guy and I thought that he was pretty skinny but I was told by a member of the Old Miss staff that he has put on 50 lbs of muscle since hes been at Old Miss Y and I was very skeptical about that cuz he doesnt look like he weighs 50 lbs no 20yearold freshman from the South Sudan free throw by Edwards rattles out and Old Miss will bring in Robert coward a 64 sophomore from Grayson Georgia and also Javon Benson 67220 a senior transfer from Hampton who is from Columbia South Carolina W so West what that means is each of the six transfers yep on the Old Miss rist Roster have played tonight I mean Wes weve talked about the old miss defense but they have 86 points thats correct and Dan they came in averaging 826 and they picked that number up and theres going to be a foul on Benson offensive foul trying to set the screen baskball and the turnover will send it back and our Continental attire player of the game is Dre Davis season High 18 points tonight for Davis eight of 11 from the floor with the four rebounds young man started his career here at Louisville then to Sean Hall and get a homecoming game of sorts tonight and leads Old Miss to the win and Davis was the guy that got him started early he scored inside very effectively did a really nice job on the defensive end that defense has been disruptive all evening long for the RBS 23point lead after the Waterman three which is his first field goal of the night coward back out front here is Jaylen Murray a three and that got tipped away to kavy and the rebels content to just run this down and get us into the games final half minute here louisv going to be three and two at home d and and the two losses are going to be to Tennessee in their second game and tonight here to Old Miss and Duke by the way visiting on Sunday after the Blue Devils play Auburn tomorrow Applause night again Pat Kelce told us this afternoon that a lot of the guys are trying to play new positions and its tough to do that when youre going against a team like Old Miss Edwards a three and the Knight and a sh for the Cardinal but the bottom line is if he cant put the ball in the basket its going to be hard to win yep oh miss going to dribble it into the front court and the rebels are going to win tonight by 23 at the KFC Yum Center Chris Beards team Dan thought they
