and Virginia will start with the basketball what are we looking for Brian especially defense for Louisville well for Louisville you have to be able to stop Virginia from pounding it inside and then you got to make sure that you close the possession by getting the rebound you dont want to give them opportunity as second Applause shots Virginia in the road Blues Louisville home white Ro drives the Baseline and stepped on the Ed line so we certainly had turnover circled for Louisville but it is an early Virginia turnover and heres the thing Virginia is going to make you defend for the entire possession you have to be disciplined and you have to be able to stay home and stay and keep the ball in front of him Huntley hanfield playing some of his best basketball of his career has been a real focal point of this Louisville offense Trey white Healthy Back in the lineup James back iron but an offensive Applause rebound Williams has brought a lot of athleticism to Kenny Paynes Club five on the shot clock Clark oneonone against Dunn front engine and dun with that length is going to be able to challenge sky Clark because again with his length youre going to have to shift the the defense for Virginia because theyre not going to allow you to touch the paint Applause easy youre all ACC point guard re pakman he is special and one of the things about pman is he allows the game to come to him I love the fact that hes not going to allow you to speed him up hes going to take the advantage when he can to penetrate and get to the cup pman one of the best point guards in the country he does every everything hes a great leader Defender just saw him take it to the cup white trying to beat roie and well jump it up it will stay Louisville basketball but two possessions what have you seeing well heres the thing we always talk about Virginia in that packline defense they do a good job of playing on man defense they dont allow you to be able to touch the paint this last time you see roie active hands gets his hand on the ball and then theyre going to be Scrappy for Louisville Id like to see them try to get the ball inside the half field and force Virginia to two have to adapt shot clock at zero did he get it away he did not so in our conversations with coach Bennett he says defense travels Brian we got to play defense so far nearly two shot clock violations for Louisville well and thats one of the things that theyre going to do youre going to have to run your offense and youre going to have to shift uh Virginia theyre one of the most disciplined teams defensively in the conference McNeely third best in the country in threepoint shooting and how about Up and Under inside what a presence Jordan Miner has been for The Who well his thing is that this curl by mcney you have to honor that but then good dump off to Miner again that big wide body being able to finish right around the rim Brian where do the Cardinals go for offense but I think that they again got to give Huntley Hatfield some touches down low and try to get an opport to score down there and force the Virginia to help once again five on the shot clock white fade away and one and Applause done Virginia out quick for zip offensive call on miner and good defense by Scott Clark following that pick on beakman Miners got to stay solid and again watch the pick right there Miner he he comes up and moves a little bit for for Virginia you have to stay disciplined run your offense but again back to Louisville they got to find some way to put some points on the Applause board big fella Distributing Williams and quickly the Cardinals now 0 for four from the field and heres the thing Virginia if you get down by 10 thats almost like 20 so Louisvilles got to find some way to get some points because Virginia is going to run their offense theyre going to be method methodical about how they do things touch that paint you see little Runner right there by re beat I tell you the senior from Milwaukee you see him at the next level I mean hes done everything at Virginia but hes its all round game because we talk about his defense and how Poise he plays just allows the game to come to him and picks the spots Williams just bullying his way to the bucket and its an offensive foul so four minutes in Louisville still in search of their first point well I love the penetration by Willams that last time extended a little bit of a chicken wing to get that offensive rebound and again we talk about Virginia you see McNeilly stays solid if Williams had not extended himself he would have gotten that watch again gives him a little bit of a chicken wing dislodges McNeely were going the other way pakman four early four of the first six for Virginia ree again survey never in a hurry but he finds his man inside easy bucket for Blake Buchan and the Freshman weve seen a couple of penetrations by beakman getting his offense that last time a little pocket pass well be able to get that to a little Runner eight zip and the Louisville faithful getting a little bit uh uneasy here in the KFC Young James driving theyre going to pick dumb with a foul but boy oh boy how about the Virginia lockdown the

Virginia pitching a shut out here in the first half its eight zip and UVA has owned Louisville since the Cardinals joined the ACC 182 against the Cardinals but back in 2018 how about this game at the Yum Center 9 seconds to go DeAndre Big Game Hunter 6766 Virginia number one in the country number one seed in the NCAA tournament but they did get upset in the first round that year certainly right now uh UVA on the outside looking in but a lot of basketball left for them to improve that resume and absolutely February is a very big month especially in conference play because thats when youll start to see teams separate themselves and in Virginia they just have to stay the course Louisville again offer uh I like the fact that theyre trying to touch the paint they just got to get some those shots to drop you mentioned a 10point lead I mean were a basket away from that pman with the double roie oh book it all that and heres the thing we see Ryan with Reese beakman youve seen the first couple of buets he got penetration for himself the last two dump offs he is the guy that gets everyone going Virginia clicking on all cylinders and right now UVA has not missed and obviously Louisville has yet to make so the worst case scenario for Kenny pay yeah and obviously that last play you saw Reese bigman get into the paint forc the help gets the ball out to roie Ros able to get a not wide open three and for again for Louisville you got to find some weight to be able to touch the paint make the extra pass you cannot go oneonone against this good Virginia Defense James triying to do just that actually one on Two And it is another held ball scenario and this Virginia Defense Brian it is suffocating well I feel like this is going to be something thats going to be repetitious for the entire afternoon because again they do an amazing job on week side defense that last time when you penetrate theres someone there to try to help and tie you up and Louisville now needs to just find a way to get a stop and break the ice here at home mcney and the first Miss of the game beakman skies for the rebound and theyll actually catch the senior with a person foul and good defensive possession I I like that Mike James you have to follow behind Isaac mcne because again we talked about him and the shot and you see again good box out by Scott Clark right there catches beakman going over the bat again for Louisville you got to find some type of offense you see Tyler Johnson into the game and fly to the basket is Mike James and its an opportunity to get on the board here well and if youre Kenny pay you tell your guys to stick to the course you dont want to get impatient you dont want to start to play Hero ball stay disciplined with your offense and continue to penetrate 79 free throw shooter Tuesday on inside the NFL the guys take a look back at the conference Championship Sunday and take the first look at the Super Bowl matchup Inside the NFL Tuesday at 8 East 7 Central on the CW a two for two at the line is James louville still in search of their first field goal now some 6 minutes into this Applause contest Dante Harris in for Applause beakman Harris thinks about it shot clock winding down he Glides in and its going to stay Virginia basketball thats one of the things that Louisville had a problem against Virginia in the last game in Charlottesville got to do a better job of being able to close out possessions and get that rebound so just two starters on the court for Music Virginia mcdy thought about it drives right here and it is another offensive rebound but it will go to Louisville possession you see Mike James hugging Isaac mcney you want to force him to go into the paint that last time mcne gets to the cup and then again watch the penetration you do a good job of being able to challenge that shot and then again Louisville closing out the possession now they have to find opportunity to score and it is another Cardinal turnover lets see if Virginia continue and content Brian to play their game their Style with well theyre going to use most of the shot clock because youll see them theyre going to do a lot of curl action theyre going to shift the ball east to west theyre going to force you to to defend for at least the majority of that shot clock and then theyre going to either penetrate get the ball down low Bond high off the top of the glass now Louisville will look to move Johnson in the open court as quick as anyone in college basketball and Tyler Johnson to the cup and Tyler Johnson is one of the guys that Kenny pay talked about with that assertion of the lineup being able to get into some open court where youre not forced to play against that half court defense of Virginia Brian he is an absolute Applause blur Virginias missed five in a row after making five in a row to start Harris on the Baseline uhoh McNeely oh you absolutely cannot leave iMac open but that that play was started by Harris with the penetration that Force the help you leave MN wide open we talk about this is a guy thats number three in the country and feel at threepoint percentage you have to stay home on him and its another Virginia open but I tell you if theres one guyo you cant leave open the IM and R Im saying what you have to do is you got to stay at home you got I make need he said if you going to go ahead and leave me wide open Im going to go ahead and make you pay how many times have I felt this good let me count for you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 Music 10 how many times have I felt this good Dad were going to

whos out on top of the cardal looking for their fifth win in a row certainly points in the paint has been important you look at the ACC Standing and Ill tell you what a league that has somehow only has two teams in the rankings from top to bottom I mean how strong is this league right well I think what it is is that you see Carolina and Duke still the the only teams left remaining but you see a lot of teams up there that you werent expecting this Florida State team is surprise then you see a log Jam with NC State wake fors and the Virginia right there the team that I feel like has dropped off a little bit look at Clemsons Conference record they were a team earlier that was ranked in the top 20 three and four so what Im seeing is the league is showing a lot more parity and then thats probably was resulting in the disparity as far as the national rankings it is tough to win on the road in the ACC very very difficult as even Virginia has found out this year Al Louisvilles going to have to find some offense Johnson to the cup white for three got it and since Tyler Johnson is coming to the game has given this Louisville team a shot of energy we saw the penetration and fast break now you touch the paint and you get a wide open jump shot thats what Louisville needs to get Applause going five on the shot clock for bakman nice pass inside Miner fumbles Coral oh where did he come from goodness Ryan Dunn well you saw Jordan Miner throw it up there then Ryan Dunn goes up on the pogo stick to the to the Upper Floor what a put back where did he come Music from James now little oneonone with dun high off the glass and once again Louisville one and done as Miner patrolling the Applause Glass pman Great pass another another Ryan T but again Reese beakman commands so much attention on the penetration you had two Louisville Defenders great vision by him and you throw the ball to Ryan Dunn anywhere near the rim hes going to finish and possibly put it on your head so Lova hits the three to cut the lead in half and then four straight and now a turnover Harris thats its a nice defense from the Cardinals good recovery Johnson the other way and that will be Virginia basketball if youre Louisville you have to be able to capitalize on those opportunities because youre not going to get many transition opportunities against this Virginia team to your point Tyler Johnson and his speed in athleticism an immediate impact for Louisville but then a costly turnover yeah absolutely again had an opportunity to finish youre not going to get many opportunities here but I think that for Louisville you got to continue to defend you know that Virginia is going to use at least a good 15 to 20 seconds of this shot clock per possession you got to stay disciplined especially at the end and close PS out with a defensive rebound pakman back rims it and Scott Clark will look to push two on two Clark to the bucket draws some contact and once again minor Coral so zero if youre SK CL opport if youre skot Clark you have to be able to finish you have to absorb that contact youre not going to get a minut a lot of opportunities in Fast Break you got to go strong absorb contact and finish at The Rim mcne comes off a couple screens Murray oh beautiful hes riding that hot streak played the most minutes most points just a couple days ago against NC State and if you watch Virginias on a 60 run here theyre going to run that tight curl action forces is the big to have to show if you do not show that allows him to get in and you see Tyler Johnson pulling that that that foul against Miner and that is Jordan Miners second person Al foul so wholesale changes on the court rate now Glen and Johnson out for Kenny pay and Miner will take a seat on the Virginia bench as Blake Buchanan The Freshman back in to patrol the post still feel that Louisville could try to establish Huntley Hatfield he hasnt really had many touches on the Post Louisville just two made field goals in this entire first half and it will stay that plan and and for Kenny Payne thats got to be thats got to be a frustrating play Scot Clark you can get that shot anytime hes always talking about trying to break down the defense and touch the paint Louisville just two of 12 from the field here now Virginia their calling card is defense and certainly have seen that this afternoon mcle thinks about it good defense by Mike James allow M NE to getting the airace bigman glances at the clock nearly stripped from behind but theyre going to get cloaked with a foul and last time Clark did a solid job of being the guard beatman beakman is really crafty with the basketball again in the first half seeing him doing a good job of being in a balance you see with a little bit of a hesitation you see Clark trying to get that that ball from behind got to depend on your help defense and Clark will head to the bench with Tyler johs son back in a beakman hes on every watch list your wooden watch list your nay Smith certainly a chance for a first team all ACC he does everything what do you like about him well is his all around game I mean hes so versatile you weve seen him be able to command you know the offense we going for his setting his defense his teammates up then look at that play right there hes so high a high IQ not to mention all League defender and Buchanan en rolls it in so Virginia just completely having their way at both ends Johnson again blocked by beIN this time do we need at both ends once again same play this one fumed across the end line well Virginia they can do no wrong Brian Oliver and I tell you when you look at them Ryan dun goes up to the next level puts a pogo stick you see UVA imposing their will 911 whats your emergency Sheriffs Office is

Security for more than 150 years and lets take a look at the significant stats brought to you by JP Morgan wealth management and know Brian I Dont Care What statistic you go to its being dominated right now by Virginia but certainly points in the paint that is complete domination and we talked about this Ryan at the beginning because Virginia and their offense they run a lot of curl action and what theyve been able to do is touch the paint with their guards and then the nice dump off for their bigs and again you see the turnovers Louisville already five turnovers but then Virginia has not shot a ton of threes but 50 Behind The Arc in the first half for Kenny Payne and Louisville a disastrous start but certainly we even saw against Duke Louisville capable of making a run what has to happen whats the first thing that has to happen if Louisville is to get back into this game well heres the thing you dont want home run plays you go you want to be able to continue to try to find a way to get the ball inside I still feel like Huntley half field has to get a touch because thats going to force Virginia to have to make some decisions and to your point now working hard inside was Brandon Huntley Hatfield and that is his second so actually if there if there is one thing to be positive about if youre Louisville both big men for Virginia now with two fouls well and heres the thing R you put the pressure on you see Buchanan go out if youre Huntley half field you got to scream from that ball give him a Target and you basically want to be able to get an Unity so loville into the one and one early but unable to Applause capitalize just cold shooting from all aspects for loville mcney feeding inside to Dun Groves thinks about three takes three got three how about the pace you saw done except the double team he knew that that Louis was going to send another Defender was patient accepted it gets it open to the wide open shooter thats again the discipline that is Virginia especially on offense and getting wide openen batting practice threepoint Applause efforts and it is another Virginia foul and again if Im Kenny pay I continue to try to feed Huntley Hatfield if you have Hunley Hatfield that last rip you go straight to the Baseline you draw the foul but Id like to see him attack the middle one one so just missed the front end the last trip this time he connects next Saturday the 2024 live golf season is back and better than ever as John ROM joins Brooks Kea Bryson Des Shambo Dustin Johnson and the rest of the live golf Superstars live golf Maya Koba next Saturday 1230 East 930 Pacific right here on the CW so one out of two at the free throw line and first look at Zone from Louisville beakman wideopen three again but Virginia unable to capitalize if you Louisville you got a manufacture you got Huntley hfield right there you got to go here comes the double and it is a turnover again beakman just filling the stat sheet live ball turnovers again you have to Value the ball for Louisville again that last time the double came if you Huntley have field you got to shift to the other side of the floor beakman into the lane and Tyler Johnson will pick up the foul one of the things that stands out for me Ryan for this Virginia team is that they curl tight when you see them come off that offense their bigs do a solid job of being able to set the screen allow the guards to touch the paint if youre the Louisville bigs you got to commit to either stopping that guard or you stay home and buy yourself your guards enough time to get around the screen Ro back into the game be that always under control beautiful pass inside oh the give and go to D but see thats the good it started out by beakman being able to get the ball over and and again Virginia they do a great job Ro didnt have anything drops it off to Dun passing him a good shot for a better shot and the lead is 19 and growing another Louisville turnover beakman against the freshman and Tyler Johnson will pick up his second consecutive and thats where the inexperience of a young player Tyler Johnson out of frustration you cannot exhibit your frustr because again the last play beakman is a heav experienced guard he understands hes got you and then Johnson shows the frustration after the play you come down with the foul a terrible and they will call the technical foul on Tyler Johnson as well so insult to injury for the Applause Freshman beakman misses the first of the technical hes a 76 free throw shooter Applause you see right now Virginia up by 20 and what theyve been able to do is that its the level of consistency youve seen it on defense you see it offensively where theyre a patient team they make sure that everyone touches the Applause ball well B Louisville has made two baskets well a a lot of that is the fact that we talk about this Virginia team and how good they are defensively but then for Louisville the level of patience that theyre not showing to run their offense the live ball turnovers and its hard because they have not been able to establish any offensive Rhythm that shown Virginia to be able to expand this Leep to Applause 22 has not scored a basket in over six minutes Mike James trying to change that and heres another thing you you see Louisville get one crack at it then after that Virginias closing the The Possession by locking up these defensive rebounds and not giving Louisville any opportunity for offensive boards mcney Ro thinks about it draws the double that means wide open oh my what a what a dime by Roy because again he pulled two guys from Louisville and you get the ball over to the jumping jack that is Ryan done well certainly Virginia doing whatever they want uh absolutely dismantling Louisville on both sides of the court and watch the RO and call it 10 pennies two nickels a solid dime him threaten the needle right there the vision and we talk about Ryan dun with the pogo stick what a play Virginia has definitely put their imprint on both ends of the play you see again go ahead and put your arms up in the rim Ryan D my goodness is an 18 to1 run 18 to1 Louisville has scored two baskets in the entire first half lets get into Virginia why not well look at all these AC ranks here I mean theyre slacking because theyre ranking third in assist per game at 15 but everything first and turnovers for game turnover percentage assist to turnover ratio and assist percentage this is the team team that youve seen that theyre second and D1 as far as the turnovers they are able to execute and put their imprint on this game in their first half and is showing up by 24 well how much of this right now is is Virginia and how much is it Lille just having a a horrific start to their day well its a little bit of both as you see Huntley Hadfield get a chance to go and continue to put a little pressure because we knew coming into this game when you look at this Louisville team they have had some struggles theyve had some bright spots we talked to kimy pay and he said that they theyre getting better but on a game like today against Virginia ran you got to come with the energy a sense of discipline and right now Louisville has not been able to establish any offensive momentum well Brandon Huntley Hatfield has had his way getting to the free throw line he it was going to have to make some of these but certainly you know Virginias at one foul away from going into the Louisville going into the double bonus so is the game plan just just absolutely feed it inside well that as hes trading the fouls for only coming up one youre only coming up partial but then Louisvilles got to do something on the other end this Virginia teams got 32 points with 4 minutes left to go they normally hover somewhere in the upper 50s lower 60s theyre on Pace to have a 42 uh 42o half McNeely thought about three was able to keep the pivot beakman penetrates five on the shot clock mcney roie and it will be Louisville basketball so had to defend the entire shot clock but able to get a stop and right now the story is Virginia at both ends of the Court the whoos having their way in Kentucky

excellence but Excellence for a purpose to advance the greater good welcome back lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years ree bigman the star the senior the do it all point guard has done it all in the first half and its one of the things we talk about why hes so hes so versatile to his ability to score to play defense and also get his teammates involved in this first half you see the numbers seven points three assists and three steals may not jump off the chart but I love the fact that this is a guy that impacts the game and its contagious for his teammates because you can see right now even with the Huddle he has command of this team and they basically follow him like the P Piper Virginia held NC State to just 15 first half points on Wednesday night they LED 2715 at the half the game did go to overtime so Im searching here br well yeah again this Virginia team may have LS in their offensive game but for Louisville youve got to start to limit them theyve been able to touch the paint do some things and get where they want but thats like I say again you saw empty possession by Mike James I like the fact that you put him on the post against a smaller Isaac McNeely but you have to finish at The Rim I think Kenny Payne will take that shot every day its just right now Louisville cant throw it in the ocean shot clock once again under 10 McNeely done and he cannot miss right now and heres the thing great defensive possession by Louisville is one of those situations where good D but better o because you see Ryan Dunn be able to elevate and finish that that playoff and bakman another steal its two on one for it wait for oh he tried over that was ambitious Brian and he he went with with bad intentions too good thing for Scott Clark he comes up Ive never been so excited to see a replay on the foul but if you watch this play watch Ryan D he goes up good thing for Ry MC sky Clark that hes able to foul him because watch the length hes sitting and sizing them up and was going to go ahead and sign for sign him up for the new poster oh he the done Banks it in oh my goodness he looked over as like did not realize that my bank account was still functioning on the Saturday just a 57 free throw shooter and he bricks them both in my goodness and talking about an afternoon and and again Less Than 3 minutes if you are Louisville continue to stay the course yes you are down by 20 through 27 but youve got to find some way of generating some offense Clark and done skying for the rebound I mean Louisville just cant catch a break right now beakman oh nice and just fumbled away from dun see if louville cant get something going in transition Glen to the bucket and he finally rolls in Louisvilles third basket of the game and thats how theyre able to do it the opportunity you see the sarc sarcastic Applause from the Louisville fans but again getting out in transition you have to be able to find some way to constantly try to chip away at this thing as Louisville drops back in the zone beakman Bond oh Leon Bond but again we talk about Reese beakman that last time you saw him with a subtle penetration forcing the defense to help and you get Bond a uncontested wide openen three Glen James again trying to penetrate and it will be a turnover on Mike James the leader of this Lis bille basketball team and part of that packline defense is helping recover active hands you saw the penetration by James but then Virginia having four guys in the paint to come and Applause help Louisville nine turnovers Brian three made baskets roie oh my goodness but heres the thing you saw Louisville that last time rying in a 131 you offset that with a twom man front youve got one defender on the backside you run roie from Baseline to Baseline you get him a wide open three good ball movement and youre able to execute finish it up with a three ball Corner Pocket the lead is 30 James having a tough time from the field and he gets one to roll in and nice step back by Mike James they would get to the back to the Baseline realize that he can Elevate over a smaller Isaac Applause mcne now some contact no call staying in that zone Ro and a good rebound from Clark Louisville can take the last shot if they want Applause it the big guy inside cant connect shot clock is off but a steal from roie coast to coast he lays it up and misses the layup just lost a little concentration and Roy basically had taken advantage that he was a give two and and watch he basically sits back and realizes the left hand he smokes the layup probably the one thing that Virginia has not done well in this first half and even with this ginormous lead it was interesting be went directly to him to refocus him 5 Seconds Clark almost stolen from beakman Williams front end it and that will do it what a first half for Tony Bennett and Virginia Total Domination coming up on the Subaru is the message down 28 if if anything Ry you got to show some pride youre getting handled at home and youve got to come out with some energy some fight if youre going to get beat you have to show this home your home fan base that youre fighting you got to come out and have the energy on both ends of the floor and try to have this first five minutes to the point where youre showing some life and certainly one of the few bright spots has been that guy Brandon Hunley Hatfield Im sorry and this is what you saw they ran they shifted uh Virginia and then you got Huntley Hatfield where he was able to get downhill with his length right to the basket uncontested a transfer from Tennessee averaging 11 points8 and a half rebounds again beakman into the lane mismatch inside Miner Up and Under and louva for the first time to day could go on a mini run and its a foul Louisville basketball again you you want to show some difference and you saw this last position you saw basically Huntley hfield with the blow by by miner you get the big man up there hes athletic hes long you pull Miner away from the basket then basically Virginia has no shot blocking interesting to see if that becomes a theme for for Louisville and Buchanan quickly into the game less than a minute in for Jordan Miner and once again Ill tell you Brandon Huntley Hatfield hes doing an amazing job of drawing fouls hes got to make some foul shots and thats the thing too is that at least you see him putting the ball on the floor and you see Buchanan come out and minor come back in if Im Kenny pay you continue to go towards that because youre finding something thats giving you a glimmer of hope Jordan Miner on the bench for 13 seconds and then immediately Le back into the game white oneonone knocks it down the first 40 run of the entire game for Louisville and obviously it may seem like an exaggeration but what it is is that its showing Louisville coming out in the the locker room with some type of purpose theyre trying to extend the defense theyre trying to try to create some offense McNeely in the game lays it up no good Clark white and hell drop a foul on miner that will be his third and heres what we have seen coming out is that Louisville has gotten two consecutive stops you get in transition and then again you want to get downhill you see white right there being able to go and any chance you get to not have to face the setup UVA Zone MC defense is a benefit for you and it is a 0 a Louisville run as Miner will head to the bench with his third foul and now Jacob Groves the 69 transfer from Oklahoma into play some Center white one of two and heres the thing Virginia with an uncharacteristic 41 points in the first half this is a team that has shown in the past they can have some struggles if youre Louisville you have to fight through those screens you have to show and enforce Virginia into something makes him uncomfortable a massive mismatch inside done oh my goodness hes done it again Brian D my God and heres the thing Virginia recognized they had the mismatch you got a smaller skot Clark and then Dunn did a great job of being able to spend Baseline and again weve already talked about the off thearts athleticism so that 50 run immediately disrupted by duns slam up Groves wants three and got three wow the big fell and what we thought was going to be a momentum changer for Louisville then you have Virginia consecutive stops and then Reese beakman comes in and finds the wide open shooter in the corner Clark inside and he will head to the free throw line and uh hes yet to score in the game but and yeah Ryan Clark has had his challenges again but but I I like the fact that you continue to be aggressive you think Sky averages 13 12 a game and Louisville needs him to be a productive offensive player obviously that hasnt transpired and heres what Ill tell you for a guy like Scott Clark thats had his struggles offensively as a scorer you need to be able to see the ball go into the basket and and again you talked about his numbers at almost 14 a game and I love the fact that wheres from Jason Williams ex St Johns or excuse me probably the white chocolate Jason Williams that played at uh uh certainly the Florida Gators I mean uh yeah white chocolate is exactly where that 55 comes from so Clark able to make a Music pair nearly stolen but beakman just always under control what a from Williams great great recovery by Mike James and what look to be an easy bucket by Isaac mcneel Clark surveys he has a bit of a Applause mismatch Louisville picking up their defensive intensity and again Watch the last play it looked like it was a dime by beakman and you see the recovery by Mike James comes up with that block but on the other end Hunley Hatfield had Grove sealed if youre sky Clark you got to give a big man the ball when hes down there and you have to give him an opportunity to score white inside lays it up and in it has been a much different offensive attack for Louisville in the second half well and heres the thing you see Louisville extending their pressure I love the fact with Kenny Payne you want to get out and try to make Virginia un uncomfortable and it is another Virginia turnover but what were seeing again I talked about you wanted a response Louisville has come out with the response Tony Bennett does not like what he see op to call a timeout time out Virginia well right now Louisville at least showing some pride here in the second half but Ryan dun having a career game you see him put him on the blender come in and say you

hals Louisville scored 13 points in the first half the entire first half they have nine in the first 3 minutes and 30 seconds well and youve seen that theyve done a better job of being able to break down Virginia and then Huntley Hatfield is the guy that I think that has picked up you see him coming up short if youre Mike James you can not be forced to shoot those off balance Applause shots beakman always under control right 10 on the shot clock roie done on the Applause mismatch nearly tips it up and in Virginia with the offensive rebound mcney book it and and thats a dagger from the Louisville you played solid defense you have to close a possession by getting that rebound you dont get it and then you give Isaac McNeely an opportunity to knock down to three thats got to be one of those things thats got to be frustrating for Coach pay and with the iMac you are talking about one of the Premier Shooters in the entire country conversely Louisville just trying to find a way to find

Courtside Saturday brought to you by RAM and certainly Louisville down 28 at the half has shown signs of at least uh showing some of that Pride that Coach pay talked about well heres what Im going to wow you I went to Georgia tanken Im a math whiz you see first half 4 for 20 nope aint no second half 3 for six 50 its amazing you see how basic basically showed you that hey if you find ways to score it makes the game a lot easier Brian do you challenge your team to just win a half win a five minute stretch what what youre down 28 at a half whats the message to keep them engaged well you you you got to win segments of the game you break down that second 20 minutes and four components hey lets win the first five minutes then lets go ahead and string it together for the next five we dont try to take down this whole 28 points and you see Kenny pay call a timeout because they cant get the ball in but back to the point increments of the game you dont try to take off the entire chunk you try to get it segment by segment well they are winning that first uh 5 minutes 9 to5 with with 17 seconds remain if you will uh hes a cop shes a Kong and together this unlikely Duo makes the perfect pair watch wild cards Monday 9 East 8 central only on the CW stream now on the CW app if Im Tony benett on the other side too I I remind my guys of how we were able to extend this lead you dont get complacent you do not look at the score you continue to imp impose your will defensively stay disciplined on your offense now this is a young Virginia team minus beakman and done on the court Clark rips it away white in the corner seven on the shot clock and ball bounces around James pulls it out a new 20 hes yet to get going and really has been off his game so heres the thing I I I saw the first time Trey white youve got to swing that ball that last time Williams you decide to go by and watch that Balls got to pop youre not going to get by the defender you got two guys there at the Baseline Louisville you have to continue to make that ball pop and you have to ship Virginia thats how youre going to score and thats how you going to get back in this game if if possible and Virginia already content on running clock McNeely he cant finish and Glenn skies for the rebound and what youre seeing is Louisvilles closing possessions by getting rebounds and transition still ice cold from behind the ark Louisville cannot get anything going from distance and you can get that three in the corner anytime I feel like if you go in transition you got to be able to attack the rim because youre youre an advantage and not playing against the set defense and beakman picks the foul white picks the foul up trying to guard beakman out on the perimeter thats Trey Whites first Applause personal pay attention to the Virginia def me offense when that ball comes see how quickly the ball Pops that you get down to the second and third Applause options beakman takes a rare shot front ends it great defense by Scott Clark the for him in a contested to Williams now Up and Under and its a quick turnover beakman the l oh my goodness he has done it again Ryan done The Human Highlight video near the the shot clock and Ryan Dunns going to get it now certainly Virginia will pull their share of highlight videos year end videos from this game as Ryan dun has had count him four tomahawks white again picks up the foul a Murray touching the elow Im going to look at it why and watch Reese bigman can throw it anywhere I mean this guy goes up with a trampoline I mean its just that if Im read bman I just know hey just throw it up youre going to go get it and its a good thing that Mike James he turned around he was like oh no Im going to make a a business decision and Im just going to go ahead and say hey just play on you know it was a really bad turnover from Williams for Louisville it was in transition at one end the very quick turnover dribbling off his knee leads to the to the Jam at the other we had a chance to talk with Kenny payt and that was one of the things that hes trying to impress upon his ball Club is that you have to touch the paint and be willing to make the extra pass what were seeing from this young Louisville team is that guys trying to take it on themselves to make what I call the hero play youre not going to get that against this Virginia team and their defense now some pressure from James on mcney beakman out of the game if youre going to get a chance to get into Virginia now is the time because again and thats thats a bad foul by Williams you basically had Murray in Retreat you stay solid you do not go ahead and give them an opportunity and you start that foul but with Reese beakman and now Ryan done out of the game where does Virginia go for their points if youre Louisville youre extend you get in and you make them uncomfortable try to get some turnovers now certainly it be an opportunity for Tony Bennett to get everyone involved Off the Bench Roes has already knocked down one make it two nice and great play by Murray again you saw him come off that curl he was able to occupy two guys then you basically saw Gro drift out to the three uncontested three and little pick and pop Louisville and another one of those droughts they havent scored in four minutes Clark James has just done not a whole lot offensively trying to take Murray inside beautiful pass and and great play great cut by Huntley Hatfield because again James got to the point to the paint with was patient saw the Huntley Hadfield had the advantage on miner nice little dump off Harris Miner and he throws it down but heres the thing we talked about how does Virginia get their points were both done and beatman off the game I like the fact that theyre running their offense theyre getting the advantages making the extra passes and getting the looks that they want Clark runs into Miner I think theyll count the bucket and they do and more importantly that is the fourth personal foul on Jordan Miner so louville at least putting some pressure offensively on Virginias defense and at the other end just too easy for The Music Hoots next the action

only on the CW well how about this for a a a stat for you Brian the louva Cardinals have made nine baskets in the game Virginia has six dunks well what it seems is that Louisville has come out and have found a little bit more offense and again you look at five for 10 but then again Virginia still able to get their opportunities in Transitions and then close opportunities at the bucket sky Clark back to the free throw line certainly Louisville as he completes the threepoint play and it will be fullcourt pressure from Kenny Paynes club Im sure Tony Bennett in a in a strange kind of way is anxious to see how his team plays just with the luxury of of being able to rest beakman oh absolutely and again what youre going to see is that theyre going to run their offense theyre going to run at least 15 to 17 seconds off of this CL before they even get a shot of rose has knocked down a couple of triples Harris now with Johnson guarding and that will be an offensive foul and good defense by Tyler Johnson again you were able to sustain your defensive effort and then stay in front of Harris Harris with a little bit of a nudge and extension of that arm Huntley Hatfield hasnt had a touch in a while try to get him a touch because hes continuously put the big guys from Virginia under pressure and there is the big fell in Lane draws some contact Buchanan though able to block the shot and good recovery by banan but if if Im Huntley atfield Im trying to give him one and then come back over my left shoulder has not shown really that he can score well with that left hand in low post and itll be a traveling violation by the inbound passer cant do that after a turnover Little Roy with a little twostep action there Clark Huntley Hatfield taking it to the basket one of the foul didnt get it yeah but he cant lead with the ball hes got to be hes got to keep that ball tight to his hand that last time he Canon doing a good job of being able to get his hands on the Applause ball theres Harris again nearly another pushup Groves thats where his spot and nearly three for three and Louisville dodged a bullet the communications got to be better than that you cant have two guys on the ball at the same time heres Payne on the basine Hunley Hatfield and this time he does lay up in thats to play you saw him go to his left gather himself and then come right back and again if youre Louisville continue to extend right now you understand that you dont have beakman and done in the game you want to continue to put pressure on Virginia Ro on the Baseline height advantage over clark but cant connect Huntley Hatfield is injured immediately reaching for his leg but he does get to his feet under his own power you see this last play Huntley Hatfield comes in you see right there it looked like Caleb Glenn had taken a a shot to the eye so Huntley Hatfield who has been one of the few bright spots today for Louisville he heads to the bench seems to be okay and Emanuel okaf for who starting to play some more for Kenny Paynes Club will get a little time Clark wants three and Buchanan skies for the rebound and Harris comes away with it good play by Harris realizing he didnt have the numbers you want to come out and run your offense this is where the the discipline offensively comes use that shot clock and then under 10 you go for a little Applause offense and Zan P picks up the foul underneath Neath he will head back to the bench wholesale substitutions for both head coaches in a 25o Applause contest and nearly a Virginia turn the lead was 28 at the half so Virginia they have won the first 10 minutes winning by three well but you saw the energy fromc from Louisville coming out and we said that you wanted a response you see two consecutive times that Tyler Johnson gets in that passing Lane hes extended his pressure you know but for Virginia theyve done a better job of being able to capitalize on some turnovers and also this is a team again we talk about the how theyre going to run their offense theyre going to be disciplined theyre not going to do a lot of oneonone theyre going to force you to guard roie trying to create two on the shot clock and it is a turnover now Johnson he can move but Virginia gets back nearly a foul on Buchanan great pass inside okaf for rejected by Buchanan but he picked up the person but that play was set up by Tyler Johnson he was able to pull two Defenders Buchanan had to show on the Hedge gathered himself and was able to get the ball down to Oker and watch nice time Oker goes right over Buchanans late on the the recovery allows Oker to go to the line for oh he banks it in the bank is wide open man you know what let me may have to stop on the way to the airport I was going to say man let me grab me a couple of dollars man bank is really fit you know whats interesting from Virginias perspective is no need to worry obviously about this game but both centers with 9 minutes remaining have four fouls each well if Im Tony Bennett you know obviously in a game you always always looking for an opportunity to teach and you hes one of the best teachers not only in the conference but but in the country youre going to look as you see Tyler Johnson comes up with a steal nearly oh he smokes it okaf for but heres the thing if Im Kenny pay I love okers effort because he didnt give up on the play he hustled back and then again how about Tyler Johnson extending his play that last time being rewarded and even the home crowd getting into to it just a bit as Louisville is on a 90 run beakman though is blocked okap for adding some defensive presence for the Cardinals Johnson to The Cup oh and he is just drilled from behind by Applause dun Ryan what weve been able to see from Louisville is that their defense has been able to create some offense you see the last penetration by Johnson and you see Ryan Dunn just gets caught up was making a play on the ball but back to Louisville I mean Tony Bennett realizes that theyre fighting back and he opts to bring Reese beakman back because Glenn the last thing you want is this thing to actually get under 20 and give this Louisville uh Club some confidence now the Cardinals have cut eight off of that lead its a 100 run to make it 11 but you remember I talked about the segments you know Louisvilles an 11 and0 run over the last 333 and so youre in the back half of the 10 minutes and so youve seen Louisville pick up their intensity be able to put uh Virginia a little out of source offensively and maybe one possession away from really feeling like they could get back in it but Tyler Johnson but but heres the Louisville fans are booing this call and I think that thats probably the fourth foul on Johnson it is you have to say you cant reach you played solid defense thats a foul regardless to how you spin it you still have to stay disciplined you got Virginia a little bit sputtering on their on their heels now can you get one more stop or will beakman do what beakman does mcney oh thats tough cold hard heres the thing Mike James play solid defense but then you saw MCN get that separation and elevates and thats where it is is that you play defense and then you come up short an 110 run is stopped by mcneels three and then quickly a Johnson turnover and thats what gets Louisville in in trouble that last possession Johnson throws the ball over and beakman draws the foul on Clark Clark tried to slide in it was close but even the Louisville crowd get it into it a little bit re Speakman though back in the game and always under control I have

Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creat Financial Security for more than 150 years for Ryan Dunn his year end video will highlight his game against Louisville I going go on the line and try to get Ryan done some nil money M cuz he should be working for UPS cuz hes throwing the UPS by on the other and Louisvilles picked up their offense in the second half 7 from 15 and its literally been Brandon Hatfield Huntley being able to be a little bit more active around the rim love the fact that theyve been picked it up and you seen it right now this is as close as as weve seen this game for a while Louisville picking up their intensity on both ends of the floor seems that Virginias got to regroup and get back to what they were doing the first half and you take a look at what Louisville has been able to do a lot of it has been at the free throw line in the second half the Cardinals 10 of 11 from the charity strike Virginia has yet to shoot a free throw so now lets keep an eye on that heres the other thing if Im Kenny Payne I tell my guys that when youre playing basically you realize that Louisville is now in the bonus and then defensively you want to shoot the gap on those curls you dont want allow the guards from Virginia to touch the paint you tell your big to open up you slide between it and maybe come up with a Music steal and a huge threepointer from mcne Le the last trip down the lead had been cut to 19 then a turnover beachman now in the lane he cant connect and Ill tell you okaf for providing a presence he is but that lastation solid defense by Scott Clark because you forced we beat into a contested two where was this in the first half Williams Cuts Baseline and hillhead to the free throw line but Ryan heres what youre seeing with f Louisville theyre showing the redirection now what theyre doing theyre forcing Virginia to have to shift that last time you saw McNeely get caught on the back door nice little position and you see Mike James comes in absorbs the contact now hes going to the line totally different offense from Louisville not only the bonus from here on out but the double bonus so if Louisville can continue to get to the foul line obviously they can do it with the clock stopped and continue to try to chip away to where at least you could add some pressure Buchanon comes back in with four personals James makes him both the lead is back to 20 well and heres the thing youve gotten back into this game by extending by being and heres the thing if youre white you dont have to foul youre forcing Reese bigman to take time off the clock if youre able to pressure them then thats going to put them in a hurry up offense once they get across half court you do not want to foul and reset the shot clock Virginia gives it away to White he flies in cant convert oh thats costly you got to finish that and Johnson just filed out of the Music game Tyler Johnson you got to be youve got to be smarter than that because again watch the double team great opportunity for a Double Tree Trey white youve got to come in and its got to be contested but then if youre Tyler Johnson you are not helping your team with that reach you have to be smart in that thats where the inexperience comes in because again he was able to change The Narrative of this ball game with his play earlier on you know its its really like a triple whammy you miss a layup Johnson fouls out and it now puts Virginia in the bonus where UA struggled offensively let been lets be frank in the second half theyve not been good but now theyre in the one and one and your your spot on because again for the last five or so minutes youve had UVA where they had to bring in reese deep beakman and Ryan done because again if Im Tony Bennett maybe Ill let these guys ride it out and let my my second unit get some play but he had to bring it back in its a fourpoint or a threepoint swing now because you couldnt capitalize yeah absolutely Ro does make one and Applause two game has massively slowed down with all the free throw shooting Clark white continues to really go oneonone cley Hadfield plenty of time on the shot clock double comes and stolen from who else but Rees beakman and he is content to run some offense this is where the veteran leadership comes in re Speedman understood didnt have the advantage and that will be it for Buchanan he just followed out of the basketball game oh wow they call it four that is shocking Id have to see that one again because I thought that Ryan dun missed the layup and I thought so watch the penetration by Ryan done and you see oo I dont know if I saw that close the door Ryan D gosh again watch this last penetration here I dont know if I saw the contact on that place that is terrible you may want to employ the hacker Shack on Ryan dun here he CH he chipped a piece of the platic glass with that first one now the threepoint well has been dry for Louisville but Mike James driveing to the bucket will head back to the free throw line for two with an opportunity to once again cut it to 20 you know Louisville needs a couple just they need stops and they need to be able to get stops and then score quickly and Im not saying throw up shots but you got to get into your sets a little fast what youve seen is that guys going a little bit more one onone I know C pay would opt to want to make sure that ball pops you shift the defense and then you attack those gaps if youre going oneonone Youre Going oneonone against a set defense Virginia is one of the best in the country with having guys sit in the lane weak side help James makes a pair its back to 20 can L will get that one stop to maybe just maybe start to make Virginia think about it but heres the thing you see re Speedman wide open now you good possession this is the opportunity to try to get downhill James Euro Step blocked by Dunn and stolen by Dunn and heres the maturity even for the Freshman great defense by Ryan Dunn understand it right now A little over 5 minutes the clock is your friend youre up by 20 you force them to play a position maybe under 10 you go for the bucket or blow by by re be and he is special and as Virginia moves into February Brian and starts to build that resume for another NCAA run uh Reese Beakmans going to have to be that key well and heres the thing is the fact you see penetration another turnover by Louis when you look at ree beat and what he does for a player he understands that hey not only have I looked for my offense but I got to make sure I keep my teammates and involv and you build confidence because as you get further into conference player and then you get into the ACC tournament you want other guys like Isaac McNeely be playing well you want Ryan Dunn to be playing man you want your bigs you want you know the the the buchanans and Murr to be playing well because thats when its going to really pay Applause dividends H Virginia now dissect this Loval defense and use as much block as Applause possible be nearly picks up the five and now tell you shots going in from everywhere as Elijah gertrud The Freshman Guard from Jersey City New Jersey knocks it down that last possession the ball did not even leave from the right side you saw four consecutive curls until Virginia got the actual shot that they wanted Lille one of eight from behind the arc make it one of nine Louisville would have had their hands full with Virginia at 0 but certainly if you were putting together a recipe they had to make some threepoint shots and this Louisville team is towards the bottom of the league as far as percentage of the threepoint made but I feel again you did not have the offense that you needed and and again if Im Kenny pay when were reviewing this tape you impress upon your team is that you have to be disciplined enough to make that ball pop because a a team like the Virginia youre not going to beat them with just oneonone straight line drives and another difficult turnover where really unforced bakman roie patience it again oh he has done it again stop it oh my God a career high a career high oh you say thanks for coming out God bless my goodness Ryan done is just an absolute poster waiting to happen just lob it up there and just bring it from back you know from Charlottesville oh my God Ryan Dunn has put on a display this afternoon when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top

everything came 2 days early have a good weekend Mary all right now have a good weekend but its Wednesday see you Monday am I missing something its the weekend baby see you later like getting things 2 days early when it comes to Payday you can with Wells Fargo what are you doing this Music weekend well back here at the KFC Yum Center its been all Virginia Louisville showed some pride in the second half lets take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home or motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom dont worry we have enough highlights from Ryan D to fill the entire read well heres the thing is that the 19 and 11 his a for 10 six of those eight field goals right were Ducks I mean it seemed like there was one highlight after the other but what you found out is that on the end of that is that he also was able to put his imprint defensively and you talk about the 11 boards as well huge afternoon for Ryan Ryan D so under three to go Clark a little bit more of that from Caleb Applause Glenn well as we know there is a ton of pride in the Louisville Community in their college basketball two national championships eight final fours for Applause Louisville and this community is not okay with subpar college basketball and finally a threepointer drops for the Cardinals and Curtis Williams The Applause Freshman Virginia came out and really just completely took over this game Brian in the first four or five minutes if youll remember went scoreless through the first couple timeouts well heres one of the things we talk about obviously you know Tony benns team and and the defense I mean this Virginia team was clicking efficiently on all cylinders offensively they put up 41 points in the first half uh and again when you look at the cohesiveness that they ran their offense with you know they do a good job of being able to make you defend for the majority of that 302 uh shot clock you have to be disciplined enough to get down to at least within the the teams and because they again they do a good job of of spreading the ball uh they dont get out of sorts theyve got shot makers and again Rees beakman is the guy that literally gets them going on all fronts it is now five in a row for Virginia they host Notre Dame go to Clemson host Miami at Florida State I mean listen the schedule in the ACC its its never going to
