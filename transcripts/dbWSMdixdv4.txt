green That is a rarity music First time this year that they have put the green uniforms on Thats Carson Tout about to jump for Notre Dame Theyll win the jump ball vault And Carson Tout hes a guy that youre going to want to watch as far as around the backboard That guy can get about any rebound both offensive and defensive Matter of fact hes the active leader in rebounds in the NCAA right now working the ball around the Irish looking to change the last five matchups with FSU as that one doesnt hit the rim and a shot clock violation early for the Irish but they have not been able to outdo Florida State the last five meetings And good defensive possession by Florida State They were able to keep Notre Dame on the perimeter for Notre Dame Theyre going to be able to break the paint if they can get those threes up FSU working the ball around the outside They on average will take a shot 15 seconds into that shot clock They work fast And actually coach Luke LZ first year coach for Florida State has said he doesnt think they work fast enough as Notre Dame still trying to get off a clean shot This one the look by Shrewsbury Thinks about it again And five on the shot clock Kerta is going to take the three and off the front of the rim and no good Second possession in a row You see Florida State force Notre Dame deep into the shot clock Good pass by McCrae down low Steing couldnt do anything with it Kicks it back out and now Jones the three on the way Its good This Florida State team you know that theyre going to get up a ton of threes as of late in the last two games Only 13 for 51 You see the song a little too aggressive out there on Harrison Yeah silly foul at the timeline first Rick this Florida State team is third in the in the conference in threepointers made Slightly over 10 You see Michael Shrewsbury there in his third season at Notre Dame We talked to him after shootound earlier today He said he might be a little superstitious but the green doesnt bother him And this is a guy that you understand that theyve been playing better said that their offense has got to really help them out tonight As you see Shrewsberry getting ready to was able to draw that foul from Wiggins And I think that Braden Shrewsberry is one of those guys that you really are going to need his offense this afternoon Yeah And he goes to the line I think we call that the charity stripe which can we call it the birthday stripe today for the birthday striper I like that Like where you going partner 21 years old today is Brandon Shrewsbury And dad said that uh it was a Super Bowl They were at the Super Bowl when wife went into labor and had to go to the hospital 21 years ago I thought it interesting also when we sat with uh Michael Shrewsbury that San Notre Dame team still got to adjust not having Marcus Burton out there is a primary ball hander and initiator for guys like Serta and Shrewberry And so what youll see is youll see Harelson more on the ball because hes a guy that can break the paint and create for those other guys but theyre definitely going to need them to be able to go and get a bucket themselves Big vacancy by Marcus Burton Preseason all ACC first team averaging 199 points And a big three there again for Florida State Florida State doing a good job of rotating that ball shifting the zone and you get Wiggins with an uncontested three right now Three ball is falling early for Florida State Notre Dame still struggling to get a clean shot Great defense cheering by Florida State Harelson worked his way in but couldnt get that one to fall for the Irish as McCrae goes to work into the paint Somerville out on the floor early skip pass and another three That great skip pass over from Wiggins over to McCrae Florida State doing a good job because you see Notre Dame cutting off the gaps not allowing him to pitch to paint Good cover Get that three ball Florida State off to a hot start already Three threes back to Tal Serta when he has the open shot normally high percentage from three for him Three on the way there and Brady Kaylor couldnt get that one to go and McCrae quick three on the way is good Rhythm shot by McCrae Florida State comes out rowing Open up this game 122 force Notre Dame into transition and you get those threes up early Thats one of the things thats really helping Florida State out the gate and making the shots Driving in kicks it back out Harelson cheering the freshman working on the veteran Shrewsbury loses the handle and it goes the other way And Florida State came out of that timeout showing Notre Dame a two3 zone And again you saw that last time Braden Shrewsberry did a better job of trying to get to the paint but you have to make sure that you do not turn that ball over McCree driving in The turnaround fourfooter doesnt go Offensive rebound though Wiggins is going to go for three Its good Wow Wow They have come out They are smoking Best time to shoot a three is an offensive rebound Someville allows him to get the ball out Wiggins knocked down his second three of the afternoon And off ball foul Looks like were going to potentially get McCrae on that one McCra of town Yep man coming out How about Florida State These last two games they were 13 for 51 from three in the last two Right now theyre five for six Talk about somebody thats been giving up some shots man But they have come out and definitely started out Notre Dames got to find a way to penetrate their defense You dont want to be just held on that perimeter Few times theyve been able to break the paint but you got to get something rolling All 15 points have come from outside the arc as Notre Dame continues to try to work the paint and mishandled up top and Harelsons going to put it up from a long ways away That one off the right side of the rim and a fight for the rebound and a foul Looks like that ones on Tomas Bon his second personal foul Rick youve seen these empty possessions by Notre Dame A lot of his Florida States ability to be able to guard the ball Theyre not forcing any kind of help He said last time coming out of that that trap on the baseline And Harelson is going to get called for the charge Great defense by Bassang He was able to stay in front of him And what you see watch this next play right here We talk about Florida State and their ability to to guard their yard and the on ball defense Its just the fact that you doing that that allows everyone else to stay home Little bit of pressure put on Florida State against talked about the pace of play that were seeing out of the Simols as they work the ball around They will get shots up quickly Wiggins for three that one off the front of the rim a little short and the ball kicked out of bounds and it looks like theyre going to say it went off of hims foot and goes out of bounds and so itll be Florida State ball and aggressive defense by Somerville in that back back court You see for Notre Dame theyve got to find a way to just to calm down right now Florida States got them on their heels the fact that they are playing uptempo defense and theyve got this three ball going Got a nestling get a couple of stops trying to get something in transition Four turnovers already for Notre Dame and for the first time were seeing FSU in the paint and Wiggins a little turnaround lefthander go And thats that skill set by Wiggins When they put him at the five it gives you an opportunity of a guy that can get down in the post Youve seen him already knock down the three Shows his versatility 140 run in the last three 15 in counting cheering Sbury looked too much pressure Couldnt get the shot off Mohamd driving in and kicks the ball out Harrelson off the glass doesnt go and a foul on the rebound And weve talked about Wiggins and the fact you see on the post up down there gathering himself understand that he get right there and knock down that little midrange little jump hook there Hes off to a good start We talked about the fact that Braden Shrewberry is celebrating a birthday You also got Wiggins with his birthday as well Yeah pretty rare to have two Big three there Great ball movement by Notre Dame You shift the defense from Florida State and you wind up getting Braden Shrewberry a wide open three cheering Jewsberry on his birthday Hits the first three for Notre Dame Somerville Hes more of the vocal leader for FSU Ball gets kicked around into the corner and now its going to be over the back Jaylen Crawfords going to get called for that one Sorry Yeah And watch the pass out on the double team You swing the ball get it out of double team Understand you got an advantage you get over Braden Shrewsbury and again thats one of the things that youre going to watch this Florida State team that theyre going to be committed to every time that ball gets into the corner theyre going to trap that ball for Notre Dame has to be resilient and make sure that they make that crosscourt pass cheering and make them pay Harelson looked like he slipped as he was making the turn and goes to the floor Missed opportunity by Harelson He was able to turn the corner had a straight line drive and then slipped there Missed opportunity for him You see him come out of the game and serve comes back in Harelson really impressive as a freshman and maybe overshadowed by the other freshman in the ACC this year but Harelson is a standout Yeah absolutely 15 points a game fifth among ACC rookies It may not seem like a lot but when you look at the talent pool as far as rookies in the ACC he definitely is a hooper Joes backing him down And now Somerville for three Its good And Somerville is another one of those guys Good defense by Susberry Good defense Better all in that sense Florida State already team that averages about 10 makes a game have already got six early in this first half kicks it cheering over Shberry drives in Jump stop loses a handle Big drive by Logan I but that ones rejected and just graces the front of the rim So Mohhamad not able to get that one to go Going the other way Bon drives in kicks out and Somerville looking for a second three It doesnt go now Shrewsbury a little bit short as well Offensive rebound and the put back got to the bottom of the backboard FSU slows down for just a second The drive into the paint is good And what set that play up was that you finally got the ball inside the steam Force the defense to concern uh converge in you get out the song He puts the ball on the floor Florida State right now been able to get whatever they want on the offensive end 17point deficit and chipped away there just a bit Nice little floater puts it to 227 in a kick though We set And on that note were below the 12minute medium We will sit up straight They had It looked like it was almost like stained glass windows in that thing I mean beautiful Theyve got pristine lights and alter It was beautiful But there is a lot of snow and a lot of cold here in South Bend right now And its almost converting to their offense They have not heated things up on the floor yet Jones kicks it into cheering the paint ands going to drive in One second on the shot clock It doesnt hit the rim and shot clock violation for FSU And one of the things for Notre Dame is just youre going to get back into this with your defense because again Florida State has been able to get the three ball going and then the points music off of turnovers One of the things we talked about with Notre Dame got to keep those turnovers down already eight points off of Notre Dames five turnovers You got to find a way to get some efficient uh offense rolling Easier said than done because Florida States done a good job of locking down that paint Drives in little jumper It wont go FSU bringing the ball down He sees Steen going blocked What a block by Notre Dame Great recovery by Mohamd to be able to get down and block You see great pass over the top Get him wide open And thats what you have to do You got to find some way generate some offense Two great plays Sir Mohamd starts it on one end and then you get tout a wide open shot thats going to get this Notre Dame fan base involved Crowd got a little bit louder there as Tout was able to slam it down and the three on the way No good for Chanty Wiggins And the Irish come back and Cruzberry looked and thought about it for a second IMS puts the three up off the back of the rim A good transition defense by Florida State Great body awareness there from McCrae to fifth but he cant make the little jumper go Shrewberry sets the offense back up Notre Dame their last home game here against 17th ranked Virginia and remember they started off up 19 against them but have struggled here and looks like a foul on the rebound as probably going to be called and again we talk about the plays watch this play and recovery by Cern Mohamd to go ahead and stop that basket and then you go on the other end Notre Dame does a good job of being able to find tout wide open He finishes at the rim and those are the plays that Notre Dame is going to need to do You got to get some stops on one end and find another way to generate that def that offense down there And shot selection is going to be key for them because a lot of times for for Florida State they blow up your first and second options and dont allow you to be able to get what you want For Notre Dame you got to be disciplined and continue to ball move and break that paint Jones into the paint and that shots blocked And Notre Dames bringing it back up the court Sera nice pass And that one gets blocked Man what a play You sat back and you watched what looked like it was going to be a wide open dunk You see Sir Mohamd comes up with a huge block And on the other end Swinton says Not in my house Were not allowing that Got you got to like the pace that both teams are playing with See that one stolen by McGee and he finishes at the rim and McGee did a good job of playing that passing lane comes up and what youre going to see as far as they going to try to blow up those passing lanes and try to get you to turn the ball over and nothing doing there Harelson trying to get the shot off It gets blocked The fastest growing cable news network in all of television is NewsNation NewsNation respects all Americans and is news for all Americans To find news on your screen go to newsowcom As we back under the play and Mohamad Im guessing a couple guys are a little shell shocked right now It has been hard to get a shot off in the paint as a lot of block shots and were seeing there maybe a hand by Robert McCree The fifth off tout Thats music going to be his second foul A mismatch in size there And the best way for you to get to involved especially the way Florida State is playing a little pick and roll option You see that last time Sir Mohamd since hes come in has really given this uh Notre Dame music team a shot in the arm on both ends of the floor Cals one of those guys thats not going to give you a lot on the strong post up but the pick and roll and the slip is where youre going to be able to find him Johnsons free throw Missing Long He has one rebound in this game That puts him at 1299 career rebounds And the three is good for Wiggins And Wiggins is like you know happy birthday to me man Because again you can tell hes come out here hunting his offense Florida State doing a good job of being able to pick and pick and roll occupy two guys and get him another wide open shot Tout Kaylor inside it looks as though a foul on the play You have Kaylor down there realizing he had a smaller defender on who was able to gather himself and be patient And one of the things that for an aggressive team defensively like Florida State you get them in early foul trouble and you can get them into the bonus give you an opportunity to get some easy ones at the free throw line And for a team thats struggling offensively you get a couple of them to go and it makes it a lot easier to maybe get some type of offensive rhythm That foul was on AJ Swinton his second as Kaylor at the line And hell miss the first of the oneonone Somerville running the offense now for FSU Pass inside Turnaround jumper No good for Chanty Wiggins Notre Dame with the basket Harrison right to a finger roll Great move by Harrison coast to coast realizing the best time to attack that Florida State defense is get them downhill before they set up Good move and finish by Harrison Three ball on the way for Bung Not going to go Second time youve seen some good good challenge by Kaylor Yeah Somerville shot is blocked Kaylor oneonone goes straight into Kobe McGee and the foul See right now Kaylors at the line for free throws If youre Notre Dame you want to continue use your defense to try to try to get in that early transition music and attack Florida State before they can set up their offense I mean their defense And you have to continue to try to find ways to kind of get to the paint And he makes the first end of the one and one So Kaylor who is a 697 free throw shooter got his first career double double against Virginia 16 points 10 rebounds Starting his sixth straight game today Found it interesting when we were talking to Luke WS and he was talking about how he wants his guys to come out and not necessarily look to get up threes but to let the defense dictate their offense And youve seen that in this first half is that when you play really good defense you see Harelson out in transition Shrewberry quick three Its off the front of the rim brings it down Florida State doing a good job being able to close off those defensive possessions with the rebounds Some of the things that Locks always emphasizes as well Three on the way once again And that ones a little short Cruz with the rebound Harelson slowing the pace down a bit And theyre going to call the foul there on Martin Somerville His second personal foul And this is where you miss Marcus Burton because in a game like this is that when you need a guy to be able to break down a defense and get in and force the help now Harelson has been that guy for Notre Dame because again youve got the other guys that are sitting around and basically waiting for him to try to create already into the double bonus and Harrison makes the first of two And what youve seen too is that um the better defense that Notre Dame was able to play you know that Florida State is not going to maintain how hot theyve been from behind the three So you continue to challenge get those possessions Youre already in the bonus right now and then you use your defense and then you wither away at this at this lead right now But your defense for Notre Dame has got to be the thing thats going to get back into Harelson with four points Shrewsbury right now leading Notre Dame with five Florida State goes to work Somerville driving in loses a handle Drives again kicks it outside Three on the way and it is good for AJ Swinton And great play by Somerville with realizing that he can get baseline force that help gets the ball over to Swinton And again Florida State continue to generate those threes And that skip cheering pass went into row two of the crowd We talked about in the beginning one of the keys for the Irish is the fact that you got to make sure that you do not have those turnovers And thats one of the things thats really been hurting them is that you have to be more disciplined and value the rock Florida State leads the ACC in forcing turnovers Somerville working cheering and moving the handle but hell be fouled on the way to the rim You see Somerville over there he and Harrison doing a little chirping Somerville is one of those guys man that hes going to bark at you Thats how he uh he plays Hes an aggressive player on both ends of the floor And you can see when McCrae comes out of the game he he takes over and he leads this Florida State team on both ends as far as how hes able to lead cuz Lou says that hes more of a vocal one as Steam throws the threefooter up there It doesnt go Gets his own rebound and Ill say the possession is going to stay with Florida State Watch this last little hustle down seeing a lot of grabbing down there You got both teams understanding this is important game Somerville saw an open steeen and theyre going to call foul on it Oh wow That nice rotation by Mohamd Looked like he was a little late Hes going to get whistled for that foul And what you wanted to you know Steen is going to be one of those guys Watch the dive right here Somerville does a good job And watch Sir Mohamd right there Oh that was a close one looked like he knew his hands on the ball Its got to be frustrating because he was right there Yeah Steam rebounder for Florida State and hell knock down the first this Tuesday on NXT The women face off to see who will be the next challenger for the womens championship Tune in to see who comes out on top and well get a shot at music the title Thats Tuesday 87 central right here on the CW And the second one for Steen is good and hell go take a break as Thomas has come back in for Komas So Mohhamd drives in and the floater is good And a nice move by Mohamed He was able to make Somerville pay for that reach once he got by him Realize hit that paint Got that little floater to go by Mohamd this first half has done a good job for Nordane Ball away Two doesnt go cheering And Shrewberry bringing the ball up the court Notre Dame needs to score Good pass inside to Tower Hes got to kick it back out Shrewberry three on the way Its short Somerville going to get it up the court quickly Jones trying to split the defenders and hell be fouled on the way in We see Kaylor and Shberry a little late to try to lock up the ball on Jones But then again we talk about for you notane Watch the fact that you see Mohamd was able to get blow by Somerville rotations a little late and thats what you got to get more of if youre Notre Dame and again contributions from Sarah Mohamd since hes come in Hes had definitely made an impact on both ends of the floor As far as fouls go thats only the fifth foul on Notre Dame So great pass inside to Wigan We show we saw that in in the open in fact that McCrae does such a good job of being able to thread the needle that last play Great read to get with Wiggins How about Wiggins already off to a great start right now 13 points And Notre Dame not only do they have to figure out the offense but theyve got to do something on defense to slow this Florida State team down Sera getting locked down at the block Shrewberry separation and that one is good right at the clock Hey great play by Braden Shrewsbury Realized he had the taller Wiggins on him Had to shoot over the trees and then was able to get that one to go as the time and the shot clock going down And McCras three is short Shrewberry hustling down the court Sa is going to throw the three up and that ones a little bit strong but its tipped out by Brady Kaylor And now sort of again for good two for a dollar Best chance to shoot a three is an offensive rebound If you get and 323 to play in the first half as Florida State now a 12point lead over Notre Dame Florida State already putting up quite a few possessions as they are used to again rank in the top 20 in the country as far as number of possessions a game and Wigan shot fall short there doing a better job of tightening the screws defensively step back three and tell you when a guy like Braden Shrewsbury he gives a couple a go you can tell hes starting to fiddle a little Notre Dame now have cut this under 10 A little bit more momentum SL sliding back towards the Irish now 80 run for the Irish and Florida State three on the way and that ones no good Kaylor steals the rebound from Tout Tout already over 1300 rebounds in his career Mohav drives in and hes going to get fouled going to the paint You remember when we talked earlier the fact that for Notre Dame they need to find somebody whos a shot creator and put the ball on the floor Since Sir Mohamd has come into the game hes been that guy You saw that last set Michael Shrewberry understanding put the ball in his hands get a little pick and roll action Hes been able to get downhill Now gives the Irish an opportunity to cut this lead now down to seven Mohhamd a 516 6 free throw shooter but he makes the first Coming up in the halftime show presented by Subaru Love Its what makes Subaru Subaru Its been a busy day on CW Courtzside Saturday Well recap the first two games Weve got a CW womens hoops double header thats coming up tomorrow Well get you ready for those matchups and well have first half highlights and stats And Mohamd second shot will go And you see the Notre Dame now on to something they understand is that if they can tighten up their own ball defense not allow Florida State to hit that that paint and then get those rebounds Now for Florida State keep running your offense Weak point is right there in the center And a run and a passion a huge finish with SW and SW on that backside in that dunker spot You see Steen has done a good job of being able to pass that ball and create that open opportunity Ser looks at the three now drives in Hell cheering kick it out Shrewsbury long three It wont go and a foul on the rebound Huge dunk for Quick And weve talked about the fact that what theyve done is that Florida State is able to get that P Watch where it goes up to the opposite side And talk about going up with a pogo stick He plays above the rim Yeah Florida State doing a good job That little pick and roll action right there with Steve you force the help get him right there at the middle and hes done a good job of being able to read right there at that vantage point That last foul by the way was on Carson Tal his second personal McCrae drives in and using the right doesnt get it to go but they get the offensive rebound and the ball is tipped by Notre Dame Its going to stay with MSU 18 on the shot clock Notre Dame will send in Garrick Sundram Sunra in for Tout again Two personal fouls for Carson Toutine giving the ball back to McCrae The fifth and a nice pass inside but intercepted by Mohav Taylor gets the ball back into the hands of Mohav Now Serta drives in Jump stop Taylor looks at a three over to the left side That three is good The servo will have it See the difference now in this Notre Dame offense is the fact theyre doing a better job of being able to break Florida State down Get you a second option You get a wide open three That three tipped on the way in and were going to see a foul on Notre Dame Good defensive possession That last one you and again watch You dont settle right there You break that paint You get Sir Mohamd who the guy has really come in and ignited this Notre Dame offense Another wide openen shot And now what looked like an earlier blowout for Florida State has cut the lead down to only six right now with just under a minute Ste will go to the line Steams first is good Hes a about a 66 free throw shooter That puts the lead back to seven As you mentioned just under 50 seconds remaining in this first half cheering Notre Dame doing a great job of cutting that lead that was as many as 18 down to eight You got an opportunity for a little two for one action here if youre Notre Dame Id go back to that pick and roll action with Sir Mohamd because I think that when you do that that allows you got a guy that not only can go get a bucket for yourself but then its going to force Florida State to have to help and then maybe you get a little kick out because again you still have guys in Braden Shrewberry and Cole Sa that really can knock down a three but you got to get some type of action to break down the paint first Quick drive to the hoop by Mohav and a little too much energy going in there It goes off the glass and into the hands of Florida State Somerville slowing it down 20 seconds on the shot clock 27 26 now for the game clock Someville is going to take this one all the way down as far as shot clock goes The kick out for the three Its on the way It is good Swimming again for three Nice play by Somerville Realize he can get to a point Get the ball out to Swin Double digit lead for Florida State once again Mohamd step back Still a two Its no good the tip in though It looked like before the shot clock was Garrett Sundraft and I think theyre going to count Started the game and Notre Dame is going to hope for a little momentum like they had at the end of that first half Well I think for Florida State you got to get back to the same type of defensive intensity that that you opened up with For Notre Dame youve got something where you realize that you got to continue to try to get downhill and then you got to turn up your defense Its interesting to see how theyre able to start out Harelson nice little layup and Harelson starts off where Sir Mohamd left off Gets inside get that one to go Now again all the momentum for Notre Dame Even though youre down its all in your favor for Florida State You got to find a way to be able to get those threes continue with your offense and continue to be efficient 34 possessions in the first half of Florida State continuing the speed of play that theyre used to This one gets knocked out of bounds 8 seconds still on the shot clock FSU will have make quick decisions here on the inbound McCrae the fifth is going to inbound it Trying to make sure he gets his fit together Make sure you know jerseys tucked in Shorts are right at the right angle Steam tries to drive in Hes got touted on him McCrae the fifth for three Its good Thats a big punt that he was able to size up Harelson that last time didnt get didnt panic 8 seconds A little bit of a jab step and then finishes with a three ball Harelson drives in again and it is good cheering And one Thats a grown man move that last time you had another action going over You occupy three guys from Florida State Then he realizes watch the fact that you see McCrae the third in the fifth Gives him a little bit of a jab step Knocks down that three as the shot clock goes down Then Harelson plays a little bully ball Decides to get Jones down Gets his left hand You heard him say hand one Jay Jones Thats his first personal foul The end one on its way And its good Harrison starts out the half on his mini 50 run there again Interesting to see Can they continue to do that see McCrae the fifth here orchestrating this offense finger roll for Jones doesnt go and a foul as hes into the paint Jones did a good job of being able to read that little playmaking action between he and Ste on that pick and roll defense did not come over and stop him from getting to the paint They were more committed on the roller with Steam going to the basket Ops to go in Now hes going to the line for two Yeah And this is a big foul for Tout Thats his third personal foul cheering for Carson Tout And Notre Dame really needs Tout even though he may not give him a lot of the offense you got to basically make sure that hes the guy thats going to help you with the rebounding and cheering is going to orchestrate as you see point breakdown right here for Florida State Theyve got 30 points off of the threepoint baskets And this is one of the teams that we talked about third in the ACC at 10 makes a game And fullcourt press for Florida State now trying to get Notre Dame out of their ribbon Take a little time off of that shot clock as well Hes down to 15 as they start their offense Great pass to the tout and he cheering makes it and well you saw that Harelson right now has been your primary playmaker They run a little pick and roll action Watch this action right here You see you occupy two guys you get out on the you got on the roll finishes through the contact and thats what you need is that you occupy multiple guys you open up that lane and you get another opportunity in the threepoint basket and LZ loses his leader now with three fouls so he will sit and tout free throw strong not able to be grabbed by Notre Dame and so Florida State will set up the three on the way It is good for Chy Wiggins And great answer You saw Somerville comes in runs that pick and roll action with Wiggins forced to help get Wiggins on the clear out He flares out and knocks down another three Haroldson driving in and hands all over it Pick and roll And then said you saw Wiggins on the slip Late rotation by Shrewsberry and Wiggins is shown You give him an opportunity to get that three ball up He has been rolling already Four threes this afternoon Florida State now with two players with three fouls has come out the song also his third personal and and you knew that one of the ways that Notre Dame was able to get back into the game They got into the bonus early using that aggression You see yet another foul by Bong Thats his fourth Thats his fourth And what Notre Dame has done is that being aggressive youre breaking down that Florida State defense And now what it is is that youre forcing Luke Laws to go into his bench right now with yet another starter in foul trouble And they said they switched that other one to Steen And so that now is his third foul for Tamas Pong And Steam got his first earlier And Rick what you see is that coaches make adjustments And so Michael Shrewsbury understands is that what they have to do is try to put Florida State in more pick and roll action Force the help Certus three no good And bodies on the ground trying to grab it Notre Dame gets it back Harelson drives in and its good And you see momentum to start in the favor of Notre Dame You get that little You get that next steal right there Harelson comes out already Seven points to start out the half Someville gets it down to Wiggins Wiggins working Carolson and thats ones going to go and thats tough You got you you got Chanty Wiggins that hes shown that he can shoot the three ball and on one end of the floor you see both teams fighting for it and then Harelsons come out and he is a man on a miss and finishes and then on the other end you give the ball to Charie Wiggins and I like the fact that hes able to play through the contact and Wiggins right now hes showing his skill set a guy that can go out knock down the three giving the ball in the paint cheering an opportunity to be able to carry this team right now extend this lead up to 11 threepoint play converted for Wiggins and as you mentioned 11point lead now for Florida State You see Sir Mohamd back in the game who talked about the fact that he was one of the guys I thought they really impacted that first half and allowed Notre Dame to get back into the game Shrewsberry three And again you watch you see Mohamed occupying two guys that you saw Shrewberry on a little bit of that slip allowed him to be able to get that that action that three ball going for him And a lot of times that used to be Marcus Burton that was creating those open shots And thats the thing is that Mohamed since hes come into the game his ability to turn the corner makes you have to hedge out on him Hes occupying guys And then what you do you run that action between he and Shrewsberry and then Braden Shrewberry gets a uncontested three A lot of fouls to start the second half That was the third foul on Brady Kaylor Somerville looked at the three now An open three It goes on the right side of the rim In that last possession you force Florida State to keep it out on the perimeter They werent able to break the paint Now opportunity for Notre Dame Id go back to that pick and roll action Involves Sir Mohamd because hes been one of those guys created a lot of mismatches Closest Notre Dame has been to Florida State today with six points Theyre eight right now Shrewberry driving into the paint kicks it back out A wide open three It doesnt go Offensive rebound Shrewberry Another chance It wont go Somerville grabs the rebound and were going to see who this is out on against this Florida State team Theyve been able to do a better job of running their offense and then they got some stops Now look at Florida music State and what theyve been able to do is that you have to continue to put pressure on that paint Get down to your third options and again Wiggins is that dude as you see him curling and shoot that three That one wont go But Wiggins right now leading scorer for both teams at 19 points Sir Mohamed He was making a difference in the first half Serta works his way in the defense Shrewsbury there Three over the way is good How many times have we seen in this second half Florida State does a good job of making a great defensive possession You get a kick out and it leads to a a Braden cheering Shrewberry knockdown three Happy birthday Braden as now McCrae tries the three It wont go It cheering and applause gets tipped out of bounds and the officials are going to say it stays simol Great defense by Florida State Florida State cannot come up with it Sandre kicks it out to Braden music Shrewsbury He knocks down that three again One of those guys that you know that he is streaky He has gotten an opportunity to get that three ball to go And now youve got Notre Dame to cut this down to five Cruz with 16 already in the game Nice move by McCrae the fifth but it wont go and Notre Dame on the attack This is the closest the game has been since the start of six2 guy Thats the guy they need to get going Serta nice pass inside and that is good for Derek Sundra Sundra did a good job of being able to shield off and seal Somerville start to realize he was able to get the defender right now You got this fan base for Notre Dame but theyre definitely deep into it now on their feet here at Notre Dame Nice pass inside cheering the block Swinton tries to do the reverse It gets tipped and now Notre Dame with an opportunity to tie it His plays would have erupted if if Co had knocked that one down Grab the ball Youre standing out of bounds That was Sir Mohamd trying to get that one back in play Heres the thing for Florida State You got to maintain your composure You understand that you were up by 18 at one time and now youve allowed Notre Dame to get back into this game Get back to what was working for you Little pick and roll option Make sure you maintain your spacing and your shot selection has got to still stay on point 80 Notre Dame run has got them within three McCrae the fifth drives in It wont fall but a beautiful tip there by Alex Ste Ste did a good job realizing the McCrae fifth in the fifth was able to bring up two guys Crashes the offensive glass See Florida State falling back in what looks like a two3 zone Little floater there but Mohamd is good Mohamd did a good job realizing that Stain was too far in the basket Got that little floater Was really surprised that he was that wide open Somerville driving in has to kick it back out Three on the way No good And once again Notre Dame with an opportunity to tie it up You see that zone a little bit of that that middle is wide open right there If youre Notre Dame you want to continue to try to get the ball in the middle Hines working on steam Fall away Its too strong And that one gets knocked out by Mohhamd Itll be FSU ball And McCrae holding his hand after that Maybe Mohamd got a little bit of the hand as well Well next Saturday NASCAR returns for a brand new season and a new partner when the OReilly Auto Part music Series races into historic Daytona International Speedway Its 33 weeks of Pure Raw Racing which begins next Saturday from Daytona at 400 pm Eastern 100 pm Pacific only on the CW this lineup that Florida State has Gray the fifth is the guy that you want to try to put the ball in his hands because he can go create a shot get downhill Hes doing just that and throws it up Fouled on the way up Jaylen Harelsons going to get called for that foul If we take a look at the field goals what what stands out is that you you see that Florida State beginning you know five for seven early and it seemed that Notre Dame couldnt find a way but then the second half kind of flipflopped a little bit Got eight for 14 for Notre Dame And so you see McCrae the fifth knock down that free throw Harold Go Im sorry Go ahead I was going to say Harelsons got to leave the floor He got four personal fouls now So thats a tough one Thats a tough one Big hit for Shrewsbury Coach Shrewsbury that is cheering And McCrae the fifth misses his second free throw Huge momentum shift for for the Irish Theyve been able to find some easier ways to score Mohamed working the right side trying to back down to Song And a nice little turnaround doesnt go McCrae quick ball in the hands of Somerville Three is good And that play was the pace by by McCrae The fifth push that ball in You force Notre Dame have to get back and that allows Somerville to walk right into that wide open three Shrewberry Nice little move inside by Hines Nice jump stop by again Shrew was there to freeze the defense as he gets it over the Ives Its downhill McCrae kicks out and Bang is going to hit a three And McCrae McCrae the fifth was able to get down force that defense to go ahead and and help Asan gets that another three Florida State starting to pick it up a little bit Now its an eightpoint advantage Long three on the way It is good for Cole Sera Sera is the dude that you need Youve already got other guys stepping up and Mohamd and Shrews bear Certs one of those guys had a careerhigh against Virginia 34 Need him to start cooking Nice pass inside and a foul before Alex Steam could get get back into this game And theres a lot of games to be played I mean 10 minutes 55 seconds to go in this second half as Steam goes to the line to shoot two Knocks the first one down youve seen since McCrae the fifth has come back in Hes been able to steady the ship for Florida State because again we talked about how dynamic he is as a scorer but then his ability to be able to occupy the defense at last time you get steam involved You create opportunities for Wiggins and then Florida State again continue to to maintain this lead but you look at Notre Dame they found something and how theyve been able to break down Florida States defense Logan Irons gets it across the timeline but heavy pressure by McCrae And this could be a huge foul Fourth foul for Rod McCrae the fifth And if if youre Rod McCrae Rob McCrae the fifth you got to understand you want to have aggressive defense but you got to defend without fouling because now you go on the bench and we may not see him until maybe the under five minute mark Yeah And he is valuable uh leading scoreer leading assist for Florida State and hes going to be on the bench for a while Nice pass for three No good Tout of course with the rebound and hell be fouled trying to get the ball out of his hands Alex Ste gets that foul his second Tout sets the screen Balls back in the paint Serta gets it to Tout He cant handle it And a turnover goes to FSU Active hands by Florida State Didnt allow you to get that ball over to TA You know thats the first turnover by Notre Dame in this half And theyve done a good job of taking care of the ball Now Somerville driving in Hell kick it out McGee will fade away It doesnt go and Notre Dame with the ball back in their hands Shrewberry thought three He sees Sa wide open Gets it cheering That last play you had two You had two defenders go over to Brden Shrewberry He realized that you had Cole server right in the corner We talked about that was the guy that you needed You see another foul get whistled It seemed like that may be called on Truthberry Yeah First foul for Braden Shrewberry Watch this last play Watch the two guys that decide to go out to Brad Shrewberry But if you get the guy over there and Cole Sha that you understand you got to make sure you get over to him And again we were talking about that for Notre Dame You needed him to show up And in this second half hes starting to get a little bit of a rhythm with that three ball Sort of impressive from outside the arc And the three on the way for FSU Its no good cheering Shrewberry looking already trying to speed it up for the Irish Sort of wants to see what Shrewberrys got and might have been tipped Nope its not Kaylor throws that one out of bounds Last time Kayla comes up there holding his hand Missed opportunity for Notre Dame Could have cut that lead down to as as much as one from Florida State Im trying to find a way to get Chanty Wiggins a touch with the lineup that he has out there you know that hes an inside outside threat Jones drives cheering in Oh slams it on the right side Or or that may work Jones will either give it to Wiggins or Jones can slam it down Jones realized he had a little bit of a runway right there and he goes up to the upper room Yeah that elevator went up Shrewberry working from the top Kicks it out to Serta Serta again for three Yeah I love that action right there Shrewsbury is able to get by his man The defender goes to help You see Jones again comes up with another big play and Jones very impressed He got the ball knocked out of his hands on the way to the basket Was able to regroup grab it and put it in Yeah hes real strong when he gets down the hill Gets that momentum hard to stop Serna on fire That one wont go Kaylor with the rebound but a foul You see T on the floor Well see who this one was on Chanty Wigginss third personal foul Touts going to go to the line And thats one of the reasons why Tout is so valuable because again you may not see his in terms of points his ability to be able to rebound and set screens creates a lot of opportunity because you know down there he is going to throw his body around and youve seen since hes come back in you understand hes already in foul trouble but I like the fact he continues to hustle I think he tried to bank that free throw you know what I didnt want to say anything about that one I saw him in warmups earlier he was he did bank a free throw in he muscled that one up Somerville kicking it back out The song now and the ball stolen Another turnover for FSU This one tipped and it goes the other direction Great hand by Somerville Allowed the song to be able to get back I thought Notre Dame had advantage of five on four Wiggins three on the way And bad shot Bad shot by Wiggins He hadnt had a touch in a while And thats a guy you know leading in offense in scoring You want to make sure that shot selection still got to be you got to have that discipline offensively Bruceberry taking a breath now as we get to 720 to play in this one Sort of ball in hands again He tries to drive in a lot of contact No call and call jump ball Possession goes run that he had to be involved in this offense and scoring and sure enough he was listening Well the foul trouble that Florida State has had is allow uh Notre Dame to do a better job of breaking down the defense And so if youre Florida State you got to continue And you see Jones cant come up there But I love the fact that hes out there battling And another offensive rebound Three on the way No good Florida State winning the rebound battle here And looks like that one might have been out of bounds before Wiggins was able to chuck it back to the top referees are letting both teams play Its a physical game out there It has been you say letting them both play but at the same time weve got a pretty high foul count to start this second half Also guys struggling already with four fouls and McCrae the fifth sa kicks over to Shrewberry Shrewsbury three is short Somerville with the rebound Hell bring it up That spacing right there You see Wiggins has got a small irons on him If youre Somerville you got to give him a touch Swim gives it back to Somerville Somerville drives in and that one off the side of the backboard Nice opportunity by Somerville He tried to take Sundra I still would have liked to see him get the ball down to Chanty Wiggins but he had a smaller guy on him Shrewberry has Jones on him Hes so assertive He was trying to angle to get that one up if he could Yeah Kicks out 5 seconds left on the shot clock In and lays it in Well he had in his mind he wanted to get the shot up that last time Gets the kick out Was able to get downhill a finish Hes come alive especially in the second half lead down to three and timeout called cheering and you you got youre handing a little some something coming up dont you That what I was just talking about Looking forward to those 10 weeks of bowling that will be on the CW every Sunday from 4 to 6 You see McCrae back into the game again He sat on the bench for five five minutes right now You see Jones right there too many steps tried to uh tried to take off without putting the ball down And so thats another turnover for Florida State Well see if Not Dane can capitalize Well and you see Luke Box realizing that you know this game is starting to lose his grip right now for Florida State He off he brings back McCrae the fifth If youre Notre Dame you continue to run that pick and roll action Try to get your third option And right now you want to be able to try to get see the good slip right there by Sundra Garrett Sundra got free First one is good Make sure to watch as contestants spell their way to glory or disaster You can catch an all new episode of Scrabble hosted music by Craig Ferguson this Thursday at 87 central right here on the CW Youre a man of many words Bo Im sure Scrabbles right up your alley Hey man And the Scrabble game in an Oliver household is pretty nice Not only were doing it in English were doing it in Italian Italian too Hes pretty pretty competitive there Great move by McCrae He cant finish but its tipped in by Steen Steen has done a good job this afternoon That backside you see a lot of penetration Defense is worried about the ball and he hes cleaning up And now Notre Dame still at that threepoint deficit Clock 430 to go Serta drives in Good by Ste Nice pass to Sundra and timeouts going to be called by Micah Shrewsbury And great on ball defense by Steen to force that timeout and Sha for three to tie the game No you see Jaylen Harlson back into the game Harelson another one with four fouls McCrae the fifth That one tipped on its way but it still goes in And big shot by McCrae the fifth You see a little bit of a back door screen there And again what it is is Florida State still been able to maintain this lead extend it to six Harelson drives in gets fouled on his way to the basket Harrison picked up where he left out before he got that fourth foul Watch this last play Watch this little action right there Decoy as far as Wiggins and you allow McCrae the fifth to be able to flash out Defense was occupied on that roller for Wiggins And that allows McCrae the fifth get that wide open three The song just picked up his fourth foul as Harelson goes to the free throw line for two Makes the first CW courtside Saturday returns next week with a topnotch double header First Georgia Tech clashes with Notre Dame in a matchup packed with conference pride on the line Bill youre going to call that one Then SMU takes the floor versus Syracuse in a battle that could shake up the ACC standing Thats foresight Saturday double header next week starting at 1200 pm Eastern We talked in the open about you know as you couldnt see the game as you see Harrison knock down that you know youve got the upper echelon of teams you know trying to fight for top four position so he can get that buy But then you got that that bottom rung of team that theres a a lot of teams trying to make sure that they can finish in that top 15 And right now this game as we get under four Huge game for both teams See great move by affairs but he couldnt come up with it Now Notre Dame an opportunity to cut into this lead even more Harelson all the way into the paint but kicks it back out to Serta And now theyre respecting Sertas range guarding him 10 ft past that threepoint line Shrewsbury for Serta Serta driving in fade away is good with a great play He was able to get could get down the hill but then was able to redirect a little bit Got that separation Now you see the Irish right now cheering right at the three minute mark You see the fans right now only down two Three on the way Its no good Notre Dame with the ball Harelson all the way to THE BASKET OH SLAM UP TO TIE cheering it up Tie game Harelson was able to get down realize that McCrae the fifth realized cheering he had four fouls and only make a swipe at it 237 to play McCrae all the way to the basket It wont go but hes fouled on his layup Right now you see McCrae the fifth did a good job We knew right now that for his last play his own rebound This is Jaylen Harelsons fifth personal foul And you see Harelson on one side was able to get it And now what it looks like is that hes whistled for Smith after him finishing that basket So Notre Dame needing Harelson on the floor and he fouls out of the game as they had just tied it up and McCrae cheering the fifth will go to the free throw line to shoot two A 678 free throw shooter makes the first Swintons going to take a breather cheering You cheering Yep You back to two You and I knew coming into this game that even though the the records for both team in conference play didnt reflect it we knew that this was going to be a really good game because you got two teams that are much better at playing a lot better than what their records are showing Dealing with adversity And Shrewsbury thought about the three A long one in front of him He drives in kicks it out Im for three this time And the foul Talk about the momentum shifter right there Huge foul I think it might be on McCrae the fifth And shrew up He fouls out of the game Watch this penetration right there You see Ives realizing McCrae in fifth comes out challenges and gives Logan Ives an opportunity for a fourpoint play Good recognition by Braden Ruthberry You see the challenge you always taught Dont foul a threepoint shooter And then you see McCra fifth goes out in the challenge Definitely gets him with opportunity to extend this lead to two Notre Dame the first lead of the game and it comes at 207 remaining Huge blow for Florida State because I thought that McCrae the fifth when he came back in was able to give them that that sense of offense Now Logan IS gives Notre Dame an opportunity for what I think is their first lead Now theyre one up This is to make the lead two He cant convert And now two minutes to play If Im Florida State Im trying to find Chelsea Wiggins right now Someville is a guy that can make a shot but Wiggins has got to get a touch for me Hands in the Wiggins does it on Q Bam And again you know great great redirection Someville was able to occupy and you get the ball right over to Wiggins and knock down that three to allow Florida State to reclaim that lead cheering Florida State back up by two Shrewberry drives in Jump stop Clock at 10 cheering Shrewsbury for three Its strong Notre Dame with the rebound Tries to kick it over to Shrewberry and Swinton steals it Florida State up by two A minute 13 to play If youre Florida State the clock is your friend You continue to run that pick and roll action Again I go back to the place where I go you know that you can get a bucket from Wiggins either on the perimeter or even maybe a switch and a post up Somerville letting him know with 6 seconds to go on the shot clock He puts it up Its tipped Notre Dame with the rebound Good contest by by I right now you got three guys you can go to a bucket Serta I shrewberry I drives in all the way to the basket He cant make it go Florida State with a rebound They scrap on the ground cheering And its going to go the other way Logan IMS a little upset with himself Im not sure if the refs missed a call right there Looked like that ball had gotten up on the glass Watch this penetration by Logan Ims Hes able to get there Id have to see a different angle but good help by by Jones Florida State ball Theyve got the advantage 7775 And heres the thing If youre if youre Notre Dame you dont have to foul You got 39 seconds on the clock You can play defense and still come up with a stop And if youre Florida State you dont want to play scared here Obviously ball security and hoping his team can hold on to this twopoint advantage trying to inbound the ball Fullourt pressure by the Irish If youre the Irish you make sure you defend without fouling You make sure that you dont allow them to get anything on the backside Florida State if youre Somerville you got to make sure you get this ball And the last thing you want is a turnover under under the basket Taylor at 610 trying to obstruct the view of Somerville That one gets tipped out by Notre Dame Good defense by Sir Mohamd not allowing Thomas Wiggins to get that ball again Theyre checking to make sure the clock ball was touched before it got tipped out So 392 seconds on the clock Theyre saying thats right Florida State inbounding ball to Wiggins and Notre Dame fouls right away You see right there they they opt to f foul Jones Jones a 75 free throw shooter That one that foul on Sir Mohamd Lets take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance Progressive offers 247 protection when you bundle auto home and motorcycles and more at progressivecom And one of the two birthday boys today Chanty Wiggins has come out and had an allaround game with an inside outside knocking down the three ball Talk about effective his skill set A guy that can do a lot for this Florida State team on the afternoon 22 points Jones missing the free throw and Theyre going to say maybe a line violation there a lane bail violation It looks like it might be a foul right now Seems like theyre whistling That foul might be on Vong right now If thats Bong its his fifth Five fouls for Tomas Bong And so hell foul out of the game Okay Now and you realize 36 seconds now You got talent that we know is not a a really good free throw shooter And if Im Florida State I am making sure that I box out because the one thing you cannot afford is for Notre Dame to miss that and get a tap out for someone from Notre Dame to be able to get a wide open three Mohamads on the lane again Tout at the line to shoot two As you mentioned not his strength from the free throw line 436 6 tried to bank that one again to the game So again if youre Florida State you make sure that youve sent all four guys Youre tell aim aim for the inside side of the side of the square in and out And Florida State grabs the ball but it looks as though Mohamd might foul Jones on that rebound So Sir Mohamd with his third personal foul will send Jones to the free throw line You see Servin come back into the game Mohamd comes out And again you see Jones as you mentioned before that last time unsuccessful at the free throw line Important if you are Notre Dame He misses the free throw You got to make sure that that you lock up the rebound Jones two for three today from the line again Missing the last time he was at the free throw line here just moments ago Important one and one not two shot foul cheering and he makes the first Nice smooth stroke there by Jones Extend the lead to three And Courtney he makes this one because again you make this extend the lead to four youre talking about a twopossession game versus if he misses it still give the Irish to a chance cheering to top And Jones makes it does just that Four points separating Notre Dame and Florida State Florida State 7975 Notre Dame The drive in kicked out Kaylor Kaylor the sixfooter It wont go but theyre going to call goalending He grabbed the ri He grabbed the net And so that ones going to count for Notre Dame And they have pulled back within two And smart play by Kayla You understand that youre down by four You dont necessarily need a three you need a bucket And so now right now you still got plenty of time if youre Notre Dame Florida State you got to make sure you get this ball inbound by Kaylor And then on that backside you watch you see not sure if that was steam that touched the net but right there 24 and a half seconds drawing up the defense 251 is what they put back on the clock Notre Dame has led once today Florida State had an 18point lead in the first half and Notre Dame has continued to fight back But now 21 251 seconds and down two You know that also you you dont want to foul immediately You try to make a a swipe at the ball and see if you can get a steal cheering And foul quick Wiggins is going to go to the line Well see who they call this one on More than likely Braden Shrewberry Wiggins a 89 free throw shooter your lines guy that you want is your leading scoreer guy And again cheering you mentioned hes the best percentage free throw shooter for Florida State and he misses the first I do not I do not subscribe to the to the announcer Jinx I dont either but I wanted to make sure you were the one who said it Oh and he misses both Under 20 seconds now Its 204 seconds to go and 4 seconds to go Down two Notre Dame inbounding Pay attention to Cole Cert in that in that back court and they foul Tower A good move there at the line Smart move because again and Luke logs understands that you know you got a guy tout his struggling from the free throw line that thats really obvious Struggling is a generous word Absolutely So tout will try to shoot two Hes 0 for five today And theyre going to substitute Serta out Heavy play by Aloo Lots to be able to go ahead and and foul t for a second Its long It was tipped out by Taylor State grabs it now Oh that was a close one Sir Mohammed will looked like it could have been a steal Whistled early for a foul Thatll be his fourth foul Lets take another look at this Watch this mix and watch Sir H come out right there May have been some contact on that left arm of Somerville Watch him from the backside Oo that looked like that might have been minimal Yeah very very light contact but that puts Somerville to the line Hell miss his first How many times have we seen for Florida State you could really lock up this game You see Wiggins miss two and now you see Somerville Somerville an 848 free cheering throw shooter He misses his first and the crowd gets loud Knocks his second one down Florida State up three under 15 seconds to play Shrewsbury and hell be fouled And another Luke loss down the first Remember you and I talked earlier that for Notre Dame you want to go ahead and stretch out this game And you see right now that assuming that Braden Shrewsbury knocks down this and you talk about a onepoint game you still force Florida State to get the ball in I make sure that I can get someone in and foul immediately A onepoint game Oh you see the foul by Tal and he he fouls what looks to be it Malu So Steam ends the game with 10 points nine rebounds music Maloo in for Florida State Maloos a 50 free throw shooter And so heres the thing is that youre down by one 9 seconds and you sacrifice tout on the foul Now you put Maloo to have to make two free throws Maloo a 50 free throw shooter cheering First one fall Friendly bounce right there substitutions Were seeing Sir Mohamd come back in the game cheering Serta is coming out applause Did you take Serta out when theyre going to need a three Well I think that Michael Rubberry is telling him if if they can get the ball up he wants a timeout Well how about Maloo comes in money there right before substitution there before they were able to inbound it Youre going to expect this one to go into the hands of either Serta or Shrewberry Mohamed over to Serta Serta for three off the front of the rim No good T back to Shrewberry Truth Fairy IN HIS LONG GO FLORIDA STATES going to win it
