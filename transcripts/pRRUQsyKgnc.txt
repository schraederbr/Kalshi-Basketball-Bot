game leads the ACC and one of the best in the country awesome day of college basketball gets started at 1100 am eastern time 1000 am back in Memphis good to get it started from Little John Coliseum Memphis in the black gets going with Tyrese Hunter PJ Hagerty on the perimeter part of one of the best backcourts in the country going up against a very good Clemson D this is kobby Rogers who can stroke it at 43 from long range and case in point but once again you see the ability by this backourt to stretch it now Clemson is going to have to pay a tremendous amount of attention to the guys Beyond a threepoint R couple key transfers for Clemson in this starting lineup Jaden Zachary from Boston College and Victor lockin from Cincinnati heres Ian shefflin you saw him knocked down three triples in a win last weekend against Miami after hed been cold in the win over Kentucky last week and the starters for Memphis we mentioned the back court youve got hagard the top scorer Kobe Rogers doing it from three and Hunter another one of those transfers for Penny Hardaway also in double figures at 15 a game shot clock below 10 Rogers with the post entry and he threw it away looking for Musa ceis 20 turnovers against Arkansas state did Memphis in you talked about them being ranked number 16 last week but going into that game was a bit of a let down for Penny hardaways group johy Wiggins missed it from Deep yeah they trailed by double figures for 29 minutes of that game Arkansas States first win over ranked team since 1991 talking to his assistant coach Nolan Smith he said they were do for that one they didnt play well against Louisiana Tech their first game back from Maui had a bit of a hangover and it all came into fruition against Arkansas State Hunter Banks one in from three Hunter was one for seven against Arkansas State however I dont think he even attempted a bank shot so thats going to be early morning action for Tyrese Hunter getting it to go early morning holiday hours as well Victor locking wide right and the loose ball secured by PJ Hagerty so a lot of Threes early in this game however Clemson unable to knock one down yet as Memphis has already made two of their threepoint field goals the only baskets made in this game this has been a concern for Brad Brown feels like his team is still a work in progress offensively 2 and 12 minutes without points for the Tigers locking off the bounce on Cay shefflin saved it underneath spinning out of a double good cut Cay the block on Zachary and Jaden Zachary as soon as he saw cay was hesitant to attack the big guy but with a shot clock going down had to Chow Hagerty corner kick Rogers off the bounce against the physical guard Zachary Rogers cant hit and last touched by Memphis well heres Penny Hardaway in year seven and you know we asked him about that Arkansas State game at practice last night we said what were the film sessions like he said I threw that right in the trash they did not watch any of the film from the loss to Arkansas State yeah and again thats one of those games where you really dont want to remember much about it however you need to use it to improve but you can do that on the practice Court in comparison in the film room you said a full week of practice and theyre used to these early starts they have some of that in the American and this is their normal practice time during the week as well 9 or 10 am back in Memphis Chase hunter lost it on the drive and its a turnover for Clemson and Brad Brown s group 16th in the country 9 one overall after the Elite 8 trip last year but they had a tremendous support system in their huge win over Kentucky here on on this home floor about 10 G 10 days ago and now when you consider the students being out Clemson right now looking for some energy that they didnt get theyre not getting get from the crowd that atmosphere was awesome I can tell you I I did the Arkansas Miami game prior to that got back to the hotel watched that game and you almost felt as though you were here in Little John Coliseum the energy was so great yeah that was last Tuesday here Nick Jordan no but an offensive rebound secured by Kobe Rogers jordane on the drive and he draws a foul on the way up and one of the things that youll see early and often from Brad Brownell who starts johnon Wiggins at the small forward position at 610 but when he goes to the bench he goes with three guards and the guard coming in would be Dylan Hunter coming in with that foul against Jordan going to the basket not as good of a rebounding team when you put the three guards on the floor for Clemson however they have to have that to match up with the sides and speed of this Memphis back court so the fifthyear senior Nick Jordan good on the first for Penny hardaways team like we said ranked 16th last week because they were really the surprise of a loaded Maui field that you saw they absolutely were I mean you start off in game one of the tournament overtime victory over number two then ranked Yukon and a game that Penny Hardway team actually led by 13 with 3 minutes left allow Yukon to get back in it but was able to take away the momentum in overtime and Come Away with the win then beat Michigan State on the next night before losing to Auburn in a championship game theyre up eight zip in the first four minutes on the road post entry for Ian shefflin averages the double double banging with jordane shefflin tough shot wont go and then lock in is the last to touch Applause it well you mentioned threepoint shooting right away and Memphis has already knocked down a couple from Deep theyve knocked down a couple from deep but the unconventional way Tyrese Hunter going glass from the left facing wing and then Musa ceis coming up with a huge rejection against Music JayZ one loss to this point was against Memphis at Memphis now when they have been nine and one it was a sweet 16 back in 20178 last year Elite eight run this Clemson team has a chance to be one of the best in the ACC if not the best this season only loss this year so far at Boise State couple of weeks into the season good interior feed and it popped out on jordane and jordane going to be called for offensive interference on that possession he wants the interference however its on him as hes going back jordane is up more than high enough just unable to but by hanging on the rim and forcing the rim to move that will be offensive interference take away so done that to what is an8 nothing lead for Memphis and theyll mix up their defenses theyve extended a few times here against Clemson heres Chase Hunter top scorer for Clemson the sixth year senior off to Dell Jones the true freshman getting some early run with a step through that wouldnt go but look at Jordan keeping Ian shefin off the glass you have to know that Penny Hardway and his staff made it very clear youve got to take away his opportunities Hunter quick trigger no dice from deep and right now the crowd here little John getting a little antsy about the fact that the Tigers have yet to score five plus minutes in Dylan Hunter cant end the drought and Dane danger skies for the rebound and youve been waiting to say Dane danger havent you how fun is that danger its going to happen multiple times throughout this game well hes in the action again and he was a foul on Dell Jones you guys refer to him as Penny I call him my friend Anthony however look at the schedule for Memphis and Penny Hardaway coming up the next five games look how important each and every one of these are playing in the AAC is not a one bid League however youre not going to get a tremendous amount of bids from being in that conference as a from at large standpoint so at Virginia on Wednesday having to play Mississippi State who has been very good and then Old Miss to FAU North Texas so a strong slate headed put Penny Hardway in his group Rogers sticks the Baseline jumper off the Baseline out of bounds and its 10 nothing to begin this busy stretch for the Tigers and one of the things that people dont realize even though Memphis shoots the basketball extremely well they are also known for the their defense and theyre showing it here as you see the first May field goal from the Tigers Victor Lockton knocking it in from top of the key 5 minutes and 44 seconds in courtesy of Victor locken the fifth year senior from Russia your math was much better just right there when you were able to subtract 544 from 20 are you surprised cuz earlier today it was not good however what has been good is Kobe Rogers coming off the under underneath out of bounds play knocking down the two and then Victor lockin knocking down the first field goal the threepointer from the top of the key jordane rounding out locking the rebound Del Jones is fast the freshman we mentioned hes Fearless as well hes out there and its a turnover for Clemson so you got to get your glove in the dirt right there you see locking of course seven feet is hard to throw it at his feet but you know you got a lot of baseball in your yeah in your past and your future as well you got to get your glove all the way down on the ground to be able to scoop that one the multifaceted Cory Alexander oh you know Im a big baseball guy hunter on the drive couldnt get it to go Dylan Hunter pushes move for Jake highy breeder came up short known for his shooting yeah thats the guy you want to be able to get that wide open look high breeder shooting over 40 as well from Beyond the arc on the season danger cin for it and he couldnt haul in the pass from jordane we talked with Penny Hardway at practice last night a practice in which he spent the entire hour with his two post guys in mus C say in Dan Dana and he feels like against Clemsons front Court of sheflin of guys like lockin that its going to come down to the likes of dja and CE who he wants to be more offensively inclined yeah youve got to put some pressure on those guys and force them to defend you cant just allow Victor Lock and and Ian shein to take the defensive end of the floor off not having to be able to having to challenge them in the front court because you know how important the guard play is going to be from Memphis and just like that on the other end of the floor Clemson is going to put a lot of pressure on you with lockin and shefin especially on the interior still only three points for Clemson seven minutes into this game and once again we see a Zone defensively from Memphis Penny Hardway switching up his defenses trying to keep the Tigers off balance late shot clock for Jaden Zachary the Boston College transfer gets to the midrange couldnt hit and it belongs to Clemson thats a great look for JayZ got to a sweet spot only 10 ft away from the basket just unable to get it to go and thats the type of game has been offensively thus far for the Tigers and as I mentioned the Tigers both these teams are the tigers so I could be talking about either yeah please be specific nope I will not lockin gets it to go off the Baseline out of bounds and Clemson adds two more if Im specific I might be wrong see as long as I say the Tigers Ill be right the entire afternoon or morning which we would say it is right now still is fivepoint Memphis lead Baraka okoi the Canadian George Mason transfer gave it up and a tough pass from Rogers for PJ Hagerty to handle Clemson running underneath out of bounds play the good look into lockin who gets the second field goal of the game for the Tigers and he has all five points for Clemson thus far as Memphis has doubled them up however neither team has been great on the offensive end especially handling the basketball to this point we have as many made buckets five as turnovers combined in this game so far sheflin going to work on jordane and Ian sheflin cannot get it to go in its last Touch by Dane danger and shefin disappointed about the fact that he couldnt get that one to go did all the right work to get it on the glass just didnt have the soft touch but sticks with it and by his activity under the basket maintains possession 14 we told you the nations leading rebounder and the ACC player of the week for what he did last week with 20 rebounds in the win over Kentucky and as as the game we started early of course but Im going to tell you that the uh student section has shrunk significantly and when I say that I mean physically they went from you know 18 to 22 year olds so Im guessing five and up yeah okay its like the kindergarten looking forward to seeing this group see to make some noise here in Little John long two doesnt go for Dylan hunter in the rebound haggy Subs in the front court on both sides Cay and dja out there for Memphis and Christian Reeves at 72 the Duke transfer has checked in for Clemson danger going to work coming off a double double with the interior passing to Cay who gave it back oh that is beautiful thats a beautiful pass the touch pass by danger to drop it off for the easy layup but the presence of mine to be able to recognize where the defender is kind of a no look from Cay to start it and then the touch pass from Dane danger yeah you see Cay dropping off danger Just a Touch pass over allowing hagy to get the easy one look who has showed up behind us they were they dancing though it was something going on we got oh there we go there we go lets go we we are having fun here this bun today let me tell you what this is going to be and again I was a little concerned early CU there was no one in the stand as Christian Reed is able to score off the second underneath out of bounds play Im sure thats something Penny Hardy wants to clean up with his defense but when you think about we were concerned cuz there was no one in the stands of course the students are out right now but I think its been an upgrade I believe these guys can make some noise back here I think so too we heard from some folks watching wondering where the crowd was its actually a pretty good crowd its just in the normal spot where the students would be understandably they werent here until now over 2000 students in the section verse Kentucky for a huge win here two Tuesdays ago first points for Dane D yeah another huge test for the Tigers on their home floor sevenpoint lead for Memphis Chas Hunter came around the screen trying to maintain the hand shefin off the shot fake cant bury it hesitated she taking the first one soon as he caught the basketball but look at danger getting out in traffic but another turnover for Memphis thats been the thing thats hampered them throughout the season how about the idea from Brad Brownell lets serve mimosas to the students getting ready pregame why cant we have a tailgate he said not all the students right the ones of it could be the crowd it could be the crowd and the students of age see youre not that far removed as Chase Hunter really just removes Musa ceis from his legal guarding position knocks him out and off balance and this how you have to go at a shot blocker lower the shoulder hard for Cay to be able to get to a maximum jump to defend that opportunity as Chase hunter gets the lefthanded bucket to go and an opportunity for the M1 and thats two on Musa ceis as well a former allconference defensive player of the year so now is Musa ceis at his third stop or his fourth stop in I say third school no okay but his fort stopped okay all right so there you go all right so Musa ceis who started his college basketball career at Memphis then two years at Oklahoma State a year at Old Miss and is back at Memphis to finish his career under the coach Penny Hardway who recruited him out of high school great job defensively by Christian Reeds with the deflection speaking of of age celebrating his 21st birthday today Hunter to the midrange sticks the jumper and its down to two for Memphis we talked about the dynamic dynamic Duos on this these two teams well one part of them is always going to be a hunter whether its Tyrese or is Chase youve got a hunter in each dynamic duo and now Chase with backto back buckets starting to flex his muscle good feed from Hagerty underneath jordane kicked it out back to PJ hag matched up with Jaden Zachary shot clock at four Hagerty got stripped a couple of times danger had to throw it up and a shot clock violation thanks to Jaden Zachary if you want to show textbook defense show that possession from Jaden Zachary slides his feet uses his body extremely well and more importantly does not bail out Hagerty at the end of the shot clock by fouling uses his hands to strip the basketball away not once but twice musis is back in with his two fouls replacing danger for a Memphis team that has now turned it over six times more turnovers than made buckets for Memphis oh and he could not run the Baseline there was not a made shot it was off a turnover so you cannot run the Baseline a violation hands it right back on Chi Wiggins a junior unaware of that a lot of people would miss out on that one though jordane tough finish to add two more for Memphis and the reason why you miss out on it because rarely are you going the other direction and the team is pressing you and is not after a May bucket so Im going to give Chanty a pass on that one and now Clemson back with it Midway through this first half down by four good kick Wiggins can shoot it airballs it with the offensive rebounds go tending and goal tending on mus CE against Jake Hy breeder but how about the fact that Penny Hardway is trusting Musa CE back on the floor with those two fouls still with 851 remaining mus of course extremely important to the success of these Memphis Tigers with that interior defense and Penny Hardway going to trust him to stay out of foul trouble off the pick and roll this is kobby Rogers up top for Hunter shooting it so much better from Deep this year big bucket right there as Clemson has started to gain the momentum but the three PES the pushes the lead to five for the Memphis Tigers do you remember Memphis State I do you do thanks to Penny okay thats the reason jordane pushes oh out of control and an offensive foul on Nick jordane and once again Jaden Zachary doing the job defensively sees Jordan out out of control gets in proper position and see how long hes set up waiting for the offensive foul and today it is difficult to get a charge so when you consider the fact of how long you have to be actually standing in your spot waiting to absorb that contact James zacher does it to Perfection two great clips from a defensive standpoint by JayZ on the last couple possessions pretty clinical stuff from the point guard for Clemson who Brad Brown L says he thinks is an all ACC Defender tough shot Chase Hunter and Chase Hunter could be an all ACC player when you consider his ability to get in the painted area just like that seven points but Chase Hunter after taking about the first eight minutes off from the scoring column hes gotten hot came back for his sixth season hes their number one option Kobe Rogers has an early seven for Memphis Kobe Rogers not just a threepoint shooter showing that he can do it off the bounce as well that high release is pretty yes it is and effective inside of seven and a half to go in the first half Chase Hunter was feeling it offensive rebound Zachry no foul call until late now whos that going to be on Musa CE is in the area theyre going to give it to Nick Jordan and thats his second as well but not the Third on Musa CC well Chase Hunter starting to hunt buckets you see what I did there thats what tigers do especially here in Little John on the other end Kobe Rogers getting to his midrange Music bag spent a lot of time in the state of South Carolina knows a little bit about this area but now finding his footing in the Commonwealth of Kentucky hes always quotable oh yes talking this week about hey life is good theres no stress in what Im doing get free sneakers get to wear sweats to work Im going to Im going to show up one of these days on the sideline with sweats on yeah I know my bosses are listening I know SC is out there hes listen joggers for you uh yeah but you know joggers get a little uncomfortable sitting down for a while yeah I Ill go with bag your sweats and well leave that right there threepoint game coming up on seven to go in the first half from Little John Coliseum off the bounce into the midrange another jumper goes for Kobe Rogers hes been strong to start this game knock down the first three of the game on the first possession for the Tigers and then getting to his midrange multiple times Rogers the leading score right now for the tigers with nine he at witch State last year hes at his fourth school and stop 12 newcomers with any hardways Memphis Tigers this year and still doing a great job getting them to play together good chemistry with this group I saw a lot of that in Maui seven and two the record overall you see Hunter tries again way too strong this time Chase knew that one was off as soon as it left his hand he was already grabbing at his other hand on the release points over to his brother tells him great pass however unable to take advantage of it if Im you know if Im dealing Im like hey man listen Im going need you to take care of that yeah you know thats how I do you Mike mono for me exactly you know Im going to need you to take care of if I if I set you up perfectly and you dont we going to have a conversation about it after yeah your backs going to hurt from carrying me today C underneath against locking still playing with those two fouls left it on the front of the rim but got it back and Rogers left all alone and hes got 11 oh got a soft touch on that one hit the back of the rim kind of wedged in between the rim and the back board but still able to get it to fall locking Cuts working on Cay and finishes with the right hand but smart play by Cay there to make sure he kept his hands out of the cookie jar just put his hands up forth lock in the score over the top seven for Victor Applause locken Hunter Hagerty Rogers jordane and CE the five starters are out there for Penny Hardaway tough shot for Kobe Rogers again and hes cooking but see heres a bit of the penny Hardway NBA experience all right Kobe Rogers is the guy hes got it going hes not their leading score but hes the hot guy right now so of course Penny Hardway looks at as though if its not broke dont fix it keep feeding the hot hand Dylan Hunter left alone and Clemson is one for 11 from deep and they had struggled their last two games from three as well well we talked about how good of a defense defensive team Clemson is guarding the threepoint line however Memphis is showing off their defensive prowess and stopping the Tigers from Beyond The Arc here this morning still haery ran off a screen missed it from deep and Chase Hunter secures the rebound shefflin attacks and finishes thats how you go at a shot blocker Ian shefin looking back saying I want the foul on that one also attacking Musa ceis and finishing with authority for his first bucket of the game we than 15 minutes in a guy who averages 12 and a half a game Rogers comes up to get it with with Dylan Hunter on him Tyrese Hunter wrapped it around for haery and he got fouled that was a great find by Tyrese Hunter on that possession and again you have to have a lot of trust in your teammates and know theyre going to be in the proper spots to make that pass but Hagerty does what he does so well getting to the free throw line where he is an 85 free throw Music shooter hey tomorrow on ABC the 23rd annual womens Jimmy V classic an all ACC Affair this year Louisville hosts number 22 NC State at one Eastern at the KFC Yum Center and remember to donate to the V foundation for cancer research go to vorg speaking of cancer research great news this week our guy Vicky V passed with flying colors his test on Thursday December 12th congratulations to start with Dicky V now let me tell you this after last Saturdays game I get a text message right dont have the number in my phone says thank you for the kind words so I dont know who it is so I text Seth Greenberg and said hey whose numers this he says coach byal I go off Im texting back Dicky B its great to hear from you baby I love this that coach Greenbergs your goto guy who number is this yeah Seth is very valuable hes got a lot of resources Dylan H had the bucket for Clemson fourpoint margin and jordane got tied up underneath and itll go back to Clemson with three and a half to go in the first when we come back I sheflin getting into the scores column the nice find from Chase Hunter and attacking the rack the Finish Clemson trailing by four coach Greenberg I appreciate you and even though we dont have the students we do have well they are students I would say but its more like kindergarten students as well as Elementary School students but Sanda Tiger has now made his way over into the mix with the students its about to get Rowdy behind us yeah the Santa jacket is on as Victor Lock and misses from deep and Ian sheflin could not run down an offensive rebound there he is look at Santa tiger how would you rate the fit oh the fit is nice the fit is very nice and he made his appearance with us earlier in our open but he didnt have the Santa jacket rights and a late arriving Crowd by the way cuz again you know when youre talking about elementary school kids you got to have breakfast its very important most important meal of the day I dont care what they tell you now it Still Remains true from when I was in elementary school you Prov that today you know Im eating breakfast first every day fourpoint Memphis lead inside of three minutes to go in the first half Dane danger with the left hand it rolled off and we got to remind Malcolm huckleby as well its not quite a noon game because its not even noon yet yeah the game started at 1100 am he was talking about his noon games back in the day this is even earlier and the energy picked up significantly for the Clemson Tigers once our younger crowd behind us made it into the building took them forever really to get a field goal on the board but now only trailing for an opportunity to make a one possession game with 238 remaining here in this first half for Clemson team you see ranked 16th in the country at 9 one and Memphis at 72 just out of the polls lockin with a nice move off the shot F and again you get the bucket thats a great possession however Victor lockin had an opportunity there he had Musa CEI flying at him if he steps in shoots the three gets fouled not not only does he get three free throws he sends Musa CIS to the bench with three fouls so again you love the two points but it was a possibility for even more damage Hunter offt Target altered by Dylan Hunter and Clemsons got it looking to tie or take the lead Let It Go not sure why lockin didnt shoot that hes the hot guy right now he has the ability to knock down the three ball but its even better when you see it coming from this guy in SE AK the chef because they Chef hats in the building in Little John right now and the Tigers take their first lead of the game should I say Clemson Tigers cuz the Tigers have led the entire game and will the rest of the way approaching 90 seconds to go in this first Applause half Cay comes up free some space for danger who answers right back strong response by the Memphis side ERS getting the basketball inside testing that interior defensively danger coming off 16 and 12 in that lost Sunday to Arkansas State at FedEx forum lockin got it back Zachary Rises knocks it down Hagerty snakes the screen good dish underneath danger tried to yam on sheflin Locklin ahead of the pack had it blocked by Hunter but how about Chase Hunter not giving up on the play Dylan Hunter no rebounds Cay who goes tumbling and its a foul on Jaden Zachary and Jaden Zachary with his hands on the basketball felt as though he got all basketball in that possession but some great hustle plays on that one alone I believe believe it was Rogers who got back and denied the opportunity getting down the floor from Lock and and then oh thats a great call by officiating crew you see JayZ with his hands around the arm of Musa CE so well get a timeout inside of 40 seconds to go we step aside for 30 and then right back to Clemson Music just come couple big threes for Clemson and theyve got the lead locking passed one up and they got a better one from Ian shein who knocks down the three to get it close and then is JayZ who gives the Clemson Tigers their first lead of The Game knocking down to three from the corner a Clemson team that has been one of the two best teams in the ACC so far to this point in the first month and a half have had to come from behind here in the first half against Memphis a year ago this time I thought that Clemson was the best team in the ACC coming into conference play they lost to North Carolina here early December on their home floor and right now they had the best win a year ago at on the road at Alabama and possibly the best win when you consider the fact that they beat Kentucky here on their home floor even though Duke beating number one aror had to be a pretty good one as well but the only two ACC teams that were able to get a victory in the second annual SEC ACC challenge in the only defeated team by the way in the challenge two years the Clemson Tigers with that huge Kentucky win facing Memphis in this crucial part of the schedule for Penny hardaways team me correct that only undefeated ACC team not sure about SEC teams could be a couple Hagerty no dice from Deep tipped around and secured by Dylan Hunter final 10 seconds Chase Hunter Stripped by Tyrese Hunter who was out of bounds before grabbing the loose ball great h play by Hunter both of them actually on that possession Chase Hunter getting out of transition and then Tyrese Hunter getting back taking the basketball away I can tell you this right now though Mike Monaco as we go to the timeout were most likely going to see a Chase Hunter shot attemp when we come back Ill tell you why when we return Music 6 seconds to go until halftime and thats Chase Hunters time it is absolutely Chase Hunter time in 13 separate occasions over the last two seasons Chase Hunter has made a shot in 13 separate halves so you if youre Brad Brownell you absolutely have to give him the basketball he is Mr in the quarter in the half in college basketball so hes the guy that you want to be able to get a look here with 63 remaining he is always doing this at the end of halves and so on a baseline out of bounds Jaden Zachary Keys it in looking for Chase Hunter and throwing it away to Tyrese Hunter pull up three knocks it down well we said it would be Hunter I might have been a little more specific in Chase however it was Ty those coming in the paint so much basketball still to come second half here then weve got the number two team in the country Auburn at 100 Eastern against Ohio State and then at 300 UCLA in Arizona out in Phoenix glad to have you with us Clemson starts with it out out of halftime and here is lockin matched up with Musa CE a double from hagy in a turnover a great job defensively by CE who played the remaining 851 of the first half without with two fouls and did not pick up that third so give Penny Hardway a lot of credit trusting his senior big man you see the threepoint numbers that you mentioned and that we started the morning talking about three threes from Hunter and a great pick and roll for Musa ceis but the execution by clearing the side so theres no help Defender putting Shooters on the opposite side allows Cay to be able to get the easy bucket long range arounded out and PJ hagard the rebound and the push for Tyrese Hunter Cay the flush and CE attempted to keep locking away from being able to attempt that shot locking making the effort to get back into it but dropping it back to CE who dropped the hammer making his impact already lockin tries to take Cay off the bounce who didnt bite and force the Miss MOA CE with a great first two minutes out of halftime Hunter transition three thats what you call Chase action Hunter kicks to the head to Jordan who doesnt even look at the basket waits for Tyrese Hunter to get back into a spot raises up knocks down at three ball and just like that a 70 run to start the second half for the Memphis Tigers hey hey hey different tomorrow but how about the relationship between the two mus Cay starts his career with penny at Memphis goes on plays two years at Oklahoma State another year at Old Miss and then decides that the best place for him to end his career is back where it all began with Penny Hardway at Memphis Victor locking Strokes of three and the first points for Clemson half time and it seems as though Memphis has decided theyre going to live with lock and knocking down threes because hes gotten a number of opportunities some hes actually hesitated to take throughout this game hagard he couldnt hang and hit and loins got his sixth rebound fivepoint game how about the defensive effort by both Chase Hunter as well as Jaden Zachary both guys doing the job defensively Hagerty well below what he comes in averaging on a nightly basis stuck on three points one of five shooting for the number five scorer in the country PJ Hagerty at 23 a game Chanty Wiggins didnt play a whole lot in the first half as Clemson went small with a lot of Dylan Hunter good pass from lockin but tough to handle for Ian sheflin hey tonight 8 Eastern five Pacific over on ESPN and also on the app the 90th annual Heisman Trophy ceremony Chris Fowler hosting again and we will see who it is I tell you what this is a close Heisman race I mean you you think about a number of great candidates this year I personally think as we see tyres Hunter knock down another three that youre going Hunter Im going Hunter Im going Travis Hunter I believe Travis Hunter is the best player in football right now not only the best wide receiver but also the best defensive back rarely do you see that combination we saw with Charles Woodson back I believe in 1997 you got to award a guy like that that plays on both sides of the ball despite how good Ashton Genty Ashton jents been awesome and again when youre whenever youre flirting with anything Barry Sanders is related to thats next level Tyrese hunter wanted another after Ian shefin had answered for Clemson Jaden Zachary backs it out for sheflin matched up with Jordan and then PJ Hagerty reaches in for his first foul on Q as were talking about Travis Hunter tyres gets in his bag the between the legs the step back the three ball setting us up perfectly to talk about Travis Hunter its been a hunter type of of of afternoon morning into afternoon thus far youre getting your fix I mean we absolutely are Tyrese has a 15 points now all of his buckets from Beyond the threepoint Arc five of seven this is similar to to the way he shot the basketball in Maui where he was all tournament team of the Maui Invitational and a big answer for Tyrese Hunter after he was very quiet in that brutal loss Sunday to Arkansas state locken is struggling with the basketball forcing those passes off weve seen him try to pinpoint a number of opportunities to Ian sheflin that have resulted as turnovers for the Clemson Tigers hes turned it over three times of Clemsons seven hunter lost the handle and it belongs to Applause Clemson but of course whenever you think about a turnover for the opponent Jaden Zachary is going to be in the mix you see JayZ getting his hand in there forcing Tyrese to have to go to the ground out of bounds another turnover for Memphis third for kobby Rogers now shefflin back to lockin and now Chase Hunter top scorer for Clemson this season long one knocks it down maybe we should just say hunter in comparison to even saying first names whether were talking about Chase were talking about tyres or even Travis throughout this game lets talk about the name Hunter and good things happen 10 for Chase Hunter handoff CeCe went up strong met by lockin got it back for Haggerty moves it to Rogers off the bounce floater wont go and Cafe follows thats a major finish by Musa CE on that one coming up out of nowhere to finish it off Chase Hunter cant hit again battle on the boards down to sheflin only his third rebound on an average of nearly 13 a game Chase Hunter was hounded and its a foul that goes against Memphis Yeah Musa CE going to pick up his third and as a coach those are ones you dont want your sevenfooter reaching against a guard with a fivepoint lead in the second half from the field Clemson three for six however the turnovers have hampered the Clemson Tigers more so than they have Memphis in this game and its been a good response for Memphis coming off that loss to Arkansas State in which Penny Hardway said to us he just flushed the tape right in the trash so they didnt watch it at all lockin missed it tried to follow it up shefflin secures it and will go to the line and thats the thing Memphis coming out in the Zone defensively one of the areas of concern anytime youre playing zone is finding rebounding assignments when youve got Ian shefin who averages 42 offensive rebounds per game you got to find someone or a couple people to put a body on him whenever a shot goes up to try to keep him off the offensive glass third foul by the way on Nick Jordan as well well over on ESPN later today a great double header of mens Hoops starts in Lawrence with number 10 Kansas trying to get back on track against Kevin Keats NC State team and then the Rivalry in the Commonwealth Louisville and Kentucky follows at 515 Easter great time of year when you consider of course very little football I wont say no football but very little football on this Saturday but some big time ball games coming soon Dylan Hunter lays it in off the Dane danger turnover Clemson cuts it to two and thats one of the areas of expertise for Brad brells group and Clemson Tigers turning defense into offense and now another opportunity here with a one possession game to get a stop and try to take a lead or at least tie the game after Memphis started the second half on a flurry PJ hagers been quiet Hunter has not wanted a 63 but left it short Zachary pushes for Clemson Applause Music lockin Dylan Applause Hunter and now Chase Hunter rejected the screen kicks out shefflin straight on cant hit and the rebound to tyres Hunter but a good look from shefin at the top of the key he can make that shot and you like the read by Chase Hunter giving shefin that opportunity Kobe Rogers called for the ball screen with Dane dja looking for somewhere to go risky Applause pass haard he stuck on three points hesitation and he draws a foul late shot clock with only six remaining and its on Dylan Hunter and once again thats what he does PJ Hagerty puts so much pressure on your team attacking the painted area normally results in the free throw with free throw opportunities this time without Clemson being in the bonus underneath out of bounds into jordane whos out there with three fouls Tyrese Hunter driving kick Rogers off the shot fake cant hit offensive rebound Tyrese Hunter hes been everywhere great Hustle by Tyrese Hunter to chase that down from the opposite corner sheflin flops haery cant hit Hunter Hunter going up top to get it you got to be careful with saying that he flopped because there could be there could be some penalty for that in todays college basketball game with the banging in the post and now foul out on the perimeter with the margin two Ian shefin taking the contact because there is contact there will be no flop no flop warning on that possession Ron grber right on top of it however if they did deem because there was contact you cant call that a flly he was trying he was trying to get the offenseive foul not oh he definitely sold it but not enough contact there for it to be an offensive foul I love the fact that it was not called but also glad it wasnt called a flop s minutes gone by second half Chanty Wiggins Way Off Target and the rebound Applause danger Cay and D both in there for Memphis see say again with his three fouls but hes had a big impact here since halftime Zachary harassing Rogers and reach in for the second on Jaden Zachary Jaden Zachary so good with his hands though he sticks his hands right in the cookie jar often you see that and he gets a lot of basketball that time getting more arm resulting in a foul but hes a guy thats going to put pressure on you at all times when hes defending you to be strong with the basketball hag got a switch High bre recovered and now back out for Baraka aoji and Musa ceis back on the floor with those three fouls something to pay attention to shot clock winding down and Wiggins cut off danger Zachary now Wiggins off the bounce on Dane dja lost his footing in a turnover not an aggressive play by Wiggins who missed the three on the last possession hes a very good threepoint shooter normally would have confidently stepped up and taken that last one and last Touch by Applause Memphis and chy Wiggins will check out and Miles Foster comes in for the first time in this game the fifth year senior from Brooklyn a transfer from Illinois state to replace Wiggins and Miles Foster absolutely set expect expectations very high with 17 in his debut hasnt been able to get to those type of numbers since but we know he can get in a hurry made a big impact in the first half in particular in the win last week over Kentucky sheflin with the hand off for Zachary Cay came up with the three fouls the contest and then a block at The Rim shot clock doesnt reset shefin knocks it down and the fact that the shot clock didnt reset was probably better Ian sheflin recognizing it knew that he had to shoot the basketball no hesitation catches fires knocks down a big three to Reg G to lead for the Clemson Tigers when you had seen some hesitation earlier he let it fly immediately this time Cay underneath and they got a foul called underneath on Foster Ian sheflin second three has put Clemson in front by one no hesitation by the chef kick it out the shot clock is low you got to let it go in shef with top of the key 43 remember vorg donate and 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research and not only that you also have an opportunity to win a car thats

thats right get started today there you go speaking of bowl season how about the Tigers big bowl for them heading to Texas tough Drive Baraka aoji and hes got a chance at three yeah and again youre getting a production from a number of perimeter players for the Memphis Tigers baraca attacking the basket and attacking a very strong defender in Chase Hunter giving chase a taste of his own medicine how about baraco COI during his portal process he took a visit to the and then he was going to Memphis so he was flying from Chicago to Memphis on his flight drick Rose so he took it as a sign and look at that followup by PJ Hagerty well we talked about PJ hagy always getting to the free throw line but this is a bit unconventional even for hag off of a offensive rebound and a miss free throw you see Hagerty rushing in and then the presence of mind to see Hy Breer coming over the contact gets it up on the glass now an opportunity for the am1 so it ends up a fivepoint possession for Memphis and stretches a onepoint lead to six just like that and a hustle play a points off of a offensive rebound on a free throw not boxing out get the foul here on Dane Daner thats his first on Jaden Zacharys transition drive thats first Midway through the second half theyre going to say its a foul on the floor so Baseline out of bounds for Clemson and up top for hi High breeder they run Zachary off a screen and now shefflin carving out space on danger too strong and then a foul on the rebounding action and who they get they got Musa CE say they have to hes the one who had that Applause right yes thats going to be four on Cay so thats the best best news that could happen for the Clemson Tigers Cay has been dominant on both ends of the floor throughout this game as you see lock and coming in for the offensive rebound smacking that right arm so will be a shooting foul as well as the fourth foul on Ce CeCe will check out so bookmark this 1030 to go second half Memphis by six when he departs and expect to see Penny Hardway going to a Zone more so with Cay in foul trouble as Penny and Musa have a conversation on the sideline but with Musa CE out you see more zone for Penny hardaways group and of course that opens up opportunities for Ian sheon on the offensive glass a split from Victor locken memphiss lead is five jordane Daner Hunter haery and okoji the five on the floor for Memphis shot clock beneath 10 Hagerty has high breeder on him Hagerty going to work tough shot goes tough match up right there for high breeder going up against the larger Hagerty on the Block but Hagerty showing that hes not just a playmaker on the outside has post game as well Hyer known more for his offense through the matchup with the nations fifth leading score lockin trying to get danger in the air nearly walked with it but a foul is called and thats two on Danger fou 42 thats his second PJ Hagerty who was second in the American Athletic Conference a season ago behind of course only David Jones of Memphis right now the leading scorer in the AAC playing where Jones was a season ago and just showing off that hria may be a little too small to guard him on the Block just like me and you on the Block let me ask you this I mean youve seen a lot of Memphis now they were great in Maui they had the loss Sunday to Arkansas State we know how they finished last year missing the tournament how good do you think this years team is I think theyre very good and the one theyre much better than expected you know talking up any Hardway yesterday he talked about the expectations for his team this year were not very high so going to Maui knocking off number two Yukon in game one then following up with the win over Michigan State I believe put them in on many peoples radar that werent thinking about the Memphis Tigers early jordane got Zachary in the air and had it roll out but a foul called on Clemson on Chase Hunter fou called Chase Hunter Jordan attacking the Baseline gets a shot Blocker in the air as you see Jaden Zachary flying past but then Chase Hunter coming with the contact behind Jordan and its the right call a little late however that is the absolute right call and one that Ron gr and all honestly may not have called had Jordan made that layup but you absolutely see the contact there and the contact affecting jordane missing that shot and so jordane knocks down both the only returning scholarship player from last year as Memphis in front by seven Dylan Hunter initiating around the high ball screen with Danger on him nice step through and finish and you can see Dylan Hunters confidence just growing he understands his role for Brad Brownell when he once he comes into the game to be aggressive both on the offensive end of the floor and defensively had a career high 15 points against Bradford here earlier this year and you can see his offensive confidence growing hes been there man again this season Tyrese Hunter for Hagerty Baseline Drive drop off danger missed it Zachary pushes Hunter Rises cant hit last Touch by locken and it goes to Memphis and Dylan Hunter is frustrated yeah hes frustrated got a great look on that possession a shot that hes used to making hit a huge three late in the game against Miami on the road last Saturday and would have been another big one there to make it a one possession game if he was able to get it to go down hes improved his shot a ton this season Jordan straight on can it think about that a sixpoint swing they dont make the three on one and Jordan finishes up on the other end and just like that its an eightpoint game in comparison to two jordane makes so many winning plays for Memphis Chase Hunter Banks it in in the midrange thats vet move right there thats like old school in the park you always had the one guy who knew how to use the glass so effectively even when the glass was like a small triangle white backboard up top that is cultured absolutely with the chain Nets what you know about that not much up top shot clock below 10 for Memphis jordane driving and in trouble uses Tyrese Hunter got to get it up met by Zachary and a shot clock violation another great defensive possession by Jaden Zachary however the Memphis Tigers have stood strong here in Little John jordane knocking down to three to stretch the lead out for Memphis behind Ian shefflin for number 16 Clemson Trails by six against Penny hardways Memphis team in a really crucial spot in their schedule looking for a marquee win and Penny Hardway knows a lot about Janai broom who was the most valuable player of the Maui Invitational and actually beat Memphis in the championship game so Pennys seen not only the top rebounder but also the number two rebounder as Dylan Hunter knocks down a three from the exact spot where he missed one in transition that would have made it a one possession game he does so here and now he got his hand on it last Touch by Hunter and Hunter feels as though that actually went off of Hunter and Tyrese on that one even though its a great job defensively now only two seconds to get it across half court because of the deflection so you most likely will see them throw the ball into the front Court tyres Hunter wants a lob from Hagerty and lockin picked it off but now only one second remaining that did not cross or did that go over half court well see lets see where the spot is we go back back to the football that it didnt go over half not go over half court but theyre going to say lockin stepped out of bounds with one second left hagard is trying to talk his way into the front court but Brad Brownell is saying no so because lock and touched it out of bounds is why you put it in the front Court very interesting so Clemson did get it over the timeline thanks to that and now they set up shop in the half court with Kobe Rogers oh dribbles it off his foot I believe turn that play was destined to be a turnover when you consider everything that happened with Chase with Dylan Hunter knocking it out of bounds the difficulty getting it in ends up being a turnover with Kobe Rogers kicking it out of bounds a Clemson could tie with a three or get within one with they field goal here Chase Hunter initiates pick and roll with lockin corner kick and now Dylan hunter gets it back in the dribble hand off working with lockin back out Hunter attacks on Tyrese Hunter tough ball away I tell you what the footwork on that is amazing you see Chase Hunter make plays like that all the time but the presence of mind to attack off the bals not settle for the three how good has this game B from Clemson PJ hagard he took the bump and an offensive foul and Dylan Hunter has been a Difference Maker especially here in the second half not only on the offensive end of the floor but also defensively here in the second half absorbing the bump getting in legal guarding position you see the right arm of haggy push off and just like that an opportunity now for Clemson to take a lead inside of six minutes to go and Little John Coliseum Chase Hunter matched up with Tyrese Hunter bounces for lockin spinning blocked by Cay and theyre going to count the basket tending on Musa CE count right theyll count the basket but they can go look at that Penny Hardway sing to the officials in a Timeout situation they will be able to go over and look at this to see if that basket counts and I can tell you right now thats going to be a tough one to determine called it goal tending it looks as though its right at the top of its flight going to be interesting to see after our next timeout what they come back with on that possession Hagerty turns it over but give Jaden Zachary a tremendous amount of credit for doing the job defensively he has his hands literally in everything and Penny Hardaway wants a timeout will Penny Hardaway can feel the tide turning here in this building the Clemson Tigers now building momentum and theyre doing it with their Applause defense second meeting between these teams and theyve both been these last two seasons you mentioned last year at a white out at FedEx forum in Memphis and it was a Dandy Memphis 79 Clemson 77 and at the time you said it Clemson was undefeated and ranked 13th and just like last year this years rendition has lived up to it the absolutely two great teams going at it a season to go both representing their conferences in the NCAA tournament you look at that game johy Wiggins had a huge performance for the Clemson Tigers 19 points for him you saw the big three in that flashback was three of six from Beyond The Arc hasnt had that type of performance here today yet to score in this one but hes had many of his teammate step up and of course David Jones from Memphis a year ago no longer with the Memphis Tigers that you the second chance points Memphis dominating on the interior when it comes to Second Chance opportunities Clemson on a 90 run and theyre having a look as you suspected at what was called goal tending on Musa CI and being that the score is the same Im assuming that they call that a good goal T and honestly when you looked at that play and replay I dont believe that there was enough information either way to change the call as you see right at the top its hard to see if the ball was actually coming down or still going up that possession so I dont think there was evidence either way so you stick with the call that was made in live action which was a goal1 which results in two points for Victor Locker Penny Hardaway came out and talked about this pivotal stretch this week he said the writers and the nation they dont respect one team when when we get to league play in our entire conference so he said this is a pivotal sequence this is seeding for the NCAA tournament hes got this game Virginia and then two ranked teams as well Mississippi State and Old Miss and it is go time for his Memphis Tigers it absolutely is go time but you also have to remember they have a number of very good wins already on their resume for this season Ian sheflin underneath banging with jordane and back out Dylan Hunter now Jaden Zachary entry for lockin spinning on Cay pivoting in for two and you got to remember now Victor lockin played in the American Association when Cincinnati was in the American hes played against Memphis before and you consider that cay was at Memphis four years ago these two guys have had their battles previously Memphis trying to stop an 110 run and a foul on the perimeter goes against Clemson and they get it on Jaden Zachary his third and when youre a post player but you dont have the same athleticism as the guy youre going against you have to use pump fakes you have to use good footwork Victor Lockton using both on that possession to be able to score a around not over but around Musa CE so Hagerty to the line for the one and one misses on the front end excellent free throw shooter we told you at 85 but hes only two for four from the line and hasnt been there as much as he normally is Hunter around the screen off the foot of Musa ceis and a kick keeps it with Clemson Applause Dylan Hunter finds lockin off the shot faking Drive lockin had it roll off and then a rebound to Tyrese Hunter great job by Tyrese Hunter coming back in otherwise that would have been another offensive rebound by Ian Sheffer Rogers straight on three to tie it the Tigers will not go away neither of them well I believe we have a barn burner coming down to the end of this one my friend 62 off inside of four to go in South Carolina Jaden Zachary uses the sheflin screen sheflin got a switch with Hagerty On Him Zachary wanted to go there instead its locking against Cay a bump and no bucket and if thats a foul thats going to be five on Cay waiting on the signal from Ron Grover and we will check on it when we come back ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by K the official partner of couples who love the game I was called going to be five of musis whos been strong on both ends of the floor for the Memphis Tigers throughout this one but now lockin is able to to break the tie game an opportunity to make it a twopoint lead here at the line what changes defensively for Memphis without mus well one of the things weve seen is them go to a Zone however with 339 remaining in a you know one possession game Im not sure well see a lot of zone for Penny Hardway to this point on but what it does it forces them to put a smaller defender on lockin who is had his way here in the second half of this game now up to 20 points his best game at the Clemson uniform after transferring in from Cincinnati season highs with 20 and8 for the Russian big PJ Hagerty tough shot swirls out locking another rebound that shot was made Tough by Chase Hunter a great contest and now Dylan Hunter around the Victor locking screen approaching three to go hunter probing kicking Zachary knocks it down I tell you what the three guard lineup with Dylan Hunter on the floor alongside his brother Chase and Jaden Zachary is dynamic for Brad brownells Clemson Tigers they have been special here in this second half danger banging and he draws a foul second on Victor lockin great play by Dylan Hunter keeping his dribble alive attacking the Baseline and makes the right read Jaden Zachary getting to the spot finds the LA knocks down to three ball to give the Clemson Tigers a fivepoint lead however Danger trying to cut back into that at the line you know we talked with Brad Brownell yesterday at shootaround and he said the guys we brought in as transfers Zachary and lockin theyve been the pieces we thought they were going to be that theyre a big part of why Clemson has started the way it has and thats a huge thing when you go to portal is guys have to fit your culture your playing style and the mentality of the coach Jaden Zachary is one of the toughest guys youre going to find on the floor and Brad Brownell is one of the toughest guys youre going to find on the sideline he coaches his guys up he coaches them hard he expects a lot from them but he loves them all along the way Ian sheflin we tend to shoot spinning on jordane for two now if you look at that Jordan wants that call its the exact same play that Ian shein did not get earlier in the half give the credit to the officials for being consistent on both ends of the floor Kobe Rogers cant answer but Hagerty in again on the offensive glass for Memphis Ian seon attacking off the bounds goes middle the spin nowhere near enough contact for that to be a foul either direction I shean continues to keep playing gets the easy bucket right there once jordane goes to the Applause ground PJ haery to the line hey this afternoon ACC Network its a double header of mens Hoops old rivals meeting for the 100 time Syracuse and Georgetown at the Dome 230 Eastern then Florida State against T Lane down in Florida okay so the Florida state two lane you call that old rivalry what conference with those two teams in when when they were Rivals Southern close the Metro okay the Metro Southern could be right but theres no one here to check it so therefore Im right youre wrong Point Alexander seemingly like always Zachary on the Baseline reverse lost it here comes Memphis down by four Jordan found danger cant lay it in got it back and danger follows great effort by Danger on that possession after missing the initial one able to go back and get it and finish it up as we see Memphis trying to extend the pressure 120 to go Clemson with the basketball up by two sag off of sheflin and now Chase Hunter pounded by Tyrese Hunter Chase Hunter the sixth year senior buries it its is Chase Hunter time we talked about at the end of the first half now here at the end of the second half Chase Hunter steps up and make big plays danger kicks for Rogers answers how about the shot making on display you can tell how important a game this is we talked about in our opening this game is going to have implications in marks both of these teams want to say they have this win on their resume and and theyre playing like it right now a year ago it came down to a two it was a twopoint game on memphiss home floor right now Clemson Tigers with a twopoint lead trying to finish this off against a very good Memphis Tigers team the threes on both sides clutch first Chase Hunter again Chase Hunter continues to be great to end halves for the Tigers whether its first half second half it doesnt matter three to the dome but on the other end of the floor is is danger finding Kobe Rogers who has been Spectacular from Beyond The Arc here all morning afternoon and makes his biggest three of the game to make it a twopoint game Penny Hardway took one of two timeouts he had remaining so hes got one left Brad brownells got two with 512 seconds to go in the second half and Clemson up by a pair and plenty of time to play out of course this defensive possession absolutely right now Penny Hardway just designed finding what he wants defensively from his team more importantly stay solid of course if you get a turnover theyre going to try to push it and see if they can find anything in transition especially if they can attack the paint and kick out for a three to any of their Dynamic Shooters they have on the perimeter the arrow points to Clemson in the final minute of the second half this will be most likely token pressure see if you can get a trap early if not get back you dont want to give up anything easy sheflin broke the pressure to locken and now the hunter Brothers set things up for Clemson how about with the starting point guards you have on the floor in Chase Hunter and Jaden Zachary the basketball is actually in the hands of the sixman Dylan Hunter to initiate here in crunch time and now Chase Hunter off the fake had it poked Away by Tyrese Hunter and his numbers right now for the Tigers danger running the floor tie ball game and so right now if youre your Brad Brownell you probably want to get this in across half court and then call your Applause timeout players thought there might have been a timeout called there was not no Brad wants it after they get across half court hes he yelled out to his guys get the ball across half court get the timeout oh hes not going to take hes two left and in the hands of Chase Hunter and I like him not calling a timeout cuz doesnt give Penny Hardway an opportunity to set his defense Chase Hunter trying to win it Hunter for three no and were going to overtime would have loved to have seen Chase Hunter be in attack mode try to get down memphiss second overtime game of the season remember they beat Yukon in Maui when Yukon was ranked second at Clemsons first OT game this season sitting a 9 and one overall Zachary lockin both hunters and shefin same five for Clemson a flare for Chase Hunter who kept his footing and now Jaden Zachary uses lockin drives on haery and now Dylan Hunter Rises cant hit bat it around and Zachary runs down the offensive rebound shefflin bangs with Jordan over the left shoulder and its been a relatively quiet game for Ian shein however now hes up to 16 points so offensively hes gotten the job done only five rebounds which is seven under his game average kobby Rogers buries it kobby Rogers has been massive 22 and a four3 maybe we should call him cold D Rogers for the cold blooded three he just laced to give the Memphis Tigers a onepoint lead season high for the transfer sheflin for locken answers right back so 23 is the number right so now 23 for lockin who answers heres Tyrese Hunter danger flashing and wanted it from Hunter and now Rogers the hot hand hes been coldblooded Tyrese Hunter off the shot fake drives and lays it in and so fearful of the threepointer no one even stopping the basketball giving Tyre Hunter his easiest bucket of the game 10 threes for Memphis nine for Clemson and highend shot making on both sides as Brad Brownell uses a timeout with 316 to go in overtime well lets check in with the studio we send it to Phil Murphy Music all right Phil so well get you guys to that game when this one goes final sitting here in overtime with 316 left 77 all and some threes on both sides starting with cold blooded kobby Rogers well call him coldi for today Cy Rogers coming off the screen great footwork the balance lining it up knocking it down nothing but net on the other end of the floor Victor lockin is able to knock down a huge three both players now with 23 points season best for both of them in their current uniform Victor lacken who spent four years at Cincinnati the last couple of years he was a starter but Brad Brown L says that here hes had more of the consistent role regularly that he was looking for at Cincinnati and hes found it at Little John yeah Brad brell plays a lot through him at the top of the key weve seen him p ing the basketball playing a lot of high low action has the ability to be able to shoot the three as we just watched but also put it on the floor make plays getting into the painted area lockin has been a great addition to this Clemson Tiger basketball team when you consider his ability to not only score but also facilitate flip side Kobe Rogers team High 22 remember last year he was at Witchita State and they knocked out Memphis from the American Conference tournament so he was the guy that ended memphiss season last year now hes playing for the Tigers and this has been his best performance yet and KOB Kobe Rogers started the game off knocking down the first field goal for Memphis from three and he has been special the entire morning afternoon and I believe we will hear much more from him before the end of this one if youre just joining us a reminder of whats it stake big resume game like we said for both these teams and for Memphis in particular look they went out and they got embarrassed pretty much on Sunday against Arkansas State who hadnt beat a ranked team since 1991 and Penny Hardway said to us he did not even show the film of that game to his team told us last night it went right into the trash can but he wanted to see some fight from his team he felt like they expected to win on Sunday against Arkansas State and he felt like they had been riding their own hype train and got what they deserved well and they understand now what its like to be the hunted see Memphis has been the hunter all year and no pun intended with all the hunters that we have in this game but when you consider the fact that going to Maui they were the hunter playing against Yukon they were the hunter playing against Michigan State as well as playing Auburn in the championship game they get home and play against Arkansas State they are now the hunted they did not respond the right way however they have more of the hunter mentality stepping on the floor here in Little John Coliseum and Kobe Rogers has been steering that ship four of six from long range for a guy whos been a marksman his entire career at four different stops yeah and you consider 40 threepoint field goal shooting over a career that is spectacular not a lot of guys can say that they were able to do that shoot it that well from Beyond The Arc from calp to Sienna the witas state and now Memphis and locked in an overtime game with Clemson and now we see the Zone from Memphis coming out of the timeout Penny Hardway done a great job of switching his defenses but Brad Brown now prepared for it with the high low against the Zone but sheflin couldnt finish through the contacts something lost on the floor not sure what it is Brad Brownell going to run out and grab it off the court you dont see that very often no you dont but see Brad still got some wheels on him too I think its a data tracker that the Clemson players wear on them in game shot clock below 10 for PJ Hagerty off the bounce on Zachary using Rogers late shot clock Rogers for hunter in the corner cant hit and chefin sword over danger that was a strong defensive possession right now Dylan Hunter should attack here he does and draws a foul and thats the thing at this point of the game so many times guys will get too conservative too passive and not take advantage of those opportunities a strong rebound by Ian sheflin and gets Dylan Hunter and Chase Hunter out in a 2011 scenario smart play by Dylan Hunter attacking the basket boy his minutes have been huge for Clemson as theyve gone small matching up with Memphis and when you look at what hes done this is Brad brell telling his team they really have six starters because not only has Dylan Hunter come in and hasnt left the game since checking in in the second half hes been relied upon on both the offensive in the floor and defensively so you can go with johy Wiggins to start games at the small forward often push Wiggins down to the four spot but Dylan Hunter is playing starter minutes for Brad brell only 55 at the line in his career and he split so the lead is one for Clemson more than halfway through overtime PJ Hagerty with it Fifth leading score in the country uses jordane now a screen from danger rejected by Hagerty Hunter came to help mov to the corner for three another Tyrese Hunter KN it down and its a mistake but a small Mistake by Ian sheflin he recovers to jordane in comparison to splitting the difference between the two not allowing that pass to go to a knockdown shooter Tyrese hunter in the corner Jaden Zachary response Clemson by one you cant ask for more than this on a December the 14th morning going into afternoon no the high level basketball weve been treated to here today Dana working on Locka short battle for the board secured by lockin Clemson with it up by one they push and turn it over Chase Hunter got a little bit greedy looking for his brother Dylan well it wasnt greedy it was just a little too pretty it was a Look Away in comparison to actually looking at his brother and putting it on the lases to Dylan who would had a wide open three in the corner he tried to look off the defender to not get him over there and makes an errant pass and gives Memphis an opportunity to take a lead on this possession you okay with him pushing there absolutely you want him to push you want to be aggressive it was just not executing the pass Penny Hardaway takes the timeout with 107 to go here in overtime trailing by one well its been big threes all over the place we told you Kobe Rogers has knocked out four but how about Tyrese Hunter as well hes got six triples looking like Maui Hunter and you see as in shefin rotates to jordane and again its a small thing is difficult to know at that time but if you recognize Personnel you go to Tyrese Hunter but on the other end of the floor Jaden Zachary JayZ stepping up in true veteran fashion as you look at this all right Chase does not turn his head and see the pass he throws to a spot however Dylan is beyond the threepoint Arc waiting to put a nail in the coffin right there that would have been a fourpoint game if hes able to knock down that three ends up being a turnover and giving Memphis an opportunity to take the lead here with 107 remaining in this overtime session Memphis has one timeout left Clemsons got two free throws the rest of the way in the arrow points to Penny hardaways team weve had three ties 11 lead changes we started at 1100 am weve got like kindergarteners behind us whove been dancing their hearts out in this one thats when the game started it didnt start until the elementary school came in because nobody could score early it was a 60 game until the elementary school kids showed up onepoint game Rogers off a screen short offensive rebound Tyrese Hunter for the lead the best time to shoot the three off offensive rebound give PJ hagy tremendous credit tracking it down finding a knockdown shooter Tyrese Hunter who has been spectacular here especially throughout the second half like he did in Maui hes hit seven threes today matching a career high and then Nick Jordan picks up his fourth foul jockeying with the in sheflin with 44 seconds left great execution Ian shefin getting post position but you see the two hands pulling him down great look from Kobe Rogers but how about the effort from PJ Hagerty and then finds Tyrese Hunter laces him up knocks down the three ball to give Memphis a twopoint lead and the chefin misses the first on the other end the two hands in the back pulling down Ian sheflin but sheflin missing the first free throw which makes that a great foul by jordane shefin splits memphiss lead is down to one and right now you have to play this out for the Clemson Tigers trying to get a stop can run it down to about 13 and a half if youre Memphis thats what separates the game and shot clock here at overtime danger sets the screen for Hunter tried to snake it and turned it over lock in with a loose ball Hunter ripped it back dangas got it and a foul from shefflin with the shot clock dark and lockin did not get the basketball away Brad Brown out talking to Ron gr saying that he was calling a timeout while locken had the basketball but give Tyrese Hunter tremendous credit after he loses the basketball lock and picks it up but watch Tyrese Hunter reach between his legs and grab the basketball away forcing in shein to foul danger and put him at the free throw line with only 153 remaining and again theyre saying that there was enough change of possession there for the shot clock to flip when locken had it so that plays a part in it as well and shefflin had to jump in and foul it absolutely does because otherwise you would be getting close to a shot clock violation danger good on the first 53 for his career but hes been better this season at 65 fifth year senior who transferred in from Illinois makes B and give danger a tremendous amount of credit Musa ceis fouling out with about 3 minutes remaining in regulation danger stepping up in that Five Spot getting the job done but how about Penny hardways group responding after a tough loss at home to Arkansas State last time out respond coming on the road to a very difficult environment here at Little John Coliseum and now threepoint lead with 153 remaining an opportunity to be able to walk away from here with a huge win look a lot can happen in 153 but weve talked at length about what the road ahead right now is for Penny Hardaway and its this game its Virginia its Mississippi State and Old Miss three of the four biggest ranking games left on the schedule this year you can make the case this is the biggest four game stretch of his coaching career at Memphis yeah all penny Hardway is concerned about right now is 153 seconds and whether you foul or you dont foul right here up three do you foul and send Clemson to the free throw line not allow them to have a good look at three on their home floor to tie this game or do you allow them to come down and see if they can find that look against a stout defense what do you prefer in these spots right now if Im on the road right Im going to go with fouling in this scenario if Im at home Im going to take my chances with them not making the three but on the road with the crowd behind them Im going to foul force them to make free throws and then find a way to get a offensive rebound to be able to beat us the guy you would want a foul is Dylan Hunter by the percentages but instead into Chase Hunter no foul for three Hunter no battle on the boards shefflin is out of bounds on the sideline with 83 left and Penny Hardway rolled the dice and Clemson got a great look weve seen Chase Hunter knock down a three from that exact spot unable to get it to go but now youre talking about being in a scenario where as long as youre good with the basketball get it in bounds and be strong you can make it a twopossession game with only 83 remaining PJ Hagerty is memphiss best free throw shooter theyll want to get it to him or Kobe Rogers tipped on the the inbounds by Chanty Wiggins at 610 back into the game now we saw a turnover here before got to make sure that tyres Hunter knows he cannot run the Baseline and theyre going to go have a look at this on the tip under two minutes you can make sure that you got the last play on the review for timing oh for timing instead from Ron Grover and his crew how about this game its been spectacular September 14th you quite truly could not ask for anything more you could not and especially with an 11 am tip 1100 am tip you dont know what youre going to get you know this is life like a box of chocolate typ Im Happ you showed up at 1100 am I mean 11 I was thinking about walking in at 1059 you know this is definitely much earlier than Im used to working but getting an opportunity to work with you my man its been a long time its been too long my friend and again being here your first time ever at Little John Coliseum amazingly yes I mean again and youre youre getting treated to a much younger student section than what normally you see however this place gets Rock and you saw that you felt it in the Kentucky wi and right now give Memphis a tremendous amount of credit for coming into this building and have an opportunity to walk away with they win early start to get a game like this on television why wouldnt you and Memphis jumped out to a 10point lead early on in the first half Clemson and answered it was tight at the break with Memphis up by one back and forth in the second half Clemson had a look for the win at the end of regulation it did not go for Chase Hunter and Memphis is up by three with 71 asterisk remaining here in overtime as they check the timing well the thing is we know chy Wiggins hit the basketball the game clock will be adjusted to 70 seconds will be Memphis ball we know CH WI hit the basketball to deflection doing a great job trying to deter any pass coming in but you have to determine when it hit out of bounds it cant be in the in the air going across the line thats not when the clock stops it has to hit something out of balance for the clock to stop they Sub in PJ Carter whos a very good shooter as well and can handle the ball as a guard with Tyrese Hunter trusted to put it in and he does to haery at 85 as a free throw shooter with the fourth foul on Jaden Zachary Music 310 of a second thats all that comes off the clock with haggardi trying to will Memphis to the finish line Music here and he makes it to make it a fourpoint lead or this been some kind of response by Penny hardaways team who said he needed to see his fire back back in his team today its been a some kind of response with Penny Hardaway individually this entire season I Saw Penny after winning the Michigan State game in Maui and I looked at him I said they tried to throw dirt on my boy he just looked at me playing me said yes CA but God didnt let it happen and right now they are in the scenario where they are going to get a huge win on the road and this is a tremendous Resume Builder coming into little John knocking off the number 16 Clemson Tig doing what the Kentucky Wildcats were unable to do coming in getting a win in this building which is extremely difficult against a very good Clemson Tiger Team final 67 after sheflin turned it over Clemson will not foul and Memphis grabs an overtime win over number 16 on the road at Little John big
