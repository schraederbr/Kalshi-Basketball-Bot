for him last time out against florida state and he gives a lot of credit for saving north carolinas season well see what the tar heels are able to do on the road theyve been great at home struggled on the road at times quincy garrier will jump for syracuse its armando baycott for north carolina roger airs will throw the ball in the air hes working with jamie lucky and clarence armstrong gary didnt even go up for it and thats the story to follow here tonight hes playing with a very sore left knee playing these in their loss at georgia tech on saturday and jim behind wasnt sure if hed be able to give it a go tonight but hes going to try caleb love is the point guard with walton a threepoint shooter and its garrison brooks from the freethrow line garrison brooks at a big game against syracuse the last time out a doubledouble for he and armando bacon both guys were double doubles in their starting lineup but it was more so about the ultimate offensive class 24 offensive rebounds for north carolina in that game joseph girard the third for syracuse heres the north carolina starting lineup and its the same five to open for the 13th game in a row very deep team walton their leading threepoint shooter off the mark and theres the problem you were talking about for syracuse the offensive rebounds for carolina that was armando bacon he had 24 offensive rebounds with 24 points in the first matchup between these two and you know this very well sean that thats been really the achilles heel for the orange off season long is finishing plays on the defensive end of the floor by gathering the defensive board coach behind says its the size and strength of the north carolina frontcourt inside that causes his team a problem thats an offensive foul as marik dolagis stood in and took the hit even with that big edge on the glass for roy williamss team that was a competitive game into the final minute roy talking today it was a one possession game with under a minute to go won by north carolina 8175 john that was a game where north carolina only shot 397 percent from the field and 20 21 from three so its not a great shooting team and thats something im sure jim baham is going to try to exploit in this game after buddy behind missed three carolina tried to run out joe gerard saved it for jim beiheim Applause 111 here in the dome the only loss to pittsburgh a threepoint defeat they had an 18point lead in that contest but you mentioned the resume needs bolstering its almost to the point now according to joe linardi with whom i spoke today where they might have to win the acc tournament to get into the ncaa field joe girard off the mark and a rebound by bacon but this is a great opportunity for syracuse to get a win on their home court and really get back into the conversation i understand its going to be a long road for them to try to make it into an ncaa tournament but they have great opportunities when you get to the acc tournament as well so for coach behind im sure simply about playing one game at a time but i know his guys want to try to find a way to get back into the tournament bayheims been shooting the ball better over the last month or so but off the mark to start tonights game he needs 16 points to become a thousand career point scorer so that could happen tonight hed be the 64th syracuse player to reach a thousand he scored 18 in the first half against north carolina on january 12th so again roy williams knows his number very well and buddy beijing will get a lot of attention in this game but he didnt score in the second half at all his team did a much better job with coach williams defensively heroin walton just didnt beat the shot clock buzzer and thats a rare twopoint field goal just his 17th of the year hes made 47 threes more than twice as many as the next two combined for north carolina mr bunny try to go inside and dolijay has called for a hold lets be trying to defend armando baycock as you mentioned curve walton getting into the painted area doing damage at the rim thats not his forte hes a guy that shoots the three extremely well its been a difference maker in this north carolina lineup once he came into the starting lineup has not relinquished that spot but has been the one guy thats been able to consistently stretch the floor for his team youre not a good threepoint shooting team just under 31 percent kessler in the game early and he had a nice feed underneath and the bucket for deron sharp whos also in off the bench early with interior has been a struggle for syracuse on the season the luxury for roy williams is when you take out baycod and brooks you bring in two mcdonalds allamerican freshmen who both have getting been getting better game after game gerard wide left gary a trying to compete on the offensive glass love the highly touted freshman kessler kept it alive and gary playing on that sore knee hit the deck you just see again the size and strength inside the big factor here early jesse edwards in for coach behind guilty of that foul and it gets us two times bob knight number three but roys two away from tying knight freeway from passing him roy did it again 161 games 482 wins at north carolina 418 in 15 years at kansas hes the only coach to win 400 games plus at two division one schools Applause and corey the rebounding already a nightmare for the orange north carolina is out rebounded syracuse nine to one thats one of the main reasons i wanted to get that in the first sentence because it was going to be so important to this game talking with jerry mcnamara beforehand asked him hey what do you guys need to do to come away with the win he simply said get back on defense and rebound because they kill us on the glass and when youve got walker kessler scoring the basketball this easily its going to be a long night for the orange if they dont come up with a way to find some resistance kessler the career high hes a freshman 20 points they also had eight rebounds four blocked shots played 24 minutes thats 10 minutes more than he played in any other game in his career jesse edwards is seeing more playing time up front for syracuse lately gets back on defense as well to take it away roy williams said kesslers been working hard in practice hes been getting better roy wasnt particularly happy with the way some of the other big men played theres a travel on joe girard in that first half when they fell behind the seminoles by 16 points so he let walker kessler continue to play in the second half well when you play the way walker kessler has been playing as of late youre going to get more minutes and you see the nice touch the nice jump up going over the left shoulder but walker kessler is extremely skilled when you think about his ability to shoot the basketball from the outside where he blacks with the carolina quartet is hes not as strong hes not as physical as those other guys but when it comes to skill hes probably the most skilled of all the bids 71 245 part of the problem for kessler coach williams told us was that twice before the season started he had to sit down for contact tracing that cost him about two weeks of valuable practice time in the preseason dari richmond in off the syracuse mansion guard pound the bucket from erect golijai and kessler the foul and the native of slovakia senior dolagi will have a chance for a threepoint play and i love watching dola jai play youre talking about a guy six nine six ten with tremendous skill but really guard like skills often times would be to put the basketball on the floor and we know he leads the team and assists hes a great passer so when hes one of the guys sean did i think about with the rule that the ncaa really stated with guys being able to come back and this years kind of being a wash will we see nola job back next year and if so i think that could bolster this syracuse lana hes also an excellent freethrow shooter he made the freako hes 86 second in the acc thats a block for alan griffin team leader in block shots clay being dominated on the board syracuse down by only four with the ball Applause griffin at 26 saturday and their loss to georgia tech edwards had it rejected by bacon davis number four with the ball now in for the tar heels anthony harris is in as well he just fed bacon great ball movement walton the high arcing three wouldnt go and its run down by edwards sophomore from amsterdam and beehive open for three and all of a sudden its a onepoint game and theres my buddy finding the spot on the wing and of course but hes been shooting the basketball very well when he gets open opportunities like that coach williams is going to cringe on the other side of the floor for north carolina as well as they run defensive theyre going to have to offensively theyre going to have to do the same getting back on the defensive end runner got a little sloppy with the ball after building that lead four turnovers contributing to that eight straight points for the cube thats one of the areas where north carolina has struggled recently 13 assists you know only 13 assists against marquette to 19 turnovers and then had 21 turnovers against florida state even though they were able to win that game bacon size and strength got a second chance opportunity and brooks was fouled the fast break 20 21 you dont run to the basket you run in a threepoint line buddy beijing letting everyone in the building know im open make sure you get me the basketball kadar richmond does a great job keeping his head up and finding buddy in the corner brooks missed the first free throw nobody with that bucket now 13 points away Applause from a thousand for his career that was the 189th threepoint field goal of his career one more to tie marius genoales for eighth place all time do you remember Applause Music by harris they continue to play volleyball around the rim and bacon dropped it in yeah once again even though harris missed the dunk youve got three offensive opportunities right there for north carolina until they come away with the two second chance points as jim behind is pleading with the officials to understand that someone was on the out of balance line after the basketball but no call carolina loves to run for too big too strong and up by four in north carolina getting out in transition and harris unable to finish the dunk however his team is there to pick him up in north carolina holding a four point lead the undefeatedcom always interesting and compelling content there really proud of what they did here at syracuse they have an enormous mlk day celebration by dean brian conkle of hendricks chapel sean dorselis a student here had to do it virtually this year most years they have thousands of people in person for it sean mcdonough corey alexander were at the carrier dome in balmy syracuse new york where its 27 degrees and snowing outside sean where we ran into each other this morning and of course our workouts i told you this is the first time ive been to syracuse in the last five six years and it hadnt snowed and of course it started snowing while you were working out and i was still searching for the vending machine im not going to let america believe that you were getting it in the man north carolina leading by four they vowed rebounded syracuse 183 garrison brooks are missing even andrew playtech for a moment on the offensive glass Applause what was the difference in the north carolina win at chapel hill in midjanuary the domination on the glass particularly the offensive end yeah but you talk about that game it was a plus 17 margin for the game and right now north carolina with a plus 15 margin within the first nine minutes of this game so going to have to figure out something here relatively soon to try to find a way to keep the tar heels off the glass we should point out it was in the high 40s here yesterday landed in syracuse new york harris out of the corner another offensive rebound and now three opportunities for north carolina on this possession and when you get this many chances youre going to score the basketball i mean you can shoot 33 and still win the game north carolina shot 39 percent won the game in chapel hill and jim beijing not happy with hes seeing watching this and its even more super because usually the doubleheader at five baylor squares off against red hot west virginia up to number six in the ap pull out today sonic blockbuster illinois and michigan four and two respectively and then kentucky and ole miss it starts at five eastern time tomorrow three of the top five teams in the ap poll out today from the big ten gonzaga remain number one michigan vaulted over baylor into number two illinois and iowa after their first loss of the season losing at kansas dropping to number three michigan jumping into the two spot right now unfortunately for baylor this is illtimed covet pause not that theres ever a good time i think ill do mine next week now theres never a good time buddy baeh im a three that just beat the shot clock buzzer and coach drew said that when you miss as much time as they did was it 19 days without a game the guys just lose their conditioning and kansas has also refound its form they have kansas has played very well i got david mccormick doing a great job on the interior he was a handful against baylor on saturday and he may have exposed something that im not sure the bears have seen much of this year that could be a problem for them once they get into the ncaa tournament good hands by kedari richmond the freshman third in the conference and steals just under two per game out of bounds itll be syracuse ball richmond also played lately by a lower body injury looks like hes limping around a little bit coach was hoping hed fight through it he managed to play only nine minutes at georgia tech saturday a talented freshman particularly on the defensive end agrees shawna i have him on my all acc rookie team when you consider hes third in the acc and steals per game but more importantly coming off the bench and the spark that he provides on both ends of the floor getting this team involved hes had a number of big games in ac play this year been a valuable member of the horn lets see gary a nice spin move on the baseline but good hands by leaky black and deflected it out off of garrier and richmond uh does all that in just 22 minutes a game yeah i mean hes special and what he does he reminds you of what syracuse has looked like forever what theyre supposed to look like at the top of that zone as well devon sharp goes over the top for an easy bucket and right now coach behind conversating with khadari richmond because he did not drop back down into position but turnover this is a sloppy turnover by the freshman richmond and the dunk by leaky black thats normally the way it works though we start talking so well about a player and you know did you take them off your all freshman team no thats it thats it but another pass like that coach behind like allowed me to put him on there buddy baeheim along with a three taken back for the cuse by marek golijay ten players have already played in this game for north carolina one of the deepest teams in the country edwards posting up inside shuffled his feet couldnt take advantage of the fact that much smaller kayla blub was on him for north carolina only shooting 375 from the field but when you get high quality looks as does deron sharp on the interior and leaky black getting out in transition the game becomes much easier and it just happens to increase your percentage north carolina by seven Applause perez 13 points seth yeah houser huffing murphy lead the way for virginia offensively but i got a question for my man over there the cavalier its defense im concerned about with the cavs well coach one thing that we both know defensively if youre not athletic you have a problem and virginia lost a lot of athleticism up front with the defense from a year ago and that has been the issue this year all year long fawns and i have talked about it a lot and right now they just cant recover to a lot of the areas where theyre used to being able to recover they make up with it with their shooting virginia right now trying to get back their confidence they struggled over the last three games nice rebound by jesse edwards he needs to add some strength but really has some skill Applause you know we watched him in warmups and he was a bit gimpy but right now the explosiveness that he normally plays with just is not there especially when you consider how much they need him to on the glass and its just difficult for him to compete with this side heres kessler inside for a dunk before we get too far away from the cutin we dont have a monitor where we can see the studio tonight another coven protocol i dont think we could cover from the three of them from this distance however we digress was alfonso in i thought i heard kevin mention them but but did did he say anything i dont think fox i dont think fun settings seth yeah but it was well seth didnt want fans to talk so thats why im asking coach greenberg was just talking to me see if fonz would have been talking to you if if syracuse could box out like seth did on alfonso that cut in this might be a more competitive game its still a six point game miraculously given the rebounding disparity which is now 259 Applause and that is amazing we mentioned how big of a spread it was rebounding in the game on january 12th however it was still a very close game cut has as many rebounds himself as the entire syracuse team thought it should be syracuses ball out of bounds didnt hurt them in that instance richmond all the way to the bucket he lays it in hes on his way back so hes on his way back hes going to stay on the team right now all right but i mean when you look at its a fourpoint game i mean we talked about the dominant numbers north carolina has regarding their second chance points and in the paint but syracuse is hung around and we know they can make shots in this building at some point if they can find some rhythm on the offensive end of the floor they find themselves coming away with the win gary a good hands to battle the way inside gerard staggered and then threw it away coming up next on espn the ab at nine oclock we head to stillwater the only big 12 battle of the night its bedlam kade cunningham 17th ranked oklahoma state employee bay and particularly he played very well lately in number 16 oklahoma joey brackett says the winner of that game will be a fourth seed for the time being the loser a five seed for both comfortably in that cunninghams fun to watch that he is a young man who was a power forward when i met him as a freshman in high school nike lead 100 he came to st louis and spent two years with us there and you know kevin boyle did a tremendous job with him at mont verde putting the basketball in his hands and because of that most likely would be the number one pick in the nba draft so a lot of big props to cave for really developing his game over the past few years quick turnaround in bedlam they played saturday theyre playing again tonight its a coven scheduling so easy on the inbounds its baicot there to just drop it in and Applause now has four points you know armando bacon six points guy that missed out on a lot of the minutes when walter kessler was getting it done on saturday versus florida state bake got into foul trouble early giving the opportunity to kessler but give mondo a lot of credit coming back in this game not concerned about what happened in the last one when he wasnt at his best and playing big here early already nine boards you asked him about the tattoo on the side of his neck did he give you an answer he his answer was ive had this so again you should notice that youve apparently done every north carolina game this year well this is true but ive also you know been working with him since he was in the seventh grade so he didnt have it in the seventh grade i can tell you that much but im not sure when he got it gotta call mom on that one talk to christy and find out when he got that tattoo and it better have her name underneath it another four and a half to go in the half and a foul called Applause theres caleb love good knock down hes got a lot of ink now got a lot of ink on on both sides of the neck hes got the arm sleeve going on a lot a lot of ink armando nowadays and again when he was a chubby little seventh grader no ink back then from richmond virginia is that how you know him that is how i know him yes he uh he he actually texts me when he was a seventh grader and asked if he could come work out with a couple of guys that i was already training and showed up in the gym and never left lovable young man great personality and has turned in to be a pretty good basketball player buddy behind with eight and leaves are made away from a thousand for his career four minutes to go still kind of hard to believe this is only a fourpoint game with the rebounding disparity and some sloppy turnovers for syracuse as well garrison brooks the bucket senior from lafayette alabama but thats been an issue for north carolina north carolina actually leads the turnover they have eight to only five for syracuse so they can stick around and make some shots like theyre doing right now i mean again we got a one possession game with three and half left syracuse four for 12 from behind the arc north carolina yet to make one gary a the three hes an improved threepoint shoot over a year ago he made three all season they go inside again and power it up we saw the graphic card just scored oh for seven carolina from three the mans won 900 games but we dont want to tell him what to tell team but dont shoot any more threes that ball needs to go inside every single time well and syracuse hasnt had any answer for north carolina on the interior that would be what you would love to see especially when youve got a guy like armando bacon getting it done early in this game you would expect the guards to say hey the big fella was working lets get him the basketball and armando catching on the interior dolazar decision making and most importantly flow of the game this team has a great chemistry i dont know about the group thats calling the game though the first time weve ever worked together taking shots early yeah coach little feisty but its good to see fonz got out of the witness protection program part of the show 2 56 to go until halftime carolina by five they have not trailed in the game jumped out to an 112 lead that was the largest lead Applause richmonder with behind gary and robert braswell now in for the queue and another bucket for buddy behind so he had 18 against carolina in the first half of january 12th in chapel hill and he has 11 in the first half so far tonight here in the carrier dome threepointers the great equalizer right now syracuse 514 from beyond the ark and when you think about that thats really been the only way theyve been able to stay in this game north carolina over from beyond the arc as buddy beijing great movement but love the scream by quincy garrier and telling kedar richmond that buddys going to be open in this corner im about to get a body on his man giving him an open look great ball movement and recognition by the point guard but also give number one a lot of credit for that screening buddy behind shooting has really come on lately so many affected by the pauses of covet stoppages that syracuse had to endure particularly early in the year before the year even started this shooting has come on of late the point total up as well averaging just over 15 for the year but 18 over the last five and 50 reminiscent of last year he made 97 threes in his sophomore year carolina turnover and now amazingly syracuse could tie or take the lead on this possession and if you looked at the stat sheet there will be no way you would think with syracuse and the way theyve been on the glass the way theyve been out rebound they would even have a chance in this game but because the threepoint shooting and the turnovers from north carolina they find themselves now tied unbelievable dolijai the bucket wreck fouled out just 10 minutes in their loss in atlanta to georgia jack on saturday scored just two points in that game they launched another three they still havent made one they hide with it now and syracuse can take its first lead of the night with a minute and a half to go shauna goes back to your point when youre bigs are doing what north carolinas are doing why shoot that shot so early in the clock not give brooks give sharp an opportunity in the painted area behind open for three and syracuse has the lead its first of the night when you played well against particular teams you have confidence coming into next that next game buddy remembers 18 first half points against north carolina last time and he showed it this time but also knows that they blanked them in the second half im sure hell be much aggressive much more aggressive in the second half here tonight rj daviss floater popped out richmond the drive and a foul before the bucket and a great job here by marek dolezal recognizing seeing buddy moving and relocating to the open spot and knowing who has the hot hand getting him the basketball buddy already four from eight from downtown here in the first half now two points away from becoming the 64th syracuse player to reach a thousand career points this match buddys gonna heat check on walker kessler tesla wins that battle leaky black he said some good games against syracuse missed that one turkey should take it down to about five seconds to go in the half and richmond pulls the plug for a moment guarded by anthony harris Applause Applause 10 to shoot 15 in the half richmond will stop at gomu buddy behind another three for a thousand and one career points what a half for buddy beijing chance for one last shot it wouldnt go for harris and an unbelievable turn of events here in the carrier dome sparked by buddy bayheim they end the half on a 142 run bayheim had 17 points in the half he had five threes he has a thousand and one career points late in his junior year sean everyone on the north carolina bench said dont leave buddy cadem love left buddy buddy knocked down another three lets send you back to the studio heres the halftime report Applause his chops for round two with oklahoma saturday against the sooners he became the first player in the rivalrys history with a 40point double double in that overtime victory 44 minutes of action seth what makes this young man so special hes projected to be the number one pick in the upcoming nba draft he could score at all three levels and read the defense triple header tomorrow on espn in the middle it is the main meal illinois michigan top five showdown in the big ten you get it 7 pm eastern time on espn right now syracuse and buddy beijing hes eaten from the outside so far over a thousand points in his and they played well in every other area outside of turnovers and shooting the basketball and because of that syracuse holds the lead Applause third time in the last six games north carolina did not make a threepoint field goal in the first half in one of the other games they went two for 14 against florida state from the three in the first half of course a rally from 12 down at the half in that one to win buddy behind fouled carolina in the first half saturday against the seminoles you were there shot 25 from the floor they went up to 50 in the second half as they won we asked roy williams what changed in the game he said well i knew we couldnt play any worse than he did in the first half behind a rare miss from the freethrow line another area that hurt north carolina that first half against florida state they had 14 turnovers well the turnover bug has been them again today they got 10 first half turnovers against syracuse and syracuse is a team that comes up with a lot of steal but they dont force a lot of turnovers they get the steals because they are able to get back into the lanes in that zone but they dont force a tremendous amount of turnovers a lot of these turnovers from north carolina selfinflicted wins tough shot and rattled out theres baycod and a chance for a threepoint play glove still has not scored in this game but oftentimes the best offense for north carolina is just get a shot on the glass and allow armando bay garrison brooks deron sharp walker kessler to just go after it and look at second chance points opportunities north carolina rebounds 401 of their missed shots theyre second in the country when it comes to you know that percentage so their best offense oftentimes just get a shot up on the glass let that base go get it double double for baycon he had one against syracuse in midjanuary in chapel hill when he had 15 and 12 griffin had a very quiet first half nice move by khadari richmond and the shot way too strong hes comfortable with the left hand that first shot that was too strong was with the right and richmond getting the start here in the second half instead of joe gerard richmond often makes a difference on the defensive end of the floor but you mentioned earlier sean hes not 100 either running very gingerly as edwards is also in the lineup here to start the second half and though quincy gary griffin a miss he has not scored for syracuse kind of indicative of the way his seasons gone he did a bit up and down he had 26 saturday in that loss to georgia tech and sean you know this program as well as any as caleb love knocked down the first three for north carolina in the game but with no quincy gary to start the second half would you pretty much assume that we may not see him anymore in this game yeah thats surprising you wonder if maybe his knee got stiff as the half went along or in the locker room at halftime hes their leading rebounder that would be job one for him tonight griffin another miss and now carolina with a chance to take kobe they led by as many as nine in the first half Applause harrison brooks gets a friendly bounce and its north carolina by one and when you get the ball to that acc area in the paint you can have success especially if youve got a guy like garrison brooks that can make that 12foot jump shot on a consistent basis in brooks knocking down his third opportunity from there alone in this game legit passed up a 16footer richmond for three off the mark thats not a strength of his game at least not yet as a freshman richmond has made just four threes four out of 16 of the year coming in and gary is at the scorers table so we will see him win this game surprising that he didnt start the second half bayheim had it knocked away thatll be syracuse ball and here comes quincy gary a the sophomore from montreal averaging nine rebounds per game clang knees with the georgia tech player on saturday in atlanta jim bingham said he could barely run yesterday during their light workout as you saw in this video he was limping during the warmup but hes trying to power through it and hes needed by syracuse you see going to gary as soon as he comes in the game hes one guy in the painted area that can really cause a problem for north carolina 23 points 11 rebounds for him in the first matchup between these two and the second leading rebounder in the acc at nine a game so when the way that north carolina has dominated the glass hes very important to this game sharp called for the foul jesse edwards is the free throw shooter his playing time has come up lately just looking for another big body inside he had seven points saturday at georgia tech and a careerhigh eight rebounds also matched his career high with 23 minutes played they put syracuse back on top and one of the things that edwards does for syracuse he allows marek dolezal to go back to the wing position in the zone where hes so effective you see dojo coming up with a big play already and getting syracuse out in transition buddy behind a three from right in front of his father on the syracuse bench 21 for bayheim Music leaky black well defended by gary but its there for baycod to drop it in edward goes for the block shot and when you as the biggest guy on the floor you leave that leaves your teammates disadvantaged on the other side trying to come up with the rebound but khadari richmond comes back knocks down the midrange jumper syracuse 138 on the bubble theyve lost two in a row after they had won two straight and six out of eight richmond dolagis shut off by big hunt you see right now when buddy beijing gives the basketball up caleb love goes into deny mode and because buddys doing a great job moving without the ball and right now its almost as though north carolina playing a box and one not giving him any opportunities once he gets the basketball up nice move by gary showed some quickness there sore knee at all sean im wondering if gary actually stayed in the locker room a little longer to get some treatments probably the reason he didnt start the second half but possible yeah you mentioned he does look a bit more springy especially on that last move the first pick in the next nba draft in both big guards and you see austin reeves numbers 17 and a half points per game but the 51 assist give damian harmon a lot of credit moving over to the two when reeves came to oklahoma and has really been a difference maker for them is kate cunningham has truly been a difference maker for the cowboys interesting defense now they had tehran sharp the big guy up on bayheim on the perimeter quincy gary scored inside and sean i have to correct i guess gary did start the second half i didnt see him out but he must have gone out of the game really quickly but im sure jim baham is happy to have him back on the floor as hes been producing here in the second half especially with his opportunities around the basket and a turnover for north carolina Applause jim behinds team in need of a big win this would qualify north carolina has just won win against a ranked opponent all year and that was against florida state on saturday in the lane richmond and syracuse winds its largest lead of the night its now 10 and both these teams are great at home syracuse as you mentioned 111 at home this year north carolina undefeated in the ding dong outside of that loss to marquette undefeated in acc play but theyre different teams when theyre playing on their home courts in comparison to when they have to step away rick told the guy still in the game hes playing with three fouls that could be a factor a little bit of everything tonight but you can see by that stat line three assists three steals three blocks four rebounds but also the three fouls carolinas woes from beyond the yard continue they are 290th in the country out of 340 in threepoint field goal percentage only miami worse in the acc held ball in the north carolina ball with 19 to shoot this north carolina team on pace to be the second worst threepoint shooting team in the history of the story program only behind last years team was just barely over 30 this one fraction that percentage going down with the one for 13 tonight they may actually be under that team now after tonight davis missed another three run down by sharp he has trouble with the ball in its last touch by beijing its black playtech davis kessler and sharp for north carolina sad to shoot playtech back in his home state of new york hes from the albany areas pass too hot for kessler another turnover now 15 turnovers for north carolina and again when youre not going to make threes the last thing you can continue to do is give the basketball back and give buddy behind opportunities he misfires on that one but north carolina no longer getting quality shots seth reinberg mentioned at halftime is understanding the guards knowing the flow of the game what they have to do you mentioned earlier in the game get the ball inside allow the big guys to be able to make plays but when you continue to turn it over on the perimeter that helps no one for roy williams in this club the heels now one out of 14 from behind the arc another problem theyve had all year not a good first half team theyve been outscored by 28 points in the first half this year including tonights sixpoint deficit they have outscored their opponents by 135 in the second half entering tonight that never more evident than saturday against florida state in their home building nice inbounding play dolo couldnt finish scrum and it lines up with richmond bayheim with time and missed the shot jesse edwards the rebound the other night richmond seeing more playing time than he was early in the year and gerard less edwards shot clock violation tangled up underneath the bucket down 10 for north carolina theyre starting to get in danger zone syracuse is starting to play with even more confidence on the offensive end of the floor if you take away the shot clock violation they have been getting what they want on their offensive end north carolina is struggling to get the basketball inside now for their bigs and the turnovers have really hampered them here in the second half bacon good defense by edward you held his ground richmond trying to drive on the shorter davis was listed at six feet and that might be generous behind three pops out what a rebound by garrier quincy gary looks like a different man here in the second half hes now showing that explosiveness that weve gotten used to seeing from one of the most improved in acc candidates all year long andrew playtech that should brought a shot that they want and i believe they call goaltending i dont think jim behind thought that was going to reach the rim clarence armstrong the outside official whos trying to explain it to jim behind lindsay guerilla continues to be productive on the interior the offensive board and the putback is gary bringing jim didnt like the call goaltending as we went to the break but once we had a chance to look at it andrew playtechs shot was uh the very least hit the rim clearly a goaltend against jesse edwards so its the second threepoint field goal of the night made by north carolina now two for 15 they continue to dominate in the paint but syracuse has the decided advantage from beyond the arc and the points off turnovers plus 17 for syracuse thats been a tremendous difference maker for north carolina when theyve gotten shots even though theyre not shooting the ball very well from the field they are getting offensive rebounds and second chance points but when you turn the basketball over you dont have that opportunity carolina tried to trap and got called for a foul playtech called for his first well carolina has turned it over 17 times 13 of them in live action and thats going to be a problem and roy williams nailed it didnt they when we spoke this morning i petrified this game because i dont know which team is going to show up for us tonight they look so good at the start of this game richmond nice ball fake dolage eyes open we talked all night long about oddities in this game they have the ninepoint lead without a single point from their leading scorer alan griffin who averages 15 and a half per game griffin really hasnt gotten many minutes in this game jesse edwards doing a great job on the interior and putting mark dojo back into his natural position in the zone rj davis nice move a freshman from white plains new york out of archbishop stepanak same high school which alan griffin played and alans younger brother aj griffin whos one of the top prospects in the country in high school this year hell go to duke espn has him ranked number 14 in the country among all the high school Applause prospects jesse edwards line drive floater playtech just did save it although the syracuse bench thought the ball hit the end line davis not afraid to go inside he gets bumped by dology who doesnt like the call and nord is jim behind and thats a huge call because its dologys fourth so theyll send alan griffin back into the game caleb love finding rj davis under the basket dolagi was vertical on that possession it almost looked as though rj davis was still moving and went into dolezal however regardless its going to be number four on dojo as he has the exit alan griffin back into the game the interesting see if griffin can get going here over seven from the field and over five from beyond the threepoint arc for him so syracuse needs him to be playing good basketball to try to finish this up we mentioned the syracuse bench which had a good view of it upset and with good reason that ball did hit the end line after just like that off playtech richmond and hes called for an offensive foul and momentum has shifted back to the tar heels in this back and forth game Music Applause seven nothing and a chance to extend that roy williams going back with the freshman backcourt of rj davis and caleb love this is the way they started the season and now looking for some type of offensive punch kerber walton has not had a good shooting day at all does it seem to use that syracuse is starting to go at a slower pace in the half court almost taken themselves out of the momentum they had garrier fires an air ball out of bounds off bacon and gary who made two threes in the first half long on that one which is odd when youve played as well as he has here in the second half got a couple buckets in the painted area normally playing with confidence north carolina has won 10 of the last 11 head with syracuse jim diamond is just a really tough matchup for the orange with the size and strength of north carolina inside their rebounding prowess richmond just a jumper shawn to answer your question i do believe that syracuse has slowed down a bit offensively but i think its north carolinas defense that we have to give credit for that but no one to this point has been able to slow down buddy beijing might have gotten away with a little shove with the free arm to get himself open for that shot but another demonstration of his improved ability to get his own shot and not just be a stand still threepoint shooter francie gary called for the foul gives us a chance to remind you that saturday we have a full day of college basketball across all of our networks and the app and the big one is number four illinois number seven ohio state and then the renewal of the best rivalry in college basketball dupe in north carolina that ones a sonic blockbuster it should be every time they get together saturday at six chapel hill north carolina trying to sweep that season series unc won with 25 points from caleb love who hasnt scored anything near that since sonic blockbuster saturday at 6 duke right there on the bubble among the first four out according to joey brackets two big games this week for the blue devils at georgia tech and then at unc and both teams in the mix for the ncaa tournament gary doing some work syracuse bench really upset that buddy beijing didnt get sent to the line jim behind still giving it to jamie lucky Applause rebounds in this game and all three of them on the offensive glass hes been a factor for syracuse coming up with big opportunities on the changes Applause bayheim got the call on that one buddy behind the acrobatic score and the bucket the previous foul was on deron sharp and this one for the hip check is going to go against caleb love but thats when you know its going well for you buddy behind falling down still able to finish through the contact and buddy having himself a night a chance for career highs career high is 29 which wasnt long ago on february 20th and they came from 20 down to beat notre dame here in the dome shawna ive got to ask you as a syracuse alum what do you think about this free throw shooting from the orange this year its unlike anything weve ever seen before one of the best in the country and again his dad looking for a foul call instead they just say its out of bounds to syracuse orange nation knows theyve not been a good freethrow shooting team and there have been many times when that has really hurt but uh this team shooting a percentage be way above that 75 it goes that team in the early 80s 8384 by edwards and that brings the orange bench to life as the lead goes back up to double digits with eight minutes to go and i love the confidence that jesse edwards is playing with right now you mentioned the careerhigh eight rebounds for him against georgia tech on saturday but right now he is giving syracuse a huge lift the same way he did in the miami game here and has been special on the defensive end trying to stem some of this defense rebounding harris fouled might be edwards was giving him some good minutes with dolo ji seated with Music for 175 years new york life has been helping people act on their love six three for buddy in this game is hes been ultra aggressive on the offensive end of the floor going over 1 000 points and then some on the evening for buddy and not just doing it from beyond the arc taking the basketball to the rim and finishing through contact is now he sits with 1010 points 210 more than big bro and ill let you do the math one day jimmys season of course the ivy league didnt play this year and jim beiheim scored 745 points of course when he was here freshman werent eligible to play and his job was getting the ball to a guy named dave thats not a bad job to have well jim i believe scored about 14 points per game played professionally in the old eastern league used to drive down to pennsylvania probably some icy snowy nights down i81 to go play and come back up here to syracuse arrived on this campus in 1962 as a freshman 76 years old one out of two for harris will come out of the game replaced by kerwin walton one of coach behinds concerns foul trouble in the front court edwards just picked up his fourth hes continuing to play they keep dolijah on the bench for now nice split of the defense by richmond he tried to pass it underneath the edwards and it got intercepted thats a play where khadar richard will want that one back as being simpler for him just to shoot the basketball give edwards a chance to go after the offensive line walton wide open three is the best threepoint shooter by far and it popped out out of bounds to syracuse north carolina didnt like that call oh for seven tonight for kerwin walton from beyond the yard the team two for 16 Applause its been a struggle for north carolina from beyond the arc and we mentioned the team last year that shot terribly but they did come into this building and shoot lights out a season ago with cole anthony and so im sure coach williams was hoping they would have some of that same good fortune shooting the basketball in the dome here tonight but no such luck theyve struggled as you mentioned from beyond the arc only two made threepoint field goals and one of those actually didnt go in it was a goal 10 leaky black called for his second foul north carolina one away from the bonus each team of six team foul so the next one will trigger one and one and it goes to gary he scores inside Applause and one of the things that north carolina does they put the biggest guy on the inbounder so if you get the basketball on the floor gary is going to have an opportunity to score over a smaller defender which weve seen that a couple of times already davis gary the run out they should bang his other knees on that syracuse bench the way hes playing with the sore left knee and its davis who hustled back on defense after his miss and again you know you question his shot selection davises on the last possession well you see going over the top quenching gary with the size advantage over kerber walton and then getting out in transition khadar richmond finding garrier who does a tremendous job finishing on the opposite side of the rim and both those plays sean contact on both i mean they could have easily been called fouls and giving gary an opportunity at the freethrow line davis back on his feet to the bench so quincy gary a who was terrific in their loss in chapel hill on january 12th when he had 23 and 11 in 37 minutes before fouling out he also blocked five shots a career high in that game he has emerged in a big way here in the second half the officials looking at the play on the end as garriers elbow comes out making contact dont think its intentional however it doesnt have to be intentional to be called a flagrant but that looked to be simply a basketball play and apparently thats the ruling after the viewing of it 91 run for syracuse davis explaining what happened to him yeah i said it was some contact on the play i didnt know that gary was the one i didnt see that live either and when youre down this much and you cant make threes its that much tougher to come back especially since they really soon have gone away from the power game inside walton another outside shot bacon his season high 14th rebound of the game and jesse edwards i believe has just fouled out so dolagi will come back in Applause a scrappy effort by edwards who plays a careerhigh 24 minutes scores six points and well the second straight game has a career high in rebounds with eight yeah edwards gave syracuse great minutes and jim behind has said if hes skilled hed rather not have to play him this early wants to get bigger and stronger but he has to play out of necessity and he has become much more of a factor here recent games bay caught one out of two leaky black did a nice job to poke it away but carolina couldnt come up with it in years gone by this is about the point of the game usually around five minutes with a lead like this where coach behind will take the air out of the ball on the half court offense and run some clocks Applause and rightfully so of course with the 12 point lead you want to make sure you get quality looks every time down the floor thats really not what they want threepoint shooting not gary a specialty even though he is better tilde hit the deck it was away from the ball and clarence armstrong has a foul on clarence brooks excuse my garrison brooks garrison brooks trying to create space on that one and mark dolagh who of course weve seen take hits all season long dolan sells that one a little bit garrison brooks was guilty he did extend that left forearm north carolina now picking up their fullcourt pressure but almost token pressure once syracuse gets the basketball inbound as you mentioned coach behind going to try to slow things down a bit be a little more deliberate on the offensive end of the floor and by the way clarence brooks sounds familiar he was a longtime assistant coach here at syracuse football under the late great hall of famer dick mcpherson and a wonderful guy both coach mack and coach brooks you could throw out any name and you know someone that hates brooks was a wonderful guy coach for john harbaugh in the nfl with the ravens really really nice man so a 12point game 517 to go Applause both teams are in the bonus making the change attacks with those four fouls the shot clock was running out and the lead goes to 14 the biggest of the night leaky black right back to the bucket and a chance for three Applause hes had some of his best games against syracuse he had his then careerhigh 14 points in their loss to the orange in the acc second round in greensboro nice play by leaky black attacking the basket not settling for the jump shot with edwards out of the game not much size at all in the painted area for syracuse it goes out playing with four fouls you would expect north carolina to go to the basket a little more Applause bring some pressure as we go under five minutes to go and i think were going to see what weve seen from coach b heimstein maverick hes holding his hand up as you can see is it safe lets not be in any hurry here up by 11 with under five to go Applause buddy caleb love quickly the other way and if thats on dolochi he has just fouled out there were two syracuse players there and they give it to richmond two fouls on richmond nine team fouls on the orange so the next one will put the double bonus into effect caleb love made the first 80 freethrow shooter davis back in for the first time since taking that shot to the face from quincy gary at this point you would expect for north carolina to start picking up the pressure they have their guys up but theyre not going after trapping et cetera at some point youre going to see roy williams try to go after a trap see if they can force syracuse into some turnovers there goes the trap syracuse handling it very well but only one and done for as far as the traps are concerned from north carolina and tight mantoman with love up on richmond love deflected it Applause richmond is running around very gimpy gary a wide open off the field from dolo john richmonds asking for a sub to get out of the game and hes played the entire second half Applause well as you mentioned he was gimpy coming in coach payne wasnt sure hed and play nice bucket inside Music rj davis ninepoint game 350 to go and richmond does limp off a little surprised they didnt put joe girard back in anyway only for some ball handling hes played very little tonight just six minutes time out espns exclusive presentation to college basketball brought to you by wendys try the new jalapeno popper chicken sandwich and salad today 20 minutes away sean corey back to you all right just under four minutes to go here gentlemen entertaining start of our big monday doubleheader from the carrier dome in syracuse kadari richmond has gone to the bench with a very painful leg he was grimacing while getting medical attention as an ice bag on his right knee right now he came in banged up sean would that could really get interesting richmond is the best ball handler for syracuse as griffins able to find his i think thats his first bucket first basket of the night one for nine from the floor for their leading scorer on the season attacks and scores he went right in to griffin and heres gerard their leading assist man three on two they choose not to attack as the clock goes under three minutes to Applause go its the luxury of having a guy like marek dolezal who can handle the basketball make plays not just for himself but for others at this time of the game and you mentioned before very good free throw shooter that could not have gone better for syracuse they took 29 seconds off the clock it looked like it was going to be kind of a tough shot for dolijay but he got fouled on the arm by baycod on the way up both teams are over the limit and dolagi will shoot two mentioned earlier 86 percent behind only jose alvarado of georgia tech in the acc and wouldnt you know Applause thats why i just got quiet love coming off the screen on that possession north carolina continues to struggle from beyond the arc all roy williams can do is put his hands on top of his head and wonder what happened to the team that he saw in the second half first florida state on saturday they ripped the ball away from griffin rj davis had it blocked by griffin and dolo jai struggled to save it and asked jamie lucky for a timeout what a play by griffin after they doubleteamed him and took the ball away syracuses leading shot blocker races back and makes a huge play alan griffin not giving up one to play although hes a home run ball against the press and it got turned over andrew playtech on the offensive glass and theres a foul jim behind wondering what his teams doing marek of the inbound and trying to throw a bomb none of it was deflector it just slipped out of his hand but it was nowhere well the best part of the whole play and this is what i miss about being in the arena seeing jim behinds reaction when dolezals pass came off his hand before he even got intercepted he knew it was wrong from the beginning and he was already up asking what are you doing that to the second foul on buddy behind leakey black made the first Applause missed a second now its kessler attacking thats the problem giving up offensive rebounds off of free throw misses caleb love a big three for north carolina theyre right back in it the illadvised inbounding pass might have been a momentum turner it turns into a fourpoint possession for north carolina you make the first free throw and then you miss the second free throw but walker kessler does a great job coming up with another offensive rebound and just like that is caleb love knocking down the three his second three of the game and their third as a team now three out of 19 with that rebounding edge a big factor as we saw just there 49 to 30 the boards in favor of the tar heels wednesday on the acc network clemson and syracuse at five and nc state squares off against notre dame and theyll cap the day with florida state hosting boston college dont have accn go to getaccncom for instant access connect congratulations to leonard hamilton Music on a fiveyear contract extension announced today Applause first place team congrats to coach hammond he actually told me in a conversation this summer he thought he had about five more years in them so at least and this makes it will be six he was including this year as well so you know several 70somethings in this league including roy williams and jim beiheim and sean when people talk about the acc being down and whatever it may be thats what makes acc the best conference in the country to me its the coaches and the guys that are there on a consistent basis showing up leading these teams you have so many different styles of play goal ajay they come to double him gerard syracuse a lot of good free throw shooters on the floor four of them are 80 plus of the five on the court and gary is 71 for the year Applause carolina desperately needs a stop shot clock down to five griffin working on davis missed the shorty gary missed the tip two great opportunities for syracuse and now its love 43 at air ball Applause action against north carolina buddy beijing a little slow as he ran out to contest loves three i believe buddy came down on caleb loves foot after going after that shot but quincy gary a struggling to get back down the floor after his collision on the defensive end really have enough bodies to get to the finish gary a playing on a sore left knee all night long boy griffin got a great look and gary as well gary and davis got tangled up i dont think that ones related to the knee injury i dont believe so but hurts even worse Applause Music could use a timeout he wanted to buy him a little more time Applause griffin made the front end of the one and one thatll be the last one and one of this game the next one is the double bonus leaky black the foul two big free throws there to make this a three possession game now and a team that has such a hard time making a three that really hurts in this situation nice pass by davis robert braswell just into the game thought that was clean up top and deron sharp is going to go to the freethrow line jamie lucky signaling that braswell hit him in the head braswell coming over doing a great job he got all balled up top but jamie lucky signaling that elbow to the head of davon sharp and a great view there you see exactly what jamie lucky was talking about on that block did get good basketball but hoops upside the head as well Applause sharp made the free throw and hes just 524 percent for the year and has made seven of his last 10 Applause and another long rebound comes back to carolina davis a deep three oh what a bounce it was a rock off the back rim and it dribbles in to make it a fourpoint game sean someone just wants this game to be interesting for us theres no way that basketball should have gone in when you consider the way it hits the back of the rim and just dies somehow going in for rj davis but the second time north carolina has gotten a four point possession making the first free throw and then a threepointer off an offensive rebound on the missed frequency syracuse on the ropes here just trying to get to the bell they had a 14 point lead with 5 18 to go when you think back to that 10point lead and the illadvised inbounding pass by dolage i really seem to turn the game brought north carolina back to life and put syracuse a bit on its heels dolla gile throwing it again with behind girard griffin and braswell it wont guard the inbounder smaller quick lineup out there for roy williams they want a quick steal and perhaps a foul Applause gerard shorter player in trouble timeout good defense by carolina you have to mention khadari richmond out of this game theyre not sure what the injury was a right leg injury for sure he came in with what coach behind described as a lower body Music injury and he was a lot of pain with his right leg when he left the game heres another guy who came in with a sore knee left knee for quincy gary they clearly limping during the warmups but Music he has 18 points and six rebounds Music and went to work often taking advantage of small defenders trying to guard him in the post area getting out in transition and finishing and then of course offensive rebounding and finishing around the rim has been his specialty all season long not as many rebounds for the second leading rebounder in the acc but hes had timely rebounds especially on the offensive end threw it into gerard he has trouble on the dribble graswell thats the guy they should follow if they can he throws it away 23 seconds to go love all the way to the bucket he scores its a twopoint game and carolina calls timeout sean this is the way for syracuse not to finish a game and the mistake by joe girard here is giving the basketball to braswell as a point guard you dribble it out find a way to get out of the trap and if you cannot you do not want to just give the basketball thats the george free throw shooter and the guy that doesnt play as many minutes who hasnt been in this situation before when youve got griffin on the floor as well as bae ham and dolagh not the guy you want to give the basketball to in that position well my question would be wheres gary and it has to be that the knee well we saw gary terry is in the hull i mean why is braswell on the floor and not gary braswell is a good free throw shooter i said hes the guy you want to follow because hes the least experienced but hes 11 out of 12 for the year limited sample but hes not used to going up to that line usually his free throws are in garbage time but gary is back on the floor now we saw him take a shot to the midsection earlier and hes been trying to walk that off but jim behind now in a one possession game a twopoint lead having to get gary back on the floor in a crucial scenario for syracuse to handle the pressure sergeys had a 10 point lead with just under two minutes to go they are clinging to it now its almost as if nobody wants the ball gerard fouled itll be a twoshot opportunity davis called for the foul gerard had a terrific freshman season at least relative to this season hes 80 percent from the line this year last year was 894 Applause wow will we take into consideration did not play in the second half until khadari richmond went out so when youre a guy that started every game this year and youve struggled at times up and down you have to start to wonder and question in your mind your confidence starts to waver when youre sitting over there watching your backup play all the minutes Applause one out of two but now a threepointer good time and they elect to foul which is interesting with that much time left on the clock and a team that is among the worst threepoint shooting teams in the country and joe girard looked over immediately after the free throw to jim behind and asked if he should foul but in live action im not sure that beijing gave him an answer he didnt seem as though he wanted him to foul at that point and thats early to foul oh i agree i agree usually you do that when theres less time on the Applause so clock love good free throw shooter 80 way short well the best play down the stretch here for caroline has been the missed free throw tap out so chester in perhaps to try to do that Applause will try to block him out gary and garrison brooks on the other side he missed them both ends toward the rebound and hes fouled by garrison brooks Applause big play there by joe gerard sneaking in and getting the rebound especially when the big guys have their hands forward trying to keep north carolinas bigs and kessler and brooks off with offensive glass two more for gerard Applause sire relief on that syracuse bench as the lead goes to four Applause and i told you a while ago watched this a lot syracuse they pulled the plug on the offense and more often than not it winds up in the wind column but more often than not too it seems it winds up as a seat squirmer regardless it got interesting and brook scores out the bucket but syracuse hangs on for a win that will put jim baehms team back on the bubble according to joey brackets and jim bay hive with a typical jeep they have the title we cant beat this team theyre too big theyre too strong to 110 out of 11 i said well you beat him you killed him last year in the acc tournament you beat him 8153 said it was one of the best games any of my teams has ever played everybody played great that night and of course it was the end of a lousy year for north carolina but uh roy williams still perplexed to figure out which is his real team had great reasoning for being petrified coming into this building but for syracuse theyve got clemson coming in next another opportunity against a team that is in the tournament field if syracuse is able to come away with the win who knows what happens in greensboro or a big night for the orange a 7270 winner over north carolina for corey alexander sean mcdonough saying so long from the carrier dome where buddy beijing became a 1 000 point career scorer the 64th syracuse player to do it he had 17 in the first half syracuse wins despite being out rebounded 5333 coming up next oklahoma at oklahoma state so lets send you now to bob schussen and frank
