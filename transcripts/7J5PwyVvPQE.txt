you had to win Saturday over Syracuse Moving him past legendary Virginia coach Terry Holland outstanding officiating crew tonight Doug shows Ron Gruber Lee Cassell and Carolina and Virginia the heels began the season ranked number one out of the rankings now 115 32 in the ACC Virginia 113 32 to the ACC as well ranked 13th and its Kihei Clark in the whos with the first possession of the night Clarks been such a vital performer makes clutch shots passes the ball exceptionally well what a great under six foot players in the country Jaden Garner defended by leaky black off to Armand Franklin who left it a little bit short but tipped back out by Kaden Shedrick its a fresh possession now for Virginia Gardner from the Baseline too strong and another offensive rebound by Shedrick thats a big plus to keep Carolina off the left Shedrick with two really good strong rebounds he had Clark and Miss Shedrick almost got another one but its off him out of bounds so Huber Daviss team gets its first possession and he is steamed already dick he does not like the fact that they couldnt control the defensive glass tell you one thing he really demonstrates a lot of passion a lot of energy on that sideline Seth tremble with the ball The Freshman number zero getting the start in place of the injured Pete Nance out again with a back issue so a much smaller lineup for the Tar Heels with really leaky black the de facto fourman and three guards on the court for Carolina this is RJ Davis in and out tipped out by Armando baycott love cant hit they caught another chip tell you one thing and baycot is down Armando baycott is down Applause a guy who battled an ankle injury late last year earlier this year a shoulder problem earlier this year and needing some help from his teammates to get back up as we get a look heard his uncle last year in the championship game at the end of the game yeah thats the left hand you could see him roll the left ankle and he is under he needs some help getting off the court hes trying to put a little bit more weight on it hes the best big player right now in the ACC theres no doubt about it such a factor for everybody I mean losing him is really really big lets see how much that hurt him as soon as he went down grab for it right away and obviously a huge loss for the Tar Heels if baycat is unable to go Justin McCoy a former Virginia player spent a couple of years here in Charlottesville checks into the game well hes going to play with a lot of passion here you see the posing uniform to get a whole lot of playing time here Davis with a floater and nobody can get anything to go right now Virginia ball that was a good move though by Davis Davis and love got to drive the basketball more excellent free throw shooters dead they dont go to the freethrow line enough they got to attack the rim Shedrick out to Reese Speakman and now Kihei Clark did a good unapprovement man Beekman is really outstanding Franklin and Clark Gardner and its the whos who Score first excellent post player good medium range shooter hes not going to shoot any threes in fact this is picking one three yet this year three years at East Carolina his second year here in Charlottesville has been a really nice player for Virginia the last couple of years leaky black whose threepoint shooting the percentages keep climbing every year but he misses the corner three and its Cavs ball get a look at the starting five again all kinds of experience from a team that went to the NIT dick a year ago theyve got much higher hopes this season absolutely the hopes of the win the SEC its regular season tournament and then getting the tournament bottom line is to make that happen its a big game because motifs are three and two right now Clemsons 50 and Clemson just be pit on the weekend oh that was a battle of a couple of undefeated teams at the top of the ACC standings nice block there by Armand Franklin did a great job rotating great timing here he is right there at times its really well rotating from The Hub side excellent block right there one thing about Tony Bennetts club theyre going to play defense you know what theyre going to be back on these two if you want to play for Tony Bennett you better play defense and we can tell you that Armando bacon is no longer on the Carolina bench she is evidently gone to the locker room after rolling his left ankle that puts a lot of pressure down into Lawrence youre glad youre gonna have to come up really big to win here today Trimble and another rejection by Franklin right as we come to shop left the man whats up with you rough Samson the spin by Kihei Clark Applause has to pick up his dribble finds Franklin and still plenty of time Kia just has great great basketball IQ really knows how to play the game that fifth year senior was a freshman in the national championship season for Virginia play 33 minutes in the championship now Gardner fouled by black and will be heading to the freethrow line you know we mentioned going earlier hes the only player right now in college basketball has 2 000 points and a thousand rebounds unbelievable hes had a tremendous college career averaging better than 11 points five rebounds per game and again keep in mind Virginia numbers theyre suppressed a bit because theyre a slow tempo low possession kind of team but Tony Bennett hes had this style since the day he got here he recruits players who he thinks can embrace the style enhance the style play well and its hard to argue with the success that hes had and believable National Championship five ACC titles for outright five ACC regular season championships in the last nine years pretty good I get your contract extension love guarded by Beekman one of the tremendous perimeter Defenders there in college basketball and eventually its a turnover he forces a lot of steals man he was one of the best in the nation last year Steels Beekman for three and the rebound to Leaky black thats one area they got they got to make those open shots they get quality shots theyre going to make them count better than four minutes in Carolina without a point and they turn it over again Beekman will lay it in five nothing Virginia you want to talk to some coaches prepare for the game they keep think hes the best allaround player he defends well he anticipates he read that just like a defensive back does phenomenal defensive player and hes shooting the three very well this year handles the ball exception well too nearly another turnover see Carolina doesnt have the post presence now right without Bay caught theyre changing this game its not perimeter Davis knocks down a three it took almost five minutes but finally Carolinas on the board but a lot of teams coming to this building and have droughts dont they they do bottom line is those guards you could have to be really efficient here tonight theyre gonna have to be ver for them to win this game Franklin no and black another rebound for the heels Carolina wants to push when they can a block by Shedrick Trimble gets it back since three blocks to it two by Franklin won by Shedrick love cant get by Clark tries again and gets called for the offensive foul Clark did a great job stayed in front of him he stayed in front of us he said no youre not going to get to the Rack youre not going to get there Caden Shedrick getting all of that Trimble attempt but the biggest news of the game the early injuries suffered by Carolinas big man Armando bacon by Talent lets welcome back after uh a lot of time spent on college football we welcome Andrea Carter back to the college basketball team well Dan thank you so much Im so excited to be back here but I have to say it is tenfold to be back here on a crew with Dicky V someone who has so much energy and enthusiasm for the game of college basketball and that energy is exactly what Hubert Davis said he wanted at shoot around for his team to start with today but the one good sign we saw our Mondo Bay cut go down he always brings energy and enthusiasm they are retaping his ankle and he is going to try and give it a go guys wow that is uh promising news encouraging news for the Tar Heels during the break I checked with Steve kirschner the sports information director for the Tar Heels not that it necessarily would have meant it was related but I asked him is that the same ankle that he uh that he hurt in the final four last year and the answer is no Steve Kershner says it was the right ankle last year was the left ankle here denied but boy when you see a guy roll an ankle like that dick you dont think hes going to be able to get back into the game my dogs looking at that but I still want to use one tough kid do you remember last year in the final game of the championship he went down and he came back Beekman with the shot clock and one gets it to go wow Applause DeMarco Dunn is into the game for Carolina 65 sophomore from Tucson gave him some good minutes in a win over Notre Dame Saturday in Chapel Hill he could shoot the ball he had a broken hand and kept him out but they really theyre a little deeper than in the past triple theyre going to the young kid on a bench they think hes going to be ultimately a storm Jill and washer in there and Huber Davis is looking to get more and more from his bench puff Johnson DeMarco Dunn played well on Saturday Seth Trimble as well beaten over the drive and hes fouled by RJ Davis foreign Music and converts tell you one thing about being he really attacked shes an attacker he wants to get to that rip a little surprise today in college basketball unbelievable wow they must be going bananas down in Lexington Kentucky got beaten home by South Carolina who lost Saturday did they not by 40 they lost by 42 or 43 to Tennessee and now Kentucky theyve been having their problems lately thats no secret but that continues tonight with a home court loss to South Carolina 7168 Applause and Big Blue Nation you know how they are I mean they are its going to be noisy in Big Blue Nation another steal by Beekman big notes unbelievable the way he steals the best a little defensive play Dan Sherman almost as good as you defensively where does the offense come from for Carolina very little post game but the bait got out so its got to be the guards love and Davis ball bounces away from love but theyre fortunate it lands in the hands of Davis and hes got all five for Carolina my truck Davidson love you theyre going to two Venture players who really were brilliant at the end of the year dont shoot really well in terms of you look at their stats shooting a three and I think theres a reason for that I think theyre good Shooters yep shot selection is the key you got to take good good shots Franklin and Miss on a threepointer Champion its out of bounds to Carolina another play dick by Beekman oh Tom believed hes been all over the court hes like what a defensive back man hes playing like Prime Time used to play when he played defensive football I was coaching out of Colorado a pride you know in this conference Reese Speakman and leaky black those are about the two best perimeter Defenders I think youll find theyre both Sensational Sensational yeah hey I got a feeling beekmans gonna be looking at by a lot of NFL people and really theres been guys that have done that you know basketball I think he might have a basketball future though I I think hell I think hes going to earn a paycheck playing basketball well I think hes really smart and number one you dont want to put that helmet on Jalen Washington the guy you were talking about thats him with the ball they didnt play his high school senior season tore his ACL got a late start recovering from that this year six foot ten you cant teach that size his quickness his ability run to court he can shoot the ball he just needs basketball experience love with a floater nicely done and Carolina back within three yeah I love it Davis is so explosive so exclusive they were noisy after the steals after The Beekman plays Clark Applause Davis pushing finds love well watching that Washington run the court he just climbs up and down the floor Hubert was ecstatic talking to me last night about saying his future is incredible love cant get a shot off kicks it out to Dunn and now they swing it to Davis done with a clean look for three off the back of the iron to the rebound for Franklin began the tempo much slower for Virginia 363 division one teams Virginias 360th in tempo threepoint attempt by Ben Bender plus a brad transfer from Ohio hes been a big plus for them came from Ohio she said had a big game against them several years ago on a young state tournament threepoint lead for the Cavs 10 51 to go in the first half due to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom weve got an Armando baycod update heres Trey thanks Dan well I did see Armando baycott running up and down the hallway back here he hasnt come out just yet they added a couple more layers of tape to that ankle his father Armando baycott senior did go back into the hallway was rubbing his shoulders really encouraging him as he tries to fight through it well and you got a feel for him remember it happened in the biggest on the biggest stage of all last year right and then he had an ankle injury didnt wasnt as serious wasnt as it didnt cost him as much time earlier this year then he had a shoulder injury missed a game I mean you know he posts right he plays hard he comes back from injuries but you just got a feel for a guy whos had a play through a few ankle injuries he really has been such a factor the last six games hes been absolutely Sensational I started off a little slow this year because of injuries hes their key companys team came on Big Time it all happened after February 16th they were embarrassed by Pittsburgh and people were really down it was their eighth loss and all of a sudden it was a change I mean the critics were around screaming as youve been the right guy for the job isnt it and then all of a sudden he ended here he became a hero they got hot after that loss remember they won the final regular season the game at Duke and then of course they beat Duke in there in the final four tomorrow night ranked teams highlight our ESPN2 college basketball doubleheader got some good games Alabama and Arkansas how much fun is the tide with the Brandon Miller and then TCU and Texas every game of the big 12 seems to mean a lot Marcus Carr and the horns and Mike miles Jr and the Horned Frogs unfortunately for TCU didnt go

shoot the ball he does great stroke you cant what he has he runs well hes 611 they say its up and down the floor hes got great mobility and man an excellent touch he is going to be special 70 run for Carolina to tie it and how about this is our producer Kim Belton points out without Armando Bayside North Carolina is out rebounding Virginia by six without the best remander in the conference on the floor really aggressive basketball I think puff Johnson could be a key player came on in I think 11 points in a championship game hes been up and down very streaky met a couple of big threes in the game with some Fighting Irish nice look inside Caleb Love Finds Jalen Washington and the Tar Heels have the lead hey Dan this could be coming out party for this kid really cant hes gonna be a rising star what a great opportunity heres taking advantage getting some opportunity as teammates on the sideline he knows he has to help the team and hes responding McNeely a freshman to the ball number 11 he made four threes against Syracuse on Saturday nearly a steal by done and now McNeely gets a good look and carries it well he can shoot the ball what if Tony Tony toasty for the game he said man I want to shoot at any time he has an open look he said take the parking brake off son you can go shoot it yeah hes made 23 so far threes I gotta put the parking brake on you every now John Baseline right into the chest and Chin of McNeely who is still down the basket counts there was no foul I do not believe called either way on the play but McNeely is shaken up the staff wants it elbow the screaming elbow elbow Applause nice drive on a benchline yeah got hit in the face dont know if hes got a bloody nose or exactly what it is yeah and that might be the mouth Applause take a look right here love right now look drives it into the big guy the big guy delivers nice pass right there my love Im gonna tell you I just love watching this kid play just watching what he does I can see why Hubert I mean he was just going on last night with me about him Bill McNeely will get a little bit of attention on the Virginia bench still no sign as far as I can see of Armando baycod returning to the Carolina bench the crowd here at John Paul Jones just got a look at the replay of the play on the driveby done and the officials are having a look at the monitor and thats that signal there from Lee casell was no call no flagrant uh a basketball play watch the left elbow as he elevated into the shot came up and got McNeely in the in the mouth there was no attention at all whatsoever was a basketball player you just said Dan outstanding cruelly casell Doug shouse and Ron Gruber we appreciate getting word from them so uh a bucket for Dunn and Carolinas back on top hey my first time working with Andrea Im gonna add it to my list Now 44 years and shes exactly what you said she is a rising star former Tennessee which was the last class of Pats Summit one of the greatest ever degrees sideline men or a woman Applause Clark in the backcourt along with Franklin Shedrick and Gardner the five starters on the floor right now for Virginia got off to a quick start but have slowed down noticeably offensively recently and they are one point behind the heels Applause football movement and good defense by Dunn to take it away from Franklin that was the perfect play by Doug beat him to the spot it was a great position that allowed make to turn somebody clears the guys make the turn get the driving lane pull up by Davis too strong rebound by Washington are you serious what are we watching here what are we watching here oh man this is a young guy with a lot of talent getting healthier by the week getting further away from that torn ACL of a year ago and because unfortunately for Armando Baker but because of that injury Washingtons getting some PT right now I think he heard some of the things I said about him earlier but hes making him look good you know tough that needs to make me look good I know youve tried for 27 years Shedrick tipped by Washington and its out of bounds off Gardner itll be Carolina ball Im going to tell you something if they get composite minutes out of him to join Baker down the road that is a special watch this right now look at it right now look at that sun left hand he grabs Sherman thank you threepoint lead Carolina over Virginia seven and a half to go here in the first half Dan Schulman Dick Vitale Andrea Carter the big story if youre just joining us Armando bake just a minute and change the end of the game rolled his left ankle went to the locker room has not returned yet Carolina has played well in his absence and some getting some great minutes out of the Freshman Jalen Washington yeah Jalen Washington has been a Difference Maker since hes been so active and so aggressive just Talent hes gonna tell it shes going to get stronger and that will come experience strength thatll all happen May the blood try to initiate the offense now for the heels shot clock down to eight Corner three will go down good minutes for DeMarco Don for Huber Davis and thats what his strengths I mean humor told me to last night and said hey we wanted him because he can make the three ball Carolina was down 103 theyre on a 163 run right now and it is quiet here at John Paul Jones a clean look for Kihei Clark and the Cavs needed that hes been a clutch player for him all year throughout his career and that was an example hes going to be a clutch guide he delivers Applause career highs right now if they hold up for Clark scoring assist field goal percentage threepoint percentage really having a great season even didnt always missed that shot what a nice stroke yeah Applause Washington again got a late start recovering from the ACL and played only 21 minutes all season coming into this one tonight Franklin wide open and misses the three Applause Franklin transferred him from Indiana and hes going to score for them they are great balance with Pennsylvania one thing about Virginia Four Guys the double figures right there the fifth one very close at nine points a game there again is a look at the bay cut injury for those who werent with us earlier went up for an offensive rebound rolled that left ankle but Jalen Washington has come in and played exceptionally well Off the Bench there he is right there a nice little roll to the basket has good hands good catch there was a good offensive rebound conversion hey you know you think about Bay cut now what you miss they cut has had 20 points or more in six straight games hes right now 58 career double doubles hes only too shy of one of the greatest ever to play at Carolina Billy Cunningham Billy The Kid From A Rascals High School from Brooklyn he was one of Dean Smiths great great players uh hes past Sam Perkins and we all love hes now the number two rebounder behind Tyler Hansbrough what a career hes answering Mission not just another player youre missing a starter player great ball moving on that chair by the Tar Heels but they couldnt knock down the corner three Applause good space these clubs really know how its spacing and Matt gubert told me his team change a great deal last year you can start developing better spacing and really moving it more thats ring and Drake hey Dicky V you mentioned Billy Cunningham wasnt his nickname the kangaroo kid it was Billy youre right hey Dre come on now I know you happen to be starting because my guy here told me when I walked in I said I never worked with Andrea hes a dick shes gonna be a star so you might be an agent fellow Talent fan Im just trying to be like Jalen Washington you know my name is called Im ready to go RJ Davis picked up that last foul for Carolina his second nice steal by leaky black he passed up the three steps in and misses the midrange jumper and our Carolina foul now working really hard here for Carolina Steve Kersh I keep watching walking Im going back and forth to the locker room to find out the status of Bangkok let me say this both Im just gonna get this off my chest Kirchner and also Eric bochner these SIDS mockery Im telling you they work so hard and I believe both guys should be in a sports information Hall of Fame wow I really do and theyre both great theyre both doing great on them so much WoW Caleb love and down with a rebound for Virginia Ryan Dunn a 68 freshman from Freeport New York does not play all that much for the hoos but getting some minutes here they need some size they really left side look at Beekman just going around and round but misses the lefthanded layup its a tough dangle there with that left hand Leia Washington Applause what is this what are we watching now dont get me I dont want anybody writing them Sandy Shaquille ONeal but I did it again Kimbell was the producer and it was like a comingout party for Shaquille against a great Arizona TEAM Arizona was loaded with all kinds of bits Sean Rooks Williams and Shaq was dominant Ive seen the mini now let me let me point this out because I dont want people hes talking about him with Shaquille Im not Im just saying that I get this little excitement I see a kid break out like this who hasnt done really anything like this during the year yeah it just hadnt gotten a lot of minutes right hed only played 21 minutes on the season coming into this game now in those 21 minutes to be fair he had scored 13 points that thats a lot of production but thats a couple of minutes here a couple of minutes there this is some real run against a great defensive team and he is meeting an exceeding expectations need it big time because the status of Bangkok got some womens games coming up for you for Virginia North Carolina Virginia is going to host Boston College Sunday on the ACC Network at noon Eastern and then next Thursday its a rivalry game for North Carolina on the womens side they host Duke eight oclock Eastern also on the ACC Network now Washington has gone to the mansion into the game a Virginia native number 24 Tyler Nichol from Harrisonburg Virginia about 40 miles away from here the guy who told me on Saturday can have some family and friends he was looking for tickets as leaky black knocks down to Corner three and North Carolinas lead has grown to nine you know leaky had three big threes in that game you do with Notre Dame so hes a guy hes a great defensive player we know that shooting a very respectable 37 percent from threepoint range on the season Carolina by nine hey Ill tell you one thing I had some pretty good players man I had some pretty good players three played in the NBA Tyler Long two rod they made me look pretty good 121 in a row one year Applause can Virginia get it going they had 10 points really early in this game LED 103 and have scored only five points in the longest time and even this year even recently they have had some long droughts they had a drought of seven and a half minutes not a single point in the second half against Syracuse on the weekend they did win that game last week at Pitt had a drought of almost six minutes without a point for a team that was pretty good offensively yeah they play slowly but theyre per Ken Palm they are 21st to the nation an offensive efficiency this is a good offensive team but they are prone to some dremels yeah they really are and I think right now theyre also quite into crowd down big time so thats been a big plus too Crows been a little silent people react from the crowd by the way you perform now the crowds trying to help him out a little bit trying to boost their Spirits Caleb love with the ball hes got five assists already tonight Don misses the three rebound Beekman could drive that basketball theyve done a good job on Clark Hawkins didnt have many looks hes going to go to the freethrow line right now got tripped on the drive now watching Luke Alex him play its talking to Tony Bennett yesterday on the phone and we talked about the luck today and I think about little guys nobody has ever ever done what a guy named Mugsy bogs did right I mean are you kidding me five foot three really about five two and to be as effective and as efficient as he was in the NBA and at Wake Forest I think he belongs to the Hall of Fame I mean what an inspiration to young people I think he heard a lot of times Dan I think you hit a lot of them you cant be sure to be a player you cant he said cant Ill show you and then Cody said to me do I know Mugsy three years in the NBA I played I had to guard him every day in practice together with Charlotte he said he wore me yeah he said thats why my knee hurts thats why my foot hurts its great to see little guys like this theyll make it proving that they can play with the big guys one of two for Clark three minutes to go in the half Carolina by six Applause Coy the screen to free up love a nice recovery there by the whos shot clock at 10 five yeah Applause took a match shot in the position this Virginia Defense had its best really that defines what theyve done for years defensively this is one of the few if any buildings in America where they get as excited for like a shot clock violation or a good defensive stand as they do for a dunk or a big three at the offensive end hey I like my Randy Newman team Im the six foot man Clark McGee Campbell down to UCLA and Ill tell you what Kendrick Davis Memphis and the kid right there Marquis Noel ready for this its unbelievable he has done a Kansas State he had 32 and 14 assists the other day and a big big win hes been brilliant all year what a job theyre doing in Kansas State what a week Jerome Changs team had they go to Austin they beat Texas they go to Waco they be Baylor right and Coach as an assistant thats right for 19 years under Scott drew and all of a sudden kstates 11th in the rankings unbelievable you know key player for them keonte Johnson healthy right great to see him back playing were hoping that happens with Lamar Hamlin as well it looks like hes headed in that direction Virginia has stepped up the pressure at the defensive end but why Washington scores on the assistant by nickel and a chance for a threepoint play for Jalen Washington youre talking about a Difference Maker it was silence on that bench when bacon went down and rightfully so hes such a smart player but I dont think they anticipated what theyre seeing right now out of jail in Washington what a plus this is I mean if Baker comes back healthy which we think he will credit to Steves uh reports to us and you add this kid in a steady rotation wow look at that stroke perfect follow through I mean he shoots the ball like Seth Greenberg would like to shoot it and if Seth would have put his players to shoot like that he wouldnt be working with us on TV Im only teasing and I know Seth from the time my first recruit was my first recruit was his brother and he was in the house the young guy that was at Rutgers thats a true story Franklin Applause and its down to Carolina scooped up by McCoy less than two minutes to go in the half Virginia just one for nine dick from threepoint range and that ran out into some stops they did a defensive stop here you want to go to halftime in a little momentum Washington again he was right there with that shot too right there crossover by Clark Ender plus wide open and boy did they need that one he could do that he could do that his dad played college basketball with Tony Bennett he had a big engine recruiting him and he got out of Ohio University that was a big big momentum three for them for a great ball pressure by Beekman shot clock at seven love the drive had to force it up and the follow will go for McCoy with a good offensive rebound man thats a big big play right there Applause something to keep in mind the last four times Carolina has been here theyve lost a nice flag how about that pass first see the cerebral ability Vision tremendous passing great cut for the Bill Davis Huber Davis is going to use the timeout boy Kihei Clarks been doing these kinds of things for years dick Music keeping the dribble alive unbelievable Vision huh little bowling from Clark a big bucket for Virginia to get him back within four but its Carolina led by Jalen Washington Off the Bench tonight for the injured Armando bacon who was led the way for the heels and theyve got a four point lead and the ball with the shot the shot clock turned off at the end of the first half oh boy and they turn it off a nice plan nice play solo selfie get back get back and an offensive foul goes against the heels a commode arrived here in Charlottesville thats on the side of the curves now hey remember this North Carolinas last four games here they have not scored 50 and theyve left lost with losses look at him he takes such Pride defensively were gonna look at his face I think hes happy he came back for a fifth year I think hes happy he came back for a fifth year absolutely you better believe hes happy if you want a potential turnaround here at the end of the half Carolina was up four with the ball and now Virginia can Tire Take the Lead vanderplas Applause and the first half comes to a close with North Carolina holding a twopoint Edge on Virginia Applause good battle between these two lots more fun coming from jpj but first back to the studio along with lafonzo Ellis Armando is in really good spirits he always is but the team will have to fight in the second half Dre thank you they have shown some fight that young man right there dick and youre watching him early Jalen Washingtons been outstanding two Rises and stores here we certainly have our star Andrea and we got Mr jail in Washington two Rising Stars Carolina ball to begin the second half here in Charlottesville both teams three and two in the lead Ive lost it gets it back threepoint shot has really been negating here tonight in between the clubs theyre five for 25 Applause RJ Davis trying to get into the paint and has it knocked Away by Armando Franklin but its still Carolina ball with four on the shot clock I think Hubert Davis has to be pleased with uh the fight that he has seen from his team Washingtons been great Justin McCoys got six rebounds Off the Bench well Ill rebound them to my eight plus eight right now against Virginia you would think that would help pay cut youre certainly the best rebounder in the ACC leaky black off the side of the backboard Jalen Washington a little shaken up he was reaching up around his throat but appears to be okay as he gets back on defense if North Carolinas going to leave you with a win first one theyve lost seven in a row here been in Memphis and three have to be made I love that certainly theyve just got to make some of those threes leaky black with a steal and a finish you know you look at black you look at Beekman two outstanding defensive players I mean right now Beekman by the way broke a School record last year in his steals he had 73 steals Franklin off the screen Davis stays with him Franklin left hand no and the rebound down to Black tell you what the Gordon has not given the kind of productivity they usually get from him yep very quiet one for two three points on the night swing it to Trimble in the corner into the paint and a foul called on Gardner triples a great athlete hes a defensive player hes made some great defensive stops in the games hes played hes got to work on his shot and thats something they think he will develop eventually hes got a great teaching here with Uber Davis they have many guys can shoot the ball better than you so Trimble at the line Mr basketball last year was a high school senior in the state of Wisconsin and that foul on Gardner dick his third and Tony Bennetts going to take him out here a minute and a half into the second half as Van Der Bloss comes in for him according to Southern great career we talked about it the only guy playing college basketball 2 000 points a thousand plus rebounds just been terrific in tonight North Carolinas a little terrific job on keeping him from Wheeling doing his thing and Trimble extends the Carolina lead to six Carolina has lost seven games in a row in this building and the last four to have it scored 50 points havent scored 50 points Marcus fouled got a great looking NBA Wednesday doubleheader coming your way tomorrow night game one itll be Giannis and the Bucks taking on Trey Young and the Hawks at 7 30 Eastern and then the number one team of the West the Denver Nuggets against the Phoenix Suns in the late game our coverage tips with NBA Countdown its seven Eastern on ESPN and the app Applause Clark underneath the bucket back out into the paint and called for the travel I thought it definitely walks right there took the extra step watch this right now he makes the turn they look like you kind of hopped on both feet yep good call by Ron gruver and a hedge there by Kaden Shedrick and he has called for the foul Chadwick certainly gives him a defensive guy inside but hes been limited offensively as well hes played 17 minutes in this game as attempted only two shots you think they go to him a little bit more especially without bacon on the floor Applause Im off to Davis eight to shoot now Washington and fouled by Shadrick so back to back fouls committed by Kaden Shedrick his first two of the night coming up I mean this guy is just hes impressed me so much number 13 he has been so impressed so skilled hes got really great skills and facing Triple Threat position and shoot you could drive you can pass great stroke and Armando baycott is back on the bench but hes in sweats so that seems to suggest that he will not be able to come back into the game play just a minute in 19 seconds sitting alongside Pete Nance a transfer from Northwestern who is out again tonight with a back issue so theyre without a star and another starter and theyre still trying to pull off a big road win here in Charlottesville I think the good news the good news right now for North Carolina is that big hunt doesnt have a serious injury Franklin no Applause and Virginia just unable to heat up from the perimeter tonight three ball not going down at all over the full head of steam got caught in the air through it out of bounds off Franklin Music Applause Shedrick is going to sit down now Francisco caporo is going to come into the game and yes it is half a row for years its been caffaro but we have been told that this year people who have watched Virginia games know this that the pronunciation that he would prefer is Catherine well what if he performs were going to give him what he prefers of course Applause foreign Applause coordination What A Catch and the seventh turnover of the Night by the Tar Heels tell you look right now in the ACC you got Clemson undefeated five and oh Pittsburgh Jim Capel doing a great job for it one we got a lot more balanced than people thought Miami is 41 as well then youve got six teams and three and two including both of these nice drive behold nobody will take it over thats a NoNo defensively and I guarantee that itll be on their film evaluation from a player its The A Team pretty good player alive Mr Lemo as well yeah but what if John Roy Williams did in his tenure incredible again deep into the shot clock good defense makes you take yeah extra time to try to get a shot Davis soft touch off the glass they want him to do board he and love they wanted to attack but Jack Attack tried to get fouled go to the freethrow election both guys like 80 free throw shooters Davis actually leading the ACC in free throw shooting this year at 88 percent Beekman no and a Virginia now two for 12 from

Porsche its available all you got to do is remember chance of hundred dollars is go to beatorg slash vital raffle borg vital raffle and we will sell it out tonight theres only 2 000 chances and only 310 remain available I know the Virginia and Carolina fans youre gonna get a chance on that car McCoy off the side of the backboard and brought down by Franklin and as you said earlier McCoy played in Virginia and transferred to Karen two years here and actually generally played more here than he has as a tar heel the last couple of years turn around Franklin his first field goal of the night and the whos are back within two you know theyre within two Franklin Shedrick and also Gardner have not been productive offensively and theyre right there not coming to the door so a little spark here for Virginia six minutes into the second half Davis Big Time shot for RJ Davis they needed that they did his drive a little bit earlier and they need the three ball he and love got to make some threes if theyre leaving with a W Clark followed by Franklin said Id like to do so I made earlier why not try and get another one Franklin transfer about him hes in a real struggle right now to Hoosiers and now a tie up on the drive by Caleb love and the arrow will give it to Virginia I think Uncle Moes in the house dude yeah if you quite a commode down a little bit if love and they will start knocking out a few threes tomorrows going to get louder if Virginia scores on this trip McNeely back into the game remember he took that shot to the face earlier Beekman and its a onepoint game tell you one thing I like pizza I like the way he plays he moves without the ball hes aggressive he defends thats why he led to put the school record and steals last year 73 he really loves playing defense man love a good look misses the three Vander plus the rebound and Virginia can take the lead and they will and the crowd loves him baby theyre jumping with joy cant dance jumping with joy they love it theyve got the lead baby they want to make it eight in the road trips for the guys from Chapel Hill coming here the 68 grad student transfer from Ohio gives the whos their first lead since the Midway point of the first half theyre booing McCoy the guy who transferred out of here and McNeely down with a rebound for the Cavs theyre wanting to pushes really on now the victory Lawrence from North Carolina they literally have to carry them if theyre going to get this way again no bait Khan rolled his ankle a minute 19 into the game back on the bench but in sweats and what do they miss last year pass and Beekman is heading to the freethrow line what a Nifty feed from Arman Franklin but then routed that last year they go ahead 29 Points 21 rebounds come back Andrea will have more for us a twopoint lead for the news over the heels we gotta go buddy we gotta go up oh welcome back to Charlottesville we have seen this Virginia team fight back they were down seven with 16 minutes left in the second half now have the lead and everyone on the bench for this Virginia team theyre wearing shirts that say UVA strong on the front and they have the last names of three football players that tragically lost their lives in November Lavelle Davis Jr DeSean Perry and Devin Chandler this team representing the fight that this university has had to show to pull together after that tragic incident guys horrible tragedy we were talking about it before the game and it is still on the minds of everybody on this campus absolutely it was senseless murders just drives you nuts why that happens and just uh Harkers out suddenly to Devins family LaBelles and the shorts just was so great to see a lot of love here on the campus when it happened obviously but also in the case of we look at tomorrow Hamlins situation the love among people black white rich poor ready religion didnt matter and we need more of that in our nation we need more of that love for one another caring about one another the more I tell you so happy I I really Im so wrapped up in that so happy to see where he has progressed yeah back in Buffalo now Beekman no and Vander plus give him Tony Bennett some great minutes off the bench here in the second half hey what up plus band The plus has been its incredible shooting the three there is the offensive rebound lucky but the outstanding guard for Alabama with the Bobcats last year as the heels get a much needed basket theres a nice drive to the basket it feels so talented they really are you know well coach Huberts done a great job with them Mark for three attention down with a rebound for Carolina you know puff Johnsons gonna step up hes got to give him some positive minutes hes talented he can shoot The Ball Brothers Cameron who plays now Phoenix Suns yeah over the uh knee injury unfortunately recuperating from surgery turn around Washington rolls off the rim and Franklin gobbles it up for the hoos terrific move right there by Washington we let good move just didnt fall down for the gift Applause Carolina began the season as the number one team of the nation had a fourgame losing streak late in November early December fell out of the rankings eleven and five right now three and two in the ACC as Virginia forces another turnover Virginias got some good wins speed Illinois Applause Music because hes going to knock down a lot of shots for the Cavaliers shell learn their name people hes going to be a special player here he does more than two just the three but he can shoot that three Vander plus and McNeely have been so big Off the Bench first thing he said was threepoint shooting and in 2019 when Virginia won the National Championship they shot 39 and a half percent from three this season has been their closest since then coming into tonight at 38 you see that three from McNeely first half Dan two for 11 here in the second half theyre already two of four this is a team that could get hot Dre thank you the four threes theyve got tonight are all from the two newcomers two for vanderplas and two for McNeely they want to transfer and one a freshman he made a big deal about that too say the bottom here deeper and bench has really been very successful short on the three Franklin the rebound the rebounding advantage that Carolina had through the first half has kind of disappeared as well rebounds are dead even right now 26 a piece vanderbloss quick release got it well hes not a nice touch he really does hes got the great rotation what a big plus this kid is nobody had a chance together because Tony played with his father in college and God knew him well his dad was a great coach Dick Bennett he coached uh his father RJ Davis with a three Davis became the 81st Tar Heel to surpass the 1 000 point mark that that a couple of games ago he needs a little help right now Loves got to put some points on the board Applause Im thinking about it couldnt get the shot off over leaky black so hell drive him shoot over to get it to go and after Franklin started the game over seven hes now converted on his last three well let me say this one of the reasons theyre getting that there no makeup Baker would shut that lane up right now theyre getting a lot of baskets around that threesecond area Washington lost it done saves it and then its knocked out of bounds Applause Ohio tomorrow night weve got some ranked teams four of them in fact that an ESPN2 college basketball doubleheader Alabama and Arkansas out of the SEC and then into the Big 12 for the late game between TCU and Texas great doubleheader tomorrow night on ESPN Tonight terrific right there but Alabama this looks so impressive Martins under the tough break they got a great freshman Nick Smith hes out with an injury to hope to get him back sometime during the year and traveling to Brazil out for the season after getting off to a great start this year and a shot clock violation on the heels okay what that defense step it up Caleb love has not been killed of Lafayette today he is one for eight from the field in this game he does have five assists but hes only scored two points in the game yeah hes really going to counted him especially without bacon on the floor you got to get at least 15 out of him Clark driving Davis got by him somehow that was the easiest layup he had Kihei would like to have that baby back you know one of the reasons why love may not be having much of an offensive night as he would go to the line here hes had Reese beatman on in the water tonight well big but such a terrific defensive player has no doubt about it takes the challenge you want to play somebody to play offense but getting him out of free throw line is big hes trying to get back in the groove but a Reese Speakman to the whos can get you out of your groove pretty easily Virginia leading Carolina by nine basketball he is presented by Progressive Insurance its easy to bundle your home into car insurance at progressivecom spot here in Charlottesville known as the corner Virginia welcoming in North Carolina today and leading by nine in a game that Carolina has led for a greater period of time than the whos had but whether its all finally catching up to Carolina without Armando baycod Virginia leading points in the paint 2618 leading points off turnovers 157 leading in blocks six to one and they have heated up in the second half Virginia shooting 59 percent from the field in the second half but also the value of Beekman on defense really has contained love because love is such an explosive score with great talent his point guard skills as well he can handle a bowl exception well a little pressure here football trap nearly gets right through it hes outstanding a high school player in West Virginia bark to the Elbow vanderplasch has been hot here in the second half Beekman inside and leaky black down with a rebound for Carolina Applause pivots turn around good almost play by black so they got a lot of experience you throw my black love and demons and Im in Big Time winning experience but what they did last year was unbelievable won a fifth year senior the other two Juniors and they were obviously huge Parts in that run to the national championship game halftime remember they have 16 I think at one point a Miss for vanderplas love the rebound and here he comes hes very strong very strong physically and away from the ball we got a call going against Jalen Washington of Carolina Applause leaky black right now shown his little versatility nice moving Lane good turnaround over jumper 12 footer goes down and his teammates love it they love it to the Leaky come on man lets go lets get out of Charlottesville with a W top to the guy Huber Davis was asked yesterday about him he said I love him on the court I love them in the locker room great guy to have in the program how about McNeely showing hes not just a threepoint shooter and Mr Bennett just said Hey Dad I love him too I got him for like another three more years I love him eight points for McNeely Off the Bench he and vanderbloss have combined for 23 Off the Bench for the Cavs tonight for Carolina 17 on the shot clock Seth Trimble returns now for the Tar Heels well he was really good the last couple of games wins over wake and Notre Dame especially defensively made some great defensive plays that were needed big time he can really guard love swings it to Trimble looking to kick it finds black for three and out of bounds to Virginia again the big story Armando baycott a minute in 19 seconds into the game rolled his ankle has not returned wearing sweats on the bench right now Jalen Washington was a monster in the first half much quieter in the second in Virginia led by in some ways Van Der Plaza to McNeely they really turned it up a notch in the second half never used to have a gun score youre the other score in there who are not in the game right now those are the guys on the bench because Van Der Blossom and McNeely are playing so well take everybodys face to shoot the ball Franklin soaring in couldnt finish it and its five on four right now for the heels Commander plus back into the play but not before love gets the three off and hits it to make it a fourpoint game you came by the big time click shot thats why hes been a special player in that Carolina uniform and Im just reflecting mentally on what Roy Williams did as a coach there it was just amazing the three national championships look at the benches See Shawn may just incredible 510 to go here in Charlottesville Virginia by four over Caleb love in the heels here in this ACC Caleb love that three with a 510 to go but you can see theres relief on his face hes two for nine tonight now they havent been going down for him and he was relieved as was Huber Davis that one went in theyre only down by four and theres a lot of time left in this game absolutely thats such a passionate love for North Carolina thats special it becomes contagious with your players Virginia gets it over they have withstood this pressure from Carolina relatively easily so far the last couple of minutes Applause is Carolina under man no baycott and no Nance as Franklin is going to the line now for the Cavs does a great job at ducking in getting the ball in that three second area as I said earlier you look at they caught we know about his presence of score inside rebound but its also his presence in that threesecond area defensively is such a big plus its the best big man in the conference Franklin had a nice game Saturday against Syracuse knocked down 43 scored 16 points had 26 against Baylor earlier this year didnt look like himself offensively last year his first year with Virginia but his numbers have gone back just about to where they were two years ago when he was still a Hoosier whos your player with the Hoosiers as well free throw shooter missed them both he rushed it was back on the floor you know played as many minutes he hasnt played this kind of minutes so stamina the physical side of its getting really something that he has to develop hes played more minutes tonight but he was played all season 20 21 minutes in six games coming into tonight 22 minutes tonight thats a big adjustment for a young guy tell you one thing they found gold there in that young guy Applause into Davis guarded by Beekman Kihei Clarkson love right now I love the spirit on the sideline of Hubert Rod no and Franklin the rebound he made a great drive just didnt finish the play did finish the play getting down to winning time right now Dan four minutes to go boy Armand Franklin got nine rebounds tonight there and into double figures and points now with 10 after being so cold early Virginia by four with just over four minutes to go vanderplas Beekman Franklin off balance too strong and hes down behind the play again five on four for the heels Franklin gets back Hubert Davis calling out a Play From the Bench I think he works harder than a players man he is unbelievable he has good luck leaky black and saved by Kihei Clark had a real good look here and you know Virginias not going to be in a rush at this end of the floor Applause patience patience spacing 15 17 feet apart eliminate help and the mental discipline required by the Capone to play 30 Seconds of Defense all the time great look counted and one for Franklin tremendous look great vision great call Mr Sherman youve got a chance in this business you had a chance Franklin will be at the line when we come back hes a little double double tonight double double Applause finds Franklin whos by six in yours that shocking result in Lexington that SVP was talking about is Kentucky losers again they lose on their home court to South Carolina a team that was beaten by over 40 by Tennessee on the weekend and uh next game for Kentucky tennis Tennessee on the weekend ouch ouch ouch top 10 team Tennessee right Rick Barnes has a heck of a squad they are deep they are experienced and they are as good defensively as any team in America yeah the one slip up gabiba Colorado David brilliant I love Rick Barnes Rick Barnes its been such a great help to me and my mother with cancer thats all I can simply say special award Applause inside three minutes to go love for free got it his second three in the last couple of minutes and its a one possession game tell you what the Love Has Come a big late in the game you expect that from a veteran a clutch player talented hes multitalented Music timeout called after the shot boy two big threes recently for Caleb love okay well get right in his face too its not really wide open come up big shooting like his boss Music and that was Schubert Davis who called the timeout hes still got one left Virginias got two left and we still got a lot of time here 246 to go plenty of time threepoint game plenty of time think about this now weve made it and weve documented it some people joined us late should have been with us earlier but theyve joined us late tell you this seven times in a row theyve been here and left with it all right you and I have been here a number of times we never leave with it else we live with a gonna check work steal money its a dummy look at the ACC standings how about the Clemson Tigers Brad Brownells team is 50 they beat Pitt on the weekend that was the battle between the last two undefeated teams Miami at 41 and then look at a whole bunch of teams six of them to be exact had three and two including the two that we are watching here tonight Music nominated for the Hall of Fame what about giving him a little tip of the Hat hes done a great job with the Kings yeah Isaiah Wong and Company theyre good team theyre going to be a force to be reckoned with in this league I want to say congratulations also Leonard another one of the 600th game as we know Tony won his 327th which broke the record here at Virginia Terry Holland had the record of 326 Terry Holland coached Virginia to a couple of final fours back in the early 1980s coach one of the greatest players of all time Mr Samson McNeely and vanderplas both still in the game as they have been for a long time for Virginian theyve both been exceptional here in the second half look at the great space in there yet you cant get help thats a wellcoached team are you kidding me now are you kidding me how about the Freshman looking around nobody to pass two shot clock running down let me bury a three he made four big ones against Jim mayheim and Syracuse Washington over vanderplas left it short at one point if Im not mistaken Virginia was one for 11 from threepoint range theyre now six for 19 so theyve made five of their last eight threes Applause how big is that its a threepoint shot changes the game and blocked from behind by leaky black its a big three look at his kids hes so confident shooting and so was his coach as Dan told you earlier a little story about Mr guard tell him that story again Mr Bennett what he said about about McNeely take the parking brake off he goes youre good you want to shoot it go shoot it he has earned the right one of the best ever shooting before in college sitting on a bench over there Mr Bennett yet sealer shoot up Bennett wed be here a while they they could both make some shots and one of the officials Ron Gruber is over at the monitor maybe a clock issue Applause the second to back on the clock so 124 and it is Carolina ball down by six you mentioned that fishes but what hell of a job terrific job again Carolina under man no Pete mans and a minute 19 in no Armando Baker they caught a business love oh yeah wow youre kidding me has she come up big here late in the game he has shown why hes so talented Caleb luck three big trifectas hes made well he can do this ask UCLA ask Duke teams that he was so terrific against in the NCAA tournament and again hes got Carolina back within three hes very Strictly Shooting the ball very streaky when he gets on oh no defensively what a breakdown nobody Communicator youve been watching time out go Music down by five inside 30 seconds to go and a held ball the possession arrow will keep it with the heels first of all he was trying to give him timeout then he started motion motion Applause that drive for the goal the backbreaking nobody rotating over nobody communicated you gotta talk to one another you gotta help oh Music its over its over that would be the day my friend Commander Plus and then hes back in time to come down with a loose ball and Virginia is going to get a victory and beat Carolina for the eighth consecutive time in this building Carolina certainly didnt play with their full arsenal yeah losing a guy like certainly Applause even made big plays wondering how to make the big play last year Virginia when they trailed at the half dick were oh and 17 a win tonight they are five and two in a game due to which they were trailing at halftime what a difference Caleb love with three late threes But ultimately you can see from the expression on his face Carolinas going to come up short Clark with a steal to finish it off and Virginia beats the heel 6558 here at John Paul Jones Arena terrific effort late in the game certainly by Virginia and the bench two guys left the bench they talked with some out Amanda plots and McNeely came up really big
