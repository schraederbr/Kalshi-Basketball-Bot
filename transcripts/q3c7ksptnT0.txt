py States won the last three and five of the last six and 10 of the 14 games played in this building and the tap is controlled by big Chad venning and here is Roger McFarland who works with Joshua Beetle Donald Han Jr Deon Brown and the aforementioned vinning Earl grants teams lost three straight two of those by combined five overtime Beetle dumps for V hell burrow in on middle Brooks cant finish and the rebound pulled away by Styles heres the pack with oconnell the veteran guard and of course Jaden Taylor Marcus Hill Styles oconnell and Ben Middlebrooks back in the lineup after coming off the bench in the loss to Louisville here on Wednesday night that ball got knocked Away by Brown it will stay with wolfback tend to shoot on States first possession both teams starting in manto man Boston College very aggressive mantoman defense and what you have to do with a guy like Marcus Hill and Jaden Taylor you got to keep them out of the lane heres Taylor off the inbounds hand right there now Taylor will flash in the paint fall away is good over the top of hand for Jaden Taylor Dan hes been struggling last five games all single figures 31 from the floor just six of his last 19 here is a steel and Taylor makes it four nothing now hes always been noted for his defense West he just stripped that ball away thats a really good sign for the wolf pack to get this one started and as Earl gr anticipated Inc State doesnt change their stripes if you will theyre still going to pressure you its a defensive driven program and theres Taylor Knocking it away from Beetle last Touch by Beetle says Mark snur so Jaden Taylors trying to turn the engine up a notch or two hes been very frustrated with his play recently but there he just knocks that one away Beetle tries and Beatles just got to be more careful with the basketball okell out front Styles thought about the three kick out for Hill Marcus Hill three straight double figure games in conference middle Brooks tend to shoot OK Connell against Beatles pressure Michael on the drive threw it up bounces away and here is hand Music and now heres vinning against Middlebrooks Well Chad venns had a nice year and he travels there middle Brooks is pressuring him defensively third turnover already on Boston College midd Brooks gave him some physical pressure and then backed off and as a result venning slipped and traveled venning youre right hes been really good inside and North Carolina state has had a problem particularly over their last two games given up points inside Welly this game started in a flurry hadnt it excuse me I should say NC State I got yelled at by BR Coran before the game so I told him I would try out front Taylor shot fake on a three step in two good Jaden Taylors got all six of NC States points W its going to be an upset if he fig finishes in double and single figures today yep heres Dion Brown he was terrific in Chapel Hill had 20 against Carolina in that overtime loss out of the corner McFarland long with the three Brown fighting for it Taylor wrestled it away and collects hesitates goes to the basket left it short draws the foul Jerry heer who works today with Mark snur and Pat Driscoll tags Roger McFarland with his first and the first on the Eagles so weve played three minutes a furious pace and the pace is each team they dont mind playing this way but NC State thats much more into their wheelhouse they like to get out and go and certainly the guy whos been leading him in that aspect is Taylor hes got seven now the first seven belong to Jaden Taylor Senior from Indianapolis comes in averaging just under 11 points in conference play does lead Inc state in steals per game as well hes already added to that total here got them both hes got all eight of the Wolfpack points yeah if he doesnt hit double figures today we got big Music problems here is Han OK Connell tries to stay with him pull up two for Donald Han junr cleanly through and Boston College on the board in just better than three minutes of play that may be the best part of Hs game hes got the strength to get in there and then he rises up and shoots that midrange jumper out front Taylor are still looking Marcus Hill trying to beat Beetle to the spot kick out for Taylor three ball away bounds away for Taylor Beetle the rebound transfer from Clemson looked at Benning thrown away to Taylor another steel heres the bounce pass Hill the Applause layup its going to be a long day for Boston College if they keep throwing the ball to the guys in the white shirts already four Eagle turnovers and theres a fifth and thats going to get us to a break Kevin Keats couldnt have asked for a better start to the script today at home here in Raleigh nor could Jaden Taylor hes doing the scoring Taylor founder of Hoops New York City in honor of Black History Month we saw Lou Lou version last Saturday and were getting to see NC States version here today sharp looking white jerseys and Trey Parkers into the ball game thats him wearing number five kicks to Taylor three ball got it Jaden Taylor has controlled all the scoring Dan hes got 11 hes also got three Steals and hes assisted on the other goals how about that what a start its an outstanding start Wes and Kevin Keats was saying he needed his veteran guys to step up well one of them half yep and stake the pack to an 11point lead here goes hand slashing through and hell draw the foul from Parker first on Parker itll be the first on the wolf pack and free throws coming Jaden Taylor recently has struggle to shoot the three but this is just a really nice job hes got himself in position catch and shoot hes playing with a lot of confidence that was a really good pass so Donald Han whos had 12 21 points in the last five games knocks down the free thr youve got to go back to Jerome Robinson Dan in 2018 to find somebody that scored more in a five game span than Han has in fact in the last 20 years Donald Han only Trails Jerome Robinson Olivier hanin and Tyrese rice for five game stretches now you wont talk about three cats that could go on a rip absolutely Jerome Robinson of course is from Raleigh played at Boston College terrific player Olivier Handlin was a bucket when he walked in the door and Tyrese rice played with really talented guys with Al Skinner but man he found ways to score too theres Parker hes been scoring missed off the front rim knocked out Taylor the rebound you see Dennis Parker Jr did not play the other night hes on the floor for the first time today jump shot by T middle Brooks The Rebound couldnt finish it and Boston College pulls it away with Roger McFarland now Ben midd Brooks I mean he gets the ball close to the basket sometimes he has a tough time finishing and missing on the jumper midd Brooks The Rebound Inc state in transition heres Hill in traffic had it stripped out got it back out front Taylor shot fake little entry pass from Parker heres middle Brooks then with a right hand scores on vett midd Brook midle Brooks played 19 minutes off the bench on Wednesday night had just four points and three rebounds NC State doing anything they want at this point on both ends of the Court 11point lead hand splits a double team drives and scores six for Donald H thats the only person theyve really been able to get Open West but BCs got to dig in here on the defensive end Chaz Kellys coming the ball game he was defending Trey Parker ball screen now for Taylor or got knocked away middle Brooks recovers it and a reach and a foul and its going to be on Donald hay going to be his first itll be the Applause second quick reminder to you tonight at 8 Eastern at the conclusion our mens triple header nothing but net breaks down the day and night in the ACC highlights analysis of every game looking ahead to the best games coming up next week its on acc Network and the ESPN app presented by tro price Miss at the wolf pack in from Brion pass and here goes Payne to the basket and draws the foul thats Fred Payne the sophomore from Grambling Louisiana and foul is going to be on Trey Parker thatll be his second and the second on the wolf pack so Trey Parker who had a lot of success here the other night 13 against Louisville 19 out at Stanford last weekend is in the sup with two fouls quickly and pain to the line for BC free throw good by Fred pay hes averaged 10 and a half points in the last couple of games for the Eagles hes really helped him West he he comes in with a reputation as an allout effort guy he can make a three but they need him they need him in terms of ball handling and defense because Josh beetle in the first two minutes of the game he had four turnovers yep and hes on the bench for Earl Grant Brion pass in the ball game he wears jersey number four for the now heres Parker 10 to shoot off the screen of Huntley Hatfield pass with six to shoot back for Parker three ball from Deep good Trey Parkers 18th triple of the year hes now nine of his last 15 from behind the line Dan and that thats what hes been doing Wes over his last five games coming in and providing that offensive spot and theres oconnell taking it away from Chaz Kelly lead pass and they tried to fire it around Dennis Parker did for Trey Parker and it ends up being NC States first turnover really good ball Movement by NC State and Parker you have to be able to find him he just relocates from the middle of the lane out to a place where he can knock down the three and BC loses Applause him well we started in such a flurry both these coaches have had to get into their benches a little bit here too so were seeing full subs for Inc State out front three ball missed about the hand of P heres Dennis Parker leading the break and hes going to draw a foul and transition from Fred Payne on the reach or Roger McFarland on the reach thatll be his second third on Boston College but the second on the transfer from South Eastern Louisiana Elijah strong coming in the game West and so now BCs going with their two big guys they were playing their four guard lineup trying to get some ball handling and that didnt work out so now lets see if they can use the two big guys to get some baskets inside yeah the red shardt freshman Jaden Hastings on the floor heres Huntley Hatfield out of the corner Parker Jr misses the three heres Chaz Kelly high bounce dribble score how about that Kelly averaging about three against the conference gets his first points won one thing that people forget that points in the paint stat thats just not necessarily a big guy with his back for the basket thats to the goal and finishing and BC is do doing that very well yep 8 and a half gone stayed in control Hunley Hatfield the Turning jumper and the foul on Hastings Brandon hutley Hatfield on the board Jaden Hastings the foul thats the fourth on BC wol patch up to an early advantage and its 10 as we get a timeout in Raleigh Music by official home Applause Music Applause Applause knew Jad tayor could be part of a return of the wolf pack to Excellence Dan and he has been today well hes got three steals already in the game and you know he got to the point where joshh Beetle they had to take him out of the game because he couldnt handle the ball but hes also gotten it done on the defense on the offensive end West 11 points the first time in what eight games that he scored in double figures there you see thats a pretty good start yeah after averaging seven and shooting just 31 hes been on a tear here to start and hes helped the wolf pack to a 10point lead as Brandon Huntley hadfi to go to the line after the foul a moment ago on Hastings he knocked down the turnaround jump shot after missing three straight games Hunley Hatfield started the other night at Four Points 10 rebounds of which seven were at the offensive end and now hes completed a threepoint play for his first points here this afternoon Chaz Kelly with Fred Payne Jaden Hastings Elijah strong and Donald H Jr on the floor for Boston College out of the timeout Taylors returned with Huntley Hatfield oconnell Styles and a push on hutley headfield and the afor mentioned Marcus Hill third on NC State first on the senior transfer from Clarksville Tennessee Boston College has six turnovers West and only seven field goal attempts so its hard to put the ball in the basket when youre giving it to the other guys NC state has eight field goals made in their first 15 shots 10 to shoot here goes Kelly lost his balance on the drive and Jerry heer I think is going to call Marcus Hill for the foul his first four on the wolf power lost his balance because somebody grabbed him by yeah Marcus Hill the transfer from Bowling Green another look here had him by the shoulder and pushed him down Kelly okell switching on the screens and boy CH Kelly took it right at him and scored second field goal go for the juner from Houston Chaz Kelly well Chaz Kelly took the ball and threw it back to Mark schner and Mark schner just gave him a warning to delay a game so the next time that happens itll be a technical foul and its not just Chaz Kelly its anybody right styles on the inbounds to conell heres Hill Taylor see Hatfield with a high screen for oconnell nice pass in the pocket and Hunley Hatfield to duny the Steady Hand of Michael oconor Dan and thats something that NC state has been lacking okell hadnt really played very well recently Kelly at the other end an easy drive and score see part of ok connells problem right here is he cant guard Kelly yeah and Kelly has been taking advantage of that so Chaz Kellys off of Earl Grants bench with a half dozen pretty quick VY State lead though still nine as we reach the Midway point a half one here in Raley Hill a spot up two got it Marcus Hill with four well Inc State hit 11 threes the other night shot 36 from the floor theyre a sight better theyre just under 59 here in the first 10 minutes of change and heres a steel hotley Hatfield Hastings to beat and hes fouled on the dunk Brandon went for the poster and the statue all in one swing cuz if he sets that down Bo another turnover Boston College Kelly just dribbles it off his leg and this this is where North Carolina state is NC State is at their most effective West when they can get out and go yep hudley Hatfield with five early now a couple of free throws hes 78 at the line this year one for one today at the two for two largest lead now the half and Luca Taves has checked in for Boston College he wears jersey number 10 hes a freshman from Tokyo has not scored in his last four appearances like go Grant is just looking for somebody who can handle the ball yep and hugley Hatfield hits him both States got 11 points off BC turnovers there have been seven of them for the Eagles and here is T who played at the Newman school in Boston and theres a back court foul on Taylor now Luca Taves if you say wait a second thats to ews yeah thats the thats the same way the NHL star Jonathan Tav spells it that is his cousin by the way ah okay who is a Stanley Cup champion among his other credits in HL par NHL all hes Jonathan T heres hand on the drive and it got blocked by Taylor hand cleaned it up and scored eight for Donald H Jun hand is an outstanding rebounder from the guard Music spot heres Brion pass Taylor quickly left side styles on the drive against strong fallway dropped in off the front rim first basket for dant Styles wolf pack has had problems shooting the ball at times this year West but certainly not in this first half NOP T to work off the screen by vinning dumps it back to him Chad with traffic in front still went to the basket knocked away with 10 to shoot no reset of the shot clock hand now on Taylor B away too strong missed everything pass a rebound of the air ball Styles almost traveled gets it back three away spins out Hill the rebound inside to foul on the Applause Eagles Taves is the guy they got yep first on Taves six on BC watch this Dan watch the top of the screen there watch Kevin Keats here him to go little hot step I dont even see Jeff Anderson offici say Jeff Anderson would be proud of that middle Brooks has returned to play inside back for pass tend to shoot Taylor working against Deon Brown now Brown went for the fake Taylor the step away middle Brooks trying to keep it alive and styles scrambles forward heres Taylor hes got a pass skips for pass quick dump down for Hill strong to the basket and fouled by venning Chad vinning will pick up his first its state Falcon and the free throw there bounces out for Hill Senor from Rockford Illinois whos got a couple of field goals to his credit ninth best field goal shooter in the ACC coming in he went over for two there guess we shouldnt have talked about the th points no well Im talking about the th points is fine hes an 83 free throw shooter in conference play Taves is running the offense here for Earl Grant the last couple of exchanges this is big Chad venning he cant find it he has yet to make a field goal West in fact thats only his second attempt out of the corner Styles left it short lead is 13 with the wolf pack and L and 7 and A2 to go into opening 20 minutes NC States lost five straight ACC home games after winning their first two three ball away no good and were going to get a foul here underneath on Dion Brown and Brown the transfer from Maryland Baltimore County eighth team foul against Boston college first on the young man averaging 8 and 1 half against the Music lead so Michael oconnell who is 66 as the free throw one well go to the strike front end of the one and one for the wolf pack s and he left it on the iron wow its three in a row missed by NC State lets see if B College can take advantage West they have really struggled on the offensive end first a little slow Vibe weve seen from the wol pack on offense here Dan right well their defense has been dominant in the game and thats been getting them good shots into the corner Brown cuts it Loose cant hit the wide open three oconnell for Taylor wide open in corner for Hill missed the three there Styles makes the save tried to throw it out for Taylor taken away by pay hell spot for three badly problem is when you shoot one of those in transition and miss it that badly that allows your opponent to get out and go theyre just exchanging misses now and a foul I believe on Styles or no out of bounds is the call on Taves who I wasnt sure if he was jostled or Not by dant Styles Luc couldnt control it so itll go back to NC State and here comes Paul mcneel into the lineup for NC State the 65 freshman from Rockingham North Carolina who had a season High 12 here against Louisville the other night mcneel a highly thought of prolific score and styles missing the three mcneel tried to knock it out and commits the foul six foul on NC State the First on B Neil heres the way the bench production Trey had 13 pass a dozen Paul mcneel a dozen now Dan Paul McNeil not saying he could score he broke a 73year record in the state of North Carolina including he had 71 in a state playoff game against Lee County theres a kick and a possession will stay with Boston College Wes its really interesting this time is the year most coaches are shortening their rotation but Kevin Keats is expanding his because hes just looking for help off the Baseline and thrown away another turnover ahead of the pack is mcneel layup good and a by mcneel Taylor a three spun out good heady play at the defensive end by mcneel 13 points off BC turnovers and Boston College has none off when NC state has coughed it up and thats just but twice here in this first half and theres a foul out on the perimeter thats really a good pitch ahead by o Connell and then he hits the ston and just comes right back in and takes the ball well and now hes committed a second foul so Paul mcneel literally the cup of coffee and hell pick up his second with 526 to go and one and one it will be on NC States foul here and the free throw is good for Deion Brown dont forget a triple header of ACC basketball for you next weekend well start our coverage in Chestnut Hill 200 Eastern time with Georgia Tech Boston College presented by food line then Dan and Al be in Dallas Clemsons got the week off after their win today at Florida State theyll meet SMU who host Wake Forest later tonight and Moody Coliseum and then Virginia Tech Miami our triple header on acc Network next Saturday that SMU weight game later tonight is a huge game for both teams and for the confer yep sure is heres OK Connell with just ahead of five to go in traffic couldnt finish middle Brooks rounds in Taylor on the kick out three got it Jaden Taylor has been terrific 14 points in this first half he had 11 of their first 13 Kelly on the drive tough shot in a basket for Chaz Kelly and to be honest thats been Boston Colleges best offense Kelly driving the ball to the goal four and a half to go BC drops back into Applause Zone kick out left side Styles and the rebound pulled away by Elijah strong whos playing back in his home state sophomore from Charlotte mon College just did something to change the pace on the defensive end lets see what they can do on the offensive end there goes Kelly hell feed strong couldnt finish vinning comes away with it right hand jump hook rolls off but a foul nonetheless I believe its on Brion pass eight on NC State first on the senior from Reedsville been a very frustrating first half for BC strong had the ball like two Ines from the basket and couldnt get it in yeah venning had a season ey 21 in the double overtime loss to Notre Dame thats his first point today it is yep hes the second best field goal shooter in the ACC at 55 Dan and he hit the second hes a really good find oh absolutely St bonovich you lose Quinton post you got to find somebody and he has helped offset the loss of post who his playing in the Utah Jazz organization under four to go Hill oh nice spin into traffic and Benning swatted it heres Brown now Kelly trying to use the screen strong gave it a quick look and then threw it away trying to go to venning here is pass ahead layup Parker had it blocked and hes foul so Dennis Parker Jrs going to get to the free throw line its a 12point lead for the Wolfpack just less than three and a half to go opening frame and Raleigh on acc Network free throws for Dennis Parker Jr and the first one no good the way the other night ended in Winston Salem Ill be really interested to see what the Deacon mentality is today in Dallas cuz you and I both know Andy infields group can light a fuse quick on you yeah they sure can and that kind of a loss is one that Wake Forest and won the Wake Forest T that can ruin you for the next two or three games so really important that wake be right mentally Y and oh boy in the cylinder is the foul here against Michael oconnell now oconnell is going to be a little worse for the wear here hes the one that took the forearm across but Dan immediately the signal from Pat Driscoll was a cylinder violation against okon take us through it wow the contact previous play is under review you know there looking at that and that contact was you know hes coming low to high and generally when the contact is vertical like that when you have a cylinder foul its not going to be a flagrant foul although it could be so theyre looking at that so the foul is on oconnell but you could have a flagrant file on hand as well its the ninth on NC State won you want to know what the cylinder is just imagine this stand out on the court and have your feet about shoulder width apart put the basketball in front of you I dont know and take a cylinder all the way to the ceiling right well no you put the you hold a basketball and you hold the basketball with your arms at a 90° angle and you hold the basketball in front and your cylinder you trace from the front of that basketball all the way around in a circle and so my cylinder would be bigger than yours because I got more in the back than you do uh and so thats the area where you cant invade that space now if you do invade that space that doesnt give the offensive player the right to Elbow you right and what the officials normally look at if the contact occurs with the elbow coming from down to up or from up to down thats one thing but if its a horizontal thing then generally they rule that to be a flagrant foul and when I originally saw that I thought it was more vertical up and down but as I looked at it they could they would be well within their rights to rule this a flag one foul and Pat Drisco you just saw the hand motion and thats kind of probably where the Tipping Point is here would you think yes the call on the floor stands its a cylinder foul against North Carolina State one and one so one and one will be the free throw exchange for Donald H Jr okay they spent a lot of time with that West and as I say my initial thought was thats not a flagrant foul and thats exactly what they thats exactly what they rule eight and a half for hand Ive always had trouble with that because if a guy gets in the cylinder and creates contact its just doesnt really seem fair to make call flr foul on the other guy yeah so here is the young man who was the 6A MVP in Commonwealth of Virginia that rolled around and went in little dramatic I thought for the front end of a one and one but nonetheless it counts when you take your drama away you can get it l just ahead of three minutes to go in this first half remember now Boston College West with 313 left they really need to get back closer they need to draw NC State a little bit closer to them if you can make this like a sixpoint deficit at halftime then if your BC as poorly as you played in this first half that would be that would be a very successful outcome 10point lead for the pack and heres okell with Kelly on the floor out a pass against Brown hell fire for three and hit Brion pass 19th triple of the year and thats what hes able to do West if he comes in the game and he knocks down a couple of Threes And thats really big time out front theres Han missing on a three rebound for Dennis Parker ahead for Mar Marcus Hill slapped off the glass by Hastings McFarland the other way for the Applause Eagles and lost it on the drive turned it over I thought that was the right pass to hand in transition but BC just really forcing it on the offensive end Hastings does a great job catching up to this play no question about that Jaden Hastings has turned into the best shot Blocker of the Eagles have seen in about 20 years you got to go all the way back to Shawn Williams in the 0405 season to find a guy who has posted block shots like Jaden Hastings has he leads him in conference play with 16 by the way that was coming into today and theres another one now Im going to give you a stat here that is his 10th Game of the Year with two or more blocks thats the best since Shawn Williams had 16 of them during the 2004 2005 season and R interestingly enough he doesnt really play all that many minutes Music correct we get the Kim promy blocks per minute hed be amazing and that ball is off the back iron and here is paint under two to go 13point lead after the pass Triple A Moment AG go now hand in the Eagles Dan told you single digits a be a big deal going to the locker room if your Earl Grant theyve been playing uphill from the jump hand out of the corner got it triple from Donald hand hes now got 13 in the first half and Russ we showed you before the game over his last five games hes shooting 44 from that there so in your mind they need a stop and a score here absolutely middle Brooks to Taylor who helped the wolf pack get off to a terrific start today Taylor gets hand tend to shoot now Hill into traffic a block is Applause called so the blocking call will be on hand and thats his third with 71 seconds to play now he never left the floor so thats not one of those Airborne shooter plays he just never got in position and Dan I dont know if the juice is worth the squeeze on that one right there for Donald H I would agree with you you got to understand the situation you cant be in foul trouble and the free throw good for Hill Marcus hill now with five in this first half were going to have to go back and do some accounting here because they have Donald H with two fouls not three well see if we can get it adjusted strong got one of hands well if hes got three fouls hes got to come out of the game but obviously he does not Elijah strong should have been awarded a foul we inadvertently accounted for Donald H so we got our return straight here as we close in on the final minute of this first 20 and theres hand on the drive and now its a 12point game in the W packet transition and Brion pass and one what a terrific bounce pass pardon the pun to Brion pass but again Donald hand forces a shot and sometimes when you take a bad shot that gives your opponent the opportunity to go out and go and thats an outstanding pass to two Music pass and Wes that is a really tough finish hes Ved for his threepoint shooting but good Heavens thats a tough finish so Brion pass with five and a chance to make it six hes 11 of 13 at the line this year and he completes the threepoint trip nice first half again for Brion pass off a dozen the other night and Boston College did have an opportunity to cut it to single digits but now its back out to 15 theres a hand check on Dennis Parker thatll be two free throws coming for the eagles with 449 to go Kevin Keats has to be very happy with the way his team has played defense today theyve been very aggressive theyve had Boston College back on their heels since the start of the game CH Kelly for the first of two and the free throw good dont forget Thursday night ladies night here on acc Network womens basketball double header will start in central New York Carolina visit Syracuse at six and then Virginia Tech host Stanford at8 right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN Kellys the into double figures for the Eagles hes got 10 in this first half Donald Han Jrs got 13 13 points is the difference for NC State Marcus Hill weaving through heres Taylor Jad tried to get by Fred Payne all the way to the basket blocked by Hastings but I think the foul is going to be on pain thatll be the first on pain two free throws for Jade Taylor Jaden Taylor started this game like it was going to be his night it still might be its been a pretty good night Id say so hes got 14 in the first half the lead all scores he also had three steals I think early in the ball game too oh had three steals in the first minute of the game yep still credited with three steals hes got three rebounds 17 minutes of play hes added another point on the free throw there very boner likee first half for Jaden Taylor well he doesnt have enough foul doesnt have enough fouls yeah thats it 15point lead stolen by middle Brooks boy oh boy and then turned back over to Kelly a rare giveaway the wolf Packs third turnover this first half Boston College has turned it over 13 times and a timeout to use it or lose it for Earl Grant with 5 and2 seconds left I tell you this the 48yearold head coach of the Eagles going to have a small prayer meeting over there well be back in a second with their turnovers on the offensive end they put so much pressure on their defense so North Carolina State theyve really taken advantage heres hand 4 seconds Taylor trying to defend hand in traffic lost at Marcus Hill and that wont count by pass half is over and Inc State controlled it St to St Dan absolutely on nine shots from the floor and and the Steals and the turnovers big part of NC States artillery in the first 20 minutes as The Wack has the ball and the 15point lead original starters out there for both schools well back to part Kelly has come on the floor to replace Beetle as Hill Burrows into the lane and scor eight for Marcus Hill on his third field goal that was a very bad start for Josh Beetle Id be surprised if we saw him again yeah McFarland hard drive left the land against Styles and they just have not been able to get the ball to venning heres hand three ball away Styles collects a Connell and the Wolf Pack well if they start the second half like they started the game thatd be bad news for o Grant rolled off the iron McFarland the rebound I think the Boston College absolutely has to get Ving inv B yeah heres the big fella gets middle Brooks skip out for hand takes off to the Baseline in traffic put it up foul and itll be on D Styles itll be his first first of the half on Kevin keatss Applause club and Donald H Jr will go to the line 13 in the first half and of course ACC history his dad of course played at Virginia late 90s into the 21st century and average 12 and A2 points they became the first father son to receive ACC player of the week honors this year and now Donald Hasan junr has received his second one yeah his dad only had the one remember two years ago he had an injury and it ended up being red shirt last year and we were talking about this with Earl Grant he kind of slowly remember they had Jaden Zachary on the floor they had other guys out there and it was he didnt really play a lot until Dan double figure minute eight of his last 10 games and even when you have a tough year you cant discount that last quarter last third of a regular season and what it might mean the next year to a player right BC didnt have a tough year last year they won 20 games yeah Eagles went to the NIT a season to go for Grant they finished 11th by the way dont forget that they finished 11th in a 15 team ACC with 20 wins theres a spot up by Hill Front Miss Ving a nice box out of middle Brooks and the other thing I think Boston College needs to do is they need to get down the court quicker and score and transition theres not very very many easy baskets against this NC State Defense Applause eight to shoot for hand way out front and dble H quite frankly has gotten off to a tough start from the floor here at the front end of the second half hes 0 for two after being four for nine in the first half middle Brooks was left open the PCH one to the pull the trigger he wanted to get it oconnell and let him shoot Michael okell on the board all right you take M Brookss opinion there instead of the Ben the bench the bench was hyped up about a three from Big Ben they didnt get it Michael okones with just his 20th three of the Year lead is 18 feels like a bad danger zone here for BC Dan early in half two doesnt it well it really does and again theyre having to work so hard for anything that they get Kelly back for Bing and he dunks it home might have interfered with it not sure well that would have been typical of the way things have gone for DC today sure would have almost four minutes gone and Taylor stripped and fouled 1641 to go foul will be on McFarland its his third its the first of the half on Boston College Jaden Taylors going to get a couple of free throws Taylors made all four of his free throws today yep got 16 had it all in the first half so senior from Indianapolis who played 65 games in two years at Butler and the first one goes down we told you at the top here are the stakes now for BC and NC State this the bottom eight of the league Miami lost today at pits so theyre 2 and 12 the winner of this will move closer to Syracuse you see the five two difference that three game difference in the wind column as the day started day that is a big number with three weeks left to go it is a big number and what you have if whoever wins this game since its the only time these two teams play this year will have the tiebreaker if it comes to that yeah heres Kelly on the drive and a whist on a foul there on the ball that got Jarred loose and I think middle Brooks his first second on the wolf pack the Wolfpack defense has been so aggressive that Boston College is really having a hard time running their stuff that the NC the NC State Defense has forced them into playing oneonone which is a reason why venning didnt handling the ball very much heres Benning Burrows down just glass middle Brooks and scores six points now for Chad vinning from Brooklyn to 35 Hill picked up on his dribble each team scored six points here in the second half almost the first four minutes Fall Away by Taylor good wow Jon Taylor now with 19 and hes having himself a game yep he had 18 against Cal 19 today thats an ACC high for Jon Taylor Ving a fall away and another foul on middle Brooks will be a second thatll get us to a timeout free throws from BC on the other side after middle Brooks picked up his second foul but Jadon Taylor started the game hot and right now hes helping the wol pack keep the Eagles at Beyond Arms Reach Andy state by 17 when we continue from Ry and nice to see the banners celebrating last years tournament title and r to Phoenix venning hits the free Applause throws Chad venning now with five in the half make it six and eight in the ball game and Boston College West for all the things theyve done poorly today theyve made all 16 of their free thr shooting it like Koozie he used to coach him fact he coached Boston College the first time these two teams ever played Dan Bob Koozie was the coach heres Huntley Hatfield he got fouled by venning on the way up two shots for Brandon Huntley Applause Hatfield I dont think Chad thought it was much of a foul but enough for Mark snner to blow the whistle Wes its really hard to reach in like that when the guy is going up for the shot if he can reach in on the dribble thats one thing but referees rarely allow that another triple header for you next Saturday on acc Network the Eagles will be at Cy Forum welcome Georgia Tech presented by food line at 200 I think were excited about our first visit down to Dallas absolutely yeah SMU Clemson at Four B and I be there with the former president of the United States as suspect and then the hes and Canes wrap us up from Wasco Center next Saturday night 6 o on acc Network well hes a big fan he is a consistent attendee at the Moody Coliseum and if youre going to go to a game the Clemson game would be one to go to today in next already right Duke visit and theres a nice pass benting to catch and flush oh what a good look from Chaz Kelly 10 in the game for vinning he actually lost control of that ball Wes he was still able to poke it where it needed to go Music three ball by Hill and the rebound comes away for Han So its 15 with 14 and change to go here in Raley that three is the weakest part of Hills game so nice defense that time Boston College avoided the mismatch inside heres Finning working on Hunley Hatfield right hand jump hook good Chad venning starting to heat up here Dan hes not hes not getting down side on the Block and playing with his back to the basket hes catching it out by the foul line and dribbling into the lane last 10 for the Eagles belong to the big man from Brooklyn well felt like a danger zone a moment ago now DC this might be the Run Earl Grants trying to get his team Back In Contention it was almost 20 heres okado with four to shoot fouled by Kelly and W what we what we just saw was a continuing theme that weve seen the entire game and that is Boston College is able to force a difficult shot but they commit a foul so okell will go to the line after the first on Chaz Kelly theres the venning dunk and then heres the jump hook too against H Hatfield again what were saying hes taking the ball near the foul line and dribbling it down to the basket and thats a tough shot he just made fre throw by Michael Ood he has four in the half and Luca Taves back into the ball game for Boston College first time weve seen him in the second half and here comes the fire starter from the other night Trey Parker the 61 freshman from fville North Music Carolina and ell hit both threee thrs well the pack had played 10 guys and only Dennis Parker Jr hadnt scored but he did good things defensively when he was in the first half right Dennis Parker Jr on the floor now he wears number 11 for state that ball got knocked away Jaden Taylor another hand in the passing Lane and a foul on Brown thatll be the fourth on the Eagles and the Third on Dion Brown here in the second half venning trying to make a spectacular play Wes and you really didnt need it you need the easy play just every time you think Boston College might be ready to climb back in turn it over or they commit a foul 15th turnover Dan on BC today and interestingly enough weve played 6 and2 minutes thats their first turnover in the second half and NC States got 13 points off the 15 turnovers oconnell off the Huntley Hatfield pick nice pass Brandon the catch and score good pass Michael oconnell and thats where used to see him from okon a guy who finds his teammates he struggled over the last couple of games heres Taves working against Parker catching shoot by hand got it oh boy we look right down the barrel with him there didnt we absolutely and that didnt look like there was very much going on for BC a lot of dribbling but hand just finally cuts to the top NC State lost in that time 18 now for Donald H junr skip into the corner heres Parker trying to squeeze around strong gets it to Huntley Hatfield hell spot up rled out for hands rebound boxon C needs to push Carell went for the steel pay back for hand and a foul on Taylor will be his second just the third of the half on the wol pack what a dangerous pass that was I thought oconnell had it yep so Taylor will go out Marcus will check back in for NC State Jaden Taylor now with 19 in a game his season high is 22 his career high 28 a year ago against pit look at Taves to put it in play and finally a timeout had to be called wow so well step aside Earl Grant didnt want to give it away again his team Trails 14 and Raleigh will we by 14 somebody snaps a streak today heres venning with the left hand over Taylor out of the ti out Chad vennings having quite a second half hes got a dozen in fact hes got all but five of the Eagles points here in the second half theyre throwing in the ball heres OK and hes bumped in foul by venning on the perimeter thatll be three on Chad venning five on VC and thats a foul if youre vening you just cant get that one hes a veteran player he cant be following o Connell that far from the basket hes going to come out of the game J Hastings to the table for Earl Grant across the way here goes Parker kick out for Marcus Hills Lefty three Off the Mark Fred Payne the rebound and 8 minutes gone second half and the Eagles Trail it dozen kind of right back in that neighborhood again here Dan theyve been here once or twice andc State pushed them back each time strong the Miss pay couldnt handle the rebound last Touch by the Eagles and that will get us to a timeout 1139 to go in the ball game at a rolling W pack by a dozen Miami and Virginia Cavaliers trying to even the Commonwealth clash with the hokes who won by a point at Charlottesville a couple weeks ago and thats not normal for those teams to win on the other win on the road nope usually the home guy has a clear Advantage Parker for three nope and Hastings the rebound of the Miss for BC Eagles to within 12 hadnt been able to cut it to single digits though in a long long time they gotten in this neighborhood hadnt been able to carry it over 11 minutes to play Cal and Georgia Tech follow us in game two of our ACC Network Hoops triple header today Taves at the foul line leaner blocked and recovered by Hill heres Trey Parker he will love and lay it up do Dennis Parker Taves is in the game won so I dont have any objection to himot the ball but I dont think Taves can shoot the ball on a position with Donald H hadnt touched it heres Hastings for pay back inside Hastings the catch and the rebound for Hunley Hatfield Taylor wants these guys to go yeah Jaden Taylors been the guy today for the wolfback spot up at 18 ft bounced out if DC is going to make a move W they got to start it soon heres hand hell touch it this time and draw a foul and I think that is three on Jaden Taylor Jerry heer out from underneath and in fact it is on table that doesnt count as a turnover steel West but that block shot is the same thing as a steel really nice fast break as well North Carolina NC state has been able to get out and do that third foul on Jaden Taylor fifth on the pack heres Donald Han at the line and he knocks down his third free throw of the half so he now has six in the half and 19 in a game and the Eagles are perfect at the strike so watch this yep every time tell you what were responsible sitting right over here for all of that make no mistake we are responsible for nothing thats exactly right my whole point out be very sarcastic okay under 10 to go yeah BC hit 17 in a row till old Durham started talking about it and that ball got kicked out of there kick saving Beauty usually the ice is down when things like that happen heres Taylor oh he had an alley oh bounce pass Parker had it blocked by Hastings and the hell ball is going to go to Boston College and Jaden Hastings if nothing else has got terrific timing this is not an easy play either way and that is perfect timing Dan defensively well its perfect timing Wes and he uses his body very effectively hes able to go straight up in the air and put his hand out there to block the shot does fire in with his body third block shot for Hastings here today and the lead still 13 for the wolf Music P that got swatted out hand trying to score in TI look at Trey Parker running the offense and another Alle oh my goodness no blocking that one nope and DJ Burns sitting here to our right might to live stream the whole thing wol pack got it in gear and finished with the flush heres pay with seven to shoot and a foul on it Applause State watch Trey Parker Boy West that is a really interesting pass up for grabs is what it was and look at Burns documenting Music everything middle Brooks his third foul a moment ago that is six on the pack with 45 to go to a 15point lead kick out three rolls in for Elijah strong first points for the sophomore from Charlotte he played at Myers Park 12point lead again for NC State and strong is actually Boston Colleges third leing score in ACC play but hes missed some games and hes trying to work his way back into the lineup Jaden Taylor t to shoot working in traffic tried to bounce it out of turned it over heres pay hell lob strong couldnt collect they kick it for hand hell fire and they Scramble for it itll be run down on The Far Side Kelly for strong again nope and Hill collects Marcus Hill averages about five rebounds a game in conference play does a terrific job for a guy listed at 64 whos not even close Parker at 17 ft didnt get the bounce the wolf pack West has not been able to get out in transition as much in this half which is why their offense is sputtering a little bit but their defense continues to be very very good s and a half to go on the drive and the miss that time for hand heres Dennis Parker lay up good ends up all the way in cwell but has his third field goal C drives the ball to the basket takes himself out of the play and as a result NC State is able to get a run out much like the one they had throughout the first half Dennis Parkers got six in the half SE basketball presented this afternoon by food line the official grocer of the Atlantic Coast Conference well a series that started December 1967 at B Boston Garden how about that there you go in an event called the Boston Garden Invitational when Norm Sloan was coaching the wol pack and Bob Koozie was coaching the Eagles is renewed here today NC State trying for their fourth straight win against Boston College and the pack trying to snap a nine game skid here this afternoon strong to work out of the time out against dant Styles and lost it w pack is all the way and theyre up 14 with under seven to go W only had they LED all the way they havent really been threatened 16 turnovers by the way for BC heres OK Connell T to shoot tried to bounce it the middle Brooks that got kicked by Dion Brown shot clock the hold with nine well conell is back up to his old tricks hes got four assists today no turnovers hes got a nice job moving the ball getting the w P offense in position I thought Kevin Keats was pretty candid with us pregame too Dan about where the mentality of his basketball team was thats hard to do when You head to the sequence like NC States had heres a kick for Taylor shot fake three ball away and styles the rebound hes going to get called oh no theyre going to padris going to whistle Kelly here ah is backing into him thats it second on Kelly sixth on the Eagles but Kevin Keats when youve lost nine straight and five have been by six or less okay the ability to be unfiltered is pretty important yeah I think so especially when youve had kind of the success they had a year ago and now you know there was some optimism youre in the top half of the ACC in the preseason poll things of that nature that ball got knocked away itll stay with State the idea though that you go through a sequence like this hey look you still got basketball to play theres nobody saying you cant go tournament you determine whether you go to the tournament or not and I think thats kind of what he was trying to say and it was almost incumbent upon his players some of the older guys especially I think to kind of re renew their ties a little bit about this team but you certainly dont want to put yourself in a position where you have to win five games in the ACC tournament to go to the NCA tournament every year but its obviously possible yeah of course you have to make the ACC tournament first of all yeah thats the other issue only 15 are going three will St home this year that got blocked by Hastings terrific swap now back for Taylor 3 pushed up its off the mark Hunley Hatfield battled and that was last touch I think by Styles Marner awarded it promptly to the eagles with 601 to goley Hatfield is a tremendous offensive rebound I mean hes got almost an ACC play hes got almost as many offensive rebounds as defensive rebounds so the lead stays 14 rebounds are even at 30 skip for strong they got hand on the bench momentarily and theres a foul on Styles second on Dantes Styles its the seventh on NC State with 543 to play and theres Kevin Keats with Levi Watkins Kareem Richardson Brett Nelson former Florida Gator all on that Applause Music bench and free throws now for Elijah strong strong who a year ago averaged about three points in a rebound in conference play only played seven games in the ACC a year ago and he missed the front end so heres the rub on this if he misses here Dan oh no was the front end got knocked out of bounds if he misses both in the second half and theyve been pretty good shooting they were already looking for the chicken they were SW enough to thr was one and one so they werent looking for the chicken Music yet Taylor for Huntley Hatfield theyll try and drive Kelly pull up at 12 fet and the rebound for Music pay here goes pay through traffic Scoops got his own Miss and a foul Two Shots coming I believe for pain Styles is third eighth on the wolf pack the NC State offense has not been as good in the second half as the first half and thats because they havent had the Steals and create the turnovers but their defense in the half court has really forced Boston College into some tough opportunities yep third point for pay dont forget Thursday night double header of womens basketball on acc Network Alysa usby in Carolina at Syracuse at 600 and then Virginia Tech welcome Stanford to the castle 800 pm Thursday night presented by allly on acc networks pain hit them both hes got four been averaging 10 in the last two for Earl Grant 12point game again ahead of five minutes three on pass is checked into the game Dennis Parker Jr on the floor Jaden Taylor and Ben Middlebrooks heres pass and hell shove it to conell with six to shoot now Middlebrook challenging Hastings with the right hand B Middlebrook second field goal its very important for NC State that they get something out of their big guys inside and midd Brooks has had a fairly nice game today strong on the hard dribble against Parker and a foul Hastings dunk follow on I count instead Dennis Parker Junior his second foul ninth on the wolf pack now you have a chance for chicken Parker Jr by the way is from Maggie Walker High School in Richmond and the dragons I think is their nickname heres strong hes 67 first one no good hes got work CDE Austin thats where I was going with okay all right Clyde the Glide was from Maggie Walker well here we are Elijah strong determines if they get chicken free throw away and no good and pay thought he had the rebound no stepped out of bounds itll Belong To The Wack and Earl Grant is furious with Jerry heer and theres a technical foul on Earl Grant hes going to get tossed and he might buy another one hes got to be very careful so out of bounds the ball to Inc State and now technical foul on Earl Grant two shots and the ball anyway on the Miss watch the ball head over to the side Applause Music line P stepped out of bounds well there was a little bit of compact there West but certainly a foul could have been called but I think o is frustrating oconnell is now 3 for six at the line and the ball was belonging to the wack anyway 15point game with four and a half to go Eagles have lost three straight the last two and a combined five overtime and nine of their last 10 they would love to get this to overtime somehow today West Music but that doesnt seem light heres okell into the corner follow away on the Baseline and the rebound Donald Hs going to need to go on a tear here and quick a pretty quiet second half compared to his first half hes got 19 theres pay a three thats good Fred Paynes first field goal hes got now seven in the game and its a 12point game and a timeout is taken by Kevin Keats with 349 to go so NC State burns the timeout 12point lead somebody takes home a win bounds to Aon against BC pressure Eagles Trail by 12 under four to go you follow BC at all and you know what they did against Florida State and others youd say this is their sweet spot well see some of this is going to be on how NC State handles it too Dan tend to shoot for Marcus Hill at the top double team coming skipped to the right corner Dennis Parker Jr too strong with the three Ving the rebound Boston College does not have a lot of time and again NC State does a great job getting back on defense nothing easy so far for the Eagles heres pay into traffic TR of force it up got deflected out of bounds last Touch by the wolf pack 17 to shoot I have no idea where Fred Payne was going I dont think Fred Payne did either but Wes thats the type of thing weve seen not that exact way but whenever BC drives into the lane they draw a complete crowd so heres Kelly out of the corner three bounded away and what do we got we got bodies three of them down two in the white Pat Driscoll has what play jump ball and possession to Music L here goes Dennis Parker all the way to the basket oh and he had it locked away turned over oh Kevin Keats fired up his own team didnt take better care of it hand a deep three Donald and drops home another one 9 and a half 22 in the game now theyre back to single digits with 237 to go heres hill now going to get a 10 second VI and they got it front Court just in time Parker over to Jaden Taylor now to O Connell Earl Grant and his staff shouting deep offensive instructions seven to shoot you dont want to foul now if your BC heres middle Brooks on the pass strong lay up good nicely down oconnell there six for Middlebrooks back to an 11point game midd Brooks finish one early in the game but hes finished them all since then heres Benning bothered by middle Brooks he lost the rebound theyre going to call hell ball and thatll give it to BC so its 11point game with 156 to go Boston College going to get the ball well Donald Han knocks that three down and all of a sudden you felt this building get a little nervous didnt it when youre on a n game losing streak you can understand the nerves but theres only a minute 56 seconds left Kelly puts it in play this is Roger McFarland there are four legitimate threepoint Shooters on the floor heres Donald H thats a two front rim Miss Kan the rebound couldnt finish it out front Kelly three ball away back rim look at ell go get 90 seconds to go in Ry heres okell 12 to shoot off the middle Brook screen bounce for Ben again back door cut Parker foul on McFarland spth thatll be the ninth against Boston College or eighth against Boston College of course middle Brooks wont get an assist for that West but that was a heck of a pass Dennis Parker Jr whos got six here in the second half he only had two points last Saturday at Stanford didnt play the other night against Lou hes got seven today and Dan he only had five total points in the previous six games prior to Wednesday night and hes got seven today goes back to what Kevin Keat said somebody else has got to help right we talked about expanding the roster earlier Parker got one of the two its a 12point game with 72 seconds left we mentioned before they played 10 guys and 10 guys in scor y heres Kelly down a dozen with a minute to go kick out venning on the line thats a two and a foul will be called on the wolf pack and its against Marcus Hill second on Hill that is 10 now on NC State with 554 left to go so a couple free throws for Roger McFarland first trip today hes 18 of 30 this year which works out to 60 BC came in 15th in conference play at 70 and the free throw good
