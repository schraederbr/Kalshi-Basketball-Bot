set to go in ACC play Louisville and Virginia Tech from blackburg kid against trainer and off and rolling in the ACC on a Sunday afternoon sky Clark whos been a big part of Louisville with some better play as of late hes going to have the ball in his hands a lot today down on this out and you can see Hunley Hatfield multiple screen ball screens will have it right open three they havent shot the ball at will Louisville this year but that its a good start for them Trey white is one of the guys that has given them a lot of scoring 15 points a game second behind sky Clark for the team lead this is the starting look for Virginia Tech they dont have MJ Collins in the starting lineup today but he is expected to play again and heres and heres Couture youre so worried about taking the three out you overrun him and he gets a basket right to the right to the rim on the drive on the close out the starting look for Louisville White and Clark do most of their scoring and they have the first two baskets in this game great back screen action they they wor through that today in shoot around Virginia Tech cover that exact to Lis back when you were talking about points in the paint against the hes its not just big guys its drivers and guards drivers its not going to be just throwing the ball to the Block its going to be penetration passing to the paint off the cuts theres Robbie Baron hes swatted JJ trainer knocks it out of there thats another place Virginia Tech can turn two for some post scoring as Robbie Baron at three is L heavy for Mike James well look I would tell you right here with Louisville they theyre big theyre not scoring a lot in transition offense and fast break opportun they do try to get a lot of drags off there padulla is short thats something he got youry on him hitting shots today yeah theyre going to need padulla to score hes got to be better than he was against Auburn they got great drive to the paint one more and James made the correction from that same spot absolutely and Louisville earlier sh was working on those type of plays getting the paint kicking out one more passes for and they havent been a high assist team this year right now last couple shots have been off of assist Louisville looking for the early season version of Mike James really good out of the gate theres Baron thats too strong rebound for Louisville and you can see Virginia Tech only sending one to the glass everyone got back theyre trying to guard and set up their wall defensively because of the amount of drag screens and ball screens that Louisville set in early offense this will be a fun match up today Couture and sky Clark two of the better guards in the ACC heres Trey white going to work and he is dangerous from the midrange but not here no and then theres a good box out there with Virginia Tech keeping Louisville off the glass Louisville is a really good offensive rebounding team thats one of their ways they score second and third chance opport not there for Tyler nich Virginia Techs going to need to make some fre that is ay thing for Virginia Tech offensively coach Youngs team is all about making threes as well too they havent shot the ball well the last two games thats a little Long offensive rebound though kept alive thats what Louisville does thats what Louisville does they they they live on that glass and thats an offensive foul Hunter Couture in to take it interesting see on the right now just on the pace of things Conor just on on how the pace is going its I would say its Advantage Louisville right now interesting that the mount the new rule with the charge very hard to get a charge call if you get off in the air but if your Feets on the floor youre able to take a charge theres badulla On The Run kid cant get it upstairs white slapped it away so here comes that pace for Louisville with Clark James in tight with the left really good drive by James Ive been saying that I think Mike James is such a big key deal a key person for Louisville because his jump from last year to this year is a hes big addition he the better he is the better Louisville is going to be you can see the amount of dribble hand off action that Virginia Tech running trying to get establish Li kid Baron for three in and out oh that was tantalizingly close going down yeah there and Louisville was focus in on l k the roll there which opened up Robbie Baron for the open three into the post theres that match up with kid and he wins it on Huntley Hatfield this time drag screen up top there you can see how much theyre trying to help down low there with kid and inside for a dunk Louisville had pulled on over but didnt stay there he pulled out Padilla held on the ball an extra dribble and found kid late which got him the dunk Virginia Tech started slow against Auburn trying to avoid a slow start here great box out by by Virginia Tech Louis gets to the off virgin Louisville one shot right now for the most just that one trip thats been it with the second chance kid from away from the basket and that wouldnt stick Tech is getting back they are not giving opportunities for Louisville to get out anything in transition or early drag scre trans they want to set their defense thats a point of emphasis for Coach young team right here shots up theyre gone theyre back theyre not get theyre not going to worry about getting second third opportunities on the offensive glass late clock James with the give up trainer of three and an airball no shot clock reset two on the clock one on the clock Louisville didnt see it hutley had field gave it up after the air ball got to give crit to Virginia Tech their defensively and then the awareness on on the shot clock Louisville hitting some outside shots to begin up six in our first break first break with Josh bner Conor Rion Kenny pay year two is the head coach for Louisville hes got great history of course going back to his playing days here he got tremendous history hes won a national title as a player hes been played in the NBA hes been picked hes a great guy Louisville fans give him some time hes going to be fine hes going to build this program back to where you want it things dont happen overnight he knows what hes doing hes a high level coach hes a high level guy you got but things dont happen overnight coachings hard give it a little time of course he has an NBA background and that really shows up in how they play he absolutely you can see a lot of the actions they run in the half courts a lot of NBA type of actions and uh and its hard to guard very different down on this end for Mike young offensive Mastermind Mike young one of the best in the country a slow start from outside for the hokes havent hit from out deep yet but a whirling Shan padulla scores when youre struggling a little bit from the outside the best thing to do is get into the paint get a layup get your confidence going and your rhythm going pilo just did that good action of the timeout by coach young thats going to be his only Game Auburn thats going to be his only game without a field goal year dont you think 100 thats thats just a one time FL that hadnt happened to him since the ACC title game a few years ago when he was a reserve player well that leads to a dunk for JJ trainer on the broken play sometimes its just better to be lucky on that I mean the ball was bounced in a 5050 ball there Louisville came up with it but in order for Louisville to take the next step thats whats going to happen they need to win those 5050 BS last year they didnt this year they are thats thats why they match their wi total Elijah potit in out of the timeout so is MJ Collins back from injury and thats out of bounds off of Collins yeah Collins Collins didnt play last game but you see the you see the dunk here just off the 5050 ball a scramble Louisville comes up with it but Collins didnt play last game against ol that that was something where Collins is one of the guys on Virginia Tech that can really create his own shot you know even late shot clock and that hurt Virginia Tech not having hit being back he doesnt have any restrictions on minutes thats a big big addition getting them back for this game as far as Mike young says anyway right no restrictions as far as I know depending on how he plays off the turn over padulla stripped from behind by Johnson lightning quick guard Off the Bench ahead to Clark who misses but trainers there to follow it up offensive rebounding thats what Louisville does really well credit to Louisville now on those Johnson on that 5050 play defensively the effort he made and then on the way back thats what it takes to win as those 5050 ball plays the second and third effort Johnson had hands on there hes checking pulla here a match up to watch in the half court into petite off the deflection back to padulla and way off on the three good contest there by Louisville you can see Virginia Tech really good transition defense the way theyre building a wall theyre going to make Louisville have to score in the half court you said it the pace will be IND of how this game goes and Mike young the former ACC coach of the year would like to be in a little bit slower of a pocket than right now yeah a little bit slower I think the pace right now Advantage Louisville let me just tell you this on Mike young and Im not just saying this because I I was a coach and a head coach for a long time I love Mike young he is hes excellent hes one of the best offensive coaches in the game and they dont get enough credit defensively theyre tough and hardnosed defensively you got to you got to be really good offensively to score against Mike Youngs team dug out of there hands on it for maai longor lethal outside shooter run off the line but scores plus a foul defense leading to offense just where I was saying Mike Youngs defensive group what he does is they really guard in the chest and and how they guard on that in the chest gets a turnover which leads to a fast break opportunity right there Couture you know everyone puts so much pressure on guarding Couture because of his threepoint shooting hes a leading alltime threepoint shooter for Virginia Tech in the history but when youre really so focused on that youre able to get by guys it opens up Lanes but just attacked that Mike James close out yeah and what happens is is you start that maybe closing out a little short and then all of a sudden youre giv an open three you know Couture is so good at his gamemanship the way he plays how he plays without the basketball the way he moves without the basketballs its an not playing with the basketball he understands that art in that you called him an incredible mover without the ball that was the first thing you said about him when Scout this game absolutely and its a skill to play without the basketball is a skill he does it as well as anybody in the country heres trainer has had a loud start but way off the window there rebound taken away by Kid Rex Steiner with the big crackback on the big there on Louisville when they were trying to get to the glass thats Curtis Williams yeah checking Couture on this trip down after James had him last time into the post kid going to work cant hit he almost never misses those as the hes will have it back in the Baseline after the timeout a rare Bunny Miss for ly kid whos shooting at 70 on the Beautiful Sunday afternoon in blackburg it is really fun flying in here you make the hour drive from roke through the hills here to Castle Coliseum Louisville out in front early this ACC opener they were one point away Coach bassner from a major Marque he win against Texas well what I would tell you is that was a great opportunity for Louisville and they played so darn well they probably deserve win the game but what happened there late they missed a free throw line box out Texas hit a shot right at the buzzer was actually really good defense by Louisville but better offense that happens they got to find another way or two in this for an ACC play to get another signature win to find a way to do that off the shot fake Hunter Couture from three thats what he does thats why hes number one in Virginia Tech History and out of a timeout great call by Mike young setting up on a dribble handoff on a misdirection he find way to put it in thats a seal breaker for Couture he came in the last two games he was one for his last 14 from three goes without saying they need his outside shot but Williams no Couture has the rebound y I dont think Coach pay wanted that shot from Williams there Louisvilles played from in front most of this first half almost to the Midway point pance the tire Take the Lead head of the 10minute Mark with kick on the spin for the slam absolutely love the move the spin Louisville got body to body to him and he was able to feel and spin Baseline thats what kid needs to do to set that presence in the paint Big Time move by Lin kid Johnson in handling the ball and thats an offensive foul on Glenn took a big bite out of Couture and called for the offensive foul you can see Couture here just they they really stayed on him Mike James stayed on him and he was able to get him lifted and then look at this move by Kid you see the body to body he didnt give him space and hes able to feel it and spin on the Baseline two big time plays I also want to say thats two charge calls already in this game and thats been one of the point of emphasis has been there there might not be as many charges this year already to this game taken by Virginia Tech and thats going to be so important how this game is called because how Louisville gets to the free throw line one of the best in the country at shooting free throws 80 run almost became 11 long goes to the free throw line long got left there no one got a hit on him he was open for a free run to the basket because of the amount of pressure on those dribble handoffs that Louisville is coming on those Shooters because they know that Virginia Techs such a good threepoint shooting team so theyre getting so much help to the to the ball that leaves a guy like M to get an offensive rebound untouched coach bner to your point about offensive fouls and how this game is called these teams get to the free throw line a lot and a quarter of their offense more in the case of Louisville comes from the from the strike Louisville one of their ways theyve theyve been able to win these games this year has been to the free throw line I mean they really attack play downhill get into the paint and theyre shooting a really good clip almost 73 from the free throw line just a little bit under but thats what they do so a lot of its going to be how the game is called will be to dictated on on some of Louisvilles scoring opportunities to this point four Z in fouls called so not a big foul heavy first 10 minutes of this AC opener one and two at the line gives Virginia Tech the lead still out and running have been several minutes since Louisville has scored and theres the first team foul against Virginia Tech and you can see Louisville trying to drive downhill and they talked about it in shoot around Virginia Tech did about the multiple ball screens that Louisville will set and then Louisvilles trying to drive it and because of the rules the way the game is called if youre on his hip its going to be a defensive foul you have to get your chest in of him to give yourself a chance for it to be an offensive fou there Pula was on his side the rule is part of it why else does louisv will get fouled so much because they put their head down and they drive it I mean their their abilities to drive to attack to get to the paint thats a tough two I think virin Tech would be happy if theyre going to keep shooting those but Louiss mentality is Drive attack live in the paint white gets a lot of his scoring from right there hes able hes able to beat off guys off the bounce and go right to that will pull up and theyre tough twos but thats his game thats what he does he does it well he did it at USC last year transfer to USC H needed more of a paint presence and kid on the fallway cant hit and a foul down here if you notice there Brandon Huntley Hatfield gave him a little more space when l k caught it down there so he wasnt able to spin on the Baseline heres that midrange shot for white you can see there got right there got separation was actually pretty good defense the kid hit a tough shot but thats what he does thats how he plays thats part of his game is those tough midrange twos kid trying the other block and goes Applause underneath you can see the spin that time again he got his chest to him and he was able to feel the contact and spun Baseline the time before where regard guarded he gave him a little more space he wasnt able to to spin but thats thats L kid move Clark knocks in the three is going to need Clark to do that really good action there back screen to rescreen to an open shot Virginia Tech got caught on that on the on the rescreen action there really good action by Kenny pay thats the guy that has freedom to go get his offensively the kid had three bodies down there and hes called for the foul after the Miss well you can see Virginia Tech sets a lot of cross screen actions with their perimeter guys because of their ability to shoot the ball again youre able to have to help on those on those guards so it leaves a guy like L kid open coming off the off the cross screen because of the gravity that those guards setting the screen they do actually Hunter Couture told me in earlier today he was like I told him youre a great screen Setter he goes I know sometimes they illegal screens too coach can I get away with him I said hey as long as were not being called what the heck hes got good hands too Couture gives it back though white Clark passes on the three and white slows it back down Hs almost had a breakout Clark into bodies three James again from the corner Louisville did not come in this game they were under 50 actually under 40 on field goals assisted tonight they are they are having high field goals assisted coach Kenny pay worked on that in shoot around of the one more the extra pass Baron cant cash in with Louisville sharing the ball building a fivepoint first half lead and Clark is off another thing is Lisle has not shot the ball well from three to start the year last in the ACC at 28 but James from the corner has been deadly its about making shots Conor thats what its about Desman I think enough people are talking about them I mean how are they not even ranked had another great win today on the road at pit they won at Alabama theyre loaded they can win the ACC this year and for them not to get into the tournament last year at 14 and six in League Play is is one of the seven wonders of the world or is there eight wonders of the world there eight so maybe there yeah goodness gracious right up there with the the Great Wall of China but theyre the way theyre playing this year theyre going to get in now padulla lost it and Louisville will get it back off the padulla turnover hes saying my bad Louisville came out pressing out of that timeout I dont know if Virginia Tech was ready for that credit to Kenny Payne trying to have a little different defensive look coming out of coming out of atto Kenny Payne told us that he turned on the first 12 minutes of the Auburn tape against Virginia Tech and showed his team the pressure that Auburn put on Virginia Tech wanted to throw some of that stuff out there today and trainer with the Miss yeah they talked about how Auburn kind of really smothered Virginia Tech and really was just everywhere they were at switching so he talked about really showing that film to him so they can see how Au played you see the back screen there by great back screen C with the handle out to long for three and an out rebound James theres white pushing it and offensive foul on Trey white Couture back to take it thats the right Call Transition defense Virginia Techs one of the very best in this league to do it in getting back hit his feet set he beat him in the spot thats the right call Third charge by Virginia Tech in this game you wondered how much theyd be able to do it yep that because thats been a point of emphasis with the new rules that its going to be hard to take charges for charges to be called because they dont want the collisions but Virginia Techs positioning has been the key for them defensively getting those charges called coutur has been involved in two of those collisions and thats a travel so wipe off the dunk for kid got resistance from trainer you can see a misdirection there they were trying to get have him come up for the three but then to throw it back in a misdirection to establish kid into the paint and he tried to again for the spin on the Baseline he shuffled his feet a little quick before he was able to make the move you wondered both ways we showed you the the points in the paint and how Virginia Tech struggled in that way how early would mville go in there theyve been good from outside to begin and James couldnt hit the runner patula on the Baseline pass and Collins underneath gets his own and gets blocked strong defense Trey White and Clark turns it over transition defense by Virginia Tech I wonder if cins a little rusty obviously from not playing last game he has the give up for the kid Slam the transition offense from that turnover by Kid beat beat Louisville down the floor got him an open basket good throw ahead to to Collins who found kid right at the Block Clark lobs it up oh that would have been nasty no connection off the hands of trainer you can see the transition here you can just see he beat everyone down the floor you can see Louisville weak side Defender was too far over wasnt pulled over into the paint into the help side there playing basket in and before getting out pure turns the corner and James is right there with him the whole time and P called for the foul white down hard after he was nudged by padulla theyre really locking and trailing and staying really connected to Couture theyre not letting him get any any uh any any free looks yeah but Louisville defensively has been really good on how theyre guarding now theyre making him get to the paint and what theyre saying is I dont know if you can beat us if you just make twos we cant let you make threes cure youre too good so weve got to be lock and Trail and be literally like a like a Velcro on you and not give you any room on the catch big foul to Padula with two fouls on the bench and Huntley Hatfield capitalizes points in the paint they got a little overextended found on the roll there on the slip was this a Sit pulla the rest of the half I situation me personally I wouldnt I think its up to each coach on how their theory is and what they believe with two fouls heres kid going to work out for Couture off the shot F again and Couture left it short and James flies in for the rebound Here Comes James pushing it give up for Clark and hell go to the line to shoot two Baseline official thought that was an n one wave it off no basket two at the line for Clark Conor do you see the the the quickness by Louisville defensively on the recovery on the second and third effort those are things that wasnt happening last year at Louisville you can look at right now the the Improvement they made on the quickness on getting to the shooters on a second and third multiple effort credit to Louisville on that theyre really trying to take out the three and not give Virginia tick any clean looks but back to padulla I I think coach young you know its going to be hard for Virginia Tech to win without pull I mean a question thing I think padul is probably smart enough to be careful not picking up his third but this really comes down to the coachs gut and Theory what do they believe when you have two fouls everyones a little bit different on that its their top ball handler one of their top scorers at 14 and a half points a game for Virginia Tech Johan Padula CL extends the first half lead for Louisville heres some of that pressure that Louisville picked up from the Auburn tape that they want to put on Virginia Tech today potit lost the handle got it back for young coming off his best game of the season long gone Baseline not for a Collins three book it if they can stay with within Striking Distance and not let Louisville get a lead with pulla on the bench you can keep him there and I think maybe thats what coach Youngs looking at big big three by by Collins a guy that hadnt hit an outside shot before that he was over for 11 coming into the year I think thats why Louisville made the close out short playing the numbers oh from the midrange again plus a foul for Trey white thats that work studying dear D rozan Kenny Payne has him in the tape watching Dear hell be at the line when we come back Trey white to extend the lead for the cards good balance for Louis Mike James eight points Trey white Scot Clark seven points as louiso has built a half first half lead in the ACG opener Trey white second time today weve seen him go to this midrange shot got fouled on this one also well as we discussed Kenny talked about he he wants him to watch film on guys like Demar D rozan you know a lot of coaches might say in todays game dont take the midrange shot Trey white thats his bread and butter he likes getting to the Elbow he likes getting to the long post he can make those shots 15 16 17 feet hes able to create his own shot there hes got good size as well too and hes got three assists seven points three for four for the field and three assists thats a great stat line for him and thats what Kenny Payne was talking about to us this morning was we know hes going to score hes at 15 points a game thats not going anywhere can he distribute a little bit better off of his scoring well how about Louisville overall seven assists on 11 made field goals they have not been good at that this year coming into this game under under 45 under 40 theyve been moving that ball today with great Rhythm flowing energy A little pressure on Virginia Tech playing without sha padulla right now with a little more than four minutes left he went to the bench with a second foul for the hokes long recovered it and the rebound for Huntley Hatfield to take it away for the cards really good defense there by Clark on on Couture who just blanketed him they theyre not giving him any room they dont care what he does its almost like a box and one but playing manto man principles theyre really trying to take him out well they allowed Couture to shoot one three in this first half did hit Itor with eight points leading Virginia Tech Johnson with seven on the clock grinding inside and an air ball on the runner and that was saved but long was out no shot clock reset so I think its going to be right at under three these are the these are the time and score situations what have you worked on to get yourself an opportunity here because got to be a quick shot when remember Louisville did not have that awareness earlier in the game couldnt get a shot up we got a out before this one 226 in the first seven point Cardinals lead Tommy week from today afternoon double header on acc Network womens soups Florida G Coast is at Duke and then number 22 Louisville host in Kentucky Big G big game thats presented by Food Lions Sunday December 10th on acc network if they pick Louisville last in this league Im telling you they are really good right now this league is going to be a a R in a fight to for all 15 teams its going to be a heck of a year this year the way these two teams are playing Clark on the air ball late in the shot clock they had a timeout Virginia Tech call timeout to set their defense up they got a shot by Clark probably not what Coach P Payne wanted but they had to get a shot up under three thats thats thats twice thats happened to him on shot clock violations late shot clock underneath out of bounds want to take you back here youre going on record saying no shot Louisville finishes 14th out of 15th like they were picked not happening not the way theyre playing now the slip for long for two more for Virginia Music Tech again the Gravity by the Virginia Tech Mike coach Mike Youngs team they such they do such a great job of setting screens what a lost start is screen setting and Virginia Techs one of the best at it and it gets Guys open the better screen you set the better chance you have somebody to get open but white off the shot fake took some steps travel gives it back to the hes going back to Virginia Tech because of the way they set their screens the gravity because of the shooters usually the screener is the person thats going to be open but because the shooter setting the screen theyre grabbing theyre just putting all energy towards that is giving guys like Lin kid or po opportunities to get right to the block score seeing some more production in the paint today for Virginia attch and that continues with Collins I just think Collins needed a little bit of a some Rhythm to get going in the game play a little bit to get his rhythm back great move there going to the left from the an one you know he was off last game didnt play Just it takes time A little bit to kind of get in and S you miss some practices in a game we were talking this week getting ready for this coach bner and think we both felt MJ Collins if he can start to hit some more jump shots hes a guy that can change Virginia Tech season yeah he he hit his three but uh theyre going to need to make more threes a new school three and an old school three for Collins a threepointer for MJ Collins then a threepoint play late in this first half points and his returned from the knee injury theyre going to need Virginia Techs going to need him and they look theyve hung theyve stayed in Striking Distance with padulla out with the two fouls part of thats been MJ Collins three and then the n one right there late in this first half in the ACC opener and James off a ball fake crafty move around the rim another good action by coach Kenny Payne out of the timeout got James going downhill thats what they want to do is they want to get down and nichel with the answer back from three the alltime leading score in Virginia High School history didnt get really any time an opportunity at North Carolina got came here as a transfer its a really good fit for him here the way they play got him a great look there they need him to score he has that ability to score brings it to a onepoint game 10 the clock for trainer Clark got to go down to seven Clark on the cross got underneath and nickel after his three has the D and that gets the crowd going with the defense there got the shot block and you see that you can see it here but hey heres another big situation coming up late shot clock out of bounds underneath this is a third one for Louisville theyve got to find a way to score one of these down to two on the clock into the post with James and he gets foul Conor these those late shot clock B out of bounds plays are very similar to special team situations in football it can make or break you so right there thats they got an opportunity get a foul and reset the shot clock to 20 so you look at the numbers are one for three and late shot clock based out of bound situations I love a good Sky punt Im throwing out the football terms now ESP the college football playoff just happen hey that was the final foul to give for Virginia Tech in this final half minute Clark went High window no hit the rebounds and the hokes can hold for the last shot of the half outstanding defense by Virginia Tech the way they pulled over they crowded the floor made it really tough for Louisville to get a clean look Louisville has led for most of this first half a chance for a lead into the locker room for Virginia Tech three on the clock though James with the defense his shot at the buzzer is off Target so all first time in two seasons they would do that with a win of this ACC opener padulla back in there to start the second half after foul trouble and IND kid for an easy two in the lead big basket for Virginia Tech to get the lead because theyre trying to fight back to get the lead and sometimes you just expend all that energy to do that you just need to get over the hump to get the lead Louisville LED for 18 of the 20 minutes in the first half and James cant give it back to him Louisville off the back to backto back winds survived in overtime against New Mexico State beat Beller in the second half come back and kid with a loud start to the second half really good action there again you can see the gravity on Couture and he just able to get to the guys help the dish off with the dunk theyre really doing the job now on the points in the paint you got an A in physics and youre were in school didnt you no I didnt I can say I did thats out off kid I was I did coach at Georgia Tech which is all about engineering science technology and math and physics but I was only the basketball coach there for for a few years you learned a lot about gravity thats youre right on that I I knew an astronaut when I was at Georgia Tech I met a couple astronauts I wont go in the whole NASA space station though I I mean I kind of want to hear about you being in the space station thats going to be part of the second half combo I bet theres white in and out and padulla with the rebound for Virginia Tech thats his game though that midrange game as we talked about he can make those shots most coaches probably say dont shoot those but for him thats his game padulla ducking underneath and scores it Mike young flexon out to midcourt off that Virginia Tech bench hoks crowd engaged on this 60 run we want to take the shortcut addressing the importance of Lyn kid and Shawn padulla theyve had all three baskets out of time absolutely they really started this second half right where they needed to start I mean with like a house on fire how the intensity they had and they attack the paint Thats they established that paint presence especially the start of the second half thats why theyve got the lead thats why Louis was forced to call a timeout a kid challenged by those last two games seeing glad golden and Janai broom but those have been two of the three big scores for the hookies to start the year along with Hunter Couture Louisville took the time out seeing Virginia Tech score six in a row in the first two minutes out of the locker room heres Clark off of ball fake gives it up extra pass white and cant stop the run really good offense for Louisville got the one more good ball movement theyve been working on that theres padulla creating for kid that combo shows up again Conor points in the paint and it doesnt always to be a the traditional throw to the block back you down the drive to the paint bring the help kick dunk points in the paint they are establishing their presence inside Virginia Tech especially with L kid wheres the answer come from for Louisville now into the post and there it is Huntley Hatfield for two talk about the answer right inside best way to stop a run go right down to attack the paint right to the block thinking that maybe Louisville would exploit that matchup early in this game go a Huntley Hatfield a lot kid feeling good but slowed down there well see if Coach P goes right back inside here to Huntley Hatfield to go back inside again that the last two games Auburn and Fa really hurt Virginia Tech points in pain that last play there they went right inside Clark with the left and trainer couldnt keep it alive Doula without numbers now a couple hookies join the play and thats blocked but a foul is called Huntley Hatfield called on the layup for maai long yeah thats a foul let me just say this tough shot by sky Clark running to his left which then allowed the tough shot transition offense for for Virginia Tech and not a balance for Louisville and then what happens is theyre able to get a a shot right at the basket sometimes people think transition offense is all for turnover so so much its about shot selection too because its C allows you to have good balance defensively some of that selected transition for Virginia Tech right yeah absolutely and they were able to get it off of there look Virginia Techs on a team thats going to just bring it up and down the floor at high speed all the time but theyre going to take their opport when they have a to Clarks been getting the airall chance and he knocks it in right in front of the student section theyll look at that they called it two for now that was set up before the ball was even shot he did his work early before he even had the ball the way he moved without the ball the cutting the setup the ganship that allowed him to get the open three padulla and kid have a nice connection going right now kid to the free throw line again because of pads ability the gravity the energy towards him is given for now a fourpoint game they will check on that outside shot rolled a two for sky Clark you can see sky Clark here the way he set up before the ball was ever caught to him he did his work early the way he moved out the ball now they ended up calling two its awfully close in there you need almost like a magnifying class to see that but they did call it a two but credit to Clark without the ball which is a lot of times is a lost starts we talked about Couture on Virginia Tech the job that he does with that pretty good there by Clark we need the ACC SE it on the magnifying PA zoom in on that a little bit NASA telescope on that one is what you need there we go every every war in this second half I need an astronaut reference out of here Roger SS when the officials came over he said there was not enough evidence to say that was definitely a three he did say also if that was a Georgia Tech last year we would have called that a three if you were on the sideline yeah well Im sitting over here now he didnt called enough threes for me thats the problem thats why Im in the in the media right now come on Roger a little too late to pay I needed more threes from you little too late so fivepoint game into Huntley Hatfield again and hes going to free throw line out of the timeout Kenny pay designed that play and said were going right inside to Huntley Hatfield and they got a misdirection with the way his footwork is set up set back upit credit to Coach P there on the at to go right back into the Applause paint bacon is out of the question for the students on this free throw trip if they missed two and free bacon for everybody he coming up this week Wednesday ruers goes to Wake Forest thats at 6 Eastern South Carolina at Clemson 8s on acc Network in the SPN out two at the line for Huntley Hatfield you can see Louisville now pressuring up to the free throw trying to change the tempo of the game try to change the now Up full got a steal Johnson saves it but back in the hands of padulla so Virginia Tech survived that and the shot clock is not right Louis was able to pressure full court they got the steel and then the 5050 ball up in the air for a loose ball there which Virginia Tech was able to get but I guess the shot clock the didnt reset on the change of possession no they didnt they said they didnt have shot clock coordinator probably thought they had control is why they so 24 on the clock instead of 18 heres coutur from three he got loose didnt hit offensive rebound for long and going back in through the double team Couture wants again and hes short this time really fortunate for Louisville they got he got two good looks on that first one that shot the dple hand off they went underneath all game long theyve been gone over the top that one they went underneath and got him an open look long range hook wont go for trainer and a number Advantage for the hokes nickel hes short three straight misses for Virginia Tech and three really good looks Conor Louisville really they didnt make any of those oh sweet cross for Johnson the easy layup and a great seal by Huntley Hatfield there that open up that paint for that drive there that was literally like a quarterback sneak right right down the gut of the defense look at Hunley halfeld here the seal right there on nichel there that just open that up a different kind of tush yes absolutely he could he he looks like he could be an offensive line middle line those Sports had hes got Inc physique hes out riding with padulla and petite with the off hand back to points in the paint off the ball screen Louisville crowded the ball handler which left weak side was not pulled all the way over which allowed to be able to get a free run to the rim down to 10 the clock and is fighting for position and hes fouled by nickel you know we asked Coach pay at Louisville shoo rounds could this be a big day for Huntley Hatfield kind of got widey and said oh yeah were going to throw it into the big guy a lot today they need his energy hes an energy guy hes an energy when he plays with energy he gives that their team feeds off the first half for Beller Coach pay was saying he didnt have that same energy and he struggled in the second half he was he played with such great energy they fed off they need him play with that that intensity every possession Couture with good defense on Clark still working his way in and he is fouled you know Virginia Tech does such a good job of using their chest you can see here looking using his chest but he got his right hand right in there and he bent that left hand a little bit down but but they chess guys really well but they got their hand walls up fingers to the lights a little the an opportunity to call foul that first one perfect for Clark yeah you hear that a lot when I know were stopping through practices all the time reach for the lights reach for the lights you want to get straight up and but you over a little you the ability for the ref to call the foul Advantage off thats what happened down there again Clark gave the students half of what they wanted they want that bacon if you miss two free throws in a row from the opponent a free bacon here in blackburg the bacon starting to sizzle but not all the way cooked yet dont eat it wrong we dont advise that dont not at all Collins said a good first half shooting the ball getting late in the clock into potit with four on the shot clock ducking in and that is knocked out of there by Huntley Hatfield now Conor heres another special team situation under two seconds base out of bounds you can see here look at look at these two guys going out look at the chest back to the chest got a good block there but this is a big special teams play late clock base out of bounds they dont up good defense there by Louisville they really gravitated towards Couture they had a slip there by potit he was open there at the last second they were trying find there for three weve seen it both on Kenny Paynes side and on Virginia Tech side late clock not a lot of shots get in the air good defense bad offense its been good defense late clock trying to just get something off but you got to credit to the defense on both teams being locked in on that the hokes were on a 60 run out of the locker room and Johnson hits that and hes fouled giv Louisville the lead right back look you can see you can see there defensively got his right there good call old fashioned a tough two they called it a three this a fourpoint opportunity yeah fourpoint play completed for Johnson from down two to up two in one possession and and a lot of thats changed the full court pressure coming out of that timeout its changed a little bit of the flow and the Rhythm for Louisville and the pace has now Tak advantage to Louisville side Louisville let it by one at halftime Virginia Tech on that 60 run out of the locker room now Louisville on a surch baron the open look wont stick heres Johnson who has lightning quickness hes got a mismatch giving it up white drill the three you can see there theyre trying to get in the pain and find those guys in the corner a quick step for Collins and hell head to the free throw line Collins can do that where he can beat you off the BS hes one of those guys that be able to create his own shot for Virginia Tech and get by guys even in late clock situation thats not a late clock situation but hes able to do that his first St able to be bit of an outlier in that way for Mike Young on this current the attch team absolutely because theyre such a you know again theyre one of the the best offensive teams in the country and the things that they run but its its its a lot of sets its a lot of reads reacting motion hes one of those guys that can kind of get his own shot without that that was in transition there off of a corner Miss which sometimes off of a Miss three in the corner allows you to have better transition offense and worse transition defense as that example that last possession Virginia Tech happy J Collins back whos up to eight points missed the Auburn game on Wednesday after he was injured just a little knee against fa on a break dun lville just took the lead on a fourpoint play take it back on this trip down with whites another midrange shot a rebound off of the for po Here Comes Collins attacking the big butley Hatfield right there with him Baron passed on an outside look hasnt been able to hit yet today and potit nails that plus a foul right inside shot by Trey white on the other end he was a midrange but it was a spin those arent the ones that Kenny wants to take you can see right here going right into potin inside didnt get the wall up hands down big and points in the pain for Virginia Tech Virginia Tech leading score Hunter Couture with eight points in this game hokey by two points in the middle of this second half this of course is vwe and this week close to the heart of Hunter Couture his dad Rodney about this time last year was diagnosed with stage two pancreatic cancer theres a picture of those two right there when Hunter was young it was about a year ago thankfully now Rodney is in remission he is cancer free and Hunter was nice enough to open up to us at shoot around today saying that you know I used to pray before games that I would play well now its just a thought of I hope everybodys safe I hope everybodys healthy and really great to hear that Rodney is healthy and in remission you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research just another great reminder just how precious life is you know you only get 86400 seconds in the day short and precious so but what ESPN does Jimmy V and Dick F tal and everybody its amazing trying to beat can Hunter got to go home playing Orlando over the Thanksgiving holiday be close to his family had 15 to 20 High School buddies at those games that Virginia Tech played in foul off ball as Louisville Works into the half court here you know Conor looks like out of every timeout from Louisville they are trying to go toley Hatfield inside its been thats obviously been a strategy for for Coach pay in this game and got himself a whistle there weve seen potit in there for Virginia Tech checking him thats the match up here and nichel with the intercept with James behind they were trying to post James but nichel did a good job frontting on that end of the floor he didnt play behind he got in front I dont know if they wanted hudley Hatfield to make that pass I thought maybe they wanted to get him up and the pin down for James but credit to Nickel fronting the post not giving up position and just playing behind which a force the turnover base out of bounds 21 on the clock this is a this is a big possession right here where the games at seems like forever after all the play shot clock Bas line outs weve had into Baron in the post he has James behind them and theway will not sit down for Baron he had a couple of those from outside today too that look like theyre going down Clark on the step and baron with the recovery Johnson gets it back and puts it down for Louisville ball rolls in and out and then the 5050 ball loose ball on this end Johnson comes up with it thats literally a fourpoint swing right there with Baron Miss then the defensive pressure right there quick hands for Johnson Collins on his hip and four in a row for Tyler Johnson the fullt pressure picking up manto after that when Virginia Tech started on a 6 to start the second has pace and for Louisville Nicholls rebound Clark Tapped Out by Couture and Virginia Tech with fresh life James has got to get that 5050 ball that that he didnt fight for that cout beat him to it James had a step those are huge plays youre trying to scrap fight grind your way to a win you got to win those 5050 balls Aon had the smaller Clark on him think about that swing right there Conor by James not getting that 5050 Ball by Couture beating him thats literally like a 40 swing right there thats a big play I promise you Coach P will be showing that on film tomorrow James tough look followed his zone Applause no thats why theyre 5050s right Louisville 11 40 swing Virginia Tech 11 40 swing and when in the game of basketball those are the difference between winning and losing boths a lot of help off the pick and roll on Collins but had a straight line rim run there they got hugged up on the outside gave a great look from Collins but not a lot of help inside there that play two plays before James missing that 5050 ball has given energy and life in Virginia Tech Collins called on the Johnson Drive you can see him cocking it back on the approach Elijah poti yep and you can see there Hatfield went stretched out a little bit there they didnt get help from the weak side there from James he was late T got there and just DED it right another Point another two points in the pain is that a better match up than going with kid seen a lot of potit this last stretch yeah I think thats been strategically from coach young trying to have his physicality to wear out Hunley Hatfield no foul trouble for kid hes sitting on two fouls this is potit and Huntley Hatfield Huntley Hatfield with the follow away nice touch really big shot there con and I think theyre going with based on his physicality little moreal than kid trying to match up inside there kids having a big offensive day with 15 points to lead the hokes Johnson with the active hands padulla working on Clark Collins late clock a tough look Johnson the D but the followup goes down from bati when balls are in the air on rebounding its like a loose ball even on a rebound its a loose ball in the air and who wants more Collins with his second JP quick off that second JP to put it back 10 on the day for MJ Collins and Johnson cant answer rebound for long just ahead of the under eight in this ACC opener somebodys getting to one and0 padulla rounded out out of the hands of white and another 5051 by the hokes padulla gave it up white intercepts and now hes Off to the Races two onone beautiful step through really good crack back down inside there by Trey white on the when pulla dried it he thought he had a pass for a dunk Trey White Dove down there on the crackback got the steel big there Louisville big play that puts him in double digits you have four guys for Louisville with exactly 10 points balanced up today for the Cardinals Collins another outside shot the 11 Conor hit two threes hes played big for him I think the amount ofen Virginia Tech doing and wearing you on your body is is taking a little bit toll on Louisville I mean theyre theyre cracking you on those screens and its and and its to wear you out because its over and over and over big shot by Collins James takes padulla and hes short on it long away for the hokes padulla and it spins off they got really fortunate there Louisville to get foua that type of look for him to miss this is a big possession right here Conor Louisvilles down four reach in for potit Castle Coliseum the rims here have been worn out by MJ Collins over the off seon working on his outside shot 0 for 11 at the start of the day shut out no more MJ Collins with two three balls in the bag today no Trey white sky clar going to get Buckets in the ACC its whos going to be that consistent third and fourth guy tonight its been Johnson and James evening them up with 10 we talked about a third score but theyve got four right now and U you know the biggest thing for Louisville is they just cant turn it over I mean youre looking at theyve got 12 turnovers right now at the spot so they just they got to take care of the ball these free throws coming up here for Huntley Hatfield are huge because with with six minutes to change to go you got to and youre on the road youve got to keep it within a possession or two this is a big oneonone right here Conor hes got a really nice stroke for a big man from the free throw line does and by the way he can be the guy for Louisville to get to double digits really balanced scoring last year thats where they struggled at that they didnt have enough scoring this year theyre getting more scoring more guys and Five Guys with 10 points James Huntley Hatfield Clark Johnson and wh by the way Trey white not on the floor out of this timeout I think Coach pay wants to give him a little extended rest I expect R back in quickly Collins working points and hell get a one and one so bonus the rest of the way for both teams whereas in the first half we never got to the bonus second half were there with six minutes to go but thats what both teams do is they do draw fouls they do Force you force the opponent to fouls and this is kind of where the numbers show up here in the second half Collins hits the first to earn a second we showed the graphic earlier in the game about a quarter of the offense quarter of the scoring for both Virginia Tech and Louisville come from the free throw line tops in the ACC both of them try to attack and and for Collins you know he started the game slow I think it took a little bit to get back in Rhythm from being out but hes man hes been hes been a key for Virginia Tech and has kept right there when they were struggling a little bit against Louisville and hes helped them obviously having an extend the lead its been a big play Big player todays best scoring game of the season with 15 points Williams short James keeps it alive into the hands of Huntley Hatfield one of those effort plays you highlighted earlier its its its all about the 5050 balls thats what offens of rebounding is in Louisville thats one of the things that they do the way they score is through offensive rebounding get second opportun how about that split and pass for Clark to get trainer to the free throw line Clark Clarks ability to kind of create and off the bounce hes crafty I was Ive been impressed with the way he moves without the ball been impressed by his demeanor hes a high level guard hes be able to play with the ball or without the ball at the same time Conor this is a big free throw right here for the pacon her High bacon is on the line he misses this everybody in the arena gets free bacon not a free hamburger free bacon brunch is delayed a threepoint game James jumps it and nichel gets it back for the hes that would have been big if they were able to come up with that Louis had it coming down to the final five minutes in the ACC opener been a fight and kid with 17 on the board he got matched up on trainer there they found him and he went right to his jump hook to the Middle with his left hand hes got long arms kid and he just extends that beautiful play beautiful looking shot after his extended rest whos back on the floor with 17 points over his average and this will be another one and one coming up with sky Clark at the line theyre getting Trey white back Ino this could come down Conor where its gonna be whos making and missing on the free throws but both teams in the bonus both teams are going to be attacking the pain these are little things teu good on the first Clark a 77 free throw shooter on a team thats shooting 72 you look at where they rank in the ACC Louisvilles eighth in free throw shooting anytime as a team are shooting over 70 youre pretty happy credit to the ACC on the amount of teams that can make free throws shows you the dep of the league you can see them making the free throw now allows them to set up their full court manto Man Press which has given Virginia some problems and its has allowed the pace and the the style Advantage for for Louisville to kind of keep Virginia Tech off off of Rhythm a little bit H at 10 turnovers on the game Mike young teams are known for 10 or less its typically the the line for them as far as turnovers late clock Collins having a big day five to get it up and he hit another throw the stats out when you start ACC play throw the stats out comes in 0 for 11 on fire from three today right back in after the big rest trainer answers back for Louisville its like a heavyweight fight both both teams answer with punches big threes by both guys first by Collins and by trainer in the corner pretty pretty great to have conference playback oh theres nothing like it throw all stats out well have free throws when we come back in a threepoint game at the yeah theyve really gone inside and hes we talked about the very start of the game about him establishing a presence inside kids done that and then Collins man 0 for 11 coming into this game has head three threes absolutely terrific has made big shots in timely situations ear the first half when Louisville was pulling away with with padulla out he made big shots and in the second half to get them back and to take the lead hes been really good hes been their MVP to this point for this game offensively Collins hadnt only struggled from three he struggled shooting in general he was at 18 struggling to hit twos and threes and the top score for Virginia Tech and in this game over MJ Collins thats what makes League Play So fascinating awesome outstanding is because you throw everything out it just it it it sets a new season its like a second season and he gets a fresh start big two free throws there by Couture who rarely misses free throws by the way fivepoint lead for Virginia Tech LED most of the first half LED at halim by one out of the timeout theyre going right back inside thats been the intentionally done by Kenny pay strategically to keep attacking inside out of every single timeout and it has worked almost every time with Huntley Hatfield kid has struggled guarding Hatfield inside thats why they had po a lot in this half defensively but kid offensively they need him in there offense nichel on rebound for Huntley Hatfield see if they go back right to Huntley Hatfield inside here inside three minutes white for the tie and trainer keeps it alive but Collins in there on the ball again gives up Couture and Clark called for the block two things as you can see there before that before Virginia Tech was able to get the ball and thats a clear block but the loose ball was picked up by Collins he just beat Louisville to the ball which allowed him to get the transition offense and again a corner three there as well too which again as we talked about on a corner three Miss sometimes you have a better opportunity for transition offense not asj Collins is over there talking to new assistant coach JD buers whos in charge of Virginia Tech defense probably a word for how they want to go after these Louisville guards late in the game yeah and itll be interesting to see what they do here with with what how theyre going to guard possession go hyfield k is in there to guard him Collins is checking white one of the top scores for Louisville heres that match up James has double digits so does Clark Clark on the take the runner goes down just beat him off the bounce Conor got right to the paint there able to get his shoulder by him big play as you get into this stretch of the game right here every possession gets so magnified on both sides of the ball the games really count now start of ACC play and Collins with the Miss lville down three back on the charge with two minutes to go and contact between kid and Huntley Hatfield and thatll go against kid underneath this is two shot foul again he tried to get his position kid thats why they had potit in there more for defense against Huntley Hatfield kid gives up some of that physicality against him he got him deep in the paint he was trying to work around to the front held him Ron Gro called the foul this is not a one and one its two shots and the first of the double Bonus Goes Down twoo game and next Sunday afternoon double header Florida GF Coast at Duke at no eastern time Kentucky at number 22 Louisville womens basketball Sunday December 10th on acc Network and the ESPN out inside two to go onepoint game after Huntley Hatfield hits a pair when they make their free throws allows them to set up their full court pressure which has again has given Virginia Tech some issues just on the Rhythm and the pace not always about turnovers how about Hunley Hatfields free throw shooting really nice stroke hes six of six in this game great luy to have hes got the on ball defense forced to give up padulla top look and hes called on or hes headed to the free throw line Clark called for the foul try to get a three or theyre going to go right inside to Huntley Hatfield will maybe Virginia Tech double will be the question if they throw it inside will they double them something they havent done yet thats why they call the timeout to put set up the defense what would your answer be to your own question well look a two you still have the lead but I think the way kid is struggling against Hunley hat inside I think youve got to maybe run off someone there and try to get the ball to his hands because even fouling him the way hes shooting free throw doesnt do any good you dont you want to keep the ball out of his hands if he does get it if you can try to double him and get the ball kicked out but you got to be alert now Louisville you know they run good action and sometimes on these late games they can run different things even on the backside where they call it Hammer action so you got to be on the lookout for that but out of every timeout theyve gone inside to hunt the half field hes upset in the screen Johnson was looking for him Louisville has options here here with Clark all guys on the floor have 10 plus points for the Cardinals but hes in trouble and Collins knocks it away Baseline out to the Cardinals so that balance weve been talking about in the second half for Louisville all five of these guys have scored at a high level today so it could be any one of them absolutely and and and heres a Conor 10 seconds on the shot clock late clock 10 on the clock Louisville calls timeout theyre going to set up what they want to run on the offensive end they know Virginia Techs coming in manto man theyre not going to play any Zone Mike young doesnt play zone so you dont have to have come out well if they go Zone if they go man you know theyre coming manto man so now you got to set up your play what you want to run and where do you want to go to because this is a huge play to get a bucket whether its a bucket or just get into the free throw line and I think coach Payne is going to want to find a way to go inside to Hunley Hatfield so you have all five of these guys on the floor is the leading scorers today do you think Hatfield Huntley Hatfields the guy with 14 yes and the way he shoots free throws so if they do foul hes such hes got such a pretty stroke from the free throw line that its its almost automatic and kid has struggled guarding Huntley Hatfield inside in the paint in this second half we see what they do right here Huntley Hatfield is outplayed as season average at the free throw line 61 shooter coming in but 100 today with six throw the stats out in leag play six of six in ACC play should have framed it that way here comes the pin down action right here white on the handoff four on the clock Johnson ball in his hands two to go Johnson way off and Louisville does not get a good look basketball I can assure you thats not what coach Payne Drew up probably a lack of execution by by one of the guys just didnt follow instruction whatever coach had cuz that is not what they wanted to do at coming out of the timeout if you look if you look down there they tried to get Hatfield to the corner kick it and then he was coming to pin in for for Clark and it looked like they went to the to the other direction not going back to Clark looking at the clock here at the table to see how much time is left but you can see Huntley Hatfield has the ball they were looking to pin down to sky Clark right there and I think Trey white went to the wrong direction based on on this view which forced him to have a late clock on that and then credit to Virginia Tech good defense and hey how about that box out by Lyn kid there on hun Hatfield really pushed him way outside there underneath the rim to not allow Huntley Hatfield to get to a sliced position to a wedged position to try to keep an offensive ball alive so Roger a still over at the scores table the officials looking at how much time will be left 103 on the clock right now Virginia Tech will have the ball after the shot clock violation up by three points in this ACC opener they will add 1 second instead of 103 itll be 104 on the clock now this dead ball Conor allows Louisville to set up their full court pressure again to try to again change keep Virginia Tech out of rhythm of their motion and try to keep them off balance a little bit when they get to the half court to take time off of the clock Virginia Tech has not beaten Louisville three times in a row since 1985 Louisville and Underdog coming in trying to steal the opener in the ACC on the road minute to play buy to the kenpom probability 15 chance Louisville would win this game now I mean I his stats are amazing but thats why you play the game you got to get on the floor and play Big possession here dips inside 10 seconds kid on Huntley Hatfield five on the clock going to work Huntley Hatfield hold strong and a foul is called late they had really good defense and I think he just dropped his hand at the last second that just ended up forced the official to call the foul got him on his wrist on the wrist yep kid to make it two possessions its down Tuesday night 10 Eastern after mens basketball double header nothing but net got coach beheim right there in the middle there smile coach beheim youre retired you got over a th wins wheres the smile enjoyed his debut yesterday yeah hes hes awesome one of the greatest ever to do it all right fivepoint game after kid hits two free throws Johnson Working quick and it rolls off rebound for padulla now Louisvilles got to think about a foul here he got the shot clock turned off and the foul finally given with 222 left Louisville went quick they tried to get a quick two it was the right decision to do that ball rolled off just a tough play with the with the way the ball rolled credit to Virginia Tech Conor in this late part of this game theyve made their free throws which has allowed him to to have the lead 18 of 21 is a team in this game 85 for the hokes and a miss for padulla on the front end of the double bonus coach young doesnt like us right now because we probably jinxed him for us talking about it but now a lot of welc to the gig exactly a lot of the a lot of the made free throws that have come in the second half more than the first half just the way the game has been called still a lot of time for Louisville Conor they they dont need a three they just go keep getting a quick two and try to extend the game and that Miss keeps this a two possession game Clark will let it roll reserve a little bit of time inside 20 seconds rille trying to come back to grab the ACC opener and hands for Couture and the Hokies closing in on 1 and0 in the ACC Virginia Tech guarded the screen into the rescreen the dribble handoff screen rescreen they call kind of pistol action late game really guarded it well had good hand Music activity he makes one of these two makes it a three possession game which makes really tough for Louisville you need to get a three if theyre going to have any chance MJ Collins perfect today and he still is a lot of credit to both of these teams Connor both teams are going to win a bunch of games in League Play I think Louisville has gotten so much better which is a credit to coach Payne and his staff obviously coach young and his his staff these are two good basketball teams thats going to win a bunch of games in a really good league in a tough ACC League a lot of going to be some great games every night oh got a foul Clark saying hes shooting this is on the ground this will be two shots at the line for Clark not three think trying to get the he was trying to get the NBA continuation he called it lint kid fou him beforehand but thats the last thing you want to do is stop the clock and give Lille a chance to score with the clock stop because now it allows him to set up their pressure full court which allows him to have a chance to create a turnover so it was the last thing that coach young wanted ly kid to do in that or anyone on their team to do Virginia Tech has two timeouts if they do run into trouble on a make and Clark does hit both with 96 left here comes the pressure for the Cardinals and into padulla running away running out the clock and two seconds come Applause Music off yeah I dont know if it they they made the free throw they could have called timeout to maybe set up but because of the free throw made I think he Coach pay was thinking hey lets we already set up lets not give Coach young an opportunity to set up a press break so he keeps it in his pocket if needed and fadoua back at the line making free throws you look back on this game and Coach pay will look at this there was a big 5050 balls we mentioned earlier were we were Virginia Tech beat Louisville Fort that was a big swing and that late clock on that base out of bounds it was not the shot that coach Payne wanted another Miss from padulla but getting really late Clark for three thats short and thatll do it Virginia Tech wins the ACC opener Over Louisville really good first win for Virginia Tech to start the league Louisville play
