teams this is their first game host Christmas so we shall see how they come out to start Clemson has won two games in a row North Carolina state has won three in a row EJ Hall and DJ Burns will be tipping it off in the 163rd meeting all time between these two programs number 70 right here in Clemson look for Clemson to try to establish PJ Hall early they are excellent at getting him isolated on the Block Clemson won both meetings last year including the ACC tournament Chase Hunter now RJ Godfrey with a turn shot clock to seven for Hall got it good fouled movement switching sides of the floor patience and Poise early by Clemson the wolf pack and theyre starting five Joyner Smith Clark morsel and burns who has been in entry into the starting lineup over the last handful of games well tell you about that due to injuries as ferns gets stuck here at the Baseline shot clock under 10 the kick to Jack Clarks Baseline J and hes foul both these teams so well prepared we watched NC State go through shoot around this morning talking about how they needed to move the ball and switch sides of the floor you see Jack Clark taking advantage of what the defense gives and putting it on the bounce to get to the line so Clark coming in certainly when you take a look at the offense of North Carolina State yes Smith and Joyner are key but getting that extra score with Clark that can be a huge factor for this team I think hes a better shooter than his percentages have shown early on in the season 26 percent from the threepoint line he is a much better shooter than that 85 percent from the line on the season hits one out of two and the wolf pack on the board NC State likes to press they come with different looks this is a mantoman full court press right now Hunter Galloway Tyson Godfrey and Hall the starting five for Clemson its Godfrey getting the first start of his career you see Clemson doesnt send anyone to the glass so its a decision to get back and set your D Not Crash early Burns trying to back down Hall thats gonna be a fun matchup today here we go this is going to be the one to keep your eye on big number 30 in the middle for NC State and PJ Hall at preseason all ACC selection Paul the feed down low the layup is in from Ian sheffler thats the one thing Brad Brownell talked about before the game was could they throw over the top of that ball pressure and you see they have size at certain positions to be able to do so the three missed by Smith hes one of the top threepoint Shooters in all of the ACC we got a couple of really good Shooters Clemsons got the top two although Hemingway is not available today with that planner fashion as sheplin scores again two buckets in a row Hemingway despite the layoff as Deb talked about still out with the plantar fasciitis injury and its day to day so it is unknown when he will return and hes one of the best threepoint Shooters in the history of the program so well see that how that impacts the offense as more cell cant get that one to go in a rebound control a tough contested too hunter three thats Off the Mark Hunter Tyson swoops in for the rebound shefflin again blocked at The Rim by Marcel Smith in the front Court got some contact and thats going to lead to a foul Reverend Galloway one of the first players there for Clemson he burns right here with the one on one showing his skill set to the left hand a block off the jumper from the Baseline burns the follow no good tipped around after the Clark Miss and Tyson gets bumped by Jack Clark and that leads to a whistle so thatll be number one on Clark as Galloway will take a breather well see Josh Beadle in and because of the injury situation with Hemingway Beetle getting some more playing time youd think heading into today and thats going to cause coach Brownell to lean into the bench a little bit more well I think if youre going to to get Beetle and Dylan Hunter some time you want to get him in early to get him a little sweat in the beginning of the game because this is going to be one of those games in the second half where depending on foul trouble or situational defense whether you want those guys in or not Tyson down low trying to bank it in could not get it to go more cell grabbing the loose change for the wolf pack States missed on four their first five shots from the field as Joyner scoop layup thats good yeah that speed and that acceleration is tough to deal with I think charquel Joyner is one of the quickest with the ball in the ACC in the hunter hunter shot that missing burns with a loose ball Joyner a little drag by Burns and then he tries to get in the post up look at PJ Hall is not letting DJ Burns get to his spot inside Smith gets a screen launches rattles out Marcel right there with the rebound of the putback talking to coach Keats he talked about rebounding being a big factor he also talked about how Casey Marcel has started to adapt and get a little bit more comfortable inside this system for Kevin Keats thats played with a little bit more Pace than what hes played in the past seven all game we can do better I feel like theres more to unearth there and hes done a great job this season well I love that 60 of their baskets are assisted theyve got good threepoint shooting theyve won six of the last seven they have a big win on the road at Georgia Tech coming into this one theyve got really good pieces closing in on 400 wins in his coaching career Chaplin whos had a good start fatal Baseline tough shot missed it burns rebound Music Smith loves playing off that drag screen joiners three the long Miss slapped outside by Clark Smith launches he cant get that one to go with Tyson rebound over four from the threepoint line to start the game his struggles against Clemson continued shuffling down low couldnt go glass to go in and it will go the other way well get a foul here off the ball this will be against Hunter Tyson and thatll be his first Breon pass in also Ebenezer dewana and Deb the injury that happened with dushan mahorsik really testing the depth of this bench because that forces Burns to come in it makes DJ Burns have to play more minutes we got a great nugget from Craig Hummel the Sid from NC State today that three of the two of the last four games DJ Burns has had to play 30 or more minutes hes never had to do that at any point in his career Marcel beautiful step back jumper to give the wolf pack a lead of 97 and they can press when the baskets scores they can get into their pressure youre not just trying to turn teams over youre trying to speed them up the drive and the near foul there but they avoided it with the slap of the ball good job there by the defense of North Carolina State Joyner having a hard time in the lane Joyner the kick out to pass good fill behind the penetration by pass Clark bandsaw maybe he stepped out of bounds Joyner the feed open shooter from the corner the three is good by morsel morsel hovering around 50 percent from three this season its a fivepoint lead for the wolf pack this is a great play by Joyner to draw help from the strong side corner shuffler down low hammers it home that ends a 90 run for North Carolina State previously the Tigers had missed on seven straight shots foreign Music ER now pass getting a screen from dewana if dewana just rolls hard and screams and rebounds he will do a very good job to help NC State Chase Hunter has been pretty quiet offensively so far beetle look at morsel move his feet cut off that Baseline Drive Music elbow J by Hunter that misses into the hands of jarkel Joyner Music Joyner gets a step and gets rejected by PJ Hall a teamhigh 11 block shots now for Mr Hall I mean Joyner gets to the second level with no issue but PJ Hall is waiting thats what you call a rim protector right there Music could have a major presence defensively in this game for Clemson as this game wears on Smith trying to find space with a crossover duwana down low he gets his shot blocked by Beetle ahead to Hunter Tyson who hits the deck and we will have a foul coming up now theres a trip its a good job by Roger Ayers he was the trail official on that play and he he came out of his area to pick up that call thats the right call the fans were waiting for that call to take place Hunter Tyson gets tied up with Casey Marcel you have to call that foul Music threepoint lead here for North Carolina State trying to do something that has been difficult for teams in the ACC so far thats win on the road in League Play entering the day home teams were 125 in their building Ben Middlebrooks with the kick Tyson now its seven to shoot jumper got it using his size and thats one of the positions that I was talking about Casey Marcel 63 Hunter Tyson 68 takes him inside and scores over the top first points of the day for Hunter Tyson hes a teams second leading scorer this season in their leading rebounder almost averaging a doubledouble this season Smith flies in and gets fouled as he hits the floor and hell go to the line for a pair one point lead for North Carolina state after the foul applied to Middlebrooks more in a moment from Clemson theres Vision here comes the screen by Clark its a little brush screen right to confuse the defense hes looking into the second level and Casey Marcel is a great threepoint shooter in the corner now watch what happens to Hunter Tyson hes got to make a choice does he help on the penetration or does he stay with a threepoint shooter he digs and helps hes late to recover Casey Marcel makes him pay and more cell is off to a hot start by the way hes hit three of four from the field including that threepointer he has three of the five field goals for the wolf pack who lead it here now by two sir turquavion Smith his first point and now his second point of the afternoon he struggled from the field hes also struggled against Clemson he had some problems in two games last year he only averaged four and a half points per game they really put the clamps on him well hes a shooter and hes thinking about the next shot so hes not worried hes put the time into the Reps in and hes not going to lose his confidence Dylan Hunter into the game for the first time Derek I dont think any college player has time to lose their confidence on if he put the work in at game speed repping the shots that youre going to get in the system theres no time theres not enough games Music Smiths got it here well this should be a clear out get give it right back to him now go shot clock to five Smith into Burns Burns flips it up with the left hand no good Tyson rebound I like the execution but Clemson does a great job of cleaning up the glass NC State really hasnt gotten anything on the offensive boards easily Music middle Brooks trying to take Burns for a ride missed a layup Burns just too big down low for Ben Middlebrook big and strong an immovable object on the Block top of the arc three misses by Smith see I think two quavians got to get it on a reversal and then he gives up two on this other end because hes looking at his coats you could see they went right after him youre right Deb after that shot right down to Godfrey for the dunk backtoback Mistakes by NC State Smith could not get to that one three mistakes in a row Tyson shakes free of Smith his jumper misses grabbed by Middlebrooks rips it away down low between three Defenders is able to draw a whistle and hell go to the line good work from Ben Middlebrooks I love the development of Ben Middlebrooks hes playing 10 and a half minutes a game he was a starter while PJ Hall was out seven games and hes handled his role coming off the bench they say players make their most improvement from freshman to sophomore year I believe thats true in Bens case knocking down the first free throw as Marcel and pass head out well see LJ Thomas for the first time here as Joyner reenters The Fray as well for the wolf pack Music two for metal Brooks and a lead for the Tigers at 15 14 Joyner into the front Court Thomas looking to get it into burns when Burns is showing numbers to the ball you got to get him to get it to him shot clock to 10 as Byrne spins off fading away from the rim showing some Nifty offensive moves draws a whistle and will go to the line I mean come on look at the big man moving he wants the ball he demands the ball I love his body language without the ball look at that move along the Baseline the spin hes got power and some finesse to his game thats number two on Godfrey Burns misses the first heres our Wednesday college basketball double header right here on acc Network in the ESPN app Kyle filipowski and number 17 Duke are in Raleigh to take on to Cleveland Smith and North Carolina State at 7 Eastern that is off to the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill Fernando baycott Caleb love and number 25 North Carolina hosting Tyree Appleby in Wake Forest should be two great matchups with some of the conferences top teams on the ACC Network after North Carolina being preseason number one they have fallen to nine and five and one and two in the league with that loss to Pitt today and how about Pitt off to a hot start unbeaten in ACC play as Galloway cant connect in the three hits one four in a row Derek two on the road NC State and Syracuse in League Play and knocking off North Carolina today Thomas open from Deep Tyson rebound by the way Hunter Tyson off to a career best start rebounding the basketball as Hunter with the whirling dervish maneuver cant connect this is a really small quick lineup on the floor for Kevin Keats right now with DJ Burns four out one in these are two of the top threepoint shooting teams in the ACC its been a slow start from Deep for both as Burns misses the wing jumper PJ Hall guarding DJ Burns Music forget the initials mixed up Ill apologize to the parents right now Dylan Hunter trying to survey and probe gets it back from Galloway Hall under 10 to shoot down to seven Hall turn around Jay in the paint no good and a rebound controlled by Smith Music Smith clears out some room well fire away cant hit it burns got a hand on the rebound out of bounds over to Clemson turquavion Smith oh for six for the wolf pack yet the game is tied under eight Music Gatorade fit off the upset I mean what a huge win for Amanda Butler in Clemson to knock off top 10 in the country in Virginia Tech number seven it was a night of upsets on the womens side in the ACC heres a couple of other ones Duke went into Reynolds and knocked off NC State Florida State gives North Carolina backtoback losses and Notre Dame squeaks by with those 22 turnovers over Katie Myers Miami defense one of the top conferences in womens college basketball the depth for sure on display last night with those upsets turn around shot by Middlebrooks Off the Mark gets the Miss back though Tyson will fire away and hit Hunter Tyson from Deep he can fill it up from the outside shooting 41 percent on the season from behind the arc he can get hot twice hes had 20 points or more this season including a big game against Penn State which is a huge win in overtime for Clemson by the way thats just a second made three in this game by Clemson just a third from either side the tip and the put back is Good from Ben Middlebrooks Clemsons winning in the paint and to your point Clemson is the best threepoint shooting team so their ability to shoot the three with establishing their play and the paint is going to make them very dangerous as the game moves on Thomas contested shot slap back outside Smith three thats good one of the best times to get a triple offensive rebound that might be what turquavion Smith needs to get going his team best 43rd made three of the season s first field goal of the game yeah Im sorry Derek thats what Im saying about confidence like turquoivion Smith is not going to stop shooting hes worked way too hard on his game thats the first foul charged to LJ Thomas of North Carolina State as we approach bonus time soon here for both sides Chase Hunter hits so Chase Hunter another key offensive star in this game struggling hits up his first two points of the day Music Smith out to catch from Joyner Smith cross over the three grazing The Rim Yeah the degree of difficulty outside the arc for turquavion Smith has been high if he would let the ball come back to him on a reversal then he can attack the closeout oh middle Brooks a zig and a zag misfiring there on the pass you want to use your bounds to create separation this is the three off the offensive rebound a bat for Clemson their first turnover of the game both teams actually now with one turnover for the game with just under six minutes left to go thats been clean right very clean absolutely Marcel trying to dig into the defense look at the Gap help Clemson theyre doing such a good job of contesting tough shot for Joyner another rebound for Hunter Tyson to under the trademark Hallmarks of Brad Brownells D is their ability to get in the Gap make you see numbers Paul pops out for three Smith with a rebound for the wolf pack entry pass to dewana Off the Mark but tip to Marcel his hook shot no good another board for Tyson who gets knocked to the floor and that will lead to a foul it was a good extra effort by dewana every Sunday afternoon we have womens basketball right here on acc Network and the ESPN app New Years Day the game start at noon Eastern and next week its the same as well but were featuring these two Haley van lit and Louisville have won six straight and they host Pittsburgh at two Eastern then its a matchup of the day between number five Notre Dame and number 13 North Carolina Sunday afternoons are for womens basketball on acc Network Miami is clearly the best team in the ACC on the mens side not so sure on the womens side there are multiple options which is going to make the race really fun for the fans by the way Clemson will be back in Action here on Sunday as well Hall with a shot clock approaching 10 seconds against Burns hook shot right hand short tip grab by Marcel I watched PJ Hall before the game make a hundred of those shots left and right hand hes very capable Joyner hopping around misses the jumper again Tyson another rebound and hes already at his season average with nine and well get a whistle off the drive by Brevin Galloway Reverend Galloway one of four players years transfer from Boston College College of Charleston before that attacking a closeout he really wanted to be a part of this Clemson program he was honored before the game he recently scored his 1000th point in his college career I mean hes coming off the Georgia Tech game which I thought was his most efficient game he had 14 points on four of eight shooting three for six outside the threepoint line he made all his free throws and you can see hes an old dude out there shooting free throws right now gets the free throw I believe he recently got engaged as well he did hes from the area its great to be home Seneca South Carolina hes got his first two points of the day as well two points and two rebounds and a sixpoint lead for Clemson as we approach four minutes left to go in the first half as a matter of fact Brevin Galloway told me before the game he got engaged in October at the shepherd Hotel the new Hot Spot in downtown Clemson if you havent been there you need to check out the delish Sisters Restaurant I can attest pretty good right there today yes outstanding stuff burns with seventh burns with five against Hall Burns spins cant score rebound to sheplin how about that d by PJ Hall really building a wall and holding his ground High post for Scheffler Chaplin trying to body through and then he gets rejected by DJ Burns and Joyner putting it on the floor unless its a whistle and that will Usher us into a stop on the floor and a sixpoint lead for the Clemson Tigers stay tuned more in a moment Music Gatorade fit post game show theyll have a complete breakdown and reaction from coaches and players nobody covers the ACC Like We Do by the way Kelsey Riggs coming up at halftime with our halftime report live from South Florida where theyre getting ready for the Capital One Orange Bowl nobody knows ACC football like my buddy Eric McLean who told me Cade Club Nick first start of his career the future of Clemson football all right I like the inside scoop three minutes left to go and the drought for North Carolina state theyre hoping to break it before halftime they are one of their last 17 from the field Clark with the kick Corner three that hits thats the second triple in that deep corner by Casey Marcel and as poorly as NC state has shot the ball its a one possession game out of that media timeout they were shooting 21 percent off the miss Joyner with it you see Clemson gets back builds their transition defense not giving up any easy baskets to NC State Marcel finds room from Deep thats an air ball Mark doing a great job throwing this drift pass after he draws the defense to the paint Dylan Hunter foreign approaching two minutes left to go in the first half PJ Hall has not scored since the first basket of the game where he made a three Galloway no good Hall got a hand on it but it ends up going back over to North Carolina State what are you seeing there with PJ Hall and Im just thinking like that play right there where hes Above the Rim he doesnt have his full lift based on the injury the two surgeries he had in the off season thats probably part of the reason why he he told me before the game Im not quite at 100 Im close theres an example of it right there 100 he throws that down he has battled through leg issues he really didnt get back into game shape until and its still kind of I think hes still working through it exactly because he didnt have much of an offseason workout because of the recovery due to the injuries and he suffered Burns at the wing with eight to shoot down a five down to two for pass lost the ball yeah DJ gave it up in a late clock probably to the wrong option on the floor for NC State Hunter leaning in throws it up cant get it but he was fouled and a couple of free throws on the way for Chase Hunter thats just the first foul on DJ Burns you see right there he leans in okay so heres why thats important because he has played significant quality minutes while hes been out there right hes played over 13 minutes in the first half okay with him not being in voucher but he can get more aggressive in his ball spring coverage and his ability to block shots and his ability to attack off the bounce those things in the second half will be what Im looking for is an adjustment in Burnss play offensively and defensively and that has to be a win for Coach Keats because you dont have to worry about trying to go deeper into the bench because of that and you got a sweat from Ernest Ross you got Ebenezer dewana got a few minutes from from them and that helps save and preserve DJ just a little bit for the second half four points now for Chase Hunter one minute left to go Clemson up by five shot clock under 10 again Joyner trying to shake free outside the pass catch and shoot three thats no good and the rebound controlled by Ben Middlebrooks thats twice in a late clock free and passes ended up with the basketball Hunter cuts through the lane and scores of the left hand and a timeout called by Kevin Gates and North Carolina State six points now for Chase Hunter Moore in a moment from Clemson being the best takes hard work it takes early mornings planning precision sweat sacrifice and teamwork thats why Old Dominion Freight Line the number one National LTL carrier for Quality works hard to be the best in the game and is proud to support those striving to be the best in their game Old Dominion Freight Line helping the world keep promises seven point lead for Clemson over North Carolina State Derrick Jones and Debbie Antonelli with you from Little John Coliseum what do you see here Deb I mean this is where fatigue could play a factor in DJ Burns whos playing drop coverage in the middle third and thats just good ball handling by Chase Hunter and one of the things that Brad Brownell did with Chase in the off season is get him ready to play the point guard position a little more ball handling a little more leadership those things and Chase is not a natural point guard hes handled it well all of his offensive numbers are up over last year hes got a lot on his plate coming in a lot of roster turnover in terms of guard play hes been put in that role as you said and also he has his brother in the mix now too Dylan Hunter one second difference between the game clock and the shot clock down to five for burns Burns trying to work his way to the paint gonna have to put it up and its an offensive foul so Burns maybe took a little bit too much time there and Ben Middlebrooks draws the foul thats number two on burns so you have to referee the defense here and is he displaced thats three Chucks on the fourth one Music I think coach Keats was perhaps looking for a flop Hunter with one puts it up and thats too late so Chase Hunter had a shot at it but at the end of the half its Clemson up at seven 2821 Kelsey Riggs has our halftime report thats live from South Florida as we get you set for the Capital One Orange Bowl big first half for Clemson to close it out up by seven over North Carolina State Carolina State how do you get out of this rut offensively move the ball play inside out and theyll start half two with The Rock The Way Clemson is defending and theyre like Gap protection one and a half players and again look at PJ Hall hes sitting in the gap on DJ Burns while hes guarding Burns so Joyner cant get to the rim Smith long Miss off the three grabbed by PJ Hall you just saw their whats at stake for these two teams Clemson looking for its best start since the 1718 season in the ACC with the win and then on the side of North Carolina State looking for their fourth win in a row but theyre gonna have to get that offense going to get that done inside to Godfrey Godfrey with seven to shoot gets fouled Music so DJ Burns picks up his third foul and thats where Casey Marcels got to raise his hand thats old school right hey give that foul to me we dont want DJ to have three see watch Marcel is there on the help yeah youre right hes right there Im Im wanting if Im NC State I want Casey Marcel to have that foul freshman RJ Godfrey at the line remember the comment I made with a minute 15 left in the first half DJ picked up his first foul yes and he got a second now hes got three okay he got three fouls in two minutes of play and again to kind of underscore that point we talked about in the first half the injury to Deshawn mahorsich suffering that rough leg injury and that really puts a crimp into their plans in terms of depth he and thats going to be a longterm problem potentially hes out indefinitely with the dislocated right patella and well see when he can come back but in the meantime they have to have burns out there on the floor Music Joyner I mean look at the D by Clemson hes able to shoot and a foul thatll be a trip so that foul will be picked up by Godfrey and thatll be his third thats the second tripping call that Roger Ayers has had to call and like he came over to the scores table Roger full of Personality he didnt mean to do it but he did it very thorough really have to enjoy this crew Smith catching shoot three thats good and one four point play opportunity on the way for turquavion Smith if youre NC State you are looking for an emotional lift this could be it turquoivion struggling only made one basket before this triple and he gets fouled with a chance for a fourpoint play foul charge through the transfer Brevin Galloway Smith cant finish off the fourpoint play The Rebound by Hall instead the lead cut to five this is where turquavian has matured hes not going to worry about his offense hes got to do other things and he understands that he can rebound he can make assists he can get two feet in the pain and dish its not just about shooting if youre not if you dont have it more cell started by the taller Hunter Tyson Music Smith leaning in cant throws it long down the floor for Hunter Tyson Tyson lays it up and in and one Hunter Tyson with the catch and the layup yeah turquavion Smith cannot be a ball stopper in their offense right now and he drives to the bucket and then he complains that he doesnt get the call and NC State doesnt Sprint and guess what Clemson does that foul charged to Jack Clark seven points and nine rebounds for Hunter Tyson hes working on his sixth DoubleDouble of the season most of those have come this year I mean thats the way you want your fifth year guys to play play your best basketball at the end of your college career eightpoint lead that was the margin at halftime for Clemson as going to the floor after the block is Casey morsel so again active protecting the rim on the Tigers same thing for PJ Hall no fouls in the game three block shots you go for everything now you try to block everything near the rim the team leader in Block shots Burns trying to find some room and thats an offensive foul on DJ Burns Kevin Keats cant believe it and that is number four on DJ Burns and that is a technical foul to boot it will be against Kevin Keats and things unraveling at the moment for North Carolina State down by eight heres one thing I think Kevin Keats is upset about does PJ Hall put two hands on DJ Burns so Hall All Smiles after that play its Tyson at the line Tyson edges closer towards another double double now in the double figures with 10 hes been Walling up PJ Hall no fouls you got a referee the defense and Keats was visibly upset the moment that happens and that was a quick trigger on the whistle for a take all stuck Ebenezer dewana by the way into the game for Burns and well see how long Burns has that Extended Stay on the bench with the four fouls I mean the way this game is going what was a 10point lead to 13 13 points for Hunter Tyson another threepointer as Clark tries to answer he does he needs to get hot for NC State hes capable he had 14 points in the win against Louisville last time out its Hall driving to the rim and well get a foul here I believe on the floor first see thats what Kevin Keats has the angle that we had does PJ Hall put two hands on him and then not very good ball screen defense right there against Hunter Tyson all lobbed that one into Tyson but over his head and a foul off the drive by Smith and this is a huge moment in this game dad for North Carolina State because when you see these technical fouls sometimes happen so those emotional plays those emotional momentum changes that can go either way the Clark that was the second foul by the way charged to Josh Beadle as Smith finds room for three Off the Mark Tyson with a rebound and that is number 10 so hes got another double double Music feeds the post stole it Clark got a hand in on it Smith on the Run Smith blocked swooping in for the rejection Chase Hunter wow so quavions trying to get the end one so he leans in and he Euros just a little hesitation step and the closing speed of Chase Hunter and for that he gets a quick breather on the bench after that run down 10point lead for Clemson 3727 Tawana with the drop for Joyner Music Joyner trying to find some room along the Baseline more cell his three thats no good tipped around Clark tries to save it does so to Joyner Joyner in the lane defeat Tawana with a hammer points of the day for Ebenezer dewana the lead at eight five in a row for the wolf pack all trying to get positioned Galloway Paul nearly lost the ball shot clock to five Galloway for three no good Clark with the rebound who comes from almost mid Court to get the ball Id go back to Jack Clark right now Joyner wow he got fouled there by Dylan Hunter and the momentum perhaps swinging on the side of the wolf pack to dewana Gator prior to that last break chase down block he also chased down a degree recently back on December 22nd picking up his degree in parks recreation and tourism management thats pretty impressive it is impressive in an error where all we talk about is the transfer portal and name Imaging likeness and collectives and heres Chase Hunter Im sure thats a proud moment for him and his family congratulations six points two rebounds a block also with steal as well plus did you see President Jim Clements handing out the diploma I miss seeing him here I know hes down there with the football team but I missed Jim and Beth Clements here at Clemson well Im here Joanna misses the shot and did Tyson stay in bounds he did not back to the wolf pack whats up into Smith he shot 414 against Louisville while scoring 14 points Clark on the drive cant get it to put back and one for Jack Clark I want Jack Clark for NC State to start to come alive and I called for it right before the break he hit a three I think hes a guy that can be a matchup issue especially with a smaller lineup on the floor for Clemson right now this is a great extra effort by Jack Clark to get that deuce second one on Ben Middlebrooks eight straight for the wolf pack and Clark I dont think its a coincidence once he has started to get going this lead for Clemson has shrunk with seven points and seven rebounds Hunter nearly lost the ball in the lane Tyson Fade Away Jay tough shot he just knows how to play hes not going to be on the top of the scout but he rebounds he defends his position hes gotten better every year 15 points as that ball tipped out of bounds by Josh beedle I mean this play breaks down Hunter Tyson has nothing he fumbles it but then watch the footwork right here against Jack Clark the fade away Smith tough shot as Tyson grabbing the ball another rebound hes got 11 trying to spin free what a move by Hunter Tyson he is having a game 17 points 11 rebounds for Hunter Tyson coming in averaging just under 15 points per game as a foul here in the corner with darkell Joyner working again great footwork Clark into the paint spins away only had five points at the half hes come alive here further in half two Joyner missing the three loose ball and it will go back over to Clemson NC States got to get tough right here theyve got to get in a stance they got to get three consecutive stops to get back in it and turquavion Smith cant get beat over the top right here beetle is all the way down the other end of the floor Tyson who has six double doubles now this season tossing it into Chase Hunter Middlebrooks wide open from Deep oh couldnt bank that one in another rebound by Tyson in another bucket its the hunter Tyson second half show pick a high line anyone any of them honor Tyson and the Tigers stealing it up by double figures once again Music Subway series menu 12 irresistible five double figures over North Carolina State and Debbie Hunter Tyson has been a big factor 14 second half points mostly in the midrange and from the freethrow line he did hit a three five of six from the field and half two to go along with three rebounds its just a Music cool does his job this is by far his best year at Clemson and mentioned the double doubles this season all of them but one happening this year Smith whips a pass in down low shot on the way trickles in Music good ATO offensively by NC State and they got to keep the pressure on dewana now with four beetle dealing with the aforementioned dewana the kick to Tyson for three knocks it down Hunter Tyson having himself a day good ball movement everyone gets a touch off the timeout Music beautifully set up for the three in the corner 22 points closing in on his career high Smith trying to go at him and he steps out of bounds to Cleveland Smith with a turnover these teams held it together in terms of taking care of the basketball in the first half but not on that possession NC State had three turnovers in the first half thats their second of the second half Hunter brings it down middle Brooks open top of the arc three no good that shots there for him but he has not been able to really knock that down as Ernest Ross with a rebound Music Joyner retreats Music had a mismatch Smith throws it off oh thats a smart he gets fouled by Ben middle Brooks and a Savvy Savvy play there by turkwavion Smith thats a smart play by turkuevion you got a mismatch three free throws when we come back Gatorade fit right here Here Comes middle Brooks a set of ball screen but what Beetle does is he rejects it so now he draws two look at the spacing by Clemson Middleburg steps out to re receive the reverse pass and then its skip drive three its a Well executed play drive down the lane line draw help in the hot hands spotted up in the corner beautifully done off the timeout by Brad brownells team how about Hunter Tyson 22 points eight of 12 shooting from the field the rest of his team has 24 points in the game that coincidentally 24 is his career high speaking of Hunter Tyson picked that up against Penn State back in November which is a huge win for Clemsons resume Penn State has one of the better teams in my estimation in the Big Ten I think theyre an NCAA tournament team well its interesting as we get into this time of year in the conference play I mean these are two of the teams that are kind of in that that mix after you get past the Dukes Miami that first cluster North Carolina Virginia Tech and you start looking at some of the other teams behind those four and these are two of the teams who could get in that mix in terms of getting looks in the tournament I mean come on its pretty sad to say theres no easy night in the ACC right I mean we know that its who you play when and where you play them and you have to obviously throw pit in there too now with the way theyve started out league play Ive got Virginia Pitt next week on Tuesday up at Pittsburgh I cant wait I cant believe how good that game is going to be how great that crowds gonna be coach capels done an excellent job with his team this year but Tony Bennetts team is always built to go on the road oh no doubt about it with that defense very tough that was the second foul picked up by Casey Marcel and another foul here this will be against Ebenezer dewana with the hole time is on 21 so dewana now with two fouls mounting up here for North Carolina State so Chase Hunter will toss in here seven team fouls committed by Clemson six now for North Carolina State 11 28 left to go Hunter nice speed down low to haul hook shot thats good beautifully done by Chase Hunter and PJ Hall and it wasnt like NC States team didnt prepare for that exact out of bounds play the whole staff was yelling it calling out the action and we watched them work on that today PJ hall now with Five Points Ross got the three Ernest Ross thats his first threepointer of the season in his first three of the day as Ross comes up with a steal to the corner got three missing from Marcel wow NC State hasnt played well Clemson just keeps punching and the Wolf Pack hasnt gone away yet Hunter with a three wow what a big shot so Chase Hunter now with nine I like the time out by Brad Brownell he sent a little momentum hes going to get his guys recollected regrouped get the focus back I sold my car to carvana and it was awesome I heard about carvana through friends so I thought Id give it a try it was easy I input information about the car including the mileage the VIN number answered a few questions and got a real offer in seconds it felt too good to be true it was a lot higher than I expected a carvana Advocate came to my house as soon as they sat in my car they paid me on the spot I couldnt believe it I recommend it to anyone try it for yourself go to carvanacom and get an offer for your car at carvana Debbie big momentum swing there potentially in this game Casey Marcel has a chance to knock down a three he cant hit but on the other side Chase Hunter is able to hit one Marcel has the three its an eightpoint game he makes it a fivepoint game instead Hunter with a huge triple right down 1029 thats when he hits it thats what Im writing down because that makes it an 11 point game what a swing and what a timeout by Brad Brownell Joyner looking to the post for dewana down low Ross got stripped and right there is dewana with a dunk dawana with six the lead down to nine Im looking for a backdoor play a ball fake and a back door slip something like that NC States picking up their pressure tigers have hit on four of their last there it is from the field back door and the layup hey youre a Hall of Famer for a reason Laughter beetle with the Finish perfect execution by Brads team 5342 ball game top of the arc three thats no good and Tyson is fouled by Ross off the rebound dewana and Ross together have been effective theres that back door cut perfectly designed and executed great finish by Beetle thats not an easy finish either down low so again after the foul situation mounting up its a one and one for Clemson Tyson looks for Point 23 hes got the ACC network has number seven Clemson covered in Miami for the Capital One Orange Bowl tonight at six Eastern the Huddle crew will have a twohour pregame show followed by the sky cast view of the game flying overhead for every play and after the game stick around for the ACC huddles post game show theyll have a complete breakdown in reactions from coaches and players nobody covers the ACC like we do my guy Eric McLean likes seeing those big guys scoring a paint I can tell you that right now I know hes a low post guy he told me the Clemson defensive line is this an encore for them or is it the start of the comeback tour theres a couple of guys there that could go to the NFL but the rumor is according to emac maybe theyre going to come back Joyner answers on the other end by the way via the trip to the free throw line and the two free throws Hunter Tyson tying his career high in scoring now 24 points 13 rebounds look at duwana getting on top of that post up doing a good job of Defending PJ Hall Tysons got it here 10 to shoot Hall corner three Clark with a rebound NC States defense will take PJ Hall shooting threes even though hes capable Joyner gets the step and a foul on the drive this is a team in North Carolina State coming in averaging 80 points per game this season stuck on 44 with 8 39 left well everythings been a struggle theres no easy transition getting to the freethrow line now theyre starting to mount up some fouls theres no easy buckets on the offensive end everything is contested its that great Clemson Gap line protect Inside Out defense speaking of scoring DJ Burns hes out of the game right now on the bench with four fouls Deb what do you think about bringing him back in well I I definitely wouldnt have brought him in before the eight minute time out thats for sure and lets see if NC State because I think dewana has been doing a good job defending PJ hall now you know if DJ Burns comes back in the game theyre going to go right at him at some point you might want to consider offense defensive substitution but it might be too early to do that Burns left the game with just over 16 minutes left to go Hunter missed a pointblank range Joyner on the Move Joyner into the lane trying to track down the handle of the ball look at Clemson build a wall Joyner cant convert another rebound number 14 for Hunter Tyson beetle spins off the ball and his put back is good and the foul Josh beetle seeing some extra time here today because of the injury situation with Alex hemenway converting and scoring to add to the lead yeah an 11 point lead for Clemson under eight left to go and it appears DJ Burns is on the way back in new customers get our best deals on all smartphones Clemson leading North Carolina State 5746 Derrick Jones and Debbie Antonelli with you and Deb how about Josh Beadle coming in off the bench I mean he was an early substitution in the first half I thought Brad Brown now is just trying to get a little sweat in case he needed him hes been fantastic hes defended his position and that is a great takeoff to bounce to get inside and finish with contact hes averaging just two points per game but today design up Point number five at the line benzenes knocks it down so beetle adding to the lead its 5846 by the way coming up after this game ACC huddle live from Miami as Clemson getting ready for the Capital One Orange Bowl The Rainmaker three is an air ball back over to Clemson still plenty of basketball left here I still feel like turquavion Smith is going to have some impact on this game I mean how can he shoot it that poorly hes too good of a player here he comes with the ball right here hes two of 15 from the field in this game DJ Burns is back in with the four fouls going to PJ Hall turns goes glass and it goes in for DJ Burns and well get a travel on the other side and a turnover back over to North Carolina state so burns on the offense on one end and the turnover by Clemson on the other thats their sixth turnover in the game Clemson has done such a great job on the glass protecting in the Gap not allowing the speed to become a factor for NC State its just a great oneonone move right here by DJ Burns he can pretty much go wherever he wants with a ball yes 275 pounds hes got five points today in part due to the foul trouble also some pretty good defense by PJ he wants a clear out he wants to get to that left hand working against middle Brooks here and thats a travel on DJ Burns sixth turnover committed by the Wolfpack I like the DJs calling his own number right there you talk about personality I mean DJ Burns is full of it has a smile on his face a lot of the time and wow he let Chase Hunter have it there down low smiling on that tank and for DJ Burns that is number five and hes gone Music Burns will head off Five Points six rebounds and he did not agree with that call neither did Kevin Keiths getting that technical earlier he really cant respond like he would like to Music Hunter missing the free throw NC State the jump ball that looks like all ball from that angle thats a tough one to pick up your fifth foul one out of two for Chase Hunter coming in shooting 77 percent from the line its a lead of 11 for Clemson with just over six and a half left to go happy holidays to you thanks for joining us on the ACC Network game three of our triple header Smith trying to get inside no good but two free throws on the way as Hunter Tyson in disbelief after that call see this is a way that turquavion Smith can have an impact impact on the game right his shots not falling but hes got a match up he believes he can take to the rim and he does he draws a foul now hes got two free throws this is a good thing for NC State clock stop game is slowed down thats Clemsons Pace now NC States got to try to play Within that without DJ burns on the floor Im still looking for Jack Clark to have a chance to get open for threes Smith with 12 points now its interesting Smith from the field two of 15 hes two of ten from three but has been a frequent visitor to the freethrow line to help run at that point total the lead down to nine middle Brooks Chase Hunter Beetle the penetration in the middle Brooks lays it in ben middle Brooks Smith down low delwana and one Ebenezer dewana back in the mix and back to the freethrow line go the wolf pack Shooters spaced out middle pick and roll good catch and finish again to the freethrow line its number three on beetle Joanna its down the free throw he only took six free throws heading into this game 33 percent shooter they need every point they can get heading down the stretch here an eightpoint lead for Clemson the watch getting the ball over the midcourt line and then its a turnover nonetheless once they get in the front Court off the leg of Chase Hunter thats turnover number seven for Clemson all in all Chase Hunter not being a natural point guard has done a terrific job so far in this game Music he reads the twoman game so well Marcel Smith cutting in Euro lays it up and in beautifully done by turquavion Smith plenty of time for NC State Music 16 points for Smith Im going to run something for Hunter Tyson right here there he is Tyson out from Deep got it nine point lead and a new career high for Hunter Tyson 27 had the hot hand Derek and he wants to take the big shot right now Smith gets a screen foul line jumper thats good here comes turquavion Smith ion Smith 17 points he averaged four and a half in the two games that North Carolina State lost last season to Clemson youve got to really be tough right here youve got to get in a stance youve got to guard and you got a rebound you cant give up that if youre NC State Brad Brownell needs a timeout middle Brooks with the follow off the missed by Beetle and a timeout for the Tigers up by nine Deb the threepoint shooting here for Clemson what a great find Hunter Tyson JCC like we do Clemson and Tennessee coming up in the Capital One Orange Bowl sir quavion Smith and Hunter Tyson very different days Tyson career high for him with 27 Smith fighting for 17 points Joyner now Smith checked by Beetle crossing over launching the three missed it Tyson with another rebound adding to his total 15 which is a career high for him beetle Music Hunter wheeling and dealing back towards the midcourt line with under 10 to shoot down to five for Chase Hunter leans in right handed shot no good dewana rebound Joyner to the paint his layup no good dewana battling kept it alive and now a possession for North Carolina State good hustle there by Ebenezer Joanna good help on the ball screen Smith and foul called against Josh Beadle so that will put Smith back to the freethrow line once again and that for beetle is number four Music and Deb this is a sign you have to think of somebody who in Smith has learned from struggling in terms of from the field he can try to find a different way to get his points yeah I mean when your shots like and youre the player the quality of turquoivion Smith you got to find other ways to impact the game and hes doing that here by getting to the line and being aggressive off the bounce as you look at Clemsons foul trouble the only Beetle the only one so beetle with the four and then obviously if youre just joining us DJ burns on the side of North Carolina State had four early on in the second half and he just found out his Beetle misses the three oh Hunter Tyson could not get rebound 16 instead off to the wolf pack middle Brooks did a good job of shadowing to Cleveland Smith and thats why he was late on the closeout to Casey Marcel oh a fivepoint game Clemson hasnt made many mistakes in transition defense that was one Music Dylan Hunter two and a half left to go the wolf pack hanging around shot 21 percent in the first half theyve hit five of their last seven from the field the mystery here Tawana and Middlebrooks battling and that will be a foul on dewana battling with Middlebrooks for what NC State defenses forced triples the last couple of possessions on the defensive end and they just havent been able to get the rebound this is a great Swing Swing in transition by NC State so double bonus both ways the rest of the way oh its been physical yes I mean every action is contested in this game every cut has an elbow in your rib cage you force the contested triple and Middlebrooks does a great job of getting inside position middle Brooks looking to add to his career total now with 10 so a new career high not just for Hunter Tyson but for Ben Middlebrooks as well sevenpoint game Smith finding room for three missed it middle Brooks battling grabs a loose ball under duress gets it into the front Court middle Brooks who has played admirably here to spell PJ Hall the urgency on a stop right here is important is of high importance you force another three the shot selected by Clemson down the stretch has not been good NC States got a window three to counter on the other side no good there Marcel he cant answer offensive rebound by Joyner trying to buy Middlebrook down low his layup is no good Tim Mike Clark still moves and maintain oh a tie up down low oh boy theyve got to get in between Marcel and Dylan Hunter who are battling there and the wrestling match leads to a jump ball call but in the meantime both teams returning to their respective Corners I think theyre definitely gonna have to look at it so both sides trying to get a quick breather here with 125 left and one time out remaining for Clemson two left for North Carolina State heres the jump and then theres the excess by Casey Marcel I believe theyre going to stick a technical on him its a dead ball contact technical right now theyre taking a look at whether they should upgrade it or not and I think theyre going to upgrade it and this is a horrible time for NC State after they get a jump ball to have this play right here thats the freshman Dylan Hunter battling with the vet Casey Marcel they can move it to an F1 which is excessive too much unnecessary and avoidable and you have to think I agree with you Deb there is an action there that was maybe not necessary on the side as Casey Marcel as well find out okay they did not upgrade it to an F1 it is a common foul on Casey Marcel technical foul which is a dead ball contact technical its two free throws for Clemson NC State gets the ball now where was the possession arrow on that jump off the possession arrow I believe was pointing in favor of Clemson after that play we will have to see here Clemson will have possession of the basketball on top of the technical foul so this is yeah this is a very problematic potentially for North Carolina State and again if youre just joining us this would be the second technical foul of the game I think the veteran crew here in the situation in the game made a wise decision while at other points in the game that might have been upgraded I think this group which is an A plus crew and Dylan hunter gets both so Hunter not known for his scoring yet those are the two free throws for the foul now we shoot the technicals right which is two free throws thats under Tyson doing work from the free throw line gets the first so again Marcel was involved with Dylan Hunter there on the dislodge to the floor and Tyson gets the free throws as well 29 Points 15 rebounds an 11 point lead again just a few moments ago this was a 6661 ball game this is a inbounding the ball at the point of interruption double team down low ahead to Dylan Hunter 120 left so again theyve built this lead further and now have possession of the ball Music 15 to shoot just over a minute left to go Music down to seven Dylan Hunter scoop layup got it wow an acrobatic layup from Dylan Hunter so he gets it done at the freethrow line and adds to the lead its at 13 Smith in the lane his jumper short the rebound corralled by Beetle ball Pops in the air for Hunter Tyson who is fouled by traquavion Smith with 447 left Beetle and Dylan Hunter have been terrific Off the Bench this is a big time play for the freshman Music third against Smith well one of the story lines coming into this game without the services of Alex Hemingway The Freshman the younger players asked to step up and they have filled in admirably here in this spot and of course the gentleman at the free throw line has done his due diligence as well with 30 points 25 of them here in the second half another from Hunter Tyson with 44 seconds left to go Joyner down low and Joanna loses the ball with 33 seconds left to go Hunter says good day and half and happier from Little John Coliseum Marcel with an answer thats short outside to Smith hits a three and a timeout call by North Carolina State but you call an exclamation point on a team thats going to go three and oh in the ACC Music I think thats far in the ACC hit defeating North Carolina today to stay undefeated Miamis still doing their thing at the top of the league so its tight quarters right now at the top of the ACC I think thats a really good time out by Kevin Keats too because thats what I would call a character time now keep your guys okay that dunk motions can get high and motions got high with Casey Marcel 14 point lead here with North Carolina state in the hole theyll fall to one and three in ACC play with some very very challenging games on the horizon as Clark knocks that ball away from Hunter Tyson itll stay with Clemson with 14 seconds left to go Music Duke Virginia Tech and Miami the next three for North Carolina State the wolf pack made a push but Clemson answering late they win it by 14 7864 an impressive performance in the second half to close it out by the Tigers 30 for the first time since 201718 and ACC play and Deb this is an important win for Clemson potentially but a huge effort by Hunter Tyson we started off talking about
