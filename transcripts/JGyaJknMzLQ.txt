Navy Virginia Tech under white from Castle Coliseum coaches love these Sunday Cruise you get all the good guys shoot open look Hokes on the board such a big key Jaden shoot is playing his best only had six points the other night but really played one of his better games especially on the defense hes hit multiple threes in the last four games here is benini going to work stepped out of bounds good job by Rex ster right there You got to stay between bonini and the basket if he penetrates Navy can be good on offense Navys going to pick up full court theyll do a little 221 and thatll be back to manto man theyll do a little one31 back to Zone they mix it up a little bit in the half court they prefer manto man no changes to the Virginia Tech starting five meanwhile Navy with two new players in shoot left that a little short Kim and woods the new starters in the lineup for the midshipman mixing things up in the midst of this threegame losing streak all way from home maybe hadnt played on Camp us in a while theyre going to go from November 25th to January 2nd without a home game and there is G new Kim the sophomore out of Overland Park Kansas going to the line prefers to drive the basketball he can make an open three but theres the head coach of the hokes Mike young closing in on career win number 400 yeah both both coaches former Southern Conference head coaches guys Im very familiar with and coached against both these guys both have won the Southern Conference tournament multiple times Kim last year shot just 14 from behind the threepoint Arc this year almost 44 yeah and almost perfect from the free throw line hes now 12 of 13 on the season theres that 221 Zone to slow Virginia Tech down back into manto man for Navy re Steiner feeds potit with five on the timer and with the left hand potit scores nice job if you can establish poti early in the game it really changes the opponents defense gives the hes a big advantage on the offense only played 14 minutes on Thursday yeah the bench was just too good the other night his back up big Pat wesler had a big game 13 points six rebounds on a very efficient five out of six from the floor behind the back bonini going in Mike young wants jump ball its a foul against the hokes got to have help on that ball screen right there seal him off Austin bonini from Woodlands Texas the Woodlands Texas in the first off the bench for Virginia Tech Patrick wesler a little reward for such a solid performance the other night against okina ENT L scor 95 their best output of the season Music Keyhole 610 penck yes right before the shot clock yeah 66 of his of his field goal attempts are threes and when that defense collaps we talk about it all the time defense collapses somebodys open on the perimeter The Freshman off to a great start in his rookie campaign will step back wont fall benini gets by Rex Steiner lost it waiting to see looks like its going to stay here yeah theres the head coach of the midshipman Ed dechellis former head coach at ETSU Penn State done a really nice job at Navy yeah had had a good uh run at at East Tennesseee state in uh in the Southern Conference and then uh off to Penn State and then uh ended up at Navy and hes had a had a really good career wherever hes been hes done a really nice job 11th alltime meeting between coach dellis and Coach young today including when coach young was an assistant at wford open left wing three Draper coming in off the bench makes his presence felt yeah and he he he prefers to drive but you leading that wide open if you can play at this level you can make a three hes coming off a careerhigh 22 points just his second made three of the year he was one for 17 before knocking the bottom out of that one wesler in the post gets to his left hand Navy playing a little bit faster this year than they have in previous Seasons they are playing faster trying to take advantage of the athleticism and a good point guard play Lysander renstrom shooting 34 from distance couple of triples for the mid shipment theyve got the sixpoint lead yeah when you when you take notes on him you know 87 of his attempts are from Beyond The Arc wesler trying to spin away from kho just throws it up draws a foul and were going to step aside for our first time out when we come back more from Castle Coliseum on a Sunday Music afternoon had a chance to to tour the Naval Academy that day bright and early at 800 am watching the midshipman stand at attention for morning colors they continued the day by getting to sit inside of a naval helicopter steered a ship virtually laid down inside of sleeping quarters and checked out the Academy stateoftheart Firearms so not only did Coach young leave Annapolis with the win against the midshipman but also with the experiences for his team theyll never forget and a gift hell treasure forever Evan yeah thanks for that Kendall how about that back thats thats unbelievable what a really unique experience for the entire team to go do that and Im sure thats a trip coach will never forget yeah thats something not everybody gets to do and uh probably everybody should try to do to uh to appreciate what those young men and women go through in Annapolis no doubt about it were talking with Coach dellis earlier obviously a exciting day for Navy yesterday yeah we we spoke a lot about the football game and and how big a deal that is uh and navy put on a performance against the heavily favored Black Knights of the Hudson shoot converting all three free throws again great to have you with us on your Sunday afternoon and not a good foul by Aiden kho right there foul in the jump shooter and the threepoint shooter and shoot made them pay thats bobbled by renstrom itll stay with navy theres coach young disagreeing on the sideline yeah he doesnt do that all that often hes not very hes not very animated over there most of the time but he felt pretty strongly about that one and they changed it I think they said if Mike young is complaining we better look at this that wont go in the stat sheet but the bench doing its job there thats right yes here is Ben Hammond coming off with an outstanding night against North Carolina t so is Rodney Brown and theyre picking up right where they left off how about that two guys off the bench coming off their career highs started again with the assist and the jumper from the corner a 60 run for Virginia Tech to tie things at 11 and a travel Draper trying to cut in its a Navy team that really values the basketball you wont see that all that often no and and they they havent missed a shot but theyve turned it over three times already here in the first five minutes among the nations best at taking care of the basketball Hammond 17 points five steals showing the offense still perfect seven for six for six the other night streak is at seven hoks back in front Navy look to respond benini shot not there nice job by Hammond closing out forcing benini to give it up a foul on the perimeter yeah penck putting it on the floor doesnt really do that a lot but you let him go to his strong hand Rodney Brown Jr picking up the foul got to cut him off got beat right there didnt get enough Health from Shoot hard help off that that corner shooter over there Rodney Browns got to stay between him and the basket 80 run for Virginia Tech back and forth early Draper floater will count and a chance for a threepoint play yeah hes a driver first hes a driver second hes a driver third even though we saw him make a three early in this game again with that right hand you got to cut him off got to know where his dominant hand is Drapers a really good Defender I think he may be in the game because of his athleticism against Toby lewow on the other end starting the game Navy back in front showing the Press again just to slow Virginia Tech down give them less time in the half court Burnham guarded by Draper you mentioned his defense he a really good Defender really good motor plays so hard had a big day in practice yesterday we got to watch him poti almost able to get that to fall off the window Austin benini leading the Patriot League an assist per game fourth in scoring and hoky forced a turnover young the whole way foul on the floor well ma we were just talking about how Navy really values the basketball and there you see the turnovers per game these two sides yeah two two teams in opposite directions right now Navy does a really good job only 10 a game theyve already got four here this afternoon and Virginia Tech really struggling even though they played well the other night still had 16 turnovers against AT and going the other way a little push off right there come up with that ball Navy got a chance to try to extend this onepoint lead potit you see him again just 14 minutes he checks out Toby low back on hes going with a really small line up right now while shown the ability to play the five at times this year ma yeah and and this is a a Navy team that if Ks not really in there that they they dont really have a true Center anyway this is probably a good matchup and there you see the benefit of it Toby LA with the deflection tack looking to turn defense to offense young has it swiped bonini full had of steam able to get that to go through two Defenders yeah we talked about it being the key of the offense and thats part of the reason why he can beat you down the floor he can beat you off the dribble creative score aages over 17 a game Rodney Brown strong take in the right hand finish had such a good night the other night played 21 minutes had played like 11 coming into the game 13 points three for five from long range think about that just 11 minutes all year here really making the most of his opportunity Kim going up against low and able to bank it in really nice job tied L up tied his body up where he couldnt jump and use that athleticism Brown hot hand early Navy defense manto man very tough very physical Brown dumps it to low and with three on the shot clock thatll go to Coach young and well step aside for a break making Navy go Austin Beni the point guard the junior out of Texas comes up with the steel realizes the defense has had a disadvantage attacks the rim placed through the contact for the basket from Mike young era and they did some special things later on well there was a lot of offense in that game that season and today yeah look at the combined totals 11 for 15 five for six six for six from the free throw line little bit of turnover issue but uh I anticipate the defense catching up with the offense here as this game goes on great to have you on your Sunday afternoon Evan Hughes M McCarthy Kendall Williams and our outstanding ACC Network crew on hand finals almost over Im sure both sides excited to be back on the floor out of the classroom you missed those dont you oh my gosh you kidding me thankfully hes a Comm major lot a lot of projects and not exams five to shoot for benini averaging a little over 17 per game a foul burn Burnham coming from behind yeah and and bonini recognized it waved everybody off knew he could beat Burnham oneonone and got all the way to the rim before Burnham fouled him trying to block the shot hes coming off the near double double on Thursday eight points n rebounds watch Bon he waves the defense off goes right by Burnham a lot of people meeting at The Rim Clean block from up above benini shooting 84 on the Year from the stripe yeah thatll help your average one you know at one point in his Navy career scored in double figures in 26 consecutive games thats tied for fifth all time and and he shares the basketball he hes got 45 assists 15 turnovers 46 assists 15 turnovers 3 to1 ratio is outstanding there you see the the Patriot League Rank and they they do take those photos in the summertime versus what youre seeing right now you know you know whats amazing though Mac 26 consecutive games in double figures you want to guess who has the Navy record for the most consecutive games in double figures Im guessing itd be a big name and a big guy David Robinson maybe youd be correct he only did it 76 consecutive games Rodney Brown floater wont drop theres kho at 6 10 with the rebound kho is the the main big guy guy that plays for Navy then everybody else is about 64 or less doubled in the post renstrom his second triple of the afternoon yeah just cant let him have that wide open shot right there youve got to know where he is and get a hand up largest lead of the first half for the midshipman Navy jumping a little two three zone mix things up here skip pass re Steiner Corner three just a little short and theres wesler three on one L sander renom didnt get the start today mck but hes making his presence felt yeah collaps onone keyho leaving renstrom wide open and were talking about the bench points for Navy but theyre actually from starters guys that coach the chellis brought Off the Bench today hes from Ron Virginia out of hearnden high school shoot too strong perfect execution got the shot they wanted Okies are missing some open looks Draper benini with t to shoot just enough space on Rex Steiner and a timeout by Mike young in Virginia Tech its a 10point Navy lead well pause and come back after these messages on the ACC Network extra welcome back to Castle Coliseum Navy leading Virginia Tech 25 15 balance scoring for the mid shipment yeah and three guys that are regularly in the lineup a couple of them come off the bench today but uh again Ben is the guy that makes things go really nice move on that last basket got the defender up under the rim protected the ball with his body and made the layup hokes havent scored since the 1209 Mark Mack what do you think coach Youngs message was there out of the timeouts I think they really executing pretty well but I think he was concerned about the defense too many too many balls are getting into the lane whether its the passes into keyho or drives by bonini a foul off the ball against Virginia Tech to a while must have been an illegal screen Navy still has yet to miss from the floor and theres a quick foul on the other end that was a little while again Music right oh shoot okay D Jaden shoot his second and thats already the eighth team foul yeah its a long time left in the half to be in the bonus too and navy is going to keep attacking off the dribble G that time can make that open three like we told you but he likes to put it on the floor with that right hand and the midshipman halfway through this first half again eight for eight perfect from the Applause floor yeah right now they either turn it over or make the shot pretty impressive and they dont turn it over much more today than usual with five so far and you think about it for Virginia Tech if youre just joining us malal poti Ben buram and Jaden shoot all with two fouls La inside side low with a little height Advantage almost a chance for a threepoint play yeah a tough pass right there contested pass but Brown got it to law and Lew goes to the free throw line see if the hokes can break this drought here you see the pass great catch by lwow and then a good job using his size over ginu mcin malal potit is not on the floor for this Tech Team how does that change things offensively for the hokes well it really hasnt changed things a a lot lately because big Patrick wesler has been enough of a threat to still make the defense respect him down low potit just moves bodies though with his size takes up so much space Pat wesler 13 points six re bounds thats North Carolina ANC on Thursday entry pass to kho help brought almost a turnover and the corner three wont drop Oki basketball first Miss for the Naval Academy and low two points been a little quiet here early but Mack we know the Junior from London England when he gets going he can really provide a spark offensively yeah especially if the game gets to going up and down a little bit or he gets the run and rebounds gets fouled right there by Draper who is again I I think he was hes out there in large part to guard L because he uh is a similar kind of athlete Navy jumps in a Zone here on the sideline out of bounds it looks like and they have change things up a little bit hogies have to change the play call got to penetrate that zone 5 Seconds to shoot Brown Corner three its through or just passing around the corner passing around the perimeter and make a long jumper couple ways to do it but generally you have to penetrate that zone to get good shot and how about this for a followup performance Rodney Brown leading all scores in the game with eight points renstrom on the other end he check wont fall yeah Rodney Brown he got he got the opportunity the other night cuz hes hes really practicing hard working on his game making a real effort and they rewarded him and it has paid off for the hokes and Rodney Brown Jr timeout Ed to chellis and navy wesler with a basket but Rodney Brown staying hot Mack Rodney Brown the other night night was really good from long range and again tonight fancy opening Music bang week at ESPN when we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is gamechanging research that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research glad to have you on your Sunday afternoon Virginia Tech on a 70 run really entertaining first half of basketball yeah Navys been good on defense making it hard for Virginia Tech to score theyve been efficient on the offensive end and sitting here with a fivepoint lead just passed halfway in the first half Austin benini with six points Balan scoring for the midshipman four players have six points each that includes Draper penck to the rack wesler the defense yeah hokey contested that drive see see if they can get something going here on the offensive end against this stingy Navy defense Ru Steiner foul line J is true nice confidence little dribble backed his Defender up created space his first basket of the day does have four assists this afternoon panck catch and shoot Hokies can tie on this possession Brown will take it and its been his day early in blackburg what a what confidence out of that young man the transfer from Cal is feeling it and benini with the left hand stops the scoring Run for the hokes yeah we talked about Rex ster has got to stay between bonini and the basket easier said than done though Rodney Brown 13 points on Thursday hes got 11 today as Johnson through two to Defenders finishes yeah the Freshman is really going to be good he gets a little more confidence in every hes good at everything he rebounds the basketball he defends well hasnt shot the ball great this season yet but hes capable of doing that Music too Draper panck with 10 Draper Corner three kho Second Chance Navy back in front B wesler didnt put a body on K two big guys battling down low number 99 got to love a guy with 99 how about that that was the first thing that jumped out to me in prep for this no look Rex Steiner creating with 8 seconds Johnson almost trying to back take that and well wow going up high for the board wesler left hand tipping you bet gave up one on the other end got it back for the hoges on the offensive end and for this Tech Team potit Burnham shoot all with two fouls Tech managing that well down the stretch crosscourt pass intercepted by Brown hell throw the lob and Johnson draws the foul smart Play From The Freshman yeah and and Rodney Brown with the good look sharing the basketball in transition maybe turnovers have hurt them at six now we talked about you saw earlier our great graphics folks they only they only turn it over 10 times a game six already here still time left in the first half potit back in Ty Johnson 70 from the free throw line last game seven points eight rebounds five assists the first true freshman to do that for Virginia Texans Dorian finny Smith did it in 2011 its a pretty good company for you hokey historians he converts both if you like offense this has been the game for you yeah and and a little bit different than uh probably both coaches expected but Virginia Tech riding that offensive output the other night when they had 95 and navy doing a nice job of executing been very efficient except for those turnovers we just mentioned Kim drills it wild the high arcing shoots 44 from Beyond The Arc it is 14 last year back and forth we go under four minutes until halftime maybe back into the Zone again have a two two three but they give it a one one3 look then match up out of it trying to cover up those shooters Johnson in the corner yes right before the horn what a good play by Rodney Brown he could have jumped up and shot that and was poised enough to know what time was left on the clock and to find the open shooter teammate Tyler Johnson shooting to 16 from distance and theres kho with the right hand nearing 40 points for both teams in the first half Hammond rightwing three is good the Freshman getting involved yeah streak is still alive at eight as far as we know eight consecutive shots made for Ben Ham and dating back to Thursday kho remember poti with two fouls yeah and they knew exactly what they were doing they attacked potit knew that he was kind of helpless down there had to stay straight up K took it up without any thinking of the block shot Hammond to the right block off the window ining Rodney Brown Jr and Ben Hammond really take it up where they left off against North Carolina on Thursday Mall Kim try to put it on the deck draws a whistle both teams are shooting the lights out from three both over 55 first G Kim for Navy and then uh the Hoke say willll match that with the Freshman Tyler Johnson for Virginia Music teag team have been feeling it from distance yeah and four different players for each team have combined for 11 made threes 11 out of 19 58 both teams on fire here this afternoon cold outside not so much inside you see the numbers coming in and what theyve done today thats dramatic isnt it we love it right this is this is great ENT fun basketball fun basketball crowd coming in a little bit letting that ice melt outside finally got out of the house it was that morning for me where I realized I need an ice scraper today it dawned on me my my wife put one in the car and I cant thank her enough no Jean is the the best youre not surprised G Kim career high two games ago against Maine 13 points hes got nine and Hammond swipes that away good decision didnt have the numbers trying to get into play 20 on the shot clock plenty of time 22 points off the bench in this first half for Tech in which theyve had to battle through foul trouble Navy in the manto man wesler just a little short but itll stay with the Hokies yeah a nice pass right there on the ball screen roll Hammond to Weser Weser a little short on the jump hook maybe was back in the manto man hokei recognized it called set play Navy still in the manto man on the Baseline out of bounds young he can shoot it Im surprised he didnt pull that one that play was designed for him to take that shot Brown off the right out right side of the rim lell going to work kho got a piece of it rolled all the way out to Draper Furious action now were going the other way and Applause back good recovery by Navy right there foul line jumper you bet what a nice first half for Ben Hammond nine in a row now 10 in a row now you got to be you know youre in the zone when you have it missed like that right Mac as a shooter even even the referees recognized they let it push off just a little on that one I think Kim draws a foul free throws coming home crowd not happy with that but a little too much contact by Jaden young if youre just joining us Navy at one point led by as many as 12 in this first half what have you seen from Techs offense down the stretch well theyve done a better a job of cutting hard recognizing what Navy is in and making some open shots T knew has only missed two free throws just missed one a while ago only missed two all Applause year now you see why pretty perfect form right there hes goes small again thatll be interesting because kho is still in for Navy thats a good thats a good match up on the offensive in for Navy Im not sure about defense whether he can guard l or burnam away from the basket of course Navy may play a little Zone too NOP they stay in the manto man so its kiho kho against laow Brown and Hammond the top two scores for Tech in the first half both on the floor with eight seconds good switch right there by Navy Burnham at the horn yes know how to create some momentum going into halftime make one at the buzzer from long range 27 points off the bench for Virginia Tech in the first half and they lead 46 41 play they going to review both teams shooting over 50 kind of fitting that the half ends on a three the way the threes were going down for both of these squads hand up well conted Basket in says no problem and our Kendall Williams is standing by with the head coach of the mid shipment Ed to chellis Kendall coach back and forth in that first half right whats the message in the locker room right now to make sure you guys pull away well we got a guard playing very good basketball ball as is Rodney Brown Patrick Wester had another good half for us so uh lets uh get all of them clicking uh you know on the same page we be in good shape thank you coach thank and thanks to Kendall for that and bench points we mentioned the 27 large part of that though the foul trouble that Tech dealt with and theres shoot drawing one first possession of the second half yeah and shoot is such a good such a good shooter I hate to say that yeah it does and and youve got to come running at him so if hell shot fake and drive it a little bit he put the G wo in a bad position right there and Drew the foul gets to the the free throw line where he is very good and that is the third on G Kim Mac take me through as a coach when a player gets in foul trouble how much does depend on the situ the time or how much does it gut feel as a coach to leave someone in or take him off and put him on the bench theres so many things you know how mature is the player how good is he recognizing that uh is is he a careless guy does he understand can he play when he has two fouls does he continue to play aggressively and who do you have to replace Laughter him Tech trailed by as many as 12 in the first half theyve got a sevenpoint lead to follow up on your question though I was very conservative I took anybody with two fouls they came out they didnt play anymore um I dont know that I ever had a player I trusted to go in there with two Applause fouls of course you coached against the two head coaches going at it today sure did kho benini on the Baseline unable to create enough traffic in there for Virginia Tech that time to force it another Navy turnover thats seven now in the game oh thats their ninth in the game low with 10 seconds L the shot clock Rex Steiner steps into a long one wont fall penck thre a fast ball inside trying to find Woods another Navy turnover yeah backtoback turnovers and then complicate the matter or make the matter even worse by creating committing a foul too and we showed it in the first half there you see the turnovers on your screen Virginia Tech was averaging around 15 per game theyve really taken care of the basketball yeah much better much better job you know even the other night even though they scored 95 points they had 16 turnovers that was that was not pleasing to coach young and now he wants the defense cleaned up a little bit hes had a couple couple backto back stops here potit tried to find the cutter and re Steiner yeah had a nice back cut setup instead of coming off of the down screen and dribble handoff he back cut was wi open but poti couldnt complete the pass good pressure on the ball by Music Navy seven points in the first half Tyler Johnson lost the handle Corner three penck in transition hits it thats what he does spots up and the best time to to attack in transition right there spot up shoot to three poti to the foul line Brandon rein are the feed there four assists done a nice job creating yeah Mike Woods got there late he got the start today didnt play a lot of minutes only played six in the first half was a little late coming over to try to get between poti and the basket on the roll Navy immediately coming back with two regular starters and typically renstrom and Draper in the starting five for Coach dellis they didnt stay on the bench very long this second half they were both productive in the first half six points a piece Oki staying in that manto man off the top of the backboard penck trying to get the the shooters touch yeah and you know he he has that quick release and Tyler Johnson got there just in time to bother him enough to miss a fivepoint hoky Music lead only six combined points in the last 3 minutes thats been something different from the first 20 I Im sure both coaches talked a little defense and low with the block the follow through from penck good effort by lwow but good Hustle by Navy to get there and clean up that block shot Johnson spins it low poti going back to to the free throw line thats a really nice job right there you had a ball screen a skip pass into the post where the ball screener rolled to the basket and had the inside position and here comes that productive bench for Virginia Tech were talking about Coach dellis a moment ago and of course one of the common stories between Navy Virginia Tech terms of the coaches Don devau of course former Tech coach and then at Navy his first job was here at Virginia Tech Don devau was a young assistant from Ohio State uh played with the likes of Bobby Knight and the group at Ohio State then he went on to coach at Wyoming and Tennessee and his final job was at the Naval Academy where he won a number of patriot League championships and the next win for Coach dellis hell move into sole possession of third place all time in Wis at the Naval Academy surpassing coach devot Don devot good man and when these two teams played a couple of years ago at the Naval Academy coach dvo is there recognized pump fake and Mike Woods gets on the board really nice patience right there you always want to be the second guy off the ground when youre in the post first guy off offense or defense is going to be in trouble thats deflected by Woods scores on one end stop on the other little bit late on that pass right there from Rodney Brown Jr kti got to hold that post up banini hits the accelerator Woods is everywhere in the last 60 seconds for Navy three straight plays first start of the season this year has started in the past onepoint game Brown had 11 in the first half Burnham Baseline the flush the College of Charleston transfer still getting his rhythm here at Virginia Tech but you do see flashes of of that College of Charleston standout Panini downhill ham in the rebound The Freshman against the top score for Navy Austin benini and he draws contact on Mike Woods how about the Freshman on both ends for Virginia Tech yeah making plays defending on the one end attacking the rim on the other and a little slow to get up Virginia Tech leads by three we step aside and return after these mat messages for the most part have done a pretty good job on him theyve limited his options uh he youve seen some of his brence of Getting By people and creating contact near the rim but hes missed his last two shots eight points two assists uh at this point coach Mike young isnt too disappointed with their defense on Austin bonini Ben Hammond was fouled for the media timeouts bring that out because Navy dealing with a little bit of foul trouble two starters have three thats woods and Kim B Hammond still perfect two nights in a row doing it once is unbelievable doing it twice it really is again just a freshman hes in a double figures backtoback games hes guarding bonini here did a nice job right there bini had an advantage coming off that handoff Woods wesler affected that shot and who comes out of there with it Burnham soft touch not that time gets his own miss that time you bet yeah always great effort from Ben Burnham tied for the largest lead of the nights for for the hokes good job on the ball screen right there by wesler and Hammond Okies didnt get into their offense Rodney Brown Jr had to bring it up Hammond was running down the floor he spins and is stuffed benini on the defensive end that ball loose look a shoot getting in there not a good possession offensively that time for Virginia Tech renstrom one of the best shooters for Navy shows it there and that often leads to a shot on the other end of the high percentage quality the captain of this team obviously such a high honor Brown stepped through just a tached short good one move 101 move right there a little Up and Under switch right there on that second ball screen this is where Panini went 101 in the first half renstrom opposite corner a rebound from cam Cole benini second times the charm on that possession yeah you cant do that got to know where he is all the time you do not want to get him started a quick six0 run its a onepoint game and 10 seconds called and the Navy bench erupts and that was bonini one onone with Rodney Brown Jr denying him access to the front Court nice transition position right there wide open three late on the conversion in transition and then after an offensive rebound see it all the time somebody standing around wide open this time it just happened to be Navys best player both teams shooting over 50 from distance G Kim has sub back in playing with three fouls Carnegie Johnson given a little bit of a blow Hammond underhand to Burnham and the right hand turnovers into to into high percentage looks burn him with the emphatic throw down in the corner little short from Johnson the sophomore renstrom two steps behind the threepoint Arc flashes three fingers in the air look good inside out got to recover quickly got to know where those Shooters are and again easy to say it hard to do it first time renstrom has been in double figure since no November 17th against Campbell right back at you Jaden young the sophomore with the hand in his face back and forth we go partner renstrom not that Music time Burnham top of the arc left side wont drop Tyler Johnson a little more attentive on defense finding renstrom in transition right there and G Kim is down Off the Bench Ben buron for Virginia Tech on the turnover the pass ahead from Ben hamon emphatic throw in and the answer from losander renstrom with a DE deep threepoint shot four for eight from long range Commonwealth of Virginia out of Reston having a great day inside of Castle 100 of his shots today are from beyond the threo line and you see why first time in double figures since about a month ago against Campbell Ma I had a chance to talk to him yesterday at practice you know hes been voting the captain of all captains you see at the Naval Academy every captain of every team goes to a Leadership Retreat and then you get voted upon is as a corner three off the front rim hes a lot of responsibility his day today including that he oversees a lot of athletes what an honor here he is on the left wing offensive rebound from Draper and a foul he was telling me his dayto day what time he wakes up what time he goes to bed its incredible yeah these guys are unbelievable and you know I feel bad for them in one way because they didnt get to go to that football game yesterday theyre the only midshipman that werent there and what a what a sacrifice but hey theyre here to play this basketball game and and what an effort theyre given they did get to watch the game together though at the hotel made sure practice was scheduled around that threepoint game just over 10 minutes to play Virginia Tech and navy two teams that go back over a hundred years Pos got to be aware of the shot clock itll stay here 38 bench points Ben Burnham has been part of that Burnham had eight the other night nine here so far this afternoon poti two strong trying to do it himself late in the shot clock good move high percentage shot Navy did a good job of contesting then not allowing a second shot we got a foul away from the ball Tyler Johnson trying to get over a screen just the third foul for Virginia Music Tech the Hokies were in the bonus Midway through that first half not as many whistles down the stretch second foul I missed up impossible Mac you never mess up come on we know benini its a long two its an air ball and the castle guard will let him know about Applause it everyone all dressed up some holiday gear yeah Ive seen a lot of stuff L of good kids outfits and a few adults who were not giving up their childhood Never Grow Up thats too high off the hands of brown yeah bad passed by Rex Downer po communication right there between those two that time Navy gets another chance no points on either side in almost two minutes in a game that has been filled of a lot of offense yeah we talked about the threepoint shooting field goal percentage they theyve each only missed one free throw too Draper trying to connect with kho and he wants a tip he is disagreeing and so is coach dellis in the Navy bench see what we see couldnt tell poti get it oh he might have okis by three Ben Hammond shoot in the corner hell make you pay a really nice play right right there just enough of a screen to get shoot wide open 8 minutes to go and weve got a good game he joins Brown and Hammond with 11 points those are the three hokes and double figures finally a starter getting in on the action he with a little ball handling benini around the screen all the way in going the other way thats a charge yeah bini thought he was going to get the call but the defense was solidly Applause there really nice job helps side comes all the way across clearly set totally the offense initiated the contact that one was easy for the officials I was about saying one of the hardest calls to make in all of sports it almost always is that one was not cam Cole heating up Hammond Hammond with a left hand did a nice job all the way to the end put enough pressure on the ball Navy with numbers didnt take advantage key help brought a foul likely going against shoot yeah he was bodying up down low weve got ourselves a Sixpoint game inside 8 minutes to go from Music blackburg but those are hard to pull off right those kind of surprises yeah I would think but at the Navy you ought to be able to keep secrets right Laughter sixpoint game glad to have you on your Sunday afternoon its been back and forth almost all game late in the shot clock Brown the takeaway and thats rejected by the 6 10 Center good possession defensively that time for Virginia Tech but couldnt convert in transition thanks to the hustle back kho kho came from a long way away to get this block shot and look at the transition hoki had numbers ended up being four Navy Defenders high low potit lost it out of bounds but last touched off Navy 17 on the shot clock Baseline out of bounds where Mike young usually gets a shot for the person he wants to shoot the ball well see if that happens this time take your pick brown with three3 shoot has two that kind of disrupted the timing of things right there Burnham the pump fake Works foul on top of it play broke down Burnham went 101 pump fake the double figures 10 one against a very good Defender but hes got a size advantage and what did I say be the second guy off the floor let the other guy go up hes at a disadvantage ois for three eight points on Thursday against North Carolina ENT double figures today Mac what can it do for this Tech Team if Ben Burnham can start delivering like hes done here as of late yeah I mean I saw him a lot last year called a lot of CA games College Charleston games uh and he can be a beast every single night and he seems like hes finally understanding what what coach Young and the staff won out of him on both ends of the floor you can see his confidence growing largest lead for Tech shoot too strong going the other way foul against Virginia Tech Mike young doesnt like it po may have pushed off to get that rebound position that was a nice penetration by Rodney Brown Jr good open shot by shoot looked like a good offensive rebound but petite may have had a little help getting there little push off a 90 Virginia Tech run benini through tons of traffic on his way in tons of traffic is right he beat three different people to get a layup on that its the first Navy basket since the 11 rather 12 uh 1158 mark what he did was unbelievably difficult degree of difficulty he should have gotten three instead of two to be honest Brown looking for his career high he wont fall that time its a good look good execution but a good job by Navy not allowing a second shot penck the kick out thats off the top of the backboard but Cole the hustle and too far out of reach for kho hoki take it back yeah the turnovers have really been tough on Navy theyre up to 15 now five more than their average usually something they do very well but again give Virginia Tech credit for some of that Applause five points for potit and thats one of his best baskets of the day very nice move little counter leftand jump hook a Timeout on the floor hokes tied for their largest lead of the game good win NC State batland and then you saw Syracuse Georgetown 100th meeting and then in that North Carolina win over Lal Bill bellich introduced during the game the new head coach of the Tar Heels was met with the go Eagles chant I didnt see that again your game here 70 to 61 Virginia Tech leading mid Shipman 72 from the floor in the first half just 35 in the seconds that was the fourth foul on Jaden shoot by the way and theres a great response out of the timeout chance for a threepoint play Donovan Draper this is such a good play Baseline out of bounds after the ball BS reversed they get a baseline cut and Ben Burnham got caught and got there late watch this Baseline cut Advantage Draper and Burnham would have been better off just contesting the shot Draper who came to Navy as a receiver on the football team great high school basketball player now back on the hardwood two possession game maybe had some big pass catches yesterday what an upset Hammond is played almost 20 minutes off the bench see if the hookies can answer that thats off of Pat wesler midshipman get possession back under five to go yeah Navy out of the time out did exactly what they needed to do scored got the and one and forced the turnover now a chance to cut further into the tech lead Vini leading all Navy scores with 13 Johnson face guarding penck renstrom driving Baseline his first field goal for from not behind the threepoint Arc yeah first attempt shot fake drive a little floater showing a little diversity to that offensive game Rodney Brown scoreless in the second half good defense right there about Jordan penck re Steiner stripped itll stay with tech six to shoot yep dial something up here with that in mind on the Baseline out of bounds shoot coming back in for this offensive possession and potit got your best shooter your best screener theres the cutter shoot po Burnham right before the horn how good is that awareness and the execution the loudest that castle has been today Navy trying to respond Panic a foul late whistle near side Virginia Tech on the Baseline out of bounds on the other end of the floor thats a set play to get shoot the ball Hokes alert come up with the ball Burnham very aware of the clock and executes it to perfection Sharkies that does make sense there is a Sharkies in Bradford and blackburg something to do with the New River Valley that could be it only about a what 20 minute drive down 81 depend on how motivated you are weve been motivated all day here on our broadcast its been a treat to have you Evan Hughes MC McCarthy Kendall Williams our outstanding ACC Network crew Ben Burnham just hit a huge three hes got a game high 15 but Navy still a window here Mac got to start scoring down the stretch yeah theyve shown some grittiness though as you would expect them to do now you see the numbers for the College of Charleston Applause transfer pennick converts both fivepoint game plenty of time left maybe gets that press see the hes cross into their half court offense with just 20 on the shot clock potit Saves The Possession Panini showing a little defense there too hes going all the way in potit and one yeah that matchup is an advantage potit is a little more athletic two big strong guys going at it just needed a little separation protected the ball there a very big basket for Virginia Tech in this game with just over three minutes to go hes in a double Applause figures poti tweaked a little something he was in some pain coming down the Applause floor dont know if just cramp or yeah that that was my first diagnosis over here from a nonphysician banini didnt set his feet strong board from Draper penck third chance on this possession yeah 12 offensive rebounds for Navy this afternoon 53rd in the nation in offensive rebounds averaging a little over 13 a game five to shoot benini Runs Out of Time really good job okis kept the pressure on surrounded him with enough bodies until he ran out of time hope hes with a good offensive possession and now they come back with a stop here Navys going to pick it up full court behind the back Tribble from Brown drawing some oo and a was pretty nice move its been a great week to be a good Defender Rex Steiner board from panck the drive and kick penck with a hand in his face drills it timeout Navy and we will step aside back after this short break Music just a sixpoint game under two minutes to play two possession games Virginia Tech trying to close out Navy but M the midshipman they just wont go away no and and just like you would expect them not to give up uh and all the cliches that apply to the to theis but uh yeah theyre still battling and still capable big basket right there they that allows them to set up their press where if they dont turn the Hokies over they at least have to guard less time in the half court too but a big possession right here can the hokeys get more than a twoscore game inside of two minutes Tech has overcome a 12point deficit Rex Steiner in the corner crosscourt young has to heave it and theres poti who just checked back in a collision there at midcourt with benini yeah its been a physical game all afternoon two players trying to make a play on the ball right there bini with a huge size disadvantage 171 lbs versus two 265 lbs he got the worst end that one we see the the big body meets a small body just glad both players appear to be okay Y and potite goes to the free throw line a 71 free throw shooter on the season four out of five so far here today both teams in the bonus yeah the Hokies will be in the double bonus going forward now Navy with a chance to Chip Applause Away Panic just a little short open look yeah good execution got a wide open three okis blocked out Hammond back in the game here at crunch time placing Rex Steiner I think Rex Steiners first shot that last time was a little bit quick and poti has been the man here in the last two minutes the soft touch eightpoint Tech lead under 60 to go foul on young free throws coming for Jordan penck has 12 points yeah you really dont want a foul right there but penck put him in a defensive uh disadvantage you dont want Navy to be able to score with the clock stopped and for penck he scored just nine combined points over his last three games 12 today okis going with the small lineup here to try to guard the threepoint line a little bit better FTI goes to the bench H also have more ball handlers on the floor now taking poti out the wild Burnham and brown on the front line for the Hokies all capable of handling the ball Brown way up ahead for young good job looking down the floor so many times you get caught up in the in the defensive pressure you dont look down the floor that was a nice job by Rodney Brown Jr whos had another really good day 10 on the timer Hammond trying to find low Burnham its been his day 17 points for Ben Burnham Ben buzzer Applause Burnham and low Skies high jump ball possession arrow with navy Burnham with three makes today inside of a what 510 of a second in the half and in two different possessions with the 32nd clock timeout Hokies scored over a th career points during that Thanksgiving tournament Fort Meers tip off against South Carolina season highs in points rebounds assists at the time against Vanderbilt really starting to come along yeah more and more comfortable and so many times its not the first shot that gets you itll be that second shot that gets you here the you old pass balls fumbled out of bounds but the awareness right here of how much time is on the clock that that is thats a high quality basketball play right there good decision making by Ben Burnham and like you said the third time today he is scored as the buzzer is going off 80 72 our score is both these teams nonconference play wrapping up and of course Patriot league and AC action its already started of course for Techs talking about knowing where the shooters are knowing who the shooters are knowing when they have to switch not trying to put them on the free throw line and let them score with the clock stop and and if a shot goes up make sure you get the rebound dont give him a second chance Corner three off balance short from penck bonini spins shoots another rebound another three another Miss Brown the rebound and thats going to do it from Castle Virginia Tech trailed by as many as 12 in the first half they beat Navy by eight and pick up backto back wins through finals week Music
