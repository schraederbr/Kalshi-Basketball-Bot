that happened the previous year in Charlotte North Carolina quite a remarkable turnaround in one year and they turned it around beat Texas Tech in the finals in overtime 8577 Florida state has the basketball to start our game tonight beakman on Worley is going to be a matchup we will watch here it is right there one against two and now Watkins try to muscle his way in Fall Away from Watkins right on the weak side goes out of bounds and to the Cavaliers this is a very physical Virginia team and they do it with their chest um and they will grind you down and this is you know theres very long possessions on both ends of the floor pressure immediately from Florida State well the end of this game both teams are going to know that theyve been in a basketball game mck Ney I I think this is the guy that theyre really going to lock in on as far as Florida State concern mcne is the guy really drives them from the threepoint line deep into the shot clock mcney gives it up beakman Baseline they got to shoot that ball they wont get it away roie did not release it in time shot clock violation and I dont think thats the first one of those youre going to see on the evening either from both both teams Virginia will be lets call it careful with their possessions during the course of the game yeah this you know we see a lot of times well say the first team to 50 wins we may ratchet this down to first team to 40 wins Watkins and now green trying to shake the defender its a tall order against beakman working on the Baseline out ran out ofate warley stepped to the Baseline and back to Virginia heres the look and this is just a you can see great job that time by Jordan Miner who is slow to come around he was injured a little bit earlier in the season but he has really embraced this defense did a nice job using the Baseline as a second Defender Ryan Dunn tries to hit BC Neely cutting out of the basket sends it back out for a three and pman missfires those open opportunities Virginia really needs to capit in this game was a good find by mcne Watkins guarded closely and got it away to Green Florida State seven and five at home this season three and two on their home floor and thats Watkins inside we talked about it hes their leading scorer and that was a really good finish with a little contact inside transfer from Virginia Commonwealth jir Watkins first year in the Florida state program and he aages goes to 14 points per game to lead the team he L him Mike with 10 in the win against Boston College on the road earlier this week the only double figure scorer in that game heres the look no help and even though this Virginia team one of the best shot blocking teams in the conference but able to use his body get the shot up interesting in their sideline out of bounds so theyve got minor back as a pressure release beakman down the lane Miller caught up with him Miller on the handle brings it up 611 at the Block and then his ability to bring the ball up just talking about the proficiency blocking the basketball from Virginia this is Miller trying to get around done activity on the Baseline and that was the it was the first it was the first foul that was called and this is a great recovery really nice job following the play up and then he brings it up the floor on the other end and Dunn got called on that first in the first call I think that you know the second whistle would have been on Miller warley beakman on him shot clock down to eight green steps into the long range three hes their most reliable threepoint shooter theres beakman 134 points per game thats the best on the Virginia roster for the senior from Milwaukee Wisconsin McNeely done roie tees it up and knocks it down coming in hes only 26 from behind the arc so I mean if youre going to choose your Florida State you got to work the percentage and say all right we you know we were going to give something on him but he steps up and makes a play Virginia only makes 663 pointers per game that is 13th in the ACC shot clock at eight from Miller dun cut him off trying to stay with him Miller backing down and scoring was interesting off the dribble no double team help coming that time a lot of teams uh Virginia will come across the lane and double big just Miller showing his versatility off the dribble 611 from mayorca Spain Mediterranean island 45 field goal shooter now McNeely floating came up short the second effort is good but you know what give him the choice time I think thats what what Florida State wants make him a midrange jump shooter drive him off the threepoint line mcne is a double digit scorer on average almost 12 points per game green comes out of a congested area around the perimeter Watkins in and out for three this is at least Force they do what they want to do move the ball from side to side pass along the Baseline was deflected and will stay with Virginia lets take a timeout the Cavaliers have a slim early lead on the

Ram trucks built to serve the Westcott building on the beautiful Campus of Florida State University established in 1851 Tony Bennett who has done incredible things with this Virginia program the quick snapshot Mike for 2023 24 you know it surprised me a little bit I mean hes a Midwest guy I mean he played at Wisconsin Green Bay um you know kwood is that out of Washington state and you see the record there 22 straight that uh John Paul Jones and uh but you know I think his style was a little bit of an acquired taste and that inbound was almost acquired second effort up and good so Virginia sticks with it there and Jordan Miner has two I dont know if that underneath out of bounds was exactly drawn up that way but its a good result so Mike get out your program because there are five fresh numbers to identify thats this going to be this going to be a tough test for you my friend noes not up to the test there with the threepoint attempt from nickelberry well and and for Virginia too you got to get matchup straight coming out wait a minute wheres my guy oh hes over there on the bench so also Jake roves has coming hes got the ball right now trying to drive and calculate the angle and he did it hanging in the air his last three games have been fabulous and this winning streak coincides with him coming off the bench so its its its been nice hes really kind of warm to that yeah Virginia 130 at home as they play on the road tonight that road record of three and four overall knocked away from B Bowen that was the quick hand of Ro wow they doubled big that time he tried to take advantage with it with a cut but it was great defensive help McNeely see theyre really covering up on him Ro and taking a chance with Roy it pays off that time they got the ball out of mnes hands and that time it worked inside Corin the catch the release and two cor nice run up the floor by him good look ahead so the ball starting to fall for these teams who both started two for five from the floor well Virginia had a Miss from roie on its last trip down the court M Neely was trying to go inside the grov and a foul against the seminal thats you know the thing with with this FL team that they can play really physical as deep as many guys as they play snapshot for Coach Hamilton in his 22nd season on that Florida State sideline Mike a lot of work to do in the second half of the season they really struggled in the in the nonconference part there was nine losses there but theyve had an excellent ACC season that bounces off the edge of the rim you Canon couldnt get there for Virginia Spears has the basketball now Chandler Jackson as well Corin shot clock is inside of 10 nickelberry shot was defended well he connected anyway yeah time looked a you you Canon a little reluctant to get a hand up that time nickelberry did a nice job creating some space for himself on that jump shot nickelberry transfer from Lal and Louisville here in the Florida state program McNeely open for a three and he got hit B Bowen wow just just laps mentally on that play and then thats the first decent look MCs got he had a step well beyond the threepoint line but then he gets bailed out with that foul so thats the second quickly on Taylor B Bowen played his prep ball at Brewster Academy and heres you know heres the thing hes shooting an incredible free throw percentage hes only taken one free throw in the last six games maintains 88 for the season just doesnt go there hes only missed Mike three times all year yeah but he it just shows you where you know where hes making his money okay Watkins returns leading scorer this season four Florida State Miller is in there gainy also joins the lineup and and the thing is too why you want to encourage him from two point hes shooting 35 which is why you want to really drive him off the threepoint line 106 career threes for mcne who connects on all three of those free throws this is gainy looking for Miller deflected away that double team inside they get a turnover Roes got a piece of it Virginias coming off with that win Wednesday Mike of historic proportions 60 38 Miami scored more in the first half against North Carolina today than they did in the entire game in Charlesville amazing the heels got the victory on the road and Coral Gables on this Saturday shot clock iss at five McNeil is 5 feet behind the line and he drains it he was almost in assistant coach Stan Joness lap with that jump shot couldnt get to him that time MCs got another threepointer hes up to eight points now whistle so its mcne knocking down the three and

and the rest of the scores on this Saturday Duke taking care of business at home against the BC that was a big swing game Wake Forest and NC State Wake jumping up into that top four Georgia Tech just needs to play Duke or North Carolina at home game um North Carolina rebounding after to that home loss against Clemson U Notre Dame nice win for them and then um wt talk about the Clemson Syracuse game time what a what an afternoon for Joe Gerard who win over 2000 points in the win at the Dome and I will say this just to keep the game in context 15 to8 not that you know for right now but a sevenpoint lead for Virginia is bigger than most teams uh just for the way they play and how they grind so just keep that in mind as this game unfolds they only allow 569 points per game that is the best in the conference and second of the nation only behind Houston in scoring defense and and part of that is the way they play on this end of the floor you know the way they take possessions offensively deep into the clock theyve hit three last five shots after starting two of six were inside of 11 minutes to go in the half and the shot clock is of four out of the corner theyve got another three Murray hits it Mike and this a guy that wasnt playing a lot early but Kane Murray has come on recently and really giving them a big lift three of five on threepoint tries for Virginia kany with a turnaround and he rattles it in yeah good catch against a freshman bu Canon inside so Mike Virginia doesnt shoot a lot of threepointers but they shoot a nice percentage 37 and third in the conference right thats the big key I mean you know for for what they do as a team 37 overall and 40 Inc conference so its a very effective weapon and and the thing we you know we talked about Florida States length right now Virginia is getting on the offensive glass and getting Second Chance points which has got to be a little troubling to Leonard Hamilton so Watkins picked up that foul his first it was dun who got in there off the Miss from mcne and so dun to the free throw line Ryan dun the sophomore from Freeport New York 68 and 216 lb well hes one of the returning guys and hes really stepped it up youre watching ACC basketball on the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve talk about the guys who who come back for this team Ryan done one of them and expanded role this year and he has really expanded his game and his numbers leads the conference in blocks per game just over two for contest did not get the bounce there its Watkins over the top and on the run and only 6 to the whistle Virginias on a 102 here it is this is a lot of its on the chest and this is watch this now watch this he goes over and uh Mr Watkins doesnt want any part of that here at home a little chippy here early so Harris picked up that Virginia foul Watkins is at the free throw line right now Florida States on Pace for 40 points 78 for the strike for Watkins you see what hes done this season thats the best on the team 137 had the 10 points to lead the team in the win on the road to Boston College also tied for the team lead with six rebounds against the Eagles and hes got a couple of free throws had a careerhigh 27 points on the road at the dome for the victory for the this season for jir Watkins Applause beakman cross it over by the first Defender second wave Watkins came over he was in the vicinity also warley so warley picks up the personal his first beakman at the free throw line you know we were talking with Tony Bennett and he said a joke with him he said you had ke Clark for about 10 years it seems like part of the national championship team certainly and uh but now that you know re has really grown into that role and uh you know so many responsibilities being a leader being their you know best defensive player you know I think he I think hes got to be in a Player of the Year conversation right now five of six from the line as a team for Virginia after Beacons trip hes playing in his 116th game mik in a Virginia uniform and 111 of those are starts another whistle man this is a choppy action right now and and and Jamie lucky made that call and I think theyre trying to calm things down right they get a hold of the the game a little bit or maybe a lot T Bennett former teammate of the Gman in Charlotte yes sir men of teal I always love seeing you guys get together because its an immediate smile uh he wants to pass you the ball it feels like just give you a nice boun pass you can go right to the I remember him I was telling him where to get his haircut to Charlotte and where to take his dry cleaning and you know just straight out of Green Bay Wisconsin love it Dad was a beautiful person Dick Bennett great great coach they won 25 games a season ago the NCAA tournament the finals of the ACC tournament this year goes to Washington DC scor it turnaround move for green and a chance for the old school prepoint play well this is what you want from a post player you want him aggressively asking for the ball and uh against this te he and uh it was funny that Miner was asking for the hook there but you against the if you think the double teams coming youve got to make a quick move and he was very decisive so Deontay green stands at the free throw line the sophomore from Asheville North Carolina 72 body of work from the stripe this season hes going to put a little pressure on Buchan thats Miners second foul now something wasnt right there had a couple of players step into the lane So Jamie lucky is joined by Le cell Sean Hull theyre in charge of the action this evening from Tucker Center sevenpoint difference closing in on the 9 Minute threshold of the first half Tom wory Mike jinsky are outstanding CW Courtside Saturday production crew Buchanon met it the rim by green and he grabs it just a fraction too long Gathering himself Worley driving dun came over for the help I think Murray was the one who got a piece of that as well right there just just a little too long Gathering and just three guys around him looked like green was the one who got the block team effort from the noes right at The Rim two tough two points tough to come by in the pain out there tonight my friend turbulent times in the paint this evening its a Gman battle inside almost knocked Away by MC Spears is come into the lineup of Florida state will beig green launch the three its off line Virginia will definitely take their chances from leaving threepoint Shooters open for Florida State Virginia at 43 shooting as a team so far in the game and that percentage is going up thanks to MC D just an isolation and a step back you got get out get a hand up not foul in that situation Leonard Hamilton not happy with that defensive possession so Virginia four of seven from three Florida State yet to make one from distance shes a thief and a corn artist our particular skill set can be helpful to us youre making me blush Im a cop yeah Im a cop

that sequence well theyve already theyve already got Jordan Miner on the bench with uh with two personal fouls now dun is going out um you know Jake Gro is not bad coming in so thats not a thats not a bad replacement there but you lose the one thing you do lose is some is a superior shot blocker so Watkins now with six as the leading scorer they need to find somebody else theyve got five other guys with two points and Watkins leing duns on the bench for Virginia Watkins is now four4 from the line M in the air and Watkins could not finish off the play BR was able to run it down to roie can kep

70s amazing run still strong both of these coaches coach Hamilton and coach Bennett chock is at eight for mcne and Virginia miscommunication with bman trying to go Baseline that was that and bman raised his hand that was like a wide receiver breaking his route off because Beacon was going to back cut and he quit and uh mcne was anticipating a basket cut and Virginia theyre one of the best teams in the country taking care of the basketball so turnovers are a rarity for them was only the third of the game Miller dropped it low Corin great movement without the ball on the Baseline by Corin and that thats talking about both with both Dunn and Miner out of the game its opened some things up inside sore mik from allas points per game 64 field goal shooter sign of six minutes to go in

key players out for Virginia right now and a nice answer by Florida State its a 60 run after over the last two minutes in change the cutter is Groves Jackson has it those are the shots you have to maximize on the road Spears with the pullup maybe a little quick thats what you know thats almost what this Virginia team for to get an open shot you want want to take it MC NE from Ro High arcing

special its not just the things you learned the friends you made or the wins you saw its not even that you walk the same paths as renowned artists CEOs and Nobel laurates but what makes FSU special is who you became while you were here lets take a look at the significant stats brought to you by JP Morgan wealth management and the struggles from Beyond threepoint line for Florida State Mike jinsky but you know with the with two of their main guys in foul trouble Florida state has been able to claw back into this game make it a fourpoint game uh you know you look at the numbers here with Tony Bennett and you see those are thats the national rank thats not the ACC Rank and Tony Bennett built this culture around defense and those you see at the end those six those two of those years from the first two years that he was in the program uh just astounding numbers and uh but I will say we go back to 2019 that was his best offensive team so you combine that with stopping in uh you know you get you get a national champion Watkins had a big block at the other end here come the nolles fact Virginia led the nation four years in a row in scoring defense from 2017 to 2020 with that National Championship mixed in warley literally oneonone had it knocked away for a moment second effort warley able to get it over Harris for two and now its a twopoint game well and Harris at only six feet hes giving away a lot of size and he got buried in the paint that time this is a tough team to score against oneonone but they were successful that time eight different players have now scored for Florida State John clock is a 10 for Virginia two and a half minutes to go in our first half beakman and theyve really calmed down mcne in this stretch as well beakman slicing through the lane for two D six points now for beakman after that impressive drive and then he poked that one away trying to run it down comes out of the corner gives it off got it back Corin couldnt catch up with it actually they guy made that a little bit tougher than they thought but the Florida state in general a little slow getting back four guys gave up on the play bounces off second chance and a foul Tom house got in there theres a look I this is the reigning Defensive Player of the Year in the conference 26 deals a game what he averages very unselfish giving it up and uh you know you see you see a lot of blue jerseys down the other end of the floor got you have to be so careful with the with the basketball around these guys really positive with your passes that was just the sixth free throw attempt of the season for Tom house sopt from G Ohio standing at the free lach Darren Green Jr back in gy also in that lineup for the nlls Ros getting ready to check in for Virginia one more free throw coming up for house 16 points per game for the sophomore what two for Virginia this been big minutes for Blake Buchanan The Freshman I me he is he has had a step up and fill in for Jordan Miner and done both of them out only aaging 15 minutes a game so far and Tony Benner really had he had good things to say about the Freshman he had to step up first half so the lead is four beakman d off bu Canon double fested Rim rocker from beakman beakman that time he kept his dribble alive his his drive and his penetration caused that defense to collapse that one fired out of bounds was not deflected by Virginia and this is a guy Mike who leaves the conference and assist guys converge and the Freshman just following right behind into the open space freshman from cordan Idaho Blake Buchanan had that one served up on a silver platter from beakman and made no mistake dropping the hammer that has got to be a fun feeling G not that Ive ever experienced it but a wide openen dunk after a pretty bead like that yeah yeah you know especially on the road I need a boost to get into my bed you know you know for for a freshman too for him to you know you want to hes had heavy minutes here in the first half to get a little energized too to finish out this last minute in 22 so that was the sixth turnover of the first half by Florida State as you mentioned Virginia does not turn the ball over just three so far right now this scoring in this pace is definitely favoring Virginia Ro Watton makes some Retreat pman so aggressive to the rim kany caught up with it heres green hes going to wait for reinforcements gaining a two time ivy league Defensive Player of the Year Brown before he transferred here great defensive player in his own right turn around gainy Off the Mark kept alive warley was in there and then that whistle will go in favor of Florida State all right mik coming up on the Subaru halftime report well get that recap from Virginia Tech and Notre Dame a home win for the Irish live Golf Las Vegas find out who won that event first half highlights and stats thats all coming up on the Subaru halftime report are we in the Notre Dame game the only thing thats not happening in Vegas like everythings happening in veg we can fire up the Jet and get out there after the game if you want to G your jet or mine I think we all know who owns the jet on this production staff well talk about it later thats a post game conversation gy converting from the free throw line good production from him Corin comes in I mean it is just a constant wave of substitutions fresh bodies for Coach Hamilton one of the main reasons they can press almost the entire game Mike theyve almost done it the entire 20 minutes miscommunication its coming the way of the Gman and thats out of bounds and back to the Nos and especially and thats that is the second really unforced turnover that Virginia has had that was not du to any kind of defensive pressure just a mental lapse very rare for this team so Florida State getting some production above that half average that Virginia allows and Virginia had built a 10point lead and its going to be an offensive file as beakman hit the deckin gotman in the next week watch this yeah thats uh Corin never came to a full stop and uh that is uh if Im if Im Mr pman Im Im talking to my teammate and saying you need to you need to give me a little heads up there brother little help there the fouls on coring his first little heads up so bigman shaking off the cobwebs after hitting the deck appears to be okay thats good news so there is a Timeout on the court and the good thing too if youre looking at Florida State they never got they never got they never got into the bonus in that first half they you know they defended pretty well in their own right and only had 16 fouls all right CW Courtside Saturday returns next week pivotal double header first Syracuse heads to Atlanta take on giant killer Georgia then in Prime Time NC State continues its postseason March against tournament hopeful Clemson CW Courtside Saturday returns next week 530 Eastern 230 pm Pacific only on the CW yeah I think I think the one its obvious most Clon is you know that way at North Carolina is going to look great on their resume obviously and they you know they followed up with another you know good win at Syracuse so you know you know for them to keep rolling keep some momentum they had a they had a lull there in the first half of the season they had a terrific nonconference schedule and some good wins there so I think they can really solidify some things remember they had a onepoint loss against Virginia this season as well PJ Hall led the way today against the orange in the dome he had a double double 15 and 10 Final 5 Seconds Harris pumps it Applause up so that will set us up nicely for the second 20 minutes V Virginia so they were able to up the scoring total not quite enough to up end the number three team of the nation in North Carolina all right second in 20 minutes Virginia has the ball and leads by four on the CW beakman hes got nowhere to go again McNeely let all scorers in the first half dun back to roie he lets it Go and rips the ropes for Virginia that was just a drive and replace Ro came in behind D it was good find behind him again of the guys on the floor hes the one youre going to take a chance on shooting threes he came up big one time in the first half so if youre keeping track in your program all the original starters from the beginning of the game are back in for both teams back out warley Watkins fighting with dun for that loose ball that call will go against the Cavaliers two shots on that as well and that is also the third personal foul on Ryan Dunn and that is that is huge I me I I thought of the two guys who had two fouls and you see Jake Groves over is going to get come in for Dunn that uh Dunn was the one they could least afford to have pick up that early foul and hes going to have to come out that was the first free throw Miss of the game for Watkins and so dun is out with the three personals Groves comes in 34 in blue white and orange grov really hasnt gotten he has not gotten started offensively in this game only one of four two points hes the better of the two offensively but certainly not the defensive player that dun is done so far M just one point in the game hadnt even attempted a field go in that first half Watkins on the other hand nine points to lead the way for Florida State for number of the championship team a season ago for VCU and thats be his offense really came alive later in the first half and he was very aggressive attacking the basket Watkins won an Atlantic 10 Championship a year ago at VCU there thats Miner third personal foul all of a sudden in the first minute and a half Virginias all got very serious foul trouble and now Buchanan is back in the game so a minute and a half into the second half they are back where they started from so Jordan Miner the grad student from Kingston Massachusetts leaves the floor for Tony Bennetts Virginia Cavaliers he spent four years at merac Applause GRE off of Virginia and you know with those two out of the ball game right now I think you really bail Virginia out by taking that shot just attack inside thats now 0 for seven on threepointers just for Florida State Mike you know just they you know they get on the shot clock just aack sual do not make a lot of Threes they average just over six per game which is 14 in the ACC and still looking for their first long range bucket and its be anticipation a Shifty dribble to and Defenders you cant throw a pass with a lot of air under it against this team especially against that guy look like a shut down corner look at that I mean hes hes just hes just too good so the lead was four at halime and is now eight early stages second half Tallahasse Florida with Tucker Center coming alive on a Saturday night Canon had to send it back out the shot clock is at five mcne deflected Miller shot clock running down on grov his shot never got to the rim and it is a shot clock violation despite his protest looking for a foul second one that that Florida state has gotten in this game they had one early in the first half both teams around 45 shooting so far in this game Watkins follow over Ro we touched on it hes been their most reliable scorer hes the only one in double figures right now with 11 points and uh after an early explosion mcne has really been kept in check by Florida State they need with with those guys out they need to get him going again with the fake Watkins fouls him so Watkins Mike is now nine games in a row double figures and scoring for the NS well I mean just Watkins is is so strong he can get this shot you know hes got he can go against Ro and get that little fade away so were confirming now that that is the third personal foul on Watkins well keep working on that cuz there there is theres that we saw Jamie lucky over at the scorers table and they give it to warley so Watkins has two and warley has two okay thats a big switch over for I mean again there theres a lot of bodies for Florida State but still I think for Watkins and you know how effective hes been offensively for Florida State they need him on the floor 88 free throw shooter Isaac mcney still just three misses the entire season from the line hes taken 31 attempts now five for five in our game pull up green rooves mcne flips it into the corner for Groves cannot create from that position Ro defender on his hip left hand out Watkins with the help and the block green tough catch on the pass even with that wow great recovery on that you know initial Rush at the floor Virginia made a nice job covering up and that is the first three of the game for Florida State Baba Miller Five Points now for Miller not bad for the Big Man From Beyond The Arc this season like 31 he just made his 193 of the season first of the game for the NOS mcney too deep Watkins all over him Groves with the help cuts to the basket just good and you know what no no Panic by McNeely that time he was and he had the count on his back too Darren Green Jr number 22 hes the real threepoint specialist for Florida State this season nobody takes more or makes more shoots a better percentage for the NS than number 22 not getting the ball this time Groves to the Florida mchanon thats Virginia active hands on the pass beakman the crossover gives it up reing in a three ball for Virginia they have tied their largest lead of the game right now after that three by mcney Third made three of the game for Risen mcne well that was just a really nice finding they got to know that mcne is facing up and spotting up in the corner you cant him alow so bman had the foul the other end for Virginia B Miller with the threepointer in the first of the game from Florida State and then has the response Cavaliers by Applause Music 10 Music Dad were going to be late cant stop adding stuff to

Virginia the second half M four six as a team and a couple of Threes for mcne well and heres the thing about him that the 18 points is is one thing but hes taken TW he had 26 free throws on the year coming in in 22 games but five of five tonight hes accepting both the three and getting driven off the line hes getting in hes taking fouls he got fouled on that one threo attempt but I think this game going forward he he needs to be getting to the line more especially with dun out with the three fouls and minor they got a different lineup out there right now and remember early on Tom that they had a 10point lead in Florida State able to reel them back in a little bit but missing a free throw right there these these these leads or you know you really you cant let Virginia get out more than you know right right about here this is this is kind of like red line territory so warl come up comes up empty from the free throw line Florida state is a team mik 13th on the conference from the line and 68 yeah thats thats an empty possession with a spin and driving to the rim and he very quiet has just been money for them tonight you know 12 points four rebounds three assists steals this is now the largest lead of the evening for the visiting Cavaliers look look where theyre forcing the the offense to be run and the shot clock theyre just grinding right nowley with a spin of his own got his Miss sent it back out Jackson into the lane of his but good and nice job just staying on the Miss shot get the recycle Chandler Jackson hes got four points right about his average for the season didnt play in the last two games trying to contribute tonight and get the no back in this one with that bucket peakman again driving eyes for the rim Jackson claims he went straight up and the officials do not agree and he you know he he went he started left but you know eventually hes going to come back to that right hand and you really got to try to limit that as much as you can youve got to honor those threepoint Shooters the 20 times this season double digit scoring pman Virginia with an 18 and5 record three in conference play second place right now behind North Carolina currently Florida state is fourth in the ACC standings and Tony Bennett has really had to kind of piece together lineups throughout the course of this game because of the foul trouble with Miner and with dun Jackson against Ro shot clock at 10 spears a relatively quiet so far able to reather nickelberry Spears preserving The Possession Jackson stepping into the three and knocking it down for the seven they challenged him to make a shot and he steps up under 30 from behind the arc only his ninth made three of the season on 29 from Beyond The Arc beakman Su a shot yeah see that time you make him go left and finish that way it was a tough try Jackson forcing the issue heres the look I mean there just Beakmans just saying go ahead be my guest and uh hey you make a shot Virginias going to play the percentages hes 29 on the year but you step up and you make a play so the two guys who made threes are Baba Miller and Chandler Jackson for Florida State two of 10 as a team bman getting a breather Miner back in with the foul trouble as Mike mentioned yep the last Virginia foul was on Jake Bros his third inside Corin spins off the rim and he is fou is that minor fourth Mike oh no they change it at the last second again he was certainly there SC Murray first personal that was close I mean I it it looked on first blush I thought they were going to I was watching you and they yeah because they they went right at him which is exactly what you you know you need to do guy in foul trouble coming right into the Applause game theres been activity for both teams in the paint 20 points in the paint for Florida State 18 for Virginia looks like G is getting set to come into the game and be a part of the action a COR out G in Florida State now 13 of 17 from the free throw line so far this uh the the pressure has not bothered Virginia much at all and they dont mind having time run off the clock either Harris brings it up no turnover so far in the half for still at four Harris has not scored in the game only attempted one shot it was a three attempt trying to feed his teammate Groves Groves has a three got the switch and grov had a great look theyve really been working the corner threes Groves came in 50 from Beyond The Arc to start the night 35 of 70 first attempted three and made by Grove B online all the way Murray tips it to Harris three of 18 on the year coming in Ro pass nickelberry oh Bow helps out watch out Harris grabs it tried to feed it to minor in tight quarters nickelberry went downall went out of bounds and Florida State so Jake Groves open for a three and he

not scored in this game for Florida State Mike well and keep an eye on Ryan Dunn back in the game for Virginia with the three personal fouls Jackson wants another three Jackson online but short the thing is the way Virginia plays defense it is really hard to hide somebody just because of the individual responsibilities within it inside Harriss opening G couldnt recover you know of the guys on the floor you maybe lose track of where he is but uh man he was WI open inside that was a great find by beakman so now the lead is 11 and Coach Hamilton wants a timeout and you know that just he was

field goal percentage at Fourth and steals the Third but uh you know outstanding as always but the thing Tom you know you you look at look at the second half for Florida State four of 11 shooting 36 that number is but two of 11 or two of seven from three seven of their 11 shots have been behind the arc thats thats what they need to be doing they dont need to be standing behind the threepoint line and taking shots they need be attacking inside thatll help the field goal and so that Monster Jam from Applause Watkins high percentage from Watkins yeah nice you know quick four points right there gets the crowd energized a little bit dun was able to get it back shot clock is seven for Harris hell pump up a three both sides of the rim Buchanan Second Chance Virginia quietly hes given them some

at the free throw line Florida state has made its last three field goal attempts and with that free throw its a 70 Run for the NOS was right when the when the game got to be a 10point game in the first half they had an answer and theyve answered here in the second half to cut at the four Virginia has led for the vast majority of this game and as many as 12 largest lead for the Cavaliers Applause Miller stands his ground how about Baba Miller checking beakman beakman stepping back not enough on it Jacks right up the middle looking for the rims Applause scor and he was fouled again

calling fresh and fiery in a damn good time watch wild cards this Monday 98 Central or stream free anytime on the CW you might call Chandler Jackson a bit of a wild card tonight Mike had not played in the last two games did score 10s North Carolina but before that two points Four Points couple of games without a point he is forcing the issue and successfully so for the NS but heres the thing you know with Leonard Hamilton its different guys stepping up at different times I mean he had a game 14 points against Georgia Tech earlier this year so you know you get your opportunity and he will play the hot hand that was a career high for the sophore ch against Georgia ATT Rose R for three what an answer that interrupts a 90 run for Florida State which has made its last four field goal attempts thr defending Watkins shot fory High degree of difficulty couldnt come up with it at least Florida state has kept the attack mode front and center I like you know that the continuing not settling through the three going to the rim a fiveo game with seven and a half minutes to go in regulation from Tallahasse Virginia try to win it third in a row in the series knocked away from MC warley On The Run Miller Miller pounds it into the floorans in Takes a Tumble and a foul is called by Lee Cel div into the nations most shocking Mysteries CS a series premiere of The allnew CW original true crime series crime Nation Tuesday February 20th 87 Central only on the CW last foul on beakman is third and so Florida state in the bonus for the rest of the game Boba Miller 50 from the line has to step up and first free throws of the game for Miller as Tony Bennett Paces that Virginia sideline where the threepoint line has been a benefit for Virginia the free throw line starting to be a big benefit for Florida State one of two this has been a very close series over the years 57th meaning both teams have won 28 games Mike when you average the scores of all the games Florida State ahead 668 to 667 score it for Applause pman just very simple basic basketball the curl getting to his right hand finish maybe getting away a little bit with that left arm but uh its been terrific going around curling That Way Chandler Jackson picked up his second personal foul to put be at the free throw line three of four so far from the stripe of the game for beakman 77 on the season the lead is back up to seven Music Applause foul his fourth so massive foul trouble for Virginia in the last six and a half minutes of the game grov has done it on the defensive end and the offensive end Mike with 10 points as well one of three double digit scores for Applause Virginia dont forget our double header next week CW court side Saturday Syracuse Georgia Tech NC State Clemson note the times as we inch closer to the ACC tournament in Washington DC in mid Applause the lead is five for Virginia possession of the ball with Applause bman mcne is the leading score with 18 push to Miller tell you Miller at 611 really has been impressive his ability to guard out on the perimeter you know he had he had the hand check that time but hes done a pretty nice job in general remember the Cavaliers are working on a seven game winning streak thats the best of the ACC and all those games against ACC opponents saved by D McNeely what a play I thought that pass had no chance of getting anywhere that was that was an incredible saved by dun perhaps equally as impressive Mike as the seven game winning streak three wins in a row on the road trying to make it for Virginia to about and his Str continue yeah you know youre rolling inside things are working well for you you got a guy who is 0 of five from the floor and then beakman gets an easy you get a bad shot on one end and an easy layup on the other end so green made 54 pointers this season to lead the team as Mike just mentioned for five warley puts it up top Florida State thats something Leonard Hamilton talked about today said them used to have him big so they can just throw the ball up at the rim and go play catch 61 Miller up on the rim on the business end for the AL five minutes to go in regulation late in the shot clock for the Cavaliers and pman against Corin so warley has picked up his third last foul on warley only the sixth team foul so Miner you see Miner trotting off Canons back in minor two points in the game as he heads to the Tony Bennett bench his biggest stat is no personal fouls m F feet behind the line way behind it 22t 1 and 34 in away add another six or seven of that he had been quiet up to that moment Watkins on the drive over tough angle ends up with Buchanan dangerous time right now Mike closing in on four minutes in a 10point game you got to think Virginia May unless get a really opportunistic look are going to be become very deliberate in their offense now four onoin Bean down the edge of the lane too strong buan again and he puts it back up and Applause in freshman coming of age for Tony Applause Bennett hes got four points Mike they feel a lot bigger than that a dunk and a put back bumped in the lane by roie so well take a timeout foul against Virginia theyve got the lead on the road at Florida State when youre great your game does the talking in the ACC our speaks volumes 26 appearances in the final four including nine different schools five teams and the last five NCAA fin four 40

Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years thats from the logo folks um theres the three points sh we talked about one of the keys nine of 17 Florida State got back within four points they got some quick turnaround there Watkins a nice steal they got out in transition but uh Virginia had an answer and they have stretched the lead back over still plenty of time 12point game 335 left Leonard Hamilton has had to watch Virginia make nine threepointers tonight above their season average of 67 made per game well you know Virginia on the road shooting 50 from the field nine of 17 from three 10 of 12 from the three throw line thats about as efficient efficient offensively as youre going to get and again his team is two of 13 on threepoint tries 17 assists on 25 made field goals with six turnovers against a an excellent defensive team Virginia leads the conference an assist per game as a team no surprise there theyve supported that tonight with their effort 10point game Heavy pressure L to State bask and it started with the hle by Chandler just like that nice job by Florida State getting out Chandler Jackson is earning himself some future minutes potentially with his effort tonight well he earned hes earned his minutes tonight no guarantees on that bench yeah lets put it that way Watkins bumps into dun green still has not scored to the game hes all six from the floor this is Jackson sing his way to the rim hes going back to the free throw line those are you know for right now I mean that just a a silly foul that the last thing you want to do stop the clock you know you get you get beat you get beat but to give up a threepoint play like that and also let them get into their pressure Applause defense so no Jackson with 15 points Mike thats a new career high you mentioned a 14 in win against Georgia Tech for Jackson knocked Away by Watkins Spears feeds him Watkins pumps it up just wanted a little bit too much right there the crowd was ready for that one couldnt connect and then he reaches in on beakman third on Watkins so he has 17 and Jackson has 15 theyre the leading scorers for Florida State tonight mcne got 23 beakman to the free throw line with 18 and four five from the strike this last 241 could take a while I got nowhere to be Mike nope I can hang we got pretty good seats right here Tom we are Courtside after all saw Spears exit the game for the seminal he Music actually he actually asked to come out so Im tugging at his jersey looking over the bench look at Jackson and the confidence he is playing with Mar just uh he just taking Ro right to the rim he is demanding the basketball at this point well you know when youre in this type of high rotation and you got things going on in a game uh youre going to you are going to take advantage of it Jackson and Watkins lead the way for Florida State now with 17 and for Jackson a new career high closing in on the final two minutes beakman trying to gety oh he got a foul first like he slid but the Jamie lucky is going to call the Applause foul so that could be warly Mike I mean hes the only one there and its his fourth well get in Applause confirmation so thats 12 of 15 now from the line again the fourth on warley as a team for Virginia 12 of 15 13 of 16 you know I Florida State really cant complain about the officiating or the free throw line theyve been there 25 times so far in the game Virginia is not a good free throw shooting team tonight they are over 80 Watkins staying with it he was looking for contact as well and it looks like a quick timeout and it is by coach Hamilton so one one timeout left for Florida State and a nice job me going against the premier shot Blocker in the ACC really good take why hes been hes been terrific the post tonight 19 points for him he you know and hes gotten hes gotten terrific support you talked about the new career high for Music Jackson now Watkins came into the game as the leading scorer for Florida State this season close to 14 points per game he has exceeded that tonight with his 19 the 17 from Jackson we got two players for Virginia I was that have gone over 20 mik Wonder Groves is coming back in the game hes got four also has 10 points and so he may this you know may be an offense for defense also the 21 points from beakman that ties his career high and mcne leads with 23 and that leads everybody took a little while but its turned into a fantastic ball game between Virginia and Florida State as the Cavaliers try to win their third in a row in the series inside a t of the shot Applause clock beakman kept his footing the turn around Miller almost tipped it in his own goal its been a tough go tonight for Green from Beyond the AR little bump there there and a push Canon and see that thats the Freshman coming out of him he got a guy going laterally right there look Virginias going to show really hard on those screens and Tony Bennett is just shaking his head youre giving away free throws right there and uh just uh you know just really really stop the clock giving up free giving up two free throws at this in this you know instance I mean both teams mikee are way above their season average from the line FL state is 68 as a team theyre up near 80 as is Tony Bennetts team which is last in the ACC in shooting from the free throw line so jayen warley the Junior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania Applause his free throw now makes this a fourpoint game 11 to Applause go one minute remain final minute McNeely trying to build on his career high and he did it with a three ball wow he didnt even hesitate 26 points Isaac mcne I thought theyd run some clock on that green with mcne on his hip plays it in Qui two Florida State and a timeout Leonard Hamilton Isaac mcne we take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you Auto home or motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom M near a new career high 12 five of seven from three 26 points and just fabulous numbers two assists four rebounds as well as not fouled in the game hes just one off his career high for three made in a game Mike hes got five his career high as six and hes another guy who you know is back last year is uh you know has been through the system stepped up only averaged six points a game last year but it really came on as the the season progressed fourth time this season hes exceeded 20 points in the game in fact he did in backto back games against Syracuse and North Carolina Central and he has gone over the 20 point mark and broken his existing career high of 22 points with his performance Music tonight so mcne Mike with 26 points cool common collected with that last three as well hes been impressive and 70 points put on the board by the way by Florida State thats tied for the most that virgin given up this season gave up 70 to Florida in a win back in November so regardless of the outcome Florida state has turned up the heat offensively on the best defensive team in the league and Im a little surprised they had Ro in the game at that time only 33 from the field but he looks anything but that on that free throw yeah just his 13th and 14th attempts of the season from the line for Andrew Ro sevenpoint game 40 seconds to go Watkins Drive SLI for the jam D poked it away also got a piece of Watkins so Mike the 70 points comes after only allowing Miami 38 points and winning against the canes by 22 yeah I mean you look at that stretch and Clemson was the most successful team at 65 but that was still 14 points under their season average yeah that was the win last Saturday at Clemson by one 6665 so Watkins at the free throw line again Virginia only averages allowing about 57 points per game I mean right now theyve got as many made free throws as they do made field goal attempts so you know Florida state has done a lot of their scoring at the free throw line and whats interesting about that Mike as Watkins hits the second the game at Boston College on Tuesday Florida State took a total of four free throws a made two while Virginia on Wednesday against Miami three of six from the line theyre making up for it tonight double team see they had the ball in Ros hands and they let him get away let let a few seconds tick away before they got the foul that is going to be the fifth on warley so hes going to have to leave the game well this is a game too when we touched on it that uh Tony Bennett has really had to piece together different lineups throughout the course of the game because of foul trouble yeah his team has gone to the line mik 18 times made 15 of them again on Monday against Miami three of six from the free throw line now granted it was a lopsided victory but this is a whole different story tonight for both of these teams compared to their recent games so warley is fouled Applause out couple of huge misses seconds to go green hasnt made one all night Miller deflects it Jackson throws it up he misses green grabs it he scores and hes going to the free throw line wow what a time to make your first basket of the game just kind of tipped it to himself kept it alive green has really struggled 0 of six from Beyond The Arc fought hard on that possession now has a chance for the free throw Five Points in the game from Green two Miss free throws by beakman as close as Florida state has been in the second half Ro calls a time out along that Baseline wow what a turn of events after the beakman misses at the line and the threepoint play for green at the other end and again Virginia starting the evening behind North Carolina in the second position Florida State Wake for has posted the victory to Edge in front of Florida State for the moment well Ill say Ill say this for its not so much the seven and four thats important from Florida St its a 13 and nine thats why this win is so critical for them to get a this this quality win in conference to bolster that 13 n side always keeping in mind that the top four teams in the regular season standings get that double bu last year an early exit from Florida state with a first round loss against Georgia Tech by a point in greensbor Duke going on to defeat this Virginia program in the title game a year ago at the ACC tournament in the 70th Edition 71st in Washington DC midmarch here we go with the final 113 seconds Ro on the inbounds Miller guards it and you got the big guy you got size on the inbound mck NE bothered by Watkins so Watkins picked up the foul to put mcney at the free throw line thats going to be number five on Watkins fouling out with 21 points and he battled the entire night and this will be the most points that Virginia has given up in a win this year if they close this thing out looking to extend the winning streak to eight games in a row all ACC wins if they can hang on we are far from that 82 with mcney at the free throw line McNeely 26 points leads all scores and five of five on free throw attempts well you know then too if he if he makes both do you uh you know do you give up do you take the foul you know with the fourpoint lead and you know know just come back Applause and take care of business and the lead is four no foul here Play Straight Up Spears six seconds threepoint attempts and Tony Bennett just went all great house with a threo attempt and fouled thats that is truly unbelievable so house who had an attempted a field goal all night Ryan Dunn picked up his fifth 13 and blue right there just enough wow house by the way has only attempted 163 its not that he had a whole lot of choice in the matter with the clock ticking down thats 163 for the season and if youre looking at house at the free throw line for three free throw two of five on the year for Tom house the sophomore from Dayton Ohio tonight hes made a couple two for two only two points in the evening I mean Mike you never know when the moment is thrust upon you you just dont know be ready right that is just its amazing especially for a player like dun to to make that type of mental error Applause theres the first one well you know what there are a lot of people here at the Tucker Center who went for the exits one more for house missed it on Applause purpose 33 seconds and MC got foul thats the wrong guy to send to the free throw line again not that there was a lot of choice in the matter H made the first one to make it a threepoint game missed the second and then missed the Third on purpose and now McNeely has a chance to put it away yeah I I think if you had asked the uh if you had asked the Florida state coaching staff if they were going to score 76 tonight they would have like their chances but well they scored 30 at halftime and Trail by four yeah come in and score 46 in the second half and with the Miss free throws thats the first Miss by mcney house launches it hits the rim and thatll do it wow what a finish 8076 Tony Bennetts team has now won eight in AOW R Mike and four in a row on the road in the ACC and thats where championships are won Incredible streak they have going
