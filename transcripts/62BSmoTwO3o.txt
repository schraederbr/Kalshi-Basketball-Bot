Joe Gerard and Clemson in the road purple Syracuse in the home white as we are underway in what is a terrific ACC battle in February two teams trying to bolster that tournament resume Brown aggressive swipes it away from Hall and slams it down to open the scoring when we spoke with Brad Brownell yesterday uh he said that was key in this game for Clinton they cannot turn the ball over we must keep Syracuse out of transition Chase Hunter the immediate answer take a look at the starting five for the orange JJ Starling last seven games has been in double figures he has been red hot for this Syracuse team has it here going against Applause Gerard through the MZ money Juda MZ hes been the goto guy all season well we have some NBA execs here well in the building obviously eyes on Jud men PJ Hall and thats a big time turnaround by Judah men two turnovers caused early by this Syracuse defense they have started in dialed in Starling in attack mode Ratt in and out no good well that time they caught Clinton in the mismatch that time Starling going at PJ Hall just short on the pullup jumper Chaplin working against Justin Taylor Chaplins been a double double machine for this Tigers team trying to spin his way free and he does thats the area of concern for Syracuse yes PJ Hall gets a lot of attention but shefflin going up against the smaller tailor and theyre going to try to take take advantage of that matchup Brown lines up a wide open three and buries it you cant ask for a better start uh if youre red ay and Syracuse Brown the steel that time the three hes locked in early he has five of the oranges seven and after they let up 92 against Louisville on Wednesday great defensive pressure to start this game Clark was the open man and made the orange pay and Jay thats all set up by Joseph Gerard yeah he leads them an assist an ACC play thats a beautiful find by Gerard bince walked right into it couldnt connect Gerard yet to take a shot back here in the dome against his former team Syracuse was forced three turnovers in the opening three minutes theyre doing a great job being active in the passing lanes that time theyre trying to post up sheflin and great Hands by Taylor to come up with another steal Taylor pull up hot rattles in and out gra Brownell shouting instructions for them to run their offense lobed in PJ Hall he can make it look too easy at times and I agree with him the message uh received PJ Hall had not gotten some touches uh he was hot with his team again a guy coming off a 25point performance on the road at North Carolina I assume hes going to get a lot more touches 8 seconds to shoot heres Chris Bell who had 30 in the win against roville on Wednesday off to Taylor two seconds to shoot Min has to heave it and hits it Judah mince as the shot clock sounds not bad defense of high Clemson thats just a guy in Judah minz hitting the NBA 3 with the shot clock winding Applause down into Hall Brown whos already had one steal today into sheflin who travels a terrific start two teams that have come out dialed in early just getting started Syracuse energy and the key thing is hes matched up against PJ hall right here great denial again we saw practice yesterday he practiced this shot after practice a knocking do down as you can tell that works in practice after practice is paying off knocking down to three yeah only is fourth made three this season how about his statline on Wednesday hes the only college basketball player to have more than 10 points five rebounds five assists five steals five blocks all in one game since 2021 he can do it all and I think hes the xfactor guy yes Jud men gets a lot of attention as he should uh but I think hes the guy that dra the match up of some of these opposing pigs and none on display tonight PJ Hall thats going to be a key matchup early on hes doing a great job Starling lines up a three cant connect Clemson is a perfect four for four from the floor but they also have four turnovers today so when they can get the shot off theyre perfect but this Syracuse defense has forced four turnovers a great defensive energy and pressure to start this Applause game inside to PJ Hall Hunter right back to Hall the giv go and PJ Hall rocks the rim beautiful find by Hunter that time giving go pinpoint passing and Clemson now falls back in zone They played Zone that last possession Force the Deep three if youre Syracuse be patient try to get the ball to that F line area and then attack from there Taylor trapped in the corner tries to go Baseline on Clark Fades away B Clark rejected at the ring by Chris Bal great help defense to preserve two points well that is a beautiful help D looked like it was going to be an uncontested dunk and came over and broke up a sure Deuce Bell from the corner hit the side of the backboard TR had a great Rhythm early theyve come out of this timeout theyve got no points in the last two minutes Hunter pull up pop nothing but the bottom of the net one of the more underrated guards in the ACC just a veteran presence beautiful off a high Scot ball screen right there right in his rhythm excellent offense by Clemson the last two possessions Hunter and Gerard has made a great back court Duo for the Tigers this season two Fife players that have played in big games in ACC play t another shot that just Way Off the Applause Mark right now Clintons forcing contested jumpers and that was not the case to start this game off mids gets into the lane Syracuse needed that and judin delivers and thats what Syracuse needs to do they need to push the pace uh before this Clemson Zone can get set up thats a tough runner in the lane by Jud and the near 3 minute scoring drout Brown pops it away again Malik Brown has been all over PJ Hall to start this game its super disruptive now its a loaded slate of college basketball today all over ESPNs network but the best one the Sonic Blockbuster Baylor at Kansas tonight 6 eastern time you do not want to miss it Music well Jay the defense that Malik Brown has played on uh PJ Hall hes going to get a break and uh Halls out of the game as well too I think the key thing though is hes pushing him out of the paint making it difficult for him to get the ball two feet or one foot in the paint and thats creating some disruption on the offense Vader Copeland might be the only player you see Off the Bench for shu is him and mooha have come in because this is an orange team with not a lot of depth the dismissal of Benny Williams and Peter carry is out with an injury today so hea and Copeland are six and seven they probably wont play more than that yeah but theyre going to need those to be quality minutes again right now red ay uh giving his guys Malik Brown in particular a blow when PJ hall went to the bench got Tre and thats a go johy Wiggins attacking the glass easy goal tending call as Clemson edges in front by three back in fourth we go here at the Music ACC now this is Time of Year everyone wants to talk Bracketology ESPN Joe lardy has Clemson as one of four ACC teams in his projected field as of this morning we spoke with lonardi pregame and asked him about the Tigers resume for me Clemson really gave itself some breathing room with that win in Chapel Hill this week I think the Tigers are solidly in the field uh I wouldnt get too hung up on the conference standings in fact Conference record isnt even a data point the committee uses now we can argue whether thats good or bad but its a fact my message to them would be no bad losses so thats very interesting talking about Brad brownells team that I think wrongly was left out of the tournament a year ago they seemingly live on the bubble come February and March but lonardi has them safely comfortably in the field just need to avoid bad losses just win baby and thats what all these coaches its just simple as that look and I think the the term bad loss thats the debate right there again this league and I think thats the issue the ACC conference theres some teams in there that some folks may not be aware of but the Georgia Techs the Florida States the Virginia techs uh the Boston c those are not bad losses those are quality teams its just a tough conference and I think that is really where the debate comes in and it was really interesting to hear him say conference records is not a metric that the committee looks at because thats a shame it might help Clemson whos sitting at five and six in the ACC but I dont know I think your record in the league you play in especially a good League like the ACC should matter well again right here theyre on the road obviously another opportunity to try to bolster of their resume offensive rebound kick out Gerard picks it his first shot against his former team and the New York native buries it and that is a concern uh red uty and staff he talked about rebounding thats going to be key thats a second chance opportunity right there off the offensive rebound rebound throw it back out to one of the best threepoint Shooters in the country Gerard who is a fouryear starter here at Syracuse a top 20 player in scoring in program history and another offensive rebound leads the second chance points for Clemson they got to put bodies on guys again thats something that Clemsons very good at theyre going to crash the offensive glass we talked about Syracuses depth issues right now though uh theyre having issues on the defensive glass thats got to change Applause Bell steps into it misses and a foul called on hea whos seeing increased minutes today hes played 28 minutes all season in conference the most hes played is four minutes against Boston College but with Peter Cary unavailable Benny Williams is spiss from the team earlier this week red arre is looking at his Ben saying we dont have much in the front Court yeah depth obviously an issue and now Malik Brown back into game key thing foul trouble must keep him out of foul trouble can ill afford not to have him on the court Clemson on a 7even nothing run taking control here of the first tackle heres RJ gotri trying to spin his way free and he hits it right now Clemson is just uh dominating the paint offensive rebounds and then they are trying to post and attack the paint every possession thre minute scoring drop for Syracuse mince comes up empty its allowed the Tigers to go on a 9 nothing run D during this scoring drought another foul called Clemson off the defensive stop right here again clear foul and theyre pushing the pace Clemson again theyre being very opportunistic in their transition you know Huck you never know how a team is going to respond after a huge win on the road like Clemson had on Tuesday night knocking off number three North Carolina it was only the second time in program history that the Tigers had won in Chapel Hill and Brad Brownell told us that feels like this team because theyre so veteran has the ability to handle success well he hasnt seen it theyve been too up and down today is a big opportunity to prove they can start stringing wins together and I thought he gave an interesting payoff to that point he said he was more concerned about Joseph Gerard coming back that energy as opposed to him said look our guys have won big games before I just didnt want Joe or the other guys trying to get out of character with his return and he said it these guys want to win this game for Joe Gerard they know how much it means to the New York native great Eyes by Dylan Hunter tigers Three onone give and go for an easy transition two timeout Syracuse the Tigers on a 152 run over the last 6 minutes theyre doubling up the orange 2412 to9 since then Clemson on a 152 run to grab throl the rebounding Jay thats the issue right now Clemson dominating the pain right here offensive rebound put back and then theyre getting their opportunities in half court theyre attacking the paint and then transition uh they push the pace off of turnovers a beautiful execution and transition right now 15 to4 in favor of rebounds for Clemson and that is the story of this first half thus far Judah minz trying to get the orange going but stepped on the line a turnover Syracuse had great Energy Great rhythm in the first five five six minutes of this game but that is all evaporated with Clemson taking control and Clemson has cut the turn over something graad ronell talked to us about uh in our Zoom call with him yesterday he said look we cannot turn the ball over now that right there TS him but with that he is hot right now the only good thing about that obviously its not a live ball turnover he said look we cannot uh give turnovers to Syracuse and put them in transition Brad R now has a team he feels like can not only get into the NCAA tournament but make a deep run a veteran Squad that is hungry you saw that in Chapel Hill on Tuesday taking down number three North Carolina trying to follow it up with another road win this afternoon Starling right to the rim missed it Chase Hunter crafty ball handling keeps it alive finds his brother Dylan Hunter great Hands by Copeland but Starling could not keep it in play right now Clemsons doing a great job spacing the floor and they have Syracuse so spread out they have them chasing over and theyre getting some opportunities with their dribble Applause drives Syracuse in a scoring drown of 4 minutes and 38 seconds its allowed Clemson to go on an 11 nothing on during that drought Gerard a deep three got it Joe Gerard two for two against his former team thats a breakdown again youre playing Zone but the one guy you must identify is Joseph Gerard one of the uh best threepoint Shooters in the history of the ACC obviously and that cannot happen if youre Applause Syracuse scoreless for now more than 5 minutes nice block by Bal but the orange need something on the offensive end theyve been stuck on 12 points for 5 and 12 minutes now Starling hoping to end the drought he cant do it there is a lid on the rim right now for SU Applause offensive foul it is all Clemson right now Joe Gerard cooking back of the Dome great ball Movement by Clemson and that scene looks familiar and this building right now Clemson Music rolling for the first time since his transferred to Clemson fouryear starter for the orange a primarily warm welcome this afternoon student section is letting them hear some booze here and there hes taken two shots both from three and no surprise to Syracuse fans that hes made both of them he had a prolific career when you look at the stats his four years in Syracuse he a top 20 scorer in program history and number three all time with nearly 300 threes made in a Syracuse uniform and now he is proving that hes a terrific player cuz hes come to Clemson and given them a big boost and when we spoke with Brad Brownell yesterday I asked him uh any surprises when you got uh Joseph Gerard and anything uh stick out after you said no we got exactly uh what we thought we were getting and certainly hes a guy that can score the ball and do it well Syracuse has fallen into a scoring drought of six minutes now its been crippling in this game its allowed the Tigers to go on a 14 nothing run three onone here for the orange up Copeland much needed thats what they need to do thats how they started the game off turnovers uh their defense is going to get them back in this Applause game Hall working against brown brown commits the foul thats been a great matchup to watch in this first half and the key thing look where PJ Halls catching the ball Malik Browns doing an excellent job pushing him out of the paint picked up a foul that time again speaking with Coach red arrey said look we just cannot have him in foul trouble and looks like brown picked up another Music foul thats the last thing you can afford if youre Syracuse you just said it they had already depleted front Court they are relying on Malik Brown he picks up two fouls and two seconds and theyre saying he threw a hip check sheins off to the bench hes looked like uh he is shaking up and again thats two quick fouls on Brown Wiggins left alone missed Applause it Jud de minz working against Gerard leans in does it ball second chance judeah minz trying to stick with it Hall rips it away and then travels well I think right now Syracuse theyre matching the energy that Clemson has had in this last five minute stretch this is great work by Judah Min and rap ronell though was hot he felt like PJ Hall was grabbed on that rebound swatted Away by Hunter cop would retrieves it only 5 Seconds to shoot Copeland right down the lane kick to the corner Starling he cant connect you wont find a better look than that one you cannot ask for a better look youre absolutely right nice play that time shot clock winding down by Copeland thats one you got to have if youre Syracuse wide openen Corner three wi get steps out hes off the mark thats a great blockout that time by Malik Brown on PJ Hall and theyll live with Clemson shooting those jumpers just cant get anything going offensively the oranges one of their last 12 that doesnt drop from Copeland now one for their last 13 and it seems like six or seven shots really have rattled around the rim hung up there and then rolled out way over the head of Gerard so Syracuse is forcing turnovers thats now 10 turnovers by the Tigers in this first half but theyre unable to capitalize on the other end yeah and again points off of turnovers right now now in favor of Clemson Clemson Five Points off a turnover Syracuse only four although Syracuse has four more turnovers mi in attack mode swatted by Applause Hall Gerard great crosscourt pass hson cant cash it in transition Mintz driving right at Gerard swiped away well whats lost in this play of the outlet pass by Malik Brown lets see and there definitely was some body afterwards and a crowd is crying again I think that was after he lost the ball and again though Malik Brown really impressed with his rebounding and then his Outlet passes which led to an opportunity for men right there just unable to finish dump Down Low brown finally beats Hall what a pass by Copeland again Copeland one of the better passers and the ACC thats a beautiful La pass to Malik Brown and Hall answers on the other end in perfect position to put that home and that set up though Jay because of dribble penetration that gets the big move and then gives PJ Hall an opportunity for that offensive rebound Copeland trying to get this Syracuse team going but nothing will fall Hunter spun his way free oh cant hit it another offensive rebound Cashes in for two points when you have a team that attacks the offensive glass like Clemson does soon as the ball goes up in the air if youre watching you better put a body on them now Clemson has 11 Second Chance points they are dominating the glass all right here Copeland with the beautiful pass but it has been to Eastern we have the womens basketball matchup of the day on ESPN Paige Becker in Yukon at undefeated number one South Carolina you do not want to miss it two eastern time tomorrow on ESPN and here at Syracuse Malcolm huckle J alter with you the orange LED 109 early in this game started four of eight they looked good there was a good energy since they are just three of 21 and that takes the energy out of the game and has allowed Clemson to build a 15point lead yeah and I think a lot of that Jay theyve had some open looks you look at their numbers two of 11 from the threepoint line 18 7 of 29 from the floor 24 theyve just missed some shots uh to go along though with I think the big discrepancy rebounding 26 to9 in favor of Clemson total rebounds thats really difficult to win when its that Applause lopsided now the officials deciding to move it to a side out instead of underneath the hoop if youre Syracuse you youd have to lean on a Judah Min to just try and get hot here at the end of the first half give yourself something to go into halftime with well Clemsons done a great job trying to keep him and keeping him out of the paint and then forcing jumpers theyve kept Syracuse out of transition and then uh theyve limited the dribble drives which has not broken down their defense Bell step back three got it and Syracuse needed it Chris Bells first basket of the afternoon and its a three we talking about a guy coming off a 30point performance uh where he was eight of 10 from the threepoint line Big Time shooter PJ Hall continues to show why hes one of the best in the ACC Malik Brown with two fouls if Im Clemson Im going at him every time again if PJ aall catches the ball two feet in the paint like that hes going to score every Applause time copelan rejected by Hall threw the legs to Bell did well to keep the possession alive Bell cant connect that time and another rebound by PJ Hall Clemsons 24 points in the paint of their 33 its been a simple game plan get it into Hall it has been and again theyve attacked the paint uh in this game Clemson uh if you look at uh points uh in the paint that number also has been dominated by Clemson 24 points in the paint for Clemson 10 for Applause Syracuse look at those numbers for PJ Hall he has put himself in the ACC Player of the Year conversation hes an automatic first teamer oh good look from Hunter goes Applause tagging and youll live with that if youre Syracuse no Joseph Gerard on of the Court uh youll live with perimeter jumpers Bell hits it again Chris Bell starting to heat up here at the end of the Applause half beautiful offense might be their best offensive possession of the game time out Clemson will step aside for 30 Applause Music seconds hom glow just cleaned my entire house for 19 seriously 19 they showed up right on time and did my dishes my laundry they even cleaned my windows you just pick a date pick a cleaner and enjoy a spotless house for 19 I love using homow and I think you will Music too Syracuse has lacked offense in this first half but Chris Bell backto back threes starting to heat up you look what he did on Wednesday night against Louisville careerhigh 30 points on eight made threes maybe its Bell who has the hot hand here and I talked to an NBA Scout before the game and they said a very interesting uh comment about him says every game Ive come to to scout Syracuse hes the first guy out on the court getting shots up working on his mechanics its no wonder why uh he is one of the best uh threepoint Shooters in the ACC Gerard back into the game copelan steals it away but couldnt save it Adrien Entre and Jud de me and copet saying that I was tripped up lets see right here again yes definitely I think thats in it Burton and lets see if he got on the line I think he might have kept it in play there yeah Im not sure where Im not sure he stepped on the Applause line so again I think hes Im not sure what the call is a terrible call now the officials discussing this and the shot clock resets thats a tough break for Syracuse like they were going to have a turnover and a chance to score a potentially big swing at the end of this first half oh goes right hea PJ Hall he has feasted in this first half thats a tough move again thats not an easy Runner going away from the basket and that is why uh PJ Hall I believe will be pay playing for a nice paycheck when he leaves Clemson thats a big showing off some skills but playing off the bounce 15 seconds remaining in this first half its a comfortable cushion for Clemson right now trying to add to it 7 Seconds to work with heres Gerard against his former team gives it up to Clark 1 second left Hunter beats the buzzer got it off just in time Adrien ay disagrees the officials will review it and if it is good uh you cannot close out the half any better if your Clinton I think that is going to be good looks like the ball was out of his hands uh you cannot break down into the game in the half situation that time attacking the Zone PJ Hall who Clemson fans call the hall American 106 rebounds in that first half and yeah you take a look at the rebounds coming into today should be even but it was all tigers it was and I I think a couple of things uh offense ly Syracuse uh they got stag they missed some shots but I think on the other side defensively uh you cant give up dribble drives that shift your defense and moves your pigs out of position to rebound and offensively Syracuse sees it low 24 points of that first half they need a spark on the offensive end they start with the ball trailing by 133 down but not out here at home heres JJ Starling a quiet first half for him fading away hits it maybe thatll get the orange going thats a tough turnaround shot clock winding down and Starling uh knocked down to jumper thats a great start of the second half for Syracuse Starling who was scoreless in the first half his first made shot today last seven games hes been all double figures You could argue hes been the most consistent scorer on the Syracuse team as of late 0 for five in the first half good to see him get going to start the second theyre trying to post up shefin against Taylor Clark cant connect and they call the foul against shefin pushing the back BR brout now not happy lets see if he got him right here again yeah thats again thats a elbow in the back now again may not look like much but Chans a pretty strong guy and ref felt that definitely uh caused him not K not being able to get up and get that rebound Syracuse will take any help they can get on the glass at the moment deep three pal left it Applause short heres hunter in attack mode you cant couldnt connect Starling lines up a three DRS it JJ Starling starting to come alive and hes playing with so much more confidence when we spoke with red off he said at the beginning of the Season he would not have taken those shots but he is playing with so much more confidence and less hesitation poked Away by Brown looking for mince feeds it back to Brown rejected by Hall PJ Hall great transition defense Ive been impressed with Halls defense in particular his Blocks hes kept them in play Syracuse forcing turnovers now can they cash in on the other end for three it P the foul chis bell with a chance for a fourpoint play well they needed a spark to set this second half up Judah men with the dribble drive and Bell continues his hot Applause shooting what a start to this second half Syracuse on an8 nothing run in the first two minutes and 30 seconds of this second half El cant complete the fourpoint play Wiggins to Gerard trying to quiet the crowd and he Applause does well thats an underrated uh part of his game everybody thinks hes a catch and shoot guy he is very good off the bounce thats a beautiful pullup off a close out by Judah men Bell off the cut draws another foul back to the line a beautiful cut right here by Bell again take the contact almost am one but Clemson went back to their Zone and again thats how youre going to have to attack it get it to that short corner or wing and then attack the middle I got I got and Bell continues to shoot the ball lights out at last game against Louisville eight threes made in that game where he went off for 30 points hes a guy that added 10 lbs uh during the off seon and I believe when its off all said and done hes a guy that will play at the next level because of his ability to knock down three lons largest lead was 15 that is shrunk to five the crowd back in it at the start of this second half locked in Taylor swipes it away Bell working on Gerard former teammates going at it Bell certainly has the size Advantage but its Gerard who pokes it Applause away sh lost the ball Clemsons turning it over and a high clip 15 turnovers today and theyre trying to post up shefin shefin just lost the post entry pass that time Brown going right into shefin he misses it Applause four second half turnovers of the opening four minutes for the Applause Tigers oh find to muscle his way into brown leaves it for shein and one KN and shein count it plus the foul well this is what Clemson has been trying to do a post up Paul and seflin a beautiful interior passing by PJ Hall out of the double team passing out of double teams like they did on the previous play that led to the n one Music opportunity all eight players that have touched the court for Clemson today have scored and 30 of the Tigers 41 points have come in the paint here we go and chap the junor from Loganville Georgia at the line to try and complete his and one and he does Syracuse started the second half on an eight nothing run to cut the Clemson lead to five can they continue the comeback effort plenty of time right now now uh clemon in that 32 Zone and key thing if youre clemon you got to identify Bell but cant give him any open looks and then if your Syracuse attack that paint either at the F line or short Corner Starling a deep three left it short a foul called on Godfrey had a hook on Brown underneath and I love how Malik Brown attacks both the defensive and offensive glass he does a great job ball goes in the air and he is Relentless in his Pursuit after anything coming off the glass heres Bell another offensive rebound Starling through traffic gets it to go JJ Starling all seven of his points have come in the second half and give Malik Brown half a point for that thats a unbelievable tip back out to keep that Play Alive by Malik Brown hter down the lane Tangled Up Starling with great defense there and watch Malik Brown again previous uh keeping that play alive and then Sterling with the body control Syracuse bench one of the M1 on that that one two possession game into Wiggins who jams it right in the face of brown thats a breakdown miscommunication out of bounds underneath that should never happen if your Syracuse give up a uncontested dunk underneath the basket Copelands been quiet today trying to spin his way free so crafty Applause cand that was tough the great ball fak by judement to set that pass up to the foul Applause line hunter in attack mode right to the rack for two well he is just been solid thats his eighth point to go along with five assists hey Brown on a rack attack both of these teams trading punches finding a rhythm we have seen seven straight makes between these two teams Clemsons four for four Syracuse has made three in a row all pops up stolen away heres starling and he draws the foul explosive in transition JJ Starling heads to the line for two Syracuse has matched the physicality and Pace that Clemson has I love the play by JJ Starling pushing the pace and getting out in Applause transition Starling who was scoreless in the first half now has eight in the second coming on strong as we remind you NBA Saturday prime time later tonight on ABC 830 Eastern Time Dev and Booker and KD taking on step and the Warriors you do not want to miss it coverage tips with NBA Countdown at 8 Eastern well Jay interesting speaking with uh red ay and the coaching staff about Starling his progression really has been key and I think to go along uh with Jud de men but his aggression but much more aggressive great ball movement leads to a sheflin dunk Ian sheflin ripping the rim off there well its all the interior passing thats a beautiful pass of that time both these teams doing a great job finding cutters to the basket Copeland through the spin cycle foul Applause called a Huck this is the opposite of the first half where both teams had stretches of no scoring Clemson has made five in a row Syracuse has made three in a row and has done a nice job getting to the foul line so both teams in a much better offensive Rhythm here in the second half and I think a big reason why for Syracuse theyve limited uh the paint touches and offensive rebounds for Clemson theyve gotten stops and then theyve been able to get out in Applause transition yeah this team much more comfortable in transition than in the half court absolutely and that was something Brad branell was concerned about keeping Syracuse out of transition in particular he said D de men you got to keep him out of the paint Gerard steps into a three knocks it down Joe Gerard he is three for three from Deep against his former team and thats on Jud men right there you go for the steal you dont get it and the end result Joseph Joe Gerard with a wide open three again this is all set up Juden go for the gamble right here you dont get it youre out of a place and Joe Gerard you give him a open look he is going to make you pay and now seven points away from 2000 1652 of those were scored in a Syracuse uniform Gerard in trouble to stay Clemson ball underneath their own Applause hoop out of bounds underneath Syracuse goes to the Zone thats a travel Chaplan shuffled his feet and thats a 17th turnover today for Clemson and the only thing uh that you look at and be I guess somewhat happy about is the points off of turnovers really uh have not been a big issue for Clemson only eight points off of turnovers for Syracuse yeah they failed to capitalize but still within Striking Distance here down eight with 12 to play minz in attack mode leans in it doesnt drop finally poked home quer Copeland in perfect position he is the voer leader of this team thats a great offensive rebound putback Chaplin lost his footing a foul called hell be at the line when we come Applause back well were see some highlevel offense right here the dunk and Coach ay loving that uh but chefin with the answer and then Gerard with the Deep three four and a half Im hammering the over I think it should be more like six because you take a look at the ACC 9 and3 against the Big 12 nonconference strength of schedule a lot stronger than some of the other conferences that are getting more bids and I think the most important thing HW is you have to look at how historically these teams have fared in the tournament and nobody over the last two seasons two seasons where the narrative has been the ACC is quote unquote down theyre getting less teams in but more are making the final four more more are going deeper in the tournament you have mik drop moments and that right there I think is a mik drop moment winning matters again dont tell me winning does not matter and the last two seasons nobody has done it better or more more than the ACC again I think its a hard argument I know folks want to use metrics and so forth uh but when you look at these teams which we cover and then you look at the success that they have had hard to argue that they should not have uh more than five uh teams into the tournament Gerard contested free thats his first Miss of the afternoon a perfect four for four against his former team before that misfired three mince going right at Gerard makes it a onep possession game hes smiling right now and him and Joe Gerard are having a little conversation former teammates and mint going right at him and Brad Brownell has seen enough time out Clemson the crowd back in it one possession game here in Syracuse done it the back court of Syracuse Starling and mince those two have been fantastic in the second half right here Starling with the three and then juds doing what he does best off the bounce thats the reason why hes one of the better guards not just in the ACC but in college basketball so difficult to keep out of the paint and that has been the story of the second half and how about this the orange with already more points in the second half than they had the entire first half the crowd back in it one possession Applause game Gerard against his former team DRS it Jo Gerard has made some big threes in his return to the Dome young players if you want to learn how to play without the ball watch that last possession by Joe Gerard he put a judement really in the spin cycle coming off screens and then footwork to Perfection and then bury to three Starling got a step on Gerard beats him off the glass JJ Starling 10 points all in the second half now 15 games this season in double figures Paul re gathers it watch how active Syracuse is in the passing Lanes theyre doing a great job of being active with their hands godre spinning his way in right past Copeland for an easy two and thats the problem though Syracuse is having with the three guard lineup as Clemson rightfully so going at that matchup with their three where Syracuse has given up a lot of size Syracuse has made their last four shots Starling right to the rim lays it up and in backto back buckets for JJ Applause Starling hter draws the foul on the floor so as good as the Syracuse offense has been hucked theyve made their last five Clemson has made eight of their last nine and the Syracuse bench feels like that contact and they have a valid reason and theyre going to go take a look at it I think they could potentially yeah again now based on the first Replay that I saw it looks like starlings in legal guarding position and I think thats the key thing and again legal guarding position again hes trying to get in front back in front and then the a contact is initiated by Hunter again I think that no call if anything but theyre taking a look at it right now Applause and and red ay was hot at that again I think hes got a valid argument on that again the contact was initiated by Hunter and I think thats the key Applause thing you know its been an emotional week for Syracuse on Tuesday Adrien Entre has to make the tough decision to dismiss Benny Williams from the program on Wednesday they win a thriller against Louisville 9492 a win today would do wonders in stabilizing the program right now this is a big call at a fourpoint game we already saw the ACC standings we talk with Joe lardy uh these teams right now its a log Jam right now in the middle of that pack these two teams are squarely in the middle of it it is a key game a massive moment in a critical conference Clash here in Syracuse and the officials know that and thats why theyre taking their time they know they need to get this right oh yeah and again I I think its all in how they interpret it and its a huge swing right now 856 to go in this game and Syracuse trailing by four certainly a huge call and somebodys going to walk out of this one unhappy either Brad brell is going to be happy or coach red ay is going to be happy in this one right Applause here Ry Stein is coming over the official to give the call to Malcolm hucke Applause here H what do we got he seemed disappointed telling me this but he said were going to stick with the original call and what theyre saying is is because of the arm he felt like starlings arm was out there which were not seeing in the replay right here again theyre calling starlings arm right there thats what theyre calling because hes got his arm on him now again whether or not we agree with it or not thats what they are sticking with and theyre going to call that a block so because the contact was initiated before the shooting motion its ball underneath the hoop but because the arm also came before the hunter elbow it stays Clemson ball godre grabs his own Miss hands off Wiggins no good and its Syracuse ball and the home fans here thinking the ball dont lie ball dont lie moment right there but certainly excellent blocking out that time by Syracuse to keep Clemson off the offensive Applause glass CH clock at 10 mince lost the handle and Falls to Bell Corner three missed it falls right back to him Second Chance another miss both were short God Frey draws the foul thought Malik Brown might have tied him up there momentarily and thats Browns third not a good foul by Brown and the first three uh by of Syracuse not a bad look by Bell but that foul by Brown ill advised do not want to foul 812 to go let the ball go youre too important uh to this a team to pick up a foul that leg Adrien ay leaves brown on the court with those three fouls doesnt have much Choice with a depleted front Court Godfree couldnt handle iter Copeland dialed in defensively thats the 18th turnover for Clemson today Syracuse right in it trailing by four for five from outside hes in Fuego hes that was the easiest shot hes taken his shot quality has been really difficult and the other side their defense has been Elite and a close one coach at Baton Rouge well theyve done a much better job of getting will Baker under control but LSU is driving like this theyre taking long Closeouts this is going to go down to the wire I I had the over under on infu go at 600 tonight well its shaping up to be a fun finish here in Syracuse Clemson led by as many as 15 and Joe Gerards return to the dome but Syracuse is claw it back to only down four Gerard four made threes it feels like whenever Syracuse gets within Striking Distance their former teammate hits a big shot so much on the line in this game in terms of positioning NCAA tournament and ACC standings heres Jud Min and now Applause Copeland three seconds on the shot clock Bell has to get rid of it he does and draws the foul so Chris Bell back to the foul line where he is two for three today and Clemson has change defenses that time they go man they played a lot of 32 Zone and ser Syracuse in the second half has done a nice job attacking it being patient that time Bell not settling for a jumper and driving the ball and that is the fourth foul against Chanty Wiggins the sophomore from Clemson hes looking over to the bench nobodys checking in for him so Wiggins will stay in the game with four fouls its 726 to play as Bell makes it a twopoint Applause game well Clemson has been trying to post up a Wiggins vers a Copeland and lets see if though they give PJ Hall touch hall right to the rim onehanded Jam the hall American and thatll quiet this crowd if Im Clemson Im giving him a touch every offensive possession that guy is right at the top of the list of for player the year discussion in the ACC brown lost the hand handle could have cut the Clemson lead back to two Wiggins double team balls loose Copeland has it Clemson their 19th turnover today its Syracuse cash in throws off the Rend no good well excellent transition opportunity but that time by Starin just unable to finish PA lines up a three missed it tapped out but Brown there for Applause Syracuse in a critical conference game in the ACC Clemson clinging to a fourpoint lead on the road heres Chris pal cant connect thats a great block out by PJ Hall but that time on Malik Brown and again if Im Clemson Im going right back to Hall give him a touch Wiggins left wide open falls off the rim no good you cant get a better look than that crosscourt again thats all set up by uh the spacing again you cant ask for a better look youre absolutely right wideopen corner three off a beautiful skip Applause pass shot clock down to 10 mince on the Move Fade Away contested missed it thats great defense by Hunter that time against ad judment tried to squeeze with the hall mince there to intercept Starling in attack mode keeps it alive 10 seconds to shoot Starling with all 12 points in the second half make it 14 putting the star in Starling that is a tough move but they had him isolated on PJ Hall soft touch with the finger roll Copeland to TI it at 59 and hes fouled Chase Hunter had no choice but to deny Copeland the rim this is great anticipation right here Copeland with the steel and thats a smart foul though uh by Hunter cuz that was going to be a uncontested layup Applause Music Applause that is now 21 turnovers that Clemson has suffered Syracuse has turned it into 15 second chance point or points off turnovers and now a chance to tie it at 59 missed it well a Clemson lead that was once 15 is down to one four minutes to go in the dome H trying to muscle it in and he draws the F thats where Clemson needs PJ Hall again put him in a high ball screen dive him and then let him try to post up in the paint again he is so tough right here spin move move and thats a clear foul and if youre Clemson to close out this game 401 to go uh I would run my offense through PJ Hall a Clemson team that went on the road and beat number three North Carolina Tuesday night now looking for what would be another massive Road win in the ACC we spoke with the ESPN bracket Joe lonardi he told us Clemson right now comfortably in the projected field but this road to win combined with Carolina on Tuesday would do wonders for the Tigers resume its interesting when we talk to all these ACC coaches just when thats on their mind and everything else uh takes care of itself a hall though with the Miss 81 from the line an ACC play thats a big Miss though twopoint game down the stretch mince off to Starling hes had the hot hand all 14 points have come in the second half to tie it got it he is scoring on all three levels we saw the finger roll before that time sock clck winding down sewing off the midrange thats a beautiful pullup jumper to Hall spinning his way free and fires Clemson back in front its simple PJ Hall needs to touch the ball every time every offensive possession if youre Clemson and then for Syracuse youre going to play through your back court Starling and Men let those guys go make a Applause play contested shot M Misses it short PJ Hall gasping for breath walking up the court this has been a physical Game Hunter takes it himself right down the lane big make there for Chase Hunter and its a fourpoint lead Adrien atrey takes the Applause timeout 228 to play J AJ Starling willing Syracuse to the Finish Line Clemson a fourpoint lead 228 left coming up in Under 12 minutes top of the hour Coach Iowa State 13 and0 at home well and tamon lipy is such a big part of that because he sets the point of attack defensively hes shooting it better hes got a big matchup today with uh Tennyson and big thing big problem for uel Miller and the hot for frogs is uh lipy didnt play in the first game which the Cyclones won and hes back in this game going to have a big day he did in the first game he has to do a better job getting his team out in transition handling the pressure and do not turn the ball over Hilton magic is a real thing hard to play there hes got several 20o games thats coming up at the top of the hour yeah good one following us here in the ACC Clemson and Syracuse the Tigers trying to cling to a road win a fourpoint lead 228 to play Malcolm hucke whats going to separate these two teams down stretch I think Chase Hunter he has been The X Factor for me uh in this uh game for Clemson you look at his numbers 10 points three rebounds and seven assists uh he has been huge playing the point guard position for Applause Clemson Syracuse ball trailing by four starlings had the hot hand has it here all 16 of his points scored in the second half Vince gives it up to Copeland check to make sure that he was in bounds its lost the handle swiped by Hunter again hes done a little bit of everything for this Clemson team Gerard goes right in the Min no call sheelan open for three got it in shein drills it they can beat you in so many different ways that time Mintz falls down and then it opens up your D Fade Away Mintz this time foul called against Hunter and this is all set up right here men not on Gerard and then a wideopen cheffin we talked about Gerard yes he can shoot but he leads Clemson and ACC play an assist thats a beautiful find off a breakdown Syracuse had rally back to tie it at 60 since then Clemson on a 7even nothing run and a missed free throw there from Judah minz make or Miss if youre Syracuse now youre going to have to pick up full and tried to force some turnovers minute 39 to go out two possession game Clemson in the drivers seat trying to close out what would be their second Road win of the week number three North Carolina on Tuesday and now trying to escape the Dome with a win Chaplan great patience to lay it up and in and thats the key word veteran team uh we talked about that with Clemson they are one of the more experienced teams in the country and thats beautiful offense against press great individual effort there from Copeland who fouls Gerard thats the one guy you dont want to send to the foul line and Syracuse should know that their former teammate of four years started all 125 games that he played in a Syracuse uniform took a pretty good shot that time from Pand and theyre going to take a look at this now again I think Im not sure how much of the face he caught and its definitely a play on the ball I think thats the key thing now again I dont think anything is going to Warrant more than a common file lets take a look again hes trying to steal the ball and Im not sure I think thats more Joe sold that one uh Im not sure how much contact he made with his face and I would be surprised if this thing goes anything more than a common foul as you said flagrant one would be not a legitimate play on the ball you felt like it was clearly situation youre trying to steal the ball legitimate play on the ball obviously and then I think excessive now I think that was more a Gerard he definitely sold that one a little bit and really uh again if it was really that hard he probably would have grabbed that his face afterwards Im not sure how much contact he made well Gerard 93 from the foul line this season in his Syracuse career he was 8 8 so the orange fans and players know this is not the guy you wanted the foul line yeah hes almost automatic and again big reason why its a luxur to have him out on the court its a luxury to have him on the court at the end of games you have one of the better free throw shooters in college basketball on the line and now just threepoint shy of 2000 in his college career 1652 of those points scored in a Syracuse uniform I had a chance to speak with Coach Jerry Matt uh before the game he said I got mixed feelings about seeing him in this hes happy for the young man but he said look I watched this young man win a state championship in football right in this building and created some memories four years that he had him here at Syracuse now her never time for the orange Copeland draws the foul not a good foul by PJ Hall at all again no need to fou in that situation does a couple of things stops the clock and then allows Syracuse to set up their full court pressure Hopeland at 67 on the season from the Applause line an opportunity to make it a twopossession game again this is where time becomes an issue with the Syracuse and key thing is inbounding the ball if youre Syracuse you want to make sure you have a safety back you dont want to get beat long and give up layups and Gerard is fouled again the one guy you cant send to the foul line and theyre trying to trap him credit Joe Gerardo hes just running out of the traps theyre trying to trap him in the corner and he can hes aware of that catches it and then hes on the move as soon as he catches it what a moment this could be for Joe Gerard trying to close out a game where he would could come back and beat his former team and if he makes this next foul shot he will hit 2000 career points 1652 of those scored in a Syracuse uniform and that is his 2000th Collegiate point and he does it in the dome special moment for Joe it really is and that ball did not even touch the rim Bell Syracuse needs this three and Bell delivers the orange cut it to five with 52 seconds Applause remaining now this has been a great back and forth game and our Saturday slate is loaded here on ESPN 6 Easter tonight Sonic Blockbuster Baylor and Kansas you dont want to miss it six eastern time so Joe Gerard and his return to the Dome 18 points against his former team a team he started four years for hes top 20 in program history and scoring at Syracuse now a proud member of the Clemson Tigers he said this week Ill be Syracuse for Life once this season is over Ill root for the orange but today its about going into the Dome getting a win these 2 seconds away from doing it yeah and Coach red ay said the same as well too I cheer for the young man Joe happy for him except today and certainly again he has been huge in their success on that previous play though nice little up fck by bellside a step and then make the three now you get a chance to set up your defense key thing if youre Syracuse deny Joe Gerard or try to get the ball out of his hands without fouling again thats easier said than done done the last two possessions uh hes done a nice job moving without the ball and then continuing his progress once he catches Applause it the Syracuse has gifted Clemson four points on Joe Gerard foul shots here on the previous two Applause possessions and I think the key right now A judment is faceu guarding Joe Gerard you got to switch on any screen and then try to keep the ball out of his hands chlin in trouble gets it into Hall hands off Gerard Clemson needs to get it over the line and they do with Hunter right to the rim scoop to the hoop Chase Hunter player to game in the second half right here again Chase Hunter the awareness we talked about their experience a lot of times guys would have pull this out he knows he has has the advantage of beautiful reverse layup and finish to put his team back up seven coming up next its TCU and Iowa state will get you to ases as soon as this one is done in Syracuse and Jay as we start talking about tournament resumés and teams that could potentially go on a run you got to start thinking about Clemson in that fashion again coming off a win on the road against North Carolina and then theyre following up against a very good Syracuse team putting on a really good team performance well they have shown that they can get wins on the road theyre deep theyre veteran this a very talented Clemson team 42 seconds away from escaping with another road win if youre Syracuse still some time you got to go quick yeah Ms doesnt have time Brown a deep three fell off the rim no good and a ton of time running off the clock looks like Syracuse is basically going to just let this one play out the 25 seconds came off the clock there yeah and really Gerard had the ball but it looks like Clemson is going to close this one out take a look at the numbers four players uh in double digits uh but if you look back at the tape uh Jay I think it was the dominance in the paint and also the rebounding uh you look at these final numbers and theyre going to be lopsided in favor of Clemson in those Applause areas right now 41 rebounds for Clemson to 24 for Applause Syracuse Syracuse down to their final 15 seconds and they turn it over so the orange came back and tied this game at 60 but then clemon found a second gear they finished the week with two big road wins in the ACC and win this 7768 48 points in the paint they dominated the glass it was an allaround team performance Clemson Is For Real a team that could potentially go on a deep NCAA tournament run clamson has helped their NCAA tournament resume this week a winning its number three North Carolina and then they take down Syracuse 7768 for our terrific crew Malcolm Huckabee Im Jay alter saying so long from Syracuse lets get you to as TCU
