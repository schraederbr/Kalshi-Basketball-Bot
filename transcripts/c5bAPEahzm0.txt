last year Elite eight the season before theyre six and 10 in conference play theyve lost five straight and coming off a 29o home loss to Duke Georgia Tech has dropped five out of six and the yellow jackets come off a 24o home loss to Clemson and we get an early whistle its a shot clock issue officials today Roger a Tony Henderson and Trey Stein Georgia Tech comes out in manto man we saw them this morning at shooter round playing against the Miami team defending a lot of uh ball screen action is going to be key in this game for Georgia Tech on the defensive side Miami runs a lot of actions with their bigs and guards omir knocks down the straightway three starting lineups for Georgia Tech The Freshman Nate George has cooled off a bit they really need to get see Reeves going again he struggled in his last five miles Kelly is the leading scorer hes got the ball now hes been feast or famine at times in conference oh I think the focus this morning uh for Damon stom iron staff ball movement he felt their guys were trying to do too much individually manto man he wants to see the ball swinging left to right and a lot more assisted buckets Reeves passed on the three drives on omir and Dongo knocked it out of bounds starting lineups for Miami Matthew Cleveland returns after missing the last game with an illness Nigel pack still out hes now missed three straight games with a knee injury and wga popler has scored in double figures and four straight but hes still playing through an ankle that he suffered back in December and there is benley Joseph now 11 of his last 21 from downtown well thats two threes for Miami and defending the threepoint line again Miami a team in particular with omir we talked about about his improved jumper although thats a beautiful set play and finish by Georgia Tech you talk about assisted buckets my goodness nice alley lob Dongo to the UMass transfer T far gari Kean George knocks down a three he needed to see that go in previous two games he was one for 11 this is a guy that Scout see as a big time Pro Prospect yeah and we have a couple Scouts here in the building uh this afternoon thats three threes for Miami and I think the key thing is theyre clean looks thats got to change Georgia Techs got to do a better job contesting the threepoint line kaasi Rees from the outside he had been just three of his last 16 from downtown and its interesting Georgia Tech has not shot the three ball well in its last five games Miami has struggled to defend the three in those and their last five early on both teams seem not to be missing much on the offensive side Miamis four for four as Poppers got five Jim Lena talks about uh popper as one of the more gifted athletes that hes ever coached there is Jim Lena last two seasons the two deepest runs in March in the history of Miami basketball yeah lead eight final four hall of fame coach I mean one of the best uh in the business really again a difficult team to match up against big thing this year though has been their health they just not been able to F the full team uh with their starting unit and also guys coming off the bench thats really been of the storyline for this Miami team reees straightway three got it kaasi reees has six he had been averaging only five a game over his last five he has got it going early thats a good sign Georgia Tech doesnt have a ton of offensive depth they need their top guys Kelly Reeves Dongo to play well Joseph misfires and here comes Kelly and you can hear the Georgia Tech coaches talking about ball movement swing it dont hold the ball dont let it stick and this is about as good a start as you can ask for on the road if youre Damon STM Miles Kelly to three George attack perfect for three from down and we get a foul on gari and this is all set up again excellent ball move but the balls going left to right thats not a bad de thats a guy though hitting a contested almost from the logo Dongo the block kapari down the Lane off the window too strong and this is where Miamis dangerous in transition Joseph catch release its tipped to Reeves and thats great blocking out that time by Georgia Tech omir again one of the best rebounders in college they had two bodies on him thats excellent job of Team rebounding against NORAD Kellys three too strong Jim Lena said his team is at its best when they defend re bound and then run two pretty clean looks that time by Miami just unable to knock down open looks a dribbling by Kelly d go setting the screen for George over to Reeves hes usually pretty good from the corner and now popler wants to push omir not there Miami has missed six in a row after making it first four and youll live with that if youre a Georgia Tech omir shooting a contested three I think thats the key thing the one he made earlier not contested you dont mind him shooting from the perimeter as long as thats contested Kelly running into some trees shoots over omir and Miles Kelly knocks it down fourth three of the game already for Georgia Tech yeah I mean thats a on fire for a six 67 to start this game off of for Georgia TCH and Miamis going to have to adjust too many open looks early on Cleveland answers no he can and Kelly knocked it out of bounds Georgia Tech see the problem has been theyve been unable to just practice as a unit let alone play uh as a healthy intact unit and that obviously as you said has been the story line for this Miami team and coming into today one of the stories was a Miami defense that struggled defending the three over the last five against a Georgia Tech team that has struggled making the three so far what gives well Georgia Tech is four for six from Deep yeah and its been off of good ball movement again uh they worked all shoot around swinging the ball running their sets both teams it seems like dont want to defend the threepoint line uh both teams are well over 40 from Beyond The Arc meanwhile Paul Joe B who started last game in place of Matthew Cleveland the Frenchman comes off the bench knocks off a threepointer and look at the ball movement again dribble drive and Pitch simple basketball thats something that coach Lara preaches again assisted baskets and thats a key to Miami he wants to see more of that from his team on the offensive side Reeves Miss fires tipped into the air its omir both teams have 14 points 12 of the 14 for both teams coming off threes and an thats twice now omir has tipped the ball to himself as we take a look at Matthew Cleveland but Im going to go back way a lot of these young folks dont understand how good Dennis Robin was but he was one of the few guys I saw that would tip rebounds to him two three times and omir weve seen that twice now in this game where hes tipped the ball to himself for a rebound good ball movement Kelly catch release in and out off offensive rebound and the lay in by taon Claude who led the socon in rebounding a season ago at Western Carolina and thats something that coach STM and staff talked about those plays right there Second Chance opportunities 5050 balls he felt like thats something that uh my team I was on them about you have to fight for those extra possessions early on I think theyre doing a pretty good job omir bowling balls to the rim went right at Claude not too sure uh how many people are going to be able to stop norch omir when he gets a full head of steam going down the lane Here Comes George pulls up left it way short might have been tipped Claude battling for the rebound it comes to Reeves Another Second Chance opportunity created by Claude heres sturen hes been one of the top sixth men in the ACC led to Georgia Tekken scoring the last two games knocked into the air Kelly bounces it on the floor tipped Joe Bay diving forward stolen away up ahead Kelly in front of the pack lays it in when you add up who wins the 5050 balls those hustle plays those are winning plays right there again it may seem like a little thing but guys are locked in trying to get those extra opportunities and thats something Damon Stein he was not happy about he did not me words about that but that has changed in this game right here their stur it knocks down the Triple George atch Five for 10 from threepoint land Jim Lena told us to shoot around part of whats been going wrong too many turnovers of late and George attack has not been a team that turns you over a ton good ball movement so far by the yellow jackets you can hear the Georgia Tech coaches continuing to tell their players keep moving the ball Sturdivant again for three airball Claude keeps it in bounds and I think we have an issue with the shot clock Music theyll look at the clock well step aside North Shadow Meir leading the way for Miami Tech doing it from distance after Wednesdays 24point loss to Clemson we asked him about his comments at shoot around earlier and he wanted to clarify he said look part of that is a reflection on me the teams that he had at Pacific he said were built on toughness and he felt there were times in that Clemson game where he didnt feel the compete level was at a high enough level for his liking and he felt that hey late in that game they gave up a little he didnt want to see that in his team he said thats a reflection of me it was a way to get through his team he probably wishes he could have chosen his words better but that was a message to his team I want to see you Pete I understood the message pretty clear and if anybody knows uh Damon STM and I played against Damon STM uh if youre a Georgia Tech fan or anybody associated with that uh Im happy that he is upset after a game like that because they have responded and that was more about as he said its a reflection of me at how hard they play and he felt like they were not competing you can see early on in this game they are responding uh they are matching the energy and then some against the Miami team Cleveland hits the midrange jumper on the other end Tara gari hit a three he had missed his previous 18 from three and in fact earlier this year during a shoot around for an opponent one of the players on that opposing team went to close out on the scout team player who was mimicking gafari and the coach blew the whistle and said no no no let him shoot were not defending that hes not going to make that thats got to be confidence booster for tari gari yeah its open looks I think thats the key thing youre absolutely right obviously thats huge but Im going back to the ball movement I think both these teams but in particular George and Tech but to start this game off uh theyre doing a great job swinging the ball you look at the assist uh in this game seven to seven both teams have seven assists in this game only three turnovers no omir in there for Miami lets if Georgia Tech tries to go inside Debo Coleman into the game for Georgia Tech he missed the last four with concussion related symptoms George from the corner right now Georgia Tech seems quicker to a lot of the loose balls Miami able to get this one back and Cleveland Glides in hes got six and one of the few 5050 balls of that Miami has come up with in Cleveland of the beneficiary that time clear path for the uncontested layup rebound by noo the big freshman Malcolm Miami already has more points in this first half than they did Wednesday against Duke aoko Miss fires Georgia Tech going to give him that shot all day yeah youll live with that again contested jumper thats where you want him shooting Coleman of three Georgia Tech seven threes in this first half theyve got 10 field goals in all all set up a great ball movement every time that ball is not sticking a less than a second that Balls either shot or theyre swinging the ball excellent offense early by Georgia Tech George with a deep three both teams have taken more than half their shots from Beyond The Arc for Georgia Tech 16 of their 22 shot attempts are threes make it 17 out of 23 and the friendly roll for George this is a Georgia Tech team thats had its struggles on offense theyve been below 70 points and five straight as we get a whistle but 11 of 23 from the field eight of 17 from three it has been a threepoint exec right here great ball movement extra pass both teams hot from Beyond The Arc and on the other end George with the answer 40 years ago Wake Forest not long ago knocked off Duke at Lawrence Joel Coliseum Kyle filipowski appeared to get injured during the ensuing Court storm and wake began the day as not just one of the first four out but Joe lardys first team out this puts them safely in the tournament field for now and you would think barring no bad losses the rest of the way a win against Duke it gives wake another quad one win their second of the Year this should make wake fans feel pretty good absolutely no doubt and I think it goes to the strength of this ACC conference but as were going to take a look at theyre going to go review this uh but the filipowski news to me somethings got to be done about the court storming again I love the college atmosphere I love that students are into it but thats a dangerous situation we caught a little bit of it where you have students really uh unimpeded running out onto the court as other players are trying to get off it was bound to happen now the video of filipowski getting hurt thats going to be the college basketball ziger film in the coming days its going to be analyzed and dissected did every which way right now the officials officials went to the monitor to see if that foul on Wugga popper was anything more than a common foul and they say nope basketball play Common foul only the first team foul on Miami veteran crew and I love it where they take one look at it make an assessment and then play on excellent job by the refs not taking a whole lot of time at the monitor Miami always looking to push George the trailer lines up a three and Kean George with his third triple hes got nine and Damon St talked to us at shootaround transition D was going to be key you cant run any better that time by Miami uh Cave the defense in throw it back out for a wide openen three excellent transition offense by Miami Dongo with the size Advantage heres the double Dongo the fade he has gotten exponentially better with his low poost moves through the course of this season key thing again uh you take a look at Damon sterm staff led by assistant Carl Hobs they do a great job working with these young players benley Joseph hits the three and dangos got a pretty good assistant coach to work with on those post moves and bonsy Wells as Miles Kelly drills it from Deep bony Wells one of the better to do it in that post area mid post low post and we saw him out there in shoot around running around he looks like he can still go get a double double Kean George with 11 his previous two games he had scored a total of two points was one for 11 from the field remember he had that ankle injury against Virginia that was the start of a fivegame losing streak for Miami its easy to see why NBA Scouts and execs are so excited about this young player hes got all the physical tools great shot but right there I think thats the area uh where he continues to get better driving the ball in traffic Cleveland playing defensive back driving on George wild shot and he gets the foul and Cleveland is down momentarily on the Baseline and Cleveland still down his teammates huddled around him Miami has just not able ble to escape the injury bug this season Nigel pack out today with a knee packs dealt with a back an ankle Cleveland missed the last game after food poisoning every starter has missed at least one game and Nigel pack obviously uh not having him there again its just been that type of season for Coach l and his staff as you take a look at Nigel pack right there in Street close and you know just unable to practice uh and again thats hurt obviously All Phases defensively offensively to have any really uh continuity uh just really a tough situation to coach and Huck Miamis never been a team that likes to go nine 10 Deep Jim lgas always featured a tight rotation so when you add injuries to it and now youre playing guys who probably dont factor into your rotation you get exposed pretty quickly and thats whats happened yeah hes playing some young guys that uh quite honestly he wasnt planning on playing a lot of minutes and the only good thing about that is is theyre gaining valuable experience uh but certainly a team that the previous two seasons Elite uh getting Elite eight and then final four uh uh you know certainly uh hurts the expectations coming in when your key guys have been out for extended time Matthew Cleveland got off to such a terrific start this season and last eight games production down hes only averaging about nine a game prior to that he was averaging more than 16 game and we talked with Coach L about uh Clevelands progress he said look similar to what a lot of guys have been dealing with when hes been healthy hes felt like hes had a really solid season hes been playing through some injuries and certainly that has impacted his production the Frenchman Jo Bay back in there is he now in Jim Lenas circle of trust heres George over to Joseph lays it in for two Miami is lethal in transition and thats a heads up play by George again a lot of young players would have held on to that ball try to hold it too long and make a play for themselves saw Joseph going up gave it up early excellent play that time by The Freshman kishan George a fourpoint lead for Miami in a game thats featured eight ties and six lead changes already Dongo with a nice move down low so impressive of seeing Dongo again he showed you the turnaround jumper that time size Advantage dont settle spin move to the Baseline soft finish topper from Deep thats the eighth three for Miami and theyve made five straight from the field well 409 uh left in this game excuse me little under four minutes and both these teams may have uh over 10 threes in the first half Miamis got more points today than they had in the Virginia game over 40 minutes stur it doubled and that Baseline serves as a third Defender George leans in Nate George the freshman first freshman to pass the 100 assist Threshold at Georgia Tech since Aman schumpert back in the 0809 season and George gets fouled itll be on Miles Kelly both Team game summary so far Miles Kelly and the Freshman kesan George Leading The Way for their respective teams both teams lights out from three yeah you look at Georgia Tech their last five games only 27 from the threepoint line uh today uh 50 nine of 18 and Miami eight of 14 from the threepoint line both teams doing a great job moving the ball in transition or in their half court sets Georgia Tech came into the game only averaging about eight threes a game a little less than eight threes Miami came in in conference play giving up about 10 a game and its still just the first half two teams that have had their issues of late offensively yeah they really have right now though Miami man to man theyre switching anything any ball screen or down screens of theyre switching one through five third of it step back on omir rebound Joseph Bley Joseph had lost his starting job to K George as we get a foul but injuries have forced him back into the lineup especially with pack out stur picks up the foul and and that last play right there an sums up the versatility of omire he switches out onto a guard sturd it forces him into a contested three or jump shot and then beats everybody down the court for a post up omir over Dongo too much Jim Lara has said NORAD as the green light bring the ball up on a fast break a lot of trust in the big man stur ofan smooth and thats all set up by George again uh hon STM one of the better point guards to do it a long NBA career coached in the NBA coached in college and now at Georgia Tech but the growth of George underneath him thats a beautiful dribble drive and dis by The Freshman point guard popler the pull up Damon statamire message to George has been hey be careful about wasting your energy get other guys involved Dont Force It as cliche as it sounds Let The Game come to you shot fake by sturdivan the block by Joseph Dongo swings it to Kelly and the three is good 11 threes in the opening half for Georgia Tech Kellys got four of them hes got a game high 14 Second Chance opportunities again they be Miami to those loose balls and uh again the message received that was given by their head coach George gets free hes got 16 thats his fourth Music three if you had seen these teams over the last couple of weeks you wouldnt think offense was an issue both teams pouring it on 4945 a minute left opening half Dongo off balance theres George again 16 points five assists for kesan George Joe Bay right through everybody I think he was surprised by how open he was Jim L winced at the other end Joe B had an open layup and couldnt make it I think he was waiting for somebody to pick him up I mean he faked the dribble hand off and then went right down the lane nobody with him just missed the Applause layup timeout Jim Lena 29 seconds to go in a high scoring opening half if what a massive win it is for Wake Forest but its going to be about court storming its going to be about the health of Kyle filipowski John shy was heated in his postgame press conference and basically said when are we going to ban Court storming and he also revealed that Phil palowski has a sprained ankle and this could be the moment again its not listen I love the college atmosphere make no mistake about it cant have guys getting injured after a game Cleveland beats the shot clock and it spins out final tick stur it lets it Fly and the first half comes to an end Miami had been struggling offensively Georgia Tech had been struggling offensively the guy Don sheer for Yukon that was a little ahead of him that time but ratio flashes oh kapari thunder coming down the tracks first five minutes of the second half coaches talk about that how do you come out thats pretty good right there with authority down the lane Monster Jam Kean George 16 points five assists in the opening half Josephs three raises the rim Kelly with 14 in the first half to lead Georgia Tech he lines up a deep three give him 17 his fifth triple well Damon STM may have Ray Allen come and speak to his team every game moving forward if they keep shooting this way my goodness Ray Allens about to be on payroll George down the lane Euro Step rebound capari bounce pass up ahead to Reeves Fast Break of the year pass of the Year nominee you cannot thread the needle any better than that right there my goodness that might be the transition play of the year right there by Rush the shot Reeves diving for it back to Cleveland fresh 30 theyll say Georgia Tech had possession and poppler fouled on the drive kapari picks up his third well you cannot run a offense any better right here down the lane with authority and then right here transition break of the year right here one pass that led to a uncontested dunk my goodness you talk about threat in the needle Kari stays in there with the three fouls 70 Georgia Tech run to begin the half Joseph denied 15 of Georgia Techs 20 baskets have been assisted Kelly on the drive 19 for him and a timeout by Jim Lena as Georgia Tech opens the second half with a blitz a 90 run out of the chasing Syracuse which won today against Notre Dame theyre a couple of games behind Syracuse in the Lost column and the orange have the headtohead win against Miami yeah and I think obviously the key thing with Miami their heal uh Nigel pack again out today uh one of the better guards not just in the ACC but in college basketball and again you have to start thinking about trying to get your guys healthy uh going into the ACC tournament if youre Jim leega on the other end Georgia Tech you have to be pleased if youre Damon stym your guys have responded when youve challenged them about their energy and effort but that question has been answered in particular in that first half really did a phenomenal job and then to start off the second half Tech coming off a 24o home loss to Clemson Miami coming off a 29o home loss to Duke no Cleveland or pack in that game omir on Dongo knocked out of bounds by The Freshman well Nate George lucky on that screen oh that time thats on his big hes talking to dang hes got to call that screen he ran right into norat omir and a lot of times the expression running into the wall is thrown out thats what its like when you run in to NORAD omir that thing is not moving oms been quiet today just five points for to shoot popper gives it up Joseph has to put it up and Miami still without a basket still without a point in the second half and great job of blocking out that time by Dango Kelly feeling it just short theres popler and theres Miamis first field goal and first points of this second half degree of difficulty off the charts that time by popler my goodness in transition weaving through two guys and then weird angle was able to get it to go off the glass par no good from three hes now missed 19 of his last 20 from three George against George and the foul and if that is gari thats number four but they say its on Nate George his second and again look at this right here we through two look at the angle eyes on the rim the entire time thats great concentration and body control and back to what coach L says about popper hes one of the more gifted athletes that hes coached and you can see right there with that body control and athleticism on display in transition a young man who really only started playing basketball seriously as a high school sophomore was a big baseball player before that Joseph on the drive good defense by Applause gari sturdivan the love for Dongo with a throw down my goodness Dongo with the elbows Above the Rim and thats a beautiful find by Sturman and transition omir using the shot fake Joe Bay from the outside they call him the French Connection what a pass though by omir shot fake dribble drive and then kick it out looking like a guard excellent read that time by NAD omir pop by Doyle and cloudy Russo would be proud Reeves for three too strong Miami can tie with a two Joseph rejected by gari stur of it keeps it in bounds what a recovery and hustle to keep that ball alive and in play of for Georgia Tech Safara gari has played a really strong allaround game today and thats the key word all around on both ends hes been impactful down low its Dongo Music popper is fouled by Kelly with the injuries and guys playing through injuries it Zapped some of their offensive Firepower well I think the biggest thing has been as you said earlier defensively they been unable to defend look even with the injury as we take a look at an and one situation as Georgia Tech continues uh to attack that time Coleman Debo Coleman with the n one right here again dont settle for to jumper take the contact and then finish thats a strong move uh by Coleman right there but the inability to get your core unit together on both ends you tell you could tell look and obviously anytime you lose a guy like Nigel pack as theyve had in this stretch thats a big piece to be missing offensively of for Miami that free throw was Georgia Techs first attempt of the game and Tech with its largest lead of the afternoon 6154 Poppers three not there he gets his follow and a foul on the floor theyll get kapari and thats going to be four right now Georgia Tech up seven and you take a look at some of these numbers both teams shooting the ball well from the threepoint line Georgia Tech 50 12 of 24 Joe Bay the drive the lob and there is omir only a seventh point of the night well theyve done a good job of Georgia Tech uh doubling him but then also keeping him off the offensive glass in this second half Reeves squares up and hits well the assist rate for Georgia Tech and thats the key something both coaches talked with us about extensively this morning at shootaround they wanted to see more of that right there dribble drive and kick out assisted baskets poppers three in and out well that assist rate right now Huck 18 assists on 25 made baskets popler to omir no foul now they say jump ball possession arrow Miami this is just a great recovery right here popper with the nice pass to omir thats a great recovery in are you sure that was a jump ball or a foul Im not sure but nonetheless thats a great recovery but omir showing off the strength and hes starting to get more aggressive down low we didnt see that early on and I think if youre a Georgia Tech you got to send somebody at him again when hes isolated like that barely down hes so strong tomorrows ACC Network womens basketball games you got number 19 Notre Dame taking on BC UNC at eighth ranked Virginia Tech and six ranked NC State makes the short trip to Duke omir missed them both came in as a 77 free throw shooter best Mark of his career George to Claude kicks it out to stent and foul against Miami theyre going to get Joe Bay popper is down on the ground its been that kind of season for Miami and now wiga popper limping when youre great walking around uh unassisted certainly again when he went down looked a lot worse so again good to see that young man up walking around lets hope hes able to go back in this game for Miami Christian Watson number three into the game for popper Deo Coleman makes it a 10point lead largest of the game for Tech and Ive been impressed with how Coleman has attacked again not settling for jumpers that time again a nice little shot fake and then dribble Drive soft touch with the runner lot of dribbling by Joe Bay six to shoot Watson offensive rebound Joe Bay a lot of stagnation on offense right now Jim Lena preaches five make a decision within five tense of getting the ball either shoot pass or drive and create what theyre doing right now obviously with uh popper on the bench and hes about ready to come back into the game they were trying to post up omir credit Georgia Tech they were almost doubling shading guys towards him and forcing somebody else to shoot the ball three offline for George and popper is at the scores table omir down low gets his own Miss Joseph for three and Claude wrestles The Rebound away great job on the defensive glass that time by CLA Coleman tip back Reeves and a second chance bucket for Georgia Tech all the 5050 balls have gone in favor of Georgia Tech in this game its a big reason why theyre up 12 right now theyre doing a great job defensive and offensive glass any loose balls of theyre coming up with them and thats a direct result of their energy and effort the timeout was by Georgia Tech 122 Run for the yellow jackets whove outscored Miami 23 to S since halftime and a lot was made over the last few days of Damon statam Myerss comments following the loss to Clemson the cliffnotes version that folks ran with was when statam said when I get my guys up in here its going to be different when we talked to Damon statamire before the game he said listen what I was trying to say he probably used a poor choice of words but he said what I was trying to get out was I felt this was a reflection of me my teams dont play like this he felt that they didnt have enough fight they didnt have enough didnt have enough effort against Clemson well theyve come out with the type of energy and the type of fight that he wants to see from his teams today and Ill say it again if youre a Georgia Tech fan you want that from your coach do you want to to be happy after uh getting uh really embarrassed against a Clemson team with no effort or fight or do you want him calling guys out holding them accountable and it looks like obviously theyve receive that message and they come out a different team uh this afternoon on the road against Miami ball is stuck behind the backboard I finally get it down now the other thing he was joking about with us was hey so many times you get coach speak you get guys who speak in generalities they dont tell you anything and he tries to be honest I had no issue whatsoever again him trying to tell his team look its a reflection of me you play and he wants them to play more like how theyve done tonight on the road against Miami the foul is on the floor before the shot its on benley Joseph Georgia Tech shooting 59 from the field in the second half while Miami is just three of 19 Reeves has the spin out Nei team is hit from deep in the second half after shooting lights out from three in the first half Tex two for nine Miamis one for 11 from three Here Comes Watson strong Drive basket is good plus the foul for Christian Watson but this is tough right here nice screen by omir clear the path take the hit and one and again its its all set up by their spacing Miami did a great job spacing the floor using omir as the screener so often guys get open and a little talked about the screening thats a great screen that time by omir the free up Watson Watson missed the free throw and well get a foul now on benley Joseph right now Miami changing up the defense again uh trailing 10 908 to go theyre going to extend the pressure here see if they can force Georgia Tech into some turnovers yeah Techs got two pretty good ball handlers on the floor in stur of an and to George essentially two point guards the 6 fo8 George marking sturen George has been quiet in the second half Kelly open drills it 22 for Miles Kelly his eighth 20point game of the season best Ive seen Georgia Tech play in terms of spacing the floor dribble drive and Pitch out again you cant do it any better uh suck into defense and then throw to a wide open shooter in the corner excellent half court offense by Georgia Tech and well get a foul on Kelly defending George down low his third this is what we saw in shoot around they drilled it again draw three kick to the corner uh you cannot do it any better unselfish and I think the key thing in this game that everybody on the court for Georgia Tech has been unselfish with the ball Georgia Tech assisting on 71 of its baskets and George misses the free throw Miamis missed six of its last seven from the field only nine points in the second half kanes had a fourpoint lead at the break and we get a foul as Dongo able to draw the foul on George and thats set up again theyre switching so that time again omir switches off and thats great recognition by Georgia Tech to go right back at George whos guarding Dongo giving up a lot of size and again been impressed with how George Tech has been patient and then theyve gone at the matchups that favor them in this game T to shoot Stans been one of the top reserves in the ACC this year hell launch two canes went for the rebound almost turned it over and now lets see if Miami can push popper deep three got it wga popler hes got a dozen Reeves beats the defense down at the other end and thats there again if Miami is going to pressure you you that time no safety back miscommunication and really Miami with this lineup they have really five guards out on the court popler swoops in here comes Kelly and the pull up three is good a 25 for Miles Kelly who is seven of 10 from three 15 for 32 from the threepoint line of for Georgia Tech 47 my goodness they have shot the ball really well Joseph drops it off to Watson 15 threes for Georgia Tech matches a season High the school record 18 set against Syracuse last season and I think its how theyve gotten him and the quality of looks theyve all been assist and theyve all been almost wide open off of excellent ball movement or in transition a tech team that came in having lost five out of six George beats the shot clock missed the shot Cleveland will trigger the break popler nearly lost his balance George looking for his first to the second half out to Cleveland good look doesnt go cant ask for a better look nice pass that time by George pop wide open Dongo to Kelly blocked by George stur it lead rebound George Joseph hits from three basically put the team on his back in that game even though it was a loss and again today he has been nothing short of outstanding and I think its uh how poised hes been in this game I think thats the key thing look you know hes a high volume scorer he hasnt forced it today no and a guy that tested the NBA Waters as we look at a 10c call excellent energy that time coming up with a turnover and I think thats been the story of this game again Miami a team obviously battling through injuries they got a lot of guys out but credit Georgia Tech again they were the more energetic or energetic team thus far in this game its been that way since the opening tip George tied up and jump ball is the call possession arrow to Georgia Tech and George thought he got fouled I like this change up though by coach Lara again pressure the ball see if you can get this thing up and down and then get Georgia Tech into some turnovers this time they get it across so now you get it across half court youve used up about half the shot clock Kelly down the lane off balance and it rolls out the tip by Dongo no Applause Cleveland popler the trailer crowd was ready to erupt thats a pretty good look in transition and again thats where Miami wants to be theyre so good in transition not a bad look that time for popper both teams have attempted more three the twos Dongo has it taken away and Roger a says its going to be Miami ball Tony Henderson the official underneath the basket was right there wanted help Roger Ayers says going the other way and with this lineup Miami the smaller lineup I like that move by a Georgia Tech going to Dango again hes got some size let him operate are you surprised omir and crunch time is on the bench well I think because theyre pressing again they a five really call it a four guards in a wing out on the court Joseph on the drive Watson shot fakes the three down the lane and a foul is call as Dongo tried to make the emphatic block under four media timeout Georgia Tech with an eightpoint lead Miami trying to avoid a sixth straight loss this NC tournament last season uh in the final four losing to Yukon the eventual Champion but its been a challenge this year obviously uh dealing with all the injuries and if you take a look at this game 345 to go chance to cut this deficit the six one out of two for Watson loose ball and its knocked out of bounds to Georgia Tech so free throws sometimes can be an entry point back into a game Miami 5 for 10 from the line one for six in the second half yeah tough obviously its been a struggle but the Press is giving Georgia Tech problems and Trey steinon says last touch kaasi Reeves ball F again if youre Georgia Tech uh you know look Miami theyre going to be aggressive in this game right now trying to get back into it down seven got to take better care of the ball if youre Georgia Tech a basket here makes it a twopossession game Watson lets it Fly offensive rebound by George 20 Joseph gets the two 7671 Reeves has his pass picked Cleveland the Applause lane itll stay with the canes Georgia Tech right now having issues breaking the Press again right here if youre George you got to come to the ball right there again youre going away from it not great spacing against the pressure and another turnover Miami in the midst of an 80 run pop to Joseph Cleveland is open Cleveland hits Miami within three George gets it Music across gets tied up but they will say a foul benley Joseph picks up his third lets see right here again now hard to tell from that angle again Roger As one of the best right here in good position yeah he got some arm he definitely got some arm right there and hes right in position I think thats the key thing where the ref is positions hes right on top of that he had the best angle and right now again if youre Miami Georgia Tech with 703 to go Le 7663 they have not scored since then that was the sixth team foul on Miami one more Tech they got to get touch I think thats where they need to go again smaller lineup play through him five to shoot Kelly hoists Dongo it hits the rim it doesnt go Miami can tie with a Applause three George had 16 all in the first half omir not on the floor Watson the turnaround it doesnt go gari back in with those four fouls hes been a Difference Maker today pop nearly stole it entry pass Dongo in traffic Georgia Tech ball tend to shoot well theyre switching Miami one through five really they got all guards out on the court in Wings if youre Georgia Tech again continue to go back through Dango and forc Miami to double Georgia Tech has not scored in 5 and a half minutes they turn it over and for Damon sts team this has been a microcosm of the season the ability or rather the inability to close out games yeah credit though Miami again theyve been very active with this lineup if youre George te you got to be stronger with the ball on that possession right now if youre Miami you do not need a three obviously in this Applause situation George against George freshman on freshman now gari picks up George on the S switch Joseph for the tie air ball and Nate George feathers this in line and now pushes it across Nate George has made some big baskets late in games for Georgia Tech we get a timeout by Damon stoutmire remember in that overtime win against Clemson George hit the two big three a kapari and also Dango those are the two guys if Im Georgia Tech Im going right at those two let them get a touch play your offense through them and then Force Miami to make a decision double or leave those guys alone omir went out with about 8 minutes to go has not come back into the game 15 to shoot less than a minute to play Georgia Tech nurses a threepoint lead Kellys got 25 George takes it away Watson couldnt hold on to it stur of it carals Applause and sturdivan is fouled that will be a one and one for Georgia Tech and pal Stan is an 87 free throw shooter yeah both teams missed opportunities right there Watson in transition unable to secure the ball and on the previous possession Georgia Tech turned it over so both teams really sloppy with the ball 405 seconds left Georgia Tech at the line with an opportunity to is to eight excuse me to five again Georgia Tech LED 7663 with 703 to go in the second half no points over the last 6 minutes and 23 seconds stur it will try to end that spell front end of a one and one and omir back into the game for Miami two possession game with that free Applause throw fivepoint lead for Tech Georgia Tech will pick up Miami full court now they back off still have to get into your offense quick Miami popler catch release no good omir tips it back to Joseph Cleveland for three in and out omir another rebound Joseph lines it up and hits twopoint Game Advance it but you do have time to go for the one steal it was a made basket so Kelly can run the Baseline Georgia Tech out of timeouts they get it to sturen Miami does not foul right away sturen is fouled now George picks up number four and if youre Damon statamire this is the guy you want shooting these free throws as omir gets ready to check in for the canes you said it again inbounding the ball and then its going to come down to free throws Miami has one timeout left itll be a one and one for sturen teams work on these end of game situations down two down three team at the free throw line you typically have a play set up you want to run to get a two or a three now if he misses this one do you foul youre Georgia Tech most teams say yes it depends on the coach Ive seen it really 5050 down the line this is the key one right here though for Georgia Applause Tech Two possession game s seconds popper Baseline drive it doesnt go it comes back to George he launches time expires Georgia Tech gets the road win at Miami the yellow jackets did not
