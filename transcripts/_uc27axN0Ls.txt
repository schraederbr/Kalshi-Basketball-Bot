starting lineup man hes uh over the last eight games playing really well 31st made pre of the season for Zack Austin and that leads the team the red shirt senior from Winston Salem North Carolina Tigers six and one in the ACC Zachary pumps up a three ball doesnt get the bounce Austin the clearance right now pits cover the boards well theyre playing with a little bit of desperation coach C said

lock and knocked it to Zachary match up to watch Zachary is low so far Zachary nice defensive possession on Zachary into the paint shovels to Applause shefflin sends it back out to Wiggins a few feet behind the line Leed comes out of The Fray Panthers trying to avoid the turnovers almost had one there they had 17 the season high in the loss of Florida State R to work inside for two cam Corin the Florida state transfer big body down there nice start for him getting getting off a to a good start against a big fell from Russia Victor Lock in the leading shot Blocker in the conference almost lost the handle Diaz R poked it away right here taking his time nice shoulder to the chess good D but just better offense nice hook shot Locka maybe could have jumped a little bit and affected that shot waren averag is just over 10 points per game and almost six rebounds that is Tops on the team in rebounding Zachary slashing corn might have got a piece of it back to shefin and now Hunter bounces out to Austin offensive rebound to a three that usually goes in Lucky break for pit right there trying to attack the rim passing tight quarters corn couldnt handle it Hunter pulls up for a three and knocks it down this is a 50 4090 guy you cannot back up when hes coming down off transition that is a buffet a layup as we would call it hes got 46 F threes now John that is the best on the tiger roster and by percentage hes the best threepoint shooter in the ACC yes Graham took the tumble leged midrange Shing the rebound Ram right there drove back into the traffic low drove down the middle and kicked it out hes got to either shoot that or go the other way theres already defenders in the middle loin tries a three and he hits it Ive watched this kid at Cincinnati hes so underrated skillwise shows you right there hitting that three at the top of the key lockin shoots 32 from Beyond The Arc hes just made his 11th three of the season coming off a 106 rebound performance at Georgia Tech and a win last week for the Tigers he was 0 for four on threepointers in that game against Georgia Tech has one today against pit leged Baseline Austin show and go down the lane looking for the twohanded jam loing contested Diaz as Graham its a three hit has came to play today that was a highlevel block meet me at the top right there for Clemson blocking tried to contest the move by Austin down the lane and then Diaz Graham knocked down a three for the Panthers what action at the Pete twopoint game a lot of basketball connections around y JB is a former assistant as well for those Charlotte Bobcats teams Clemson in the white Pit in the blue Chase Hunter has the basketball averages over 17 points per game that is best on the team for the Tigers shot clock at 10 locken trying to operate on the Block stepping into the paint bounces out oh over the top Corin for the rebound its all over the glass I think they heard me in that rebound stat when they get out rebounded they usually dont win so far they are leading in the rebound category Corin led the team with nine rebounds in the loss at Florida Applause State that is out of bounds and it will stay with the Panthers well coming up next on CW Courtside Saturday Maxine Renault and the Stanford C Cardinal heading to Chapel Hill face RJ Davis in North Carolina CW Courtside Saturday Stanford North Carolina coming up next John on the CW its going to be a tough match up for my tar Hills I dont think people are expecting Stanford to come in there but they played really well early on against uh Wake Forest tar Hills have won four games in a row Renault is a leading scorer and rebounder in the ACC first year in the conference for Stanford along with SMU and Cal at the end of the shot clock shefin deflected in Chase Hunter John playing in his 152nd college basketball game its a lot of college basketball an amazing career amazing career they try to Loop it inside it goes out of bounds and that is Panther basketball side note too something to watch chlin is dealing with a little bit of a sore back hes been nursing it all week hes been banged up coach is taking him out first so maybe trying to get a little little rest for him for the minutes hes been playing lately having a quick chat with Brad Brownell in his 15th season four trips to the NCAA tournament including the regional finals last year also went in 2021 2018 and 2011 for Coach Brownell the most wins in school history 278 low locking rebound is so Shifty man he fools Zachary which is hard to do out there defensively Wiggins lost the handle now the officials are talking about it hold on a second Lamar Simpson Eric Lewis trying to decide whose ball it is and I think they made the right choice Eric Lewis me and have me and him have had a few uh skirmishes 100 hes gave me a tech before but wait he came by to say hello to you yeah you look convers its the game but yeah me me and Eric uh weve had some uh heated conversations to say the least its my guy though its my guy its all pleasantries this afternoon with John sitting at the broadcast table court side here on CWs presentation of ACC basketball Papa amadu kti has committed the game number four in blue hes got the basketball right now high energy guy Coach T loves what he brings to the team coming off the bench this is low bit a mismatch pan somehow got it back Damen Dunn is in there as well into the shock CLX for Leed for three not a prolific threepoint shooter but if he gets that three going watch out it could be a long night for Clemson over 3 minutes without scoring for the Tigers Leed had the rebound off the Miss shot from Zachary three ball right here for leged nice jab get Zach kind of lean a little bit shoots the three in Rhythm Ill let you guys translate what he said he came here to play I love the intensity its kind of giving me chills Tom just being out being on the sideline man this is an intense game right here for both teams well the Panthers certainly know the meaning of this game trying to stop a three game is losing streak they had one five in a row prior to that the tigers are 6 and one behind Duke at the top of the standings in the ACC the metrics say this is a pretty even match up so this is an important win for resume building in the postseason Hunter oo launching way behind the line John one of the one of the best Shooters if not the best threepoint shooter by percentage in the ACC hes showing us right now why he has at Theo its been all threepointers so far for the Tigers after Hunter hit that long distance three oh Los got to be a little more cautious with the ball kind of relax a little bit and HRA got the steal blocking thought about seeing up a Applause three Hunter trying to direct some traffic hit has to come in a little bit and try to make him pass this is a mismatch right here Hunter again scrapes the Rapters low tried to get it on the Baseline and he was bumped that was Dylan Hunter younger brother of Chase who just hit a three second of The Game Hunter saw the first one go in so you know hes feeling good right here the hesy pull get your Defender stuck in Quicks sand and raay nice move he tried that again against the big fell I would like to to attack a little more and break down a defense with a big guy on him with a mismatch both of these teams will make threes and stack them up Panthers average almost nine threes per game fourth in the conference and the tigers are third in the conference they make just over nine per game nowhere to go for Dunn has to send it back out to the perimeter shefflin has the rebound hes back into the game for the Tigers Forge Diaz Graham also in the lineup right now brother of Applause Deo tyght d by Austin on Hunter around the perimeter shefin Nifty little pass inside tried to get it back off the Mist couldnt do it might have Bend but dont break by the pit defense Diaz Graham cut off on the Baseline by Dylan Hunter had a really good game last game just quter State H some big time threes to keep them in it late yeah he made four and threeo John and had 15 points in the second half well take a timeout its a twopoint lead for the Panthers on their home floor CW Courtside Saturday settling a little bit early on this Pittsburgh defense is tightening their vices all the points from threepoint baskets so far two from Chase Hunter for the Tigers win against Georgia Tech on the road on Tuesday 70 to 59 they made eight threepointers in that game on 23 tries Dylan Hunter calculates the angle off the backboard and scores nice fade off the glass I dont think people understand how hard that is that is a tough shot he made look very easy Junior guard Dylan Hunter number two and white struggled in that game at Georgia Tech John two points four rebounds 20 minutes off the bench may be looking to get back pick well Clemsons alltime assisted turnover ratio leader dun will fall away rattle out then Hunter comes away with it Damien Dunn the transfer from Temple also played at Houston when his Collegiate travels dlan Hunter around the edge shefflin triple team he sent it to Zachary in the corner and he hits it draw the defense Swing Swing the hockey assists by shefin kicking it out Zacharys been shooting it well hes having 14 over his last five games hes coming to his own after transferring from Boston College first three

look Zachary keeps it alive Hunter time out pitch on that is what we talked about offensive rebounding Clemson is slowly closing that Gap and we all know when this offensive rebound kicked out to a three perfect opportunity to shoot a shot Hunter made that shot after half the blast right here just nice Hustle by Zachary on the freshman KS to set his feet wide open shot hes going to hit most of those that is now an 110 Run for the Music Tigers just a second ago in a blink John pit had a twopoint lead and now its a sixpoint lead for Clemson coach capable talked to us yesterday in practice about how he just you know they play Super they play so well I mean they have these lapses now all of a sudden theyre down six points the hit series Hall Amer ameran returns for its seventh season Same Heart same dream new rivalry All American season premiere Monday February 5th 87 Central here on the Music CW saw the threepoint shooting stats so far for the body of work for the entire season the Panthers are fifth in the ACC at 36 from threepoint real estate look like coach capist went big right here got two Big Fellas in how about the pass by leot and the Finish By Corin to the free throw Applause line nice twoman game right here screen and roll physical screen gets it inside finishes Zachary reaching he likes to steal the ball but right here Cohen just too strong much needed two points for this pit team whos been on a little bit of a scoring drought Applause 66 from the line on the season for Corin Panthers are the best free throw shooting team in the ACC 79 as a team and whos second Clemson 78 comes down to free throws those statistics could be a factor the two best from the strike in the ACC shefflin in the paint low got a piece of it Leed came in to help as well leg gets it back settles things down for a moment Corin and sheelin Corin wins the fight looks like coach C is like hey look lets get inside lets score the ball we need to get some easy shots putting the emphasis on calling getting the shot inside pull up Zachary and he was fouled on the chumper Freshman might have been a little too aggressive Brandon Cummings and I think hes going to come out now hes made some crucial mistakes let Zach get offensive rebound and then the end one hell learn from this and uh come back and play some more minutes in the second half potentially Applause threepoint play for Zachary youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands Pittsburgh has to keep a spot on who just came in h Brier hes shooting almost 50 from three make sure they put an emphasis on running him off the line yeah hes a guy whos made 135 career threepointers after two years at Air Force into the Clemson program he wears number three trying to contest the shot weak side Diaz Graham Deo in the lineup right now this is Leed against Hunter speed on speed drops it for Corin where did that pass come from John nice dump off to Corin kind of underhand scoop Bs been effective down low Pittsburgh has to keep doing that but woo Dylan Hunter with a three at the other end it feels like John as soon as we mentioned cson shooting 27 they have cranked up the intensity one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the conference pit has to have empal running them off the line right now justre feeling it try to Loft it into Corin able to volleyball it around Hy breeder got tangled up with cor and picked up the foul right here little little dump off for the Finish nice nice little scoop and then we got the threepointer back right here that hurts man if youre running te just had a tight a shot inside a double double four years they they could use a guy like that on this team right now wrong his number will go to the rafters see if P keeps having an emphasis getting the ball Applause inside bounced off on the Miss from leget dont know if Coach K wanted a midrange ISO jumper coming out of a timeout Wiggins TR to back it down on Corin Wiggins itll jump hook and a soft touch good Patience by Wiggins hes kind of Cl his xfactor when he plays well their ceiling as a team Applause increases Panthers trying to snap that threegame losing streak a loss of Florida State home against Louisville and also at Duke has zero points hes got to start getting more aggressive hes their second leading scorer they need him to start getting to the rack and maybe creating some stuff for his teammates this is a step back from leged for Applause three legot looks like hes going to take on the offensive role until low kind of figures it out he struggled early in the in the Florida State game until he figured it out late in the second half second year in the panther program for Leed after three years at the University of Rhode Island hide breeder thats his specialty cannot leave him open hes hes making one out of every two threes essentially this year cant let him see air space 17th May three on the season for Jake Hy breeder 48 from Beyond The Arc the transfer from Air Force low creating space against Dylan Hunter theres some of that aggression that we talked about he needs to start getting more aggressive when his Clon team quits this game to where maybe Ps going to struggle to come back so low is into the box score Hunter the other way hes got a three with a scissor kick John that was that was an NBA shot coming off the screen setting your feet raising on balance 50490 guy got to get out there his third three of the game and the Tigers have made their last five shots Austin misses fight on the weak side Wiggins appeared to be the last to touch it see the offensive pressure starting to mount for Pittsburgh leg of three the James Haren double step back right there he made that famous and also made that not a travel just making sure he was behind the line back to low these attack great for his teammates right here or take a shot there he goes right there deep B of the shot clock good shot from good shot he got an open threepoint shot in the corner off the Applause drive Panthers now three of 10 on threepoint tries Wiggins thats a deep three Leed the kick done the gathered dribble Diaz Graham on the weak side it goes out of bounds and that is off of Wiggins once again Crimson shooting 62 from three as a leader of his team low has to tell his guys hey look no more threes well live with the twos Dylan Hunter to the Clemson bench Jaylen low leading scorer for the Panthers this season 17 and 1 12 points per game for number 15 in blue six in the ACC only two points so far Diaz Graham shefflin had a fingertip on it knocked around and taken by the Tigers and Chase Hunter crosses it over goes into the paint against three Defenders that was a nice I dont know if we show the replay Bulldog move by Chase Hunter throw the ball down in front see where the defender goes and go the opposite way I played with a guy named Brandon Knight that was his favorite move draws a foul this will be two shots for CH Hunter Hunter at the free throw line 90 of the Season leads the team fourth in the AC for Chase Hunter oh now SG I got nothing to do with that y Pittsburgh right now this is game is in the danger zone we talked about clemon imposing their will early on they are doing just that right now theyve got to figure it out fast cuz you can feel the tide shifting coach Cs putting in different combination of guys trying to figure it out in this almost musing scenario you dont want to go down 0 and four in this ACC that 49 from the floor for Hunter is the best on the team as well as he gets the second one to fall and the lead is 10 inside of four minutes to go in our first half Tom wormy John Henson the North Carolina great and our outstanding production crew on CW Courtside Saturday Peterson Event Center Pittsburgh Pennsylvania only meeting between the teams this season Panthers havt won in this series since 2015 done tough shot great help defense by Clemson not letting the defender see any daylight driving into the lane look at look look at the help right here man this is a defensive Clinic theyre putting on right now whistle on the drive by leg so Chase Hunter picks up the personal his team has the lead by 10 in Pittsburgh clerson un back to three he was behind the line so a point has been added to the pit total Ps got to get some help from third guy were at 3223 now John pit basketball and this is Corin who by the way leads have been scoring with nine so far hes got to be that third guy inside to help him out knocked over his own teammate leg it and combined for seven points so far on average they combine for 34 points per game low tough shot and its all net opposite leg inside hand floer thats tough by low hes starting to kind of get more aggressive offensively Silky Smooth Move Jaylen low the sophomore from Missouri City Texas Hunter little jab step to free himself up and ripped the ropes for the Tigers I cant be mad at dun that was just a good shot he was right there Chase Hunter six here guy those are the type of things that he does I mean John that is a veteran move right there that could be a next level move right there he put his name into the draft and got feedback and came back and looks like hes been working on this game fight inside Corin did the work Leed came away with it I like the physicality Corin been play playing with down there against a CL team that tries to impose their physical nature down there on the glass Leed lot of dribbling front rim shefflin out to Zachary done over zealous bumps Hunter right here opposite hand left opposite foot left hand floater fade and that might have been a foul thats a tough shot and right here Hunter hes feeling it step back Applause three got done to lean a little bit to the basket they got to run him off the line Hunter has four made three so far in this first half on five tries shefflin will spin it trying to get by the defender Corin up and under second chance shefflin just big strong move shielding the defender finishing on OPP side getting the rebound hes grimacing a little bit so that back might have hurt him a little I talked about that earlier to Tom yeah hes hes feeling it right now first points of the game for shefman who averages close to 13 per game second best on the tiger roster hes a senior from Atlanta Georgia trying to defend Corin inside round the perimeter Austin launching attempted save on the base Applause Baseline sheflin committed the foul all right coming up with a halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru well check out whats happening around the ACC this weekend including a preview of our second game Stanford North Carolina with Tom brenman Mike jinsky and well tell you about two former ACC womens basketball players being honored this week that is all coming up on the Subaru halftime show and at halftime the retirement of number 15 Sam clany drafted in both the NBA and NFL interesting to note final minute first half low nowhere to go Austin a twisting attempts and he hit it right in front of the tiger bench hes hes had some good shots that hes missed today and thats the one that goes in that right there is basketball folks unreal shefin lining up the three he hit two last game he was two for four so hes feeling good right now hes in Rhythm that hurts sheflin had a huge game when they played last year in Clemson South Carolina with 15 points 12 boards and a win for the Tigers theyve won 12 in a row in the series there about a second maybe shot and game clock difference low off a screen leot pumps it up rims out hits out of bounds with 26 on the clock it is pit basketball I didnt see that went out on and Im the right court side so thats a tough call for the ref could have went both Applause ways last chance for the Panthers Corin turns and hits Corin gets it into double digits with 11 points to lead the Tigers in the first half and into the locker room trailing by 10 Clemson shoots 63 from three Corin with a turnaround nice Fade Away desperation shot but it goes in have pit feeling good going into the half coach capable seems energized like hey look this is a tough team the second half they got to close the gap they are the tigers 6 And1 in ACC play going on the road against the Panthers and the L Zoo Subaru halftime show is straight ahead on CW court side Applause Saturday of Sam Clancy the pit Legend Number 15 into the rafters number 15 is on the court for the Panthers to start the second half as well and Jaylen low sheflin you know he only got into the box score late in the first half but he has come alive that was a beautiful set by cson the ball rotated the floor two to three times spreading out the pit defense lead to it open threee with the lock and roll down the middle and then collapsing beautiful set second three of the game for shefflin and now 11 made threes in the game for the Tigers foul on the entry pass might have been locken Wiggins was also there looks like the emphasis is still getting the ball in the paint down low against this Clemson team and working inside out trying to get back back into this Applause game 37 from the floor for the Panthers in the first half remember their second best in field goal percentage in the ACC at 47 Austin had a three in the first half and the shot clock is at five right there look at Wiggins closing the cap right there Diaz gr from the Music Applause corner watched the B the cers yesterday hes a really good shooter really skilled needs to get a Little Bit Stronger but hes hes going to be a player for them before its all set him done second three the brother combination of guo Diaz Graham and Jorge Diaz Graham guo on the court right now and he tapped that one Applause away they hail from the Canary Islands Spain prep ball at IMG Academy in Florida by me right up the road at a Tampa Florida a lot of guys come from there man its a high level basketball schol Jorge on the bench right now John mentioned he made four threepointers and had 17 points in the loss at Florida State this past week for pit on the road lockin sends it back out Zachary is wide open Wiggins with a twohanded follow I saw that coming from the top of the key hes a big time athl hes got some good sides on him too Wiggins now with four points in the game he averages close to nine per game with the sophomore from Grayson Georgia and Grayson High School lock in the steel attention does such a good job of helping on drives being in closing the deps Zachary got the shot away and was fouled Corin got a piece of Zachary right here nice pass getting in the Locking good Swing Swing good things happen when the defense is under man and that double team calls that they finish with the dunk so Corin picked up the foul Jaden Zachary the graduate student from Salem Wisconsin three years in the Boston College Applause program last year the Tigers had Joe Gerard from Syracuse after his long and decorated career and they went all the way to a regional final hes kind of having that same impact you know just just saying John High LEL high level transfer creating an instant impact on the team that was already pretty good of course they also had the AllAmerican PJ Hall in the lineup last year as well for the Tigers all the way to the regional final they lost to Alabama 8982 that game was in Los Angeles largest lead of the game right now for Clemson Alabama had to come back there in that game as well Applause Tigers beat New Mexico Baylor and Arizona on the way to the region of final angular rebound into the Applause corner good hustle there by low to keep it alive now Corin enforcing his will big shoulder bump big strong move by Corin theyre going to need more of that looks like hes becoming an emphasis offensively of getting the ball inside and letting him go to work cant do that punter locking runs it down hands it right back to Applause Hunter Wiggins fed shefin Zachary got it back deserving The Possession John and this is what we talked about pit has to finish the possession if they want to win this game and dont let it slip away right now it is crucial for pit to get a good shot on this possession Al Austin the Finish on the business end from legot Smart play by Austin cut Baseline when his Defender was not looking paying attention nice F by leg Diaz Graham picked up the foul you know the crowd was just starting to come alive on the alley oop right here leg with a nice lob Wiggins loses sight of his player and nice finish by Zachary who should probably attack a little more hes been shooting a lot more threes than he normally does I dont know if that was an emphasis today but uh it always feels good to get a little dunk down there maybe the next three will go in see Zach Austin on that Rim Bender from right behind the backboard for the red sht senior from Winston Salem North Carolina out of the High Point University program Jaden Zachary three straight away veteran play by Hunter he did not take the first shot he saw he drove the def got the defender to come in boom three by Zachary beautiful offensive play right there Savvy offensive play low defender on his hip and Zachary and low created contact and earned a trip to the free throw line Jaden Zachary on the foul for cl right here look he could have took that three drives the defender comes in Zachary steps into a rhythm three theres a reason why they are one of the top threepoint shooting teams in the ACC they take good shots usually when you take good shots you make them second made three for Zachary 12th made three of the game for the Tigers they made 10 in the first half Jaylen low is at the free throw line trying to bring the zoo alive the Oakland Zoo we in the Oakland neighborhood Pittsburgh Im a fan of zoo so this is exciting to be a part of this do not feed the animals John hson if youre pit right now you have to keep chugging away I do not think Clemson will continue to shoot at a 60 clip from three just keep fighting and defending looks like pit is in a zone right now trying to change up the rhythm of the offense by Clemson shefin in traffic out of the congested area to Hunter trying to get something going late in the clock Zachary lot of dribbling shefflin has to shoot and he got the bounce everything is going for Clemson right now if youre you cant get discouraged keep defending that was a not a pretty possession but H also got a threepointer in the corner by Zachary that wasnt pretty at all ear the Tigers shooting the three ball they have made 12 in the game their head coach Brad Music brell John were keeping an eye on the turnovers as well pit has only six Clemson has just two in the entire game so far and that is how you win Road games true Road games in the ACC this is a Clemson team that beat a Kentucky team thats you know a national championship Contender Kentucky was number four at the time they beat him 7066 at Little John Coliseum Kentucky is now number eight in the nation one of two wins out of the entire ACC SEC challenge quality wins for the ACC Duke also had a win over a ranked Auburn team and this would be another quality win as well if they can get get this one on the road and hold on leaving his way trying to spin it low couldnt finish it off he didnt look at the basket he was open I think Clemson Scout and say hey hes looking to pass when he drives down the lane hes got to be more aggressive and look the score when he gets in the lane cheffin on the Block against Corin so Corin has picked up

done put in the loose ball there was a whistle in there on second on Dylan Hunter pit fighting like they are down and ACC play 0 0 and three this is what coach cap wanted from his team they did this in the second half of Florida State as well they just have to keep coming and fighting back and not have any lapses because that has kind of been their MO they fight back and then they have a mental laps for a couple minutes and now the games out of pain yeah lost Wednesday at Florida State 8270 the guy on the bench you just saw Jorge Diaz Graham was part of that comeback he had 15 points in the second half today hes watching brother guo two is always better than one Tom Ill tell you that any day of the week best free throw shooting team in the ACC the Panthers 5754 in this second half Hunter trying to back it down locking six on the shot clock tied up by legot and a foul is called legot picks it up thats a third on Applause Leed hes going to have to be careful leot about his foul situation legot does have 13 points in the game hit is switching everything keeping the big fow down low I like this defense that theyre running Chase Hunter caught off by Austin and a steel done hell step into a three and K it here they come the Panthers Big Time transition three by dun the grad student from Kidston North Carolina has tied us Walkin Austin came over to alter the shot done again stepping back that might have brought the house down right there that have brought the house down the heat check by D Im not mad at it use some of this momentum to your advantage if youre pittsbur still nine made threes in the game for the Panthers Hunter driving in foul called as he was stumbling to the rim good defense by Zachary physical dun comes right here pulls up for the three hes feeling it the crowds feeling it tie ball game the second half weve got a ball game Tom Clemsons gone over 3 minutes without scoring Hunter at the line though right now to try to untie us from the free throw Applause line see if the Grayson Allen head is getting to him I dont know wheres Waldo back there too Kevin James Blake Hinson as well King of Queens Kevin James mean Tigers back up by two thanks to the free throws Tigers havent hit a field goal since the 1239 Mark and weve got 745 to go in regulation pit trying to beat this Clemson program for the first time since 2015 theyve lost 12 in a row in the series done Applause shefflin the rebound against Diaz Graham deflected by leged he stole it back shefflin got it right back what a Hustle by shefflin Wiggs leading to a layup thats what he does most improved player last year I mean that is a play that wont go into the stat book but he got his team two points off that hustle what a huge play and now its a fourpoint lead for the Tigers after we were tied at 57 here in the second half Leed almost had a steal shefflin got it back it created two for Wiggins three Miss from low bounces around to Hunter hit cant fall in love with the three right now theyve got to get some shots down low I think thats why cors going back in theyre leading the game in points in the paints not threepoint shots right now defensive intensity forces Hunter to call a timeout pit had gone on an 18 to4 run to tie it at 57 right here chef with the Big Time hustle to get the ball back leading to a layup by Wiggins players like that make winning plays thats why CL is six And1 in the ACC right now great hands from Wiggins too to catch that pass all in one motion and float up to the rim to lay it in and the tigers are up by four dont forget coming up

getting inside theyre leading the game in points in the paint not threes and thats what they need to keep doing to stay in this game potentially win it right now two point down two points inside of 6 minutes to go low Takes a Tumble I like how low sold that foul thats part of the game Wiggins picking up the foul second on Wiggins gives the ball back to the Panthers Wiggins kind of put a chicken wing out and low felt that and kind of sold it but that was a foul both teams into the bonus with 545 to go in regulation Leed Catch and Release leg it fishing for a three the Panthers going in front

Hunter right here crossover way to be in put your hands in there get the possession change which might matter later in this game inbounds leg it got caught under the rim hit by one Tigers led by 10 at the break shock loock is inside of 10 R Clemson you got to get a little more M ball movement theyre really stagnant on offensive end Hunter needs to shoot it ball did not hit the rim Clemson looks like theyre kind of out of sync right now offensively theyve got to get back into their sets with the ball movement theyre just passing on the perimeter maybe get locking the play play down there to get on the Block and draw The Defenders and kick it out for three last two possessions shot clock violations against the Tigers rebound count hit up three that usually BS with for them as a head coach Jeff cable is 0 and8 against Clemson he has won 109 games as the head man for pit took him to the NCAA tournament back in 2023 their first appearance since 2016 legged driving got in trouble Dylan Hunter Picks It Off low tried to knock it away from Hunter and the foul isou on jayen low Timeout on the court 343 to go Panthers by one keep bound the opposition they lead 272 24 on the boards theyre 120 tied or having the rebounding Advantage this season right now its all about getting quality shots for both teams as this is a position session game now this is a one one for Dy Hunter first trip to the line for Dylan Hunter 64 on the season this is the front end and Austin comes down with it5 number Diaz Graham back into the lineup number 25 in blue and gold johy Wiggins number seven Zone with Zary Clemson in the zone right now trying to stop the penetration by pit in their guards done down the lane done off the glass seems like hes finding his rhythm after being injured and missing a few games just getting back seven points now for dun three of nine from the floor and that includes a threepointer shefflin spins away from the double Hunter lays it in late in the clock just a nice possession by a veteran team of Clemson not panicking hting an open guy and getting a nice layup off the glass by Chase Hunter 17 points for Hunter leads all scores four Clemson Tigers and double figures led by Chase Hunter the graduate student from Atlanta Georgia low nowhere to go leg it Legas got an attack right here get downhill create for his teammates leg it Zachary the rebound hustles out of the pack Zachary eyes for the rim leans in and creates the contact we talked about getting quality shots right there might be a right here Zachary the bull hes a bulldog down TR a contact crimsons forth in a country of number of players with 50 career starts these last possession have shown they know what theyre doing at then in tight crucial games Zachary to the line fourth foul against leot Zachary in the game three of three from the stripe 90 best free throw shooter for the Applause Tigers 121 Career College game for Jaden Zachary coming off a 216 rebound performance in the win at Georgia Tech when he made three threepointers season High 21 points coming up next the outstanding basketball action continues Stanford faces North Carolina then tomorrow 2 Eastern 1100 am Pacific the women take the court as Virginia faces number 21 NC State the fantastic weekend of basketball action continues right here on the CW 102 for Zachary thats enough to tie us at 64 John this is going to be a crucial possession for pit the momentums kind of shifted towards Clemson theyve got to get a really good shot by love needs the ball in his hand create for his teammates Austin this fires bounces near the pit bench and the officials say Clemson ball and that right there is kind of a dichotomy of the last couple minutes pit has not gotten great shots down the stretch and Clemson has and its a tie ball game Dylan Hunter well defended by Austin shot clock to 10 for Wiggins shling wanted that on the on the Block Wiggins probably should have dropped it off to him as hes telling him give it to me and that is the final timeout for Brad br and the Clemson Tigers hes not happy about that with 133 to go Clemson comes in with a before all theyve brought Chase Hunter off screams out of timeouts to score I think they may do that again here it comes theyve got to defend this y good job by Leed defending that what shoot shot clock Hunter got it away didnt hit anything another shot clock violation yeah that was just maybe Clemson should have a little more creativity offensively leg it was sitting on that play thats why Chase Hunter had to fade to the corner and try to come back maybe Chase Hunter should have broke it off a little more be a little more creative on the on the play cuz Lega was definitely ready for that Austin to the bench for pit done on the inbounds officials are talking now Roger SS Eric Lewis Lamar Applause Simpson three really good refs by the way now remember Clemsons out of timeouts theyre essentially getting a little bit of a breather here John without having to spend one because they dont have one probably drawing up the next couple plays they W down the stretch yep the timings off a little bit on this play right here see Leed he kind of cheats the screens sheffers got to flip his screen and get Chase open either in the corner or pin him down low not a mistake you see from two kind of Veteran guys but credit to Leed being aware of the play thats coming theyve ran a Chase off the screen every time out of a timeout so so while the officials discussed this John we can tell you this the 16th alltime meeting between the programs it goes all the way back to 1958 when the Panthers beat the Tigers 60 to 50 so were working on the Applause clock that was Austin who missed out of the corner and the ball went out of bounds that was Clemson ball I mean thats at the 154 Mark weve got 124 in our game clock right now theyre taking a look at the entire sequence to determine the timing issue tie ball game down the stretch that seconds could matter ask Will Howard at Ohio State when they played Oregon seconds Applause matter still trying to do the math Music kind of like this if your Clemson kind of slow the momentum down for pit really get a little break get to set your defense and this B so theyve confirmed the timing its rolling 120 to go in regulation and tied at 64 looks like theyre going to bring low back up maybe pick and roll here he comes there it is pick and roll right here this is what you want low with the ball creating plays missing shein over the top of the board dun is down behind the play Hunter driving right into Diaz Graham defended it well couldnt hang on to it good vertical challenge by di Graham looks like duns a little hurt right here Music theyre going to take dun out he was behind the play in some discomfort point4 seconds to go in OT at Ohio State oh by his own teammate infraction involved legs also got four fouls you wonder if theyll good point John try to go with him 51 seconds to go they tried to use that against him and uh Leo did another good job of getting on those screens I need a Time on the shot clock this time around for the Tigers Zachary crafty little shot inside the free throw line from Jaden Zachary Savvy Savvy V veteran play and then he and low Collide I think the Panthers called the timeout prior to that collision and they did and good to see that both players unscathed there was a sense of calmness done back there was a sense of calmness out possession with Clemson guys that have been there obviously they made a run last year in the NCAA tournament theyve been in big games CLS high IQ shot attempt he did on that free throw to get him extra possession um those things really matter right now and uh rightfully so hes our player of the game weve got 22 made threes between the teams tigers have 12 although they made 10 in the first half John so math not my strong suit but I can figure that one out just two made in the second half for the Tigers obviously an emphasis for pit I think you get low the ball you go high pick and roll and you let him make a play for himself or his teammates right now coach Cs an NBA guys coach NBA players this is going to be what they do about a 4se second Difference game and shot low driving against shefin low lays it in 66 all tigers without a timeout Chase Hunter 5 Seconds didnt get the shot away last second chance from mid Court oh leg it would have mismatch right here hes got to create for himself for teammates cross it over against Wiggins spinning and Music scoring they have to keep going to that hes scored on every possession that theyve switched off on him low has 12 shefflin trying to tie us tough shot floater from the AC logo 15 points for shefflin fighting through those back issues all Applause game try to get it to Cory Le Applause it shot clock at five for low pulls up ball back to the Tigers this is kind of a a a pro turn but if you score on a play two or three times in a row you do nothing else until that H until they stop it pit has to go back to that highp pick and roll and keep going until they stop it Tiger basketball theyve got four players in double digits that includes Dylan Hunter coming off the bench with 10 Applause Dylan Hunter Runner bounces out to sheelin he lost the handle low in The Fray somehow it comes to Wiggins who Cates in for three big time hustle Big Time shot from Clemson those 5050 balls are crucial Clemson got to that Applause Wiggins hits a big time threepoint shot first three of the game for Wiggins 13th three of the game for Clemson offensive FAL Corin as Zachary went flying across the court look at this hustle right here sheffy gets in there loses the ball they dive on the floor he gets it out of the scrum to the threepoint shooter that is why it is great to have guys and vets on your team 5050 balls are a big deal when a game is at a one possession game like this 13 made threes for the Tigers that ties for their season High made threes in a game they did it against Florida State Hunter oh he wants another one John chefin skies for the board over Corin sheflin making an impact on this game without scoring right now hes got 10 rebounds double double for shefflin eighth of the Season knocked Away by the Panthers right now High pick and roll here we go now you got the mismatch take your time what a three whistling a foul away from the ball nice block by Diaz Graham right here chesing up hands up way to be there early as well they talked about that in practice being early on the screen and roll two big free throws right here for corn Wiggins picked up the foul his Applause third just a second free throw attempt for corn hes now one of two 7168 at the other end Zachary exploding to the rim and the rebounding has flipped Tom we talked about that earlier Clemson with 31 pit with 29 and we take a timeout in overtime tigers in front of the Panthers its the first day Applause school right now if youre pit you got to stick to that high picking roll live with the results maybe try to get leged involved a little bit if you can here it is the mismatch now hes got to make a play for his teammates low has 12 points Leed has 16 a threepointer 7371 thanes the low your keep running the same play and getting that mismatch and letting low go to work 11 made threes in the game for the Panthers John C Wiggins backing down over the front rim for Wiggins thats a Mitch Match down there with Zachary Wiggins is a big boy down there man hes got a lot of size on him Wiggins goes 610 216 for the sophomore from Grayson Georgia looks taller than that man hes as tall as the gram TS man here we go right here to pick and roll looks like theyre not going to switch this time low long rebound done over the top shein got it Zachary hit the deck maybe a little sophomore mistake settling for that three one minute to go in regulation John Henson fourpoint Applause game Zachary sto it start never got the shot away leot grabs it moves Zachary out of the way Leed floats it up and in thats one way to score transition when the defense not back right now Clemsons just got to get a good quality shot the clock is on your side I like the ball in your sixe guard hand 18 points now for Leed probably going to start this with about nine on the shot clock about a 9sec difference game in shot Chase Hunter threepointer ripping the ropes for the Tigers Chase Hunter leg it quickly back up the court got tangled up by Wiggins Diaz grises Austin jams it for two 17 on the clock one possession game timeout what a wild sequence and Chase Hunter with the dagger threepoint shot that is why you put the ball in the hands of your best player six years in college Zachary inbounds Diaz Graham defends it sends it up to midcourt bounces around and the clock runs out on the Panthers and the Tigers get the road victory and improve to
