a big time decision maker for them but not in the starting five We have been told he is available and ready to play if his number is called and we expect it to be We are underway and the Hurricanes start with the basketball Dante Allen in for Donaldson 62 days between starts for the freshman Dante Allen Shot clock ticks down to eight cheering Purdue into a double team Kicks it out Henderson has to heave it Beats the shot clock but doesnt make it And now Syracuse will settle And we take a look at the Orange starting five No changes for Syracuse They need more from Nate George Three turnovers this season We welcome those who just watched Clemson beat Georgia Tech Eric Dondorf Jay Alter with you We welcome you to a snow filled college basketball Saturday at a place very familiar with a good winter storm Syracuse New York cheering Two teams that desperately need a win in ACC play Backtoback conference losses for Syracuse and Miami Good look inside Everything but the finish U got there to deny Kyle Henderson the highflying freshman onehanded jam Thats what Shelton Henderson can do And Jay this is how both teams want to play They want to get up and down play with pace get easy clean looks at the rim Great strong drive right there by Henderson Finished at the rim Stling weave his way in high off the window Missed layup This is what Miami will do If a team misses theyll try and push in transition and take a quick shot That rims in Maliku one of the most consistent scorers in the country dials it a three cheering and applause Hurricanes playing without Trey Donaldson to start this game Their senior point guard who has started every game this season but has struggled in the last two contests both resulted in losses First year head coach Jay Lucas trying to spark something and get a fast start for the team on the road And there is Donaldson 36 minutes per game in ACC play So very surprising to see him not in the starting lineup but if he was looking for a spark and a strong start DVO its worked Well Jay he struggled the last two games only averaging eight points and thats why Miami didnt win those games But him coming off the bench sparking offensively defensively getting up and pressuring the ball Thats what Miami needs him to play well If they play well Miami is in good shape Both of these teams desperate to snap two game losing streaks pick up a win in ACC play Nate George travels cheering and applause and turns it over If youre Syracuse you said a key was a fast start Its been everything but that a turnover for George and turnovers have plagued him this season Well Syracuse really needs Nate George to play well As of late hes been struggling taking care of the ball He has to look to be a playmaker but also be a threat scoring the ball Len there to flush it home Seven nothing start for Miami on the road This is not the start that Syracuse wanted You can see right there on that last defensive possession a little confusion between Kyle and Freeman in the high post area cheering Donnie Freeman has not seen much of the ball in the opening three minutes Struggled in the lost Virginia Tech Wednesday night just three of 14 shooting Jay Virginia Tech good did a good job of keeping Syracuse out of transition making them play against a set defense in half court And thats something that Syracuse has really been struggling with this year What do the Orange need to do on the offensive end offensively in the half court set Ball movement and body movement If you can get guys moving off the ball get cleaner looks Theyre having so taking tough shots in the half court this whole year Washington right to the rim for two Time out Adrien Miami with a team thats dropped two in a row Well Jay we were talking to him at shoot around and youre right Thats exactly what he said They have to get off to a fast start and theyre playing how they want to play Making defense and offense getting out playing fast getting easy opportunities at the rim Syracuse still looking for their first bucket Nate Kings delivers it right on Q And when Syracuse does get in the half court they have to look to put pressure on the defense Get downhill and make Miami play Well Miami had a ninegame winning streak snap to Clemson and then they followed it up with a surprising loss to Florida State to a 152 start through the first 17 games now 0 and2 They have come out with tons of energy and a great start Renee gets it to go again They are getting everything they want on offense Theyve made five in a row George pull up three Got it Much needed Oh thats a great sign for Syracuse Look we know he can pass the ball We know about his passing ability but he makes himself even better passer when he begins to be a threat scoring the ball Backs himself into another team and turns it over Donnie Freeman ripped it away cheering Its been Miami whos capitalized in transition Now Syracuse a good look Backto screaming back threes for Nate George And this is how Syracuse wants to play Get up and down play ahead of the defense Great extra pass right there by Nate Kings and Nate George knocking down his second three Both of these teams very similar They will make you pay cheering getting a turnover and creating it into points on the other end Washington spins his way into the lane Good defense by Syracuse once again and the Orange can run Five on four George with confidence grabs cheering it No finish there William Kyle usually automatic on the alley Misses it and Washington draws the foul True Washington at the line when we come and he told us were one of the worst teams in the country when it comes to getting productivity from our bench So he shook up the starting lineup trip today Trey Donaldson who has averaged more than 36 minutes per game at ACC play did not start He checked in during the most recent timeout Even if he plays the rest of the game hell still be under his average minutes cheering Well you know what It is a risky move but you know he was going to get in the game quick and Miami needs him out there as a facilitator and also a scorer And it did give the Hurricanes a spark They started this game up 9 nothing Syracuse has responded with two Nate George threes George has it here We have some great matchups right out on the floor Donaldson George freeman Ray Newu and then you got Kyle and U Adrien Autry certainly not happy with the backtoback losses home to Virginia Tech midweek before that against Boston College a team in the basement of the ACC And he has owned it He said Look nobody wants to win more than me Falls at my feet but the thing that will 11 turn things around Hes getting wins And I think the most frustrating things for Syracuse fans is the talent and ability is there Its just the energy and effort being consistent Theyve been inconsistent throughout this year as far as that goes Washington Good midrange game right on Q And great screen right there by Ray New Good job by Washington turning the corner making a read and hitting that midrange A little talk between him and George going back down cheering George hitting those two threes with Donaldson on the bench Henderson battling through and its a turnover Washington rips it away Renew the trailer Floats it inside Altun toss way over the head of Donaldson cheering into the fifth row and Syracuse creates the turnover So Jay those last two possessions both for Syracuse and Miami Suare a guy who doesnt play a lot He needs to catch it land on two feet see what he has And then same thing on the other end for Miami El Tutas right there Catch it and see what you got before you make that decision George had the hot hand but misfired that one Henderson He is not afraid to get into the paint Is fouled and two will come from the line Shelton Henderson fivestar freshman came in with big expectations Hes playing so well Miami feels like they cant take him off the court right now playing with confidence playing through contact and defensively hes not fouling as much He is a freshman who has just blossomed over the course of this season Tarheelss highlight next Saturdays ACC Network quadruple header They get started with Pit at Clemson and then UNCC in Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech Thats a week from today right here on ACC Network good opportunity to see two ranked teams in the cheering ACC Were talking about Henderson Jay I mean 66 240 lbs A M truck on the basketball floor And he looks like a defensive end but hes averaging almost 19 points in his last four games And hes aggressive When he gets downhill theres really not so much you could do He put that shoulder in your chest Hes either going to finish or go to the free throw line Freeman into the lane Gets it Donnie Freeman his first shot after a quiet start finds bottom and we know hes capable of hitting a threepoint shot but hes at his best when hes attacking the rim getting downhill and being aggress on his way to the rim Well thats a great matchup to watch over the course of this afternoon Donnie Freeman against Malik Renu Two very consistent scorers that have elevated their games this season Well two two of the best four men three four men in the ACC both averaging similar numbers 20 and six 20 and seven Both of these guys have to look to be aggressive in attack on the offensive side of the ball cheering Malik Renu playing his best basketball in a Hurricanes uniform He transferred from Indiana twoyear starter for the Hooers Funny that those two schools just played for a national championship in football And what an addition for first year head coach Jay Lucas We showed you those turnaround numbers earlier to get players like Renu Thats why in a Miami native and a big point of emphasis was bringing the Miami kids and the Florida kids back home via the portal Absolutely And we were talking to him at shootaround Ideally they want to get out and play fast but when they do get in the half court they want to get the ball to Ray New They want him to score and look to be a playmaker as well Well hes got seven of the Hurricanes 18 early Eightpoint lead for Miami on the road Syracuse still struggling on the offensive end Been a theme throughout this season and they have started slow once more trying to avoid a threegame losing streak in conference play Anthony into the game Misfires Thats what they look they have to look to do that be aggressive against this physical Miami defense Donaldson spins free Trey Donaldson so crafty and thats why hes one of the best point guards in the ACC getting downhill spin cycle finishing with the off hand Great finish right there by Trey Donaldson Miami has made seven of their last eight shots and theyve ballooned this lead to 10 doubling up to 201 almost a lone source of offense for Syracuse Thats something else In the dome right now it is 68 degrees That is a comfortable temperature when you step outside and it will hit you hard Especially for these guys used to South Florida Nate George steps the line Hes got seven of the first 11 for the Orange That was your key to this game DVO When you looked at Syracuse you thought Nate George had to be the X factor for them Well I just think all season long like he hasnt been playing as consistent as he needs to be If he plays consistent this team is at a whole another level You need your guards to play good if you want to go deep and make a deep run into conference play and then into the tournament George goes to the bench after knocking down both free throws Eight of the Oranges 12 JJ Starling comes back in and Syracuse goes to a two3 zone Something we did not see Wednesday against Virginia Tech Adrien Aut has been hesitant to go to the zone versus a mantoman defense Thats fourth best in ACC play They get a stop in the first possession of zone What do you think about this move Well theyre doing a good job of mixing it up Theyve been playing manto and zone a little bit but I think as far as Miami goes right theyre trying to put him out outside of the perimeter and did a great job right here getting the ball to the high post to Henderson Looks like he just got hit in the eye right there by Betsy Miami has to look to attack the free throw line area short corner area against the zone as Syracuse is playing A Miami team that offensively they want to get down in transition before any defense is set whether it be zone or man But a team that has struggled in the half court at times this season U called in for a reach He got it cleanly Comes into the game And the one thing Miami doesnt have is a particularly deep bench Top six guys you include Dante Allen to the normal starters Today he did start really do the lion share of the scoring and playing for this Hurricanes team And and if Im Syracuse I have to be aware of that And you have to be look to be aggressive Just like that Kayen Anthony get to the paint You have to be aggressive against this Miami team because when they get outside of that starting five theres a big dip On paper Syracuse has more quality depth They can go deeper but at times that depth hasnt necessarily turned into production Cayenne Anthony part of that heralded freshman obviously the son of Carmelo Anthony This is the first dad is in the house as he often is this season You said you were talking with him earlier this week Yeah And you see him right there shaking his head a little bit Kayen is more than capable of knocking down these free throws Once you get to the free throw line its more so of a mental thing and just having that belief and confidence to knock it down Missed them both Jay thats something that Syracuse has to take advantage You want to be aggressive get to the paint draw those fouls have to be able to knock down your free throws And its been a bugaboo all season long Last in the ACC in free throw percentage although theyve shot it better in conference play and another turnover The Syracuse defense has done their job in the last couple of minutes forcing some Miami turnovers but they cant cash in on the other end right now Well you look at this roster Jay They have the ability athleticism versatility and theyre flying around defensively Thats when theyre best But youre right they have to be able to make up for it on the offensive side of the ball when they get a stop Starling scoreless so far Right down the lane Thats more like it from JJ Starling And thats when hes at his best turning the corner getting downhill playing through contact finishing at the rim cheering Miamis made seven of their last nine but they have three turnovers during that stretch as well and theyve gotten the shot off Theyve connected cheering Shot clock ticks down to eight Renu cant connect cheering And Jay thats what Syracuse wants Miami to do shoot the ball from the perimeter You see the versatility from Sadique White guarding Donaldson cheering Threeon two Washington Lefty layup No good Well contested Anthony tried to take it up the court and a foul called And Jay this is what Miami wants to do Get out in transition But if youre Washington you have to be able to finish at the rim And an obvious foul right there on on Miami But Syracuse on this side of the ball to keep Miami out of transition they have to be able to finish themselves at the rim Heres William Kyle Floats it up White throws it down Great job by William Kyle Flashing to the high post Sadique White saw it Cut back door from the lob One of the most athletic front courts in college basketball Miami in a scoring drought of 2 and cheering 12 minutes Its allowed a 6 nothing Syracuse run Purdue trying to spin his way free Dumps it off Easy layup for Washington Well Cayenne right there got caught looking Him and JJ are standing in the same spot He should have shifted over to the middle and took that pass away Great recognition right there by Ray New Tyler Betsy trying to shake free And now Anthony freshman on freshman Two of the best in a star studded class Henderson and Anthony William Kyle trying to muscle his way to the rim and he does so successfully How impressive day has William Kyle been this whole season shot blocker protecting the rim running the floor and then when he gets it that close from the rim he usually finishes cheering Syracuse back within four on an 82 runal and what we expect to be a close and competitive game throughout on a snowy day in the ACC A great job by William Kyle finding the back cutter and Sadique White and he know York and specifically Central New York Well this is just another day in Syracuse New York Jeff you know that better than anybody DVO Eric Dondorf Jay Halter with you Been a good one so far here Both teams desperate for an ACC win after backto back conference losses Miami jumped out to the early 9 nothing lead and since then been very back and forth Yeah Well both teams obviously want to get up and down and play with some pace My question is which team is going to force the other team to play in the half court set I think Syracuse is doing a good job switching the zone and making Miami play outside on the perimeter Deep three dialed in Noam Doat drills him Well Draat just heard me and he said Im going to step into this one and knock it down And before that three 14 of Miamis 23 points came in the paint The main three will help serve stretch out their defense White lost the handle and he was fouled Ronnie Freeman jets into the game Been very quiet for his standards Two points in nine minutes They have been a much improved team with Donnie Freeman difference maker since returning from injury particularly on the glass Oh yeah And its no secret theyre a much better team with their best player on the floor I I think about the thing is with Donnie is you dont want him to settle outside You want him to attack and look to get to the basket and be aggressive Thats a goend The blow by Cayenne Anthony Theyll count it for two And Kenne hes just a natural scorer He has a knack for getting to the rim Hes crafty The big thing for him is defensively he has to be able to lock in and then get better with his decision making Well he has struggled in the mantoman defense at times Maybe Syracuse going zone will help Anthony Betsy trying to rip down that rebound Couldnt control it So itll stay Miami basketball Well Jay Syracuse has been known for their length in the two3 zone And you look up top right now you have 67 and 65 up top and 611 68 611 in the bottom If theyre active moving around theyre going to make it tough for Miami Purdue strings in the traffic Freeman blocked it away Starling weaving through Pull up top CANT STICK IT PERFECT position for the follow flush William Kyle And even though JJ Starling missed the shot the attention was on him which allowed William Kyle to get that offensive rebound and put back Miami trying to answer with a lob dunk of their own U wasnt ready for it Freeman back to Starling for the tie Missed it But Jay he has to be a threat shooting the basketball to keep the defense out of it Washington cheering dispossessed U gets it back for Miami Yeah this zone has Miami confused a little bit Great job being active by the Syracuse defense Shot clock already down to six Do has to hurry Cant shake three cheering Hoist it up and hits it Look Syracuse will live with that shot The last two shots that they made were tough shots They cant sustain like that throughout the whole game They got to find a way to get easier looks Anthony in attack mode Step back cheering three Got it And D I tell you what we talked about just his natural scoring ability He can make tough shots cheering applause stolen away again The Syracuse defense since going to zone very effective in this first half Theyre active and theyre moving around Betsy that would have given the Orange the lead Jay Miami needs to be able to find a way to get the ball in that high post area applause Time out Jay Lucas Long Theyre athletic They can move Theyre disruptive in that zone And foul trouble in the most recent loss to Virginia Tech was such a key And you tend to foul less in the zone Yeah absolutely You just have to cover your area and its you still have to work but its about communication and being active in the zone Freeman cant connect A great job by Syracuse getting back on defense Stolen away again Up ahead ANTHONY screaming IT HOME cheering Caught in Anthony with authority cheering applause Youre seeing flashes of what makes this freshman special And hes got the red going to that zone So after going down nine nothing at tip Syracuse has battled back to tie it at 27 Miami has to stop turning the ball over Four turnovers in the last four minutes eight total of this first half Henderson good out of the timeout play and the freshman Shelton Henderson delivers And Jay I know a little bit about the zone having played it for four years The weak spots is that high post area in that short corner If you get it in there now its about making the right decision Nate George leaves it short Donaldson always quick to push in transition Usually makes the right decision the senior point guard and draws the foul And thats what Miami wants to do Off the miss get it out and push And Trey Donaldson is one of the best in the country at doing it That is just six fouls against Syracuse in this first half After Wednesday night of the loss to Virginia Tech they committed 28 fouls Thats the most fouls that Orange Team has committed in a game since 2018 cheering And if you think of how Virginia Tech won that game in the second half it was getting to the free throw line and capitalizing 28 fouls The Hokes cashed it in free throws that ended up making the difference in the game And you got to give credit to Mike Young and Virginia Tech but they were aware of that and they continued to attack that whole second half Great change right here by Syracuse going zone which will keep them out of foul trouble This should limit on paper the amount of fouls you havent Kings goes baseline leaves it off to Suarez Lefty hit way off the mark Renu screaming cross the foul Malik Renu and Miami is getting back to what they do best which is dominate in transition Yeah I like what coach Lucas did Put on a little press right there and you see Rayu He was sprint down the middle of the floor and great job balance through contact And these guys are talking Theyre talking to each other Jay Theyre competitive Theyre having fun out here Thats three fouls against Suare And now Miami on a run 7 nothing Hurricanes run in the last 48 seconds coming out of that timeout Okay Miami going to a little bit of his own theirelves The line Henderson got a piece of it They go back to Kyle Henderson there again William Kyle still battling underneath and manages it and muscles it home William Kyle he is a workhorse High motor cheering Henderson lost the handle and they call a foul against Donnie Freeman Adrien Autry not happy about it Jay the thing about Miami is make or miss theyre looking to push that basketball So if youre Syracuse you got to look to get back and set up in that zone defense All right one So Henderson steps up for a one and one Has to make the first to earn the second cheering and screaming It rims out No good Anthony a three Misses it cheering Hes been the offensive spark off the bench in this first half for Syracuse Washington He cant connect on the layup It was a good idea by Washington attacking that gap You just have to finish when you get two feet in the paint George tough take Miamiys dialed up the defensive pressure Two minutes left in this first half Donaldson drains the three Trey Donaldson And I like the aggression by Nate George but if you miss it you got to hustle back cuz Miami wants to get out and play like that Transition threes Donaldson is going to knock it down if hes that open This game was tied at 27 Miami on a 102 run to grab that control Freeman Great touch on the floater Again if youre going against the zone get the ball in the high post area and then make a decision cheering Washington faces it follows his own man CLEANS UP THE SPILL FOR TWO And now you see both teams Jay really trying to settle down in that zone and they found the weak point Now its just about turning taking your time and making a good decision with the basketball Crosscourt pass George draws the foul went right into Dante Allen So George steps to the line to shoot two And its just a good sign for Syracuse Jay when Nate George is looking to be aggressive scoring the basketball misses the first Lets look ahead to February 5th a very important day in womens basketball Play 4K a double header right here on ACC Network North Carolina host Clemson at 6 And then Florida State will be in Raleigh to take on NC State You can donate to the Kaya Cancer Fund Go to kayacom George knocks down the second So Miami with all the momentum here as we tick under a minute to go with this first half Game was tied at 27 Since then the Hurricanes on a 125 run See Syracuse switches back to manto man Miami looking to be aggressive getting downhill off Henderson there Another offensive rebound and Shelton Henderson cashes in And those are the type of plays that Syracuse cannot afford You have three guys under the rim You got to be able to get those defensive rebounds William Kyle got it Plus the foul William Kyle a chance for an and one Jay hes just doing a great job of getting into that middle of the paint being available See Nate George good find and William Kyle when he gets it right there that close to the basket its usually a bucket throw JW will make a donation to our community cheering free throw shooting has not been his strength this season cant complete the threepoint play and now Miami can hold for the final shot of this first half Syracuse has to talk They have to talk to Sadique White and let him know whats going on Communication 10 seconds left Donaldson in attack mode Donaldson lost the handle Nate King stole it and is fouled And because Syracuse is in the bonus Nate Kings will shoot free throws with two seconds remaining in the first half First year head coach for the Hurricanes Jay Lucas very upset with that Its one thing to turn it over another to commit the foul when Kings would have had to heave it from half court Yeah that was just a frustration foul right there by Donaldson Not a good decision and not a good possession right there for Miami ISO ball defensively Syracuse was loaded up Donaldson who did not start this game has come off the bench and provided good minutes for Miami but a mistake there as Syracuse capitalizes with two points Allen half court way over the basket and Miami heads in the locker room with a fivepoint lead Oh Syracuse starts with the basketball trailing by five What do you want to see more of from the jump here on the offensive end for the Orange I think for Syracuse you just dont want to settle You want to attack the pressure that Miami gives the physicality and look to get downhill and opportunities at the rim George kick out Stling the three Cant connect But Jay thats what you want Get downhill get into the paint create an opportunity for one of your teammates just wasnt able to knock it down Stolen away The Miami turnovers killed them at the end of that first half and the Orange cheering cash in for two Donnie Freeman on a racket attack And we talked about both teams ideally want to get out and play fast in transition ahead of the defense Its a great example right there Great find by George Freeman with the finish Syracuse 14 points off turnovers Both of these teams are best turning defense into offense They both struggle in the half court cheering on the contact and he has the immediate answer with a dunk of his own Thats a great idea by William Kyle just getting over there two feet It was a close call but Ray New continue to play and finishing at the rim Jay I think for Syracuse Starling has to look to be more aggressive in this second half getting downhill 5 seconds to shoot Starling going downhill here across cheering contact Hell get two at the line And the big thing Jay for Starling is when he does attack and get downhill dont throw up that floater two feet away from the rim look to play with the contact and then seek it and then get opportunities at the foul line Regardless how youre shooting at the line you have to go up there with confidence and knock it down We showed you that Syracuse has struggled in second half this season cheering A big reason why the free throw shooting third worst in all of college basketball Its been much improved in ACC play Under 60 in the nonconference 75 in conference play And I think 2J early on those free throw woes were making these guys play hesitant You can never play hesitant when youre playing basketball If youre going to make a mistake do it being aggressive cheering Starland makes them both there Back to a onepossession game and we are expecting a close competitive second half and a fun finish on a snowfilled college basketball Saturday Purdue Dangerous with the left Misses it that time Itll stay Miami basketball underneath their own hoop And Jay if youre Miami Ray knew he get in that little gray area right in between the free throw line in the second hash And then they have to be a good job of sealing under the rim So they have that high low opportunity Donaldson right down the lane Trey Donaldson who did not start this game finding his rhythm in the second half And thats an experience play right there Keeping him on the hip seeing whats in front of him making the decision and then attacking Good answer Nate Kings flying to the rack I really like what Nate Kings has been bringing for the Syracuse team as of late averaging 19 over the last two He just puts his head down and strong drive to the basket with the left Donaldson no look pass finds lost the handle Scrambles it out to Washington on a three The lefty sharp shooter Drew Washington delivers And I tell you what if they start to hit a few of those perimeter shots its going to open up that Syracuse zone Starling good take when he attacks the basket gets into the paint Good things happen for him and Syracuse His team trading punches offensively Kyle got a hand to that one Syracuse saying Lets get a coachs challenge here Jay this wasnt an easy block How about there He had to fight off U right there and then block blocking it with the off hand and thats why he leaves the ACC and block shots William Kyle no challenge from the Syracuse bench So it stays Miami ball against Freeman Pull up Got it Thats as good as defense as you can play if youre Syracuse Thats just a tough shot by a really good player Now Renu up to 14 points He has been so consistent Hes elevated his game offensively Freeman and Renu have been going at it all afternoon Great man battle Really a lot of great matchups individually in this game Shot clock down to four George has to hurry Find Stling Open three Good hustle to keep it alive for the Orange cheering Scoop to the hoop for two Nate George cashes in on the second chance opportunity A bright spot for the Syracuse Orange team Nate George has been looking to be aggressive throughout this whole basketball game cheering Renu cheering over Renu wins the ball for Syracuse cheering And on the other side Syracuse is doing a good job defensively being active and then trying to get out in transition and when theyre not theyre attacking in half court And Miami putting on some fullcourt pressure out of the timeout Syracuse with the basketball trailing by four A little pressure right here for Miami trying to slow him down Take a few seconds off the shot clock Donnie Freeman been very quiet for his standards Only six points today Miami back in the zone Shot clock ticks down to eight Heres Nate George Finds Freeman Donnie Freeman has to hurry Two seconds to shoot Pulls up knocks it down Donnie Freeman delivers And again Miami did all they can defensively Thats just a really tough shot from a really really good player at Donnie Freeman Both Miami and Syracuse some elite shot making in this second half Allen too much on that Charlie the spin cycle rejected Twoon one Henderson gets to the rack cheering rocks the rim Syracuse was shouting for a goend and the freshman Shelton Henderson goes coast to coast with authority That was an unbelievable block right there by U getting up and then getting out in transition Henderson with the and again Henderson that time dished IT OFF FOR TWO WASHINGTON the finish Backto back baskets for Miami cashing in in transition Jay this guys 66 245 lbs moving like that Freeman the immediate answer Backto back baskets for Donnie Freeman against this Miami zone Thats exactly where Donnie Freeman should be at in that high post area Turn and face and make a decision Syracuse back into manto man WILL GET BACK WILL IN traffic goes up with it and it goes off Donnie Freeman and will stay Miami basketball Washington had no place to go there so just went to the rim play wins the ball back for the Hurricanes NJ I dont know But if Im Syracuse I I I liked when they were playing in the zone and they were doing a good job of keeping Miami out on the perimeter And with Donaldson out of the game with foul trouble Anderson the point guard hes not exactly a natural point guard but hes been handling the ball for the Hurricanes here Big three off the bench Malovich the freshman from Slovakia And Miami starting to separate with a sevenpoint lead Well Malovich is the one guy on the court that you have to be aware out on the perimeter Syracuse has to know that Heres William Kyle Draws the foul The latest in the Were Number One documentary series live now on the ESPN app Taking a sneak peek behind the scene look at the 1993 North Carolina Championship team led by Dean Smith Youll get never before seen footage interviews with players and coaches right now on the ESPN Heres William Kyle Spins in Uday called for the foul Ernest Dude and William Kyle they are not afraid to fly to the rim for a block or a dunk They meet at the point of attack Two big bodies going at each other We talked about the matchups Jay And thats another matchup right there And U and William Kyle And right there William Kyle being aggressive getting an opportunity for two Kyle just a 48 free throw shooter One of the more unique releases in college basketball from the line but makes it that time Well we call that the windshield wiper shot You go back across your body and then you come back on that straight line If he can get it back straight and hold his follow through hell have an opportunity Makes them both though You dont care what it looks like as long as it goes in There you go Two points is two points 252 Donaldson back into the game for Miami playing with those three fouls Purdue Oh the master of the midrange Malik Purdue Hes got 16 So anytime you get that ball in that ACC area Syracuse has to be more aware of getting up and playing that Shoot them high SHOOT THEM HIGH Shoot high For as well as Syracuse has shot it in this second half 66 They havent gotten the necessary stops defensively Anthony a deep three carries cheering it Ken Anthony off the bench and hits a huge three And kids just look at the subtle ball fake That subtle ball fake shifted that Miami defense and allowed him to get an open shot And if youre that open hes going to knock it down And with Anthony on the court Syracuse back in the zone and it leads to a turnover line Way for the Sports Center top 10 dunk and he missed it I This would have ripped the rim off had he finished it but youd probably like to see him go for the finger roll laying You just got to finish it right there You just hit a three Cen did a great job getting that deflection You have to finish that in transition if youre starling same spot Nothing but the bottom of the net Two big threes for the freshman Jay Im just on repeat right now We just said Malovich is the guy that you have to be aware of on the perimeter Thats two times that Syracuse missed him inside Anthony through traffic draws the foul And well get to at the line when we come back as these two teams desperate for an ACC win trading threes And how about Cayenne and Anthony a subtle ball fake shifts Renu and hes knocking it down And on the other side Malovich welcome to the dome Knocking it down to limit Renu because master of the midrange both as a scorer but we just saw as a passer as well Well yeah When he gets the ball in the high post William Kyle has to step up and and meet him at the point of attack and make it harder for him to make decisions with the basketball Now Renu leads all scorers with 16 points His hurricanes a sevenpoint lead 6255 Both teams desperate for an ACC win On a twoame slide right now you dont want to make it three Kayen Anthony steps to the line to shoot two Hes been a big offensive spark for Syracuse today Tied leading scorer with 11 points Really Jay hes just been letting the game come to him The shot selection has been good Hes just taking whats coming to him Two possession game Hurricanes control a sixpoint lead Plenty of time left 1120 in the second half Syracuse back to the manto man once again Would you like to see them stay in zone I would Id like to see I think theyve been really effective in that zone defense Henderson misses the layup He was fouled Hell get two at the line And you just see right there Theyve been doing a good job If youre in zone this doesnt happen right there But its a great job of Uday right there sealing off And that if Shel Sheldon Henderson gets anywhere near the rim hes going to be able to get it up with the 66 240 frame I dont know if theres any player in the entire ACC who loves to drive the lane like Shelton Henderson He is unafraid of contact Hes got so much physicality of his own at 66 240 And his development throughout this freshman year to play with confidence He has been in attack mode since tip off If I was 66 240 lbs Id have have that same mindset every single time Im welcoming the contact I dont know I think youd still be hanging out behind the threepoint line Im trying to get a little Im trying to get a little balance in there laughter Miami in the two3 zone right now Shot clock down to five George his turn to drive the lane This is a cheering Its a good idea by George but you cant let the ball stick against that zone Theyre holding the ball too long Henderson Backto back baskets for Shelton Henderson And Miamis up by 10 I tell you what basketball looks like its going to work out for him If not hes going to get a football contract But this guy is just going full head of steam downhill and hes daring anybody to get in the way Well he is Eric Dickersons nephew Pro Football Hall of Famer one of the best running backs in the history of the National Football League At times he looks like a running back on the court Whos going to stop me Henderson just doing a great job of getting downhill and really nobody wants to get in the way of that Would you I wouldnt No I wouldnt Id try to do the little swipe like George just did Well thats where the zone can help you Going back to zone versus man Anthony cant connect on that three This is Miamis largest lead of the game Starting to separate with 10 minutes left in the second half And Jay Syracuse has to be careful right here This is a crucial defensive possession In the danger zone Henderson has taken over He scored the last four for Miami Finds Donaldson Who buries the three Trey Donaldson fires Miami up by 13 And how about coach Lucas 66 cheering 245B point guard First year head coach Jay Lucas is loving it Miami desperate for a road win in the ACC Theyve got all the momentum right now And the Mac truck getting downhill making Miami becomes a runaway train here in the second half Its Henderson who has been the conductor Although Hurricanes very balanced scoring in this second half five players with five or more points in this second half It looks like Miami is going to stay zone for the rest of this half Syracuse has to find a way to attack those gaps not settle for perimeter shots And the Orange could use a few stops of their own Trying to claw back Donaldson Almost a onehanded jam for U Anthony goes coast to coast in perfect position for the long rebound and cashes in for two And if Im Syracuse Im trying to get out in transition play fast get easy buckets at the rim just like that one by Anthony He was two for two before that miss from three U called for a shove underneath So it will be Syracuse ball trailing by 11 The Orange down but not out Still time in this game but you need to string together a stretch where you can score offensively and get stops defensively and theyve failed to do it so far today And they have to move the ball against the zone with pace and then when they get it open they have to look to attack it and then make a good decision George weaving through pull up pop sticks it exactly where you want to get the ball against that zone in that ACC area Youre going to have great opportunities if youre able to do that cheering and applause cheering Goes up misses it and a great rebound by Donnie Freeman Kings transition three cheering cant connect Miami they are usually quick in transition like weve seen all season long slowing things down a bit up by nine under eight to play talked about in the half court they want to be able to get it to their guy Ray new cheering count it plus the foul ud be here Im grateful and you know what I love repres presenting that Syracuse Orange and I play with a lot of emotion I was a competitive guy and Im just happy to be here calling the games cheering right now The Orange in the danger zone trailing by 11 under eight minutes to play Betsy limited minutes today Fires a three buries it cheering Exactly what Syracuse need and Betsy delivers And thats what Betsy does and hes 12 for 23 in his last six games from three He can knock it down cheering His first basket today couldnt come at a better time And the Orange falls back into their zone cheering Donaldson shoots over it Misfires grabs the board Henderson misses it Another offensive rebound revealed Donaldson settles it 10 seconds to shoot Donaldson that rims in Trey Donaldson And its all about the second chance points under first year hook coach Jay Lucas And you see why Well that was a third chance opportunity for Miami And and thats what killed Syracuse the last game against Virginia Tech They have to secure that after one shot Freeman has a mismatch going against Donaldson Hes got six ines on him Uday swats it away Ernest Hudday Miami has numbers Anderson lays it up and in for two Hey if youre Freeman right there you dont go away from the rim You go towards the rim Freeman hits it that time That was a good job by him coming back creating space with the contact and then hitting a tough fadeaway shot in the paint cheering Miami still very much in the drivers seat though A 10point lead under six minutes to play Jay every possession for this Miami team they should look to get the best opportunity the best shot And what would that be get that ball in the high post area and make a decision Renew has been effective from there This time on the block the senior 18 points Double double for him 11 rebounds to go along with it The high post and short corner Those are the weak areas in the zone Freeman backto back baskets for the sophomore Syracuse doing a good job of attacking that paint area Freeman just has to look to flash and be big and then be aggressive at the rim The Orange go manto man here Trailing by 10 under five minutes left Donaldson draws the foul number Tonight at 10 Eastern after our mens

well A game that both teams thought they had to have And right now the Orange looking for a herculean finish to overcome this 10point deficit A real good job right there by Miami getting back in transition Freeman swiped away Shelton Henderson continues to make winning plays He does not look like a freshman and Henderson does not play like a freshman either I tell you what Jay on both sides of the basketball and he could guard one through five He he was just guarding a fourman right there a 611 guy and getting the strip on Donnie Freeman And a Miami team that loves to run in transition and be as fastpaced as possible now content to slow things down drain this clock leading by 10 Just about four minutes left in it And the guy that you go to in the half court again we talked to coach Lucas at shootound is Malik Rayu In the half court hes been doing a good job of being aggressive and also making decisions making plays for his teammates 46 of Miamis 77 points have come in the paint Hendersons got a lion share of them Passes off this time Allen lost the handle Jump ball one by Starling Twoon one Starling it up cheering Slams it home And its an eightpoint game And if youre Syracuse thats what you need Defense into offense Then you got to get out and push it Get easy opportunities at the basket Timeout Jay Lucas Hurricanes trying to hold on to a critical road conference win 338 to play Theyve got an eightpoint lead after this white dunk Defense to offense JJ Stala just throw it up Sadique White will finish it Second chance points is quite literally the difference in this game Miami with the basketball Donaldson has been their closer in crunch time The senior point guard has it here AND HE was off in the final stages of the last two games and it resulted in two Miami losses that time Makes the right play An easy layup for Renu How about Donaldson and how quick he split that getting into the lane and then dropping it to Ray New Trey Donaldson Stling it up Finds bottom Syracuse has to work quickly Ramping up the pressure Foul call against White Neither team in the bonus Hey how about Donaldson right here You headed out Im splitting it Daddy Freeman two feet in the paint Then great job off right there to Ray New whos going to finish for you every time And a win against Georgia Tech a couple of weeks ago Randolph Childris our colleague called Donaldson Mariana Rivera He didnt know who he was He didnt know who Mariana Rivera was Got to educate the best closer in the history of baseball But its been Donaldson closing these games for Miami They are very comfortable with him in that spot because he is a big shot taker and a big shot maker but also a very capable passer And you know when you have a 154 record even though youre disappointed with how the two last games have gone if youre Donaldson in Miami you trust him to make winning plays in the clutch Absolutely And hes been doing it for his whole career He did it at Michigan and now coming here as as a senior at Miami when the game is on the line clutch situations hes not scared of it at all He wants the ball in his hands and hes going to be able to make plays for him and his teammates And it doesnt hurt that hes a 78 and a half foul shooter Thats who you want with the ball in their hands His hands if youre Miami and he fires the Canes up 10 Jay Syracuse has to work quickly They have to be able to get some moving and then attack right away fouling tried to kick it to the corner for Kings Knocked away This is where Syracuse they have to make quick decisions and hopefully its the right decision for them You know we were just talking about how Donaldson has made the winning plays for Miami Just feels like for Syracuse not just today but all season long they just have not made enough winning plays Well it has to come from your guards Those are the guys who are going to have the ball a majority of time in the game They have to be able to make plays and look and be aggressive Kings through contact gets it to go for two Kings has been really solid this whole year for Syracuse being aggressive finishing at the rim And the Orange have gone fullcourt pressure here Trailing by eight 220 remaining Renu breaks the press Allen lobs it up Easy finish Ernest Duday And the Canes lead by 10 again And if youre Miami you dont have to force anything Just take care of the basketball and see the open opportunity cheering I got screaming both of these teams have made their last five shots So Syracuse getting the makes on the offensive end but they cant stop Miami on the defensive end to cut into this 10point deficit And now confusion on the inbounds They just get it into Freeman Miami swarming and Syracuse forced to take a timeout On a threegame losing streak and and the big thing right here for Syracuse you got to get it in either JJ Starlings hands or Nate George and look to get downhill If they trap you somebody flash Kings fires a three Hits it or do that Jay Henderson freshman throws out of the trap Alab U in control hammers it home But how about the patience right there by U He could have went up and tried to force it Played off two feet Got an easy dunk for two We have seen a lot of rim rockers for Miami in this game Kings step back all alone Way off the mark Starling the offensive rebound George He cant hit the three Only a minute left in Miami Going to kill this clock Syracuse isnt even fouling You have to foul if youre Syracuse And now it might be too late I mean you just let 20 seconds come off the clock Do get the steal up ahead George Betsy trailing three Misses it U gets the rebound You have to foul if you have to foul Theres no I dont know what Syracuse is doing feels like theyre content to just let Miami leave the dome with a win and a very quality win for this Hurricanes team This will be a quantu win right now ESPN bracket just and its just the opposite for Syracuse Well it just Jay it just felt like that last minute of the game Syracuse just gave up That was a lopsided score but typically teams would keep fouling in that situation to extend the game Yeah they played how they wanted to play Syracuse adjusted went zone Second half Miami figured it out They had a really good showing But Miami comes into the dome and Jay Lucas and the Hurricanes A convincing win 8576 Coming up next
