Louisville trying to get its first road win in more than two years and Miami controls the opening tip Nigel pack hes been a little banged up of late as well had a tweaked ankle still played 41 minutes in the overtime lost awake popper inside Nord Shadow Meir left it short and an early foul it is on louisv Vol and theyre going to get the former Kane Donal Yovan and youre going to see a ton of dribble handoffs and high ball screens with Arad nir diving to the ring he got great hands and the ability to finish around the basket the spacing of this Miami offense is absolutely terrific why because spacing is created by shot making and theyre going to have four guys on the court at all times that can shoot 40 from the three when you look at the offensive numbers for this team they jump off the page its mindboggling it really is threepoint shooting was absolutely spectacular they share the basketball they post the basketball they beat you in transition they beat you from the three not in a half threes made a game just incredible hery Miller making his first start as a Louisville Cardinal today hes a walk on hes got the ball now and the Cardinals turn it over that was a problem last time out against pit 18 turnovers led to 28 Pittsburgh points Matthew Cleveland lines up a three offensive rebound omir good ball movement Nigel pack the swish hes shooting a career best 46 from distance Jay Wright the former coach at Villanova had a philosophy good better bets give up a good shot to get a better shot to get the best shot and thats exactly what Miami did just there sky Clark averaging almost 15 a game for Louisville inside Brandon Huntley had field and the three from the wing is good Thats Mike James who had 23 points last time out against pit part of a sophomore class that you want to see Step Up This is a sophomore class that is the foundation of liouville basketball that was a really solid possession the ball went inside kick out outside and James was shot ready too easy for NORAD oir over his last five hes averaging a double double almost averaging one on the Music Applause season the ability for Miami to be able to defend one through four and switch and still keep the ball in front so important yovanovich out of control the Lefty spent last season with Miami played in one game only played two minutes and due to injuries which have taken their toll on Louisville theyre down to seven scholarship players hes been pressed into the starting lineup and Louisville cannot turn the basketball over theyre going to have a chance to win this basketball game and Miami Feasts in the fast break in the open court benley Joseph Catch and Release battle for the board out of bounds to Louisville solid defensive position by Louisville you know Louisville they got to take care of the basketball they got to rebound the basketball they need someone to be able to step up but to me over the course of the game they got to do the hard things consistently and well get into those hard things as the game goes along entry pass another turnover up ahead Cleveland ahead of the pth to the slam and thats three turnovers in 2 and A2 minutes and then that cannot happen if Louisville is going to have a chance to win this game make simple plays played and simple 5050 decisions cant make it make the right play make the simple Music play no fees or minimums and no overdraft fees are another reason banking with Capital One is an even easier decision than this Ill take Barkley yes yep even easier than that whats in your wallet this is not just a refill this is being independent together Walgreens Music now this is a Louisville team down to just seven scholarship players missing Trey white whos out again with a groin injury JJ trainer a double digit score out for this season they really never got Dennis Evans who has been ruled medically ineligible to play at Louisville he was the prize of the Freshman Class its been a challenge for the cards just to field bodies this season and for of Music their three of uh three turnovers on their first four possessions the miss that time on possession number five and that time Miami gives it up you know theres an art of an upset theres certain things you have to do if youre going to pull off an upset especially on the road and first and foremost you got to take care of the basketball secondly you got to take the other teams best player out of the game thirdly you got to rebound the ball in the defensive end and then someone has got to step up and make plays maybe its I Hatfield really good possession right there keeping the ball in the middle of the floor which opens up the RO he was a nonfactor the last couple of games after stringing together three straight double doubles omir puts it on the floor yanovich nearly knocked it away pack has the mismatch Cleveland so good with the midrange omir cant get the offensive rebound and here comes Clark Music Scott Clark the Illinois transfer at 20 earlier this year against Kentucky James from the outside his second three backto back solid offensive positions for possessions for louville good Pace read the defense read Advantage disadvantage get into your half court offense and then make the right decision omir thought about the three puts it on the floor and a blocking foul on James this is just really good basketball sky Clark a little penetration Mike James shot ready behind the basketball late close out and Mike James knocks down that three and then Mike James gets knocked down on the blocking foul trying to defend omir on three assist good ball movement good spacing and when they take care of the basketball theyve gotten a shot theyve wanted and on the other end defensively theyve been active and alert and a pretty good job of being in the right spot defensively taking driving Lanes away from Miami and creating some turnovers yeah the only issue early on for Louisville has been the turnovers three Louisville turnovers leading to five Miami points pack weaving inside kicks to popper over yovanovich and wga popper has blossomed into a star in his Junior season every time the guy shoots it you think its going in a 50 threepoint shooter you know hes a world class athlete what hes improved on is his footwork and his playmaking ability knocked out of bounds last touch omir watch his fight a little middle game Rhythm dribble Elevate knock it down watch his balance right here eyes on the rim get to a spot Elevate knock down that jump good job of attacking a matchup hes almost doubled his scoring from a season Music ago James a couple of Threes already and he has his third mik James coming off a big time game against pit the other day and seeing a very big basket James now eight for his last 10 from three Cleveland put too much on it in in Miamis losses theyve really struggled defending thats a two foot on the line and James sizzling hot early on this is like deja vu for the problems when the cane struggle is they struggle on the defensive end giving up 90 points a game in their losses not running people off the threepoint line and not making the opponent feel them right now Lille does not feel that Miami defense whatsoever popper from the outside where hes a 50 threepoint shooter and yovanovich has the board now you got to read Advantage disadvantage do we have an advantage if not lets try to make a play but a simple play James was open pack pokes it away goes behind the back Joseph to the ramp blocked by James Mike James is everywhere and thats thats an example of doing the hard things consistently changing ends of the floor running him down and getting a piece of that shot in transition that was a good looking shot by Curtis Williams it just didnt go Louisville made the extra pass omir to Cleveland he turns it over really good job Lou worked on doubling the post big to big and that double even though it was soft created a little bit of uncertainty but from omir numbers for Miami but popler in his first game back from injury turns it over watch right there theres the double watch watch pack watch the job of James he doesnt quit on the plate he stays with the plate doing the difficult things consistently thats what it is all about for this Louisville team now can they Main maintain that intensity of making the right play offensively and competing defensively ke Shawn George the Freshman that we highlighted in the open into the game for the first time for Miami George started the last four games with injuries to popper and Nigel pack good execution right there really good knocks it down boy and fego 14 points five of five from the field four for four from three and a little misdirection play along the Baseline James doing a really good job of catching it shot ready terrific Pace to the Louisville offense when they take care of the Music ball look how Lis defense heels to threepoint line more packline defensive principles keeping in the front taking away driving Lanes creating turnovers heres James already with 14 launches and H oh Mike James stole fire from Olympus popular the other way puts it in for two 16 points for Mike James less than 8 minutes into this game 16 of the 18 points and really good job Lille finding him finding him in transition finding him along the Baseline finding him off penetration George the theft the patience and one Music and thats what Kean George has I talk about High basketball IQ hes an experienced player whos a professional player overseas in France watch how he puts the defender on his hip puts him on his hip rides him to the front of the rim that way he can play through contact that is a high IQ veteran mature young 18yearold that made that play George a freshman from Switzerland and he has NBA Scouts drooling over what he can be DS be a little bit of Jeremy soan who played at Baylor same size skill level shoots it a little bit better than soan not as strong physically but a really talented young player George had been a perfect 10 for 10 at the free throw line prior to that Applause Music Miz Miami trying to extend defense a little bit right try to take Louisville out of any rhythm Louisville doing a nice job of reading that rooll hutley Hatfield cannot Music hit now George who was telling us about three years ago he was about 511 hes now 68 Here Comes Clark and the drop off is there Curtis Williams Miamis really struggling right now theyre trying to get in the lane and get paint touches but little s playing in those defensive gaps theyre bringing the ball into the help Defender its a quick pinch kick it make one more and then attack the close out AJ casy Miss Applause fires James entitled to a heat Checker too here I like what Louisville has been doing in terms of reading Advantage disadvantage then getting into their sets to try to move the defense James on the drive off balance follows his Miss blocked at The Rim it comes to pack pull up three offensive rebound Casey cannot give up extra possessions benley Joseph from the outside another one of those 40 threepoint shooters for Miami youve got five of them four of them on the floor at all times but due to tough things consistently you cant give up second shots CU a second shot is a kick out step in three Music Applause Clark on the drive turns it Applause over wide open George its good you know its been impressive great decision right there by pack great job of George running the four Jim Len AIS patience letting his guys figure it out they were down eight he let the game come to him he said you know what sometimes as a team I trust you youve got to go figure it out they figured it out by getting some stops and making better decisions in transition difference between a veteran team and a young team 100 that one doesnt go for Williams Casey clears Williams coming off a very good game the other night 10 for 23 and there it is and all of a sudden posted early Amir collects himself if Im k p I might get a timeout right now you got to find a way to play this game in four minute segments win the next four minute segment 80 run for Miami James again lets it go and that is his first Miss from three he had made his first four threepoint field goals James has 16 of the Louisville 20 good extra pass pack lines it up cant knock it down Glen The Freshman with the board Caleb Glenn and Curtis William two freshman on the floor for Music Louisville Caleb Glenn does all the little things hes a tough hard playing player hes got to play four and five a little undersized but a guy that plays with a sense of purpose Williams is a big time shot maker not sure thats a shot that coach Payne would like yeah Kenny Payne told us when he plays and shoots within the flow of the offense hes a really good player sometimes as a young player hell force it like he did there Joseph spots up Casey tracks it down another Second Chance second shots and turnovers you cannot give them up cant give a team as good as Miami extra possessions offensive foul on omir who cant believe Music it Miami good ball Mo B good space and make the extra pass bedley Joseph knocks down that three and then in transition kesan George do the tough things consistently Louisville you got to get matched up in defensive transition George knocks down to Big Three ready this wasnt no bear it was like a bear Squatch Dad whats a bear Squatch its a cross between a bear and a SAS made up hes usually sleeping hell never sleep again if you overdraw your account Wells Fargo gives you an extra day grace period to avoid the overdraft fee what if everything came with a grace period like accidentally parking where you shouldnt n that one gets an extra day like having an extra day grace period you can with Wells Fargo Ive got something you want what what is it all the best movies and television shows characters and stories theyre great themselves but you know what together theyre much better yeah Hulu everyone hang on and Disney plus this is our home better together for one low price with the Disney Music bundle Music Music he Music Music Laughter Laughter Music Kenny Payne in his second SE and his Louisvilles head coach he told us that shoot around what he told his team he said I go into every game believing we can win he told his players you have to believe 100 And if you think about Kenny Paynes Journey as a player as an NBA player working with Denny crumb working with Dana Alman working with John caliper hes had nothing but success uh getting this opportunity obviously working with Coach tho with the Knicks now getting this opportunity at Louisville this is a very tough business these sophomores have got to step up theyve got 18 games left in this season all right theyve got sophomores and they got freshman and one Junior those sophomores those freshman and that one Junior these next 18 games theyve got to show Improvement maybe not win any game every game but theyve got to win games and theyve got to show Improvement thats just the expectation of what is Louisville basketball if these guys are the foundation and they could go to the portal to build from here theyve got to sure that this Foundation is solid enough to go to the next level a year from now so next 18 games theyre going to have to play well and and prove it by their play by the way they carry themselves how they hard they compete and and theyve got to show Improvement game to game a shot clock inside five popper from the corner knocks it down last year I did the the Miami W flest game Miami wins the game close game we had a really nice game games over and erft one of the former un players when I was an assistant coach here was at the game so Im sitting in the stands visiting with him out comes wuga POA for 45 minutes lathered up just getting shots up his work ethic is insatiable he just his his commitment to getting better is unbelievable sheth you were telling me today you wanted to hit the treadmill for 45 minutes and you oh boy cut the time to 30 then you know showed to the hotel gym meanwhile Jim Lena is telling us wga popper is running the steps of the wats go Center they have to tell him to practice less they have to tell him to work out less look at that spot up you see W up because the step team was in good shape I walked over here to the watsco were you doing Laughter Music why at Dominos we know life doesnt always across the board it really started to the back end of last year you look at his yearbyyear progression this is a poster child for Player Development staying at one program a lot of times a guy doesnt play much as a freshman he goes to another school wga popper would have had that option he stayed he stuck it out he got better hes now thriving in this system he continued to work instead of complaining he continue to work I was saying your investment equals your expectation he invested in himself he bet on himself by getting in the gym putting in the extra work and each and every year hes gotten better another turnover driving the ball in the gaps all these turnovers are the same come to a jump stop make a play and were going to get a foul its going to be Applause onlille its George picking up his first every single one of these Miami Turners are are the same thing right here good Little Euro Step Right There 17 points for James we remind you Saturday triple header here on accn Boston College going to number 21 Clemson Tigers been rolling this season Georgia Tech beat Duke in Atlanta earlier this year now you got to do it at Cameron indor and Dukes playing as well as theyve played all season long when Tyrese Proctor went out similar to when wiga poppler went out all of a sudden other guy stepped up Mark Mitchell playing it with strength running the floor getting to the offensive glass driving the basketball being an elite Defender then Jared McCain over the last seven games almost 19 points a game almost 50 from the three the freshmans been absolutely Music spectacular pack with the shot cloth winding down smooth Johnson comes in you know if youre guarding pack youve got to run him off the threepoint line youve got to arrive on the catch with your hands above the ball and make him put It On The Ground Clark tried to navigate a triple team turns it over here comes George and Cleveland stepped out of bounds really nice job right here Nigel pack your guard Nigel pack you cant close out short you got to close out long hands above the ball make them put it down where youve got help every time they forced a drive theyve been in gaps but if you close out short youre going to give up wide open threes and that last transition even though Cleveland stepped out that time it was Kean George pushing the break it could be Matthew Cleveland it could be wga poppler it could be Nigel pack and thats what makes Miami so difficult to defend in transition where they score 21 points a game Jim Lena said even nor Chad oir has the green light Clark on the Baseline Drive Joseph a terrific Defender James gets tied up by pack and he traveled nine turnovers for Louisville Miamis got eight James 16 points in the first seven minutes with 5 minutes left hes only got another free throw since that hes got to catch that be patient hes got a matchup Advantage catch it collect yourself be patient read the defense quick jump hook use your size and strength thats better defense right there by Johnson lob inside omir threepoint opportunity and he stepped out of bounds both teams have turned it over a combined 18 times already you know Jim Len we asked him what what his team needs to be good at he said defend rebound and take care of the basketball and I said well you only turn it over about 177 of your possessions coach and he said yeah but thats about 1075 thats in the bottom half almost on all of college basketball thats not who we aspire to be meanwhile Curtis Williams left all alone and its 2826 Louisville five of eight from threepoint range came into the game shooting below 30 from three as a team Williams coming off the last four games averaging 11 a half points a game packs got two triples back iron Huntley Hatfield wins the battle for the Music board Clarks been very patient letting the game come to him this is a nice post help coming from the backside from Joseph Williams left alone and he thought about it too long missed the three and Cleveland rebounds it pushes the ball in transition and they get right into offense popler gets free and well go popler with his second three hes got 10 that is a world class jump shooter playing it simple he is a world class jump shooter and the effort defensively you know hes going to come off that screen you got to be above and catch and you got to defend him right at the level of the screen Tyler Johnson The Freshman will go to the line to shoot two watch MO coming off at this ball screen right here if youre defending wer off the ball screen a Defender defending the screen has got to be up all right you got to be up and force the ball back you cant level that screen off you cant be in drop coverage a little Quick Step Back W is going to knock down that three trap him get the ball out of his hands make someone else shoot the ball and make a play and a lead eight run those are the two deepest postseason runs in school history for the canes and back to back heres no one else in college basketball went to an elite eight in a final four over the last two years and Jim Len is a master coach hes a master program Builder uh and what hes been able to do here in Miami as you see this Banner hopefully up above taking Miami to the final four I was here in 8384 as an assistant coach when they brought basketball back to the University of Miami we didnt have a basketball we didnt have stationary we practiced outside we didnt have any players you didnt have stationary we didnt have anything we couldnt write a letter to a recruit just a piece of paper sent him a note got out and tried to find some dudes we ended up finding Eric Brown who ended up in the Hall of Fame but what Jim Len has been able to do taking the resources of this community and then his ability to coach his agility to basically mold his system to his Personnel its been absolutely phenomenal the guy belongs in the asith Hall of F Im still amazed so you were sending what brown paper packages no if we did we would have better players cuz most of the people back there that said Brown pet paper packages had a lot of cash inside Music them but Bill Foster who was the first head coach bringing basketball back was a master program Builder he did it at Charlotte which is now Charlotte UNC Charlotte and he did it here at Music Miami Tyler Johnson nice step back gets free and hits hes a guy he can be turnover prone at times but you see the upside yeah and under control make simple plays hit singles drive a gap be on balance create separation jump up and knock it down how about omir to the left hand and thats where hes developed I mean his ability to catch a face rip it and go shootting some threes runs the floor Johnsons three ribs out Joseph the rebound see you can get that shot anytime you want it right his job is to run his team and play off others swatted by Huntley Hatfield Here Comes Clark the Illinois transfer pushing they got a trailer Huntley Hatfield for three and its good he was 1 for seven from three this season prior to that well now he was two for eight mathematician I didnt use an abacus for that either they flatten the defense defense everyone gets level the ball on ball revers so the defense is inside out nice job thatf knocking down that three on balance Packs got a couple of Threes good step out on that ball screener open and it rims Applause out Louisville can tie with a three heres Williams Louisville now six of 12 from Deep Cleveland pushing and just runs right past Johnson thats a perfect example Cleveland comes with the rebound and now all of a sudden hes initiating your fast break loville you got to stop the basketball get the ball into control make him fan that ball out and then you can set your defense Inside Out Cleveland to the Florida state Music transfer he was Dens leading score last year down low the atfield missed the bunny Here Comes Cleveland again initiating the break almost a turnover popler Catch and Release got Applause it make plays for each other make the next pass one more all the things you hear coaches say thats exactly what Miami did in our possession drove it flatten the defense got it reverse made one more all right thats the one more to get you the open shot Clark and comes back to Johnson and he hits got to your point Seth why is Miami so good on offense if you watch its the amount of great shots they get look your space is created by your shot making and really good job defensively a little loose with the ball Johnson over rir and Lille with the hustle play Miami can hold for one Johnson give him good solid minutes right there Jim Lena gets the timeout hell try to get basically the last shot of the half well take one to Miami up by four 25 seconds to go with a half at Dominos we know life doesnt always go as planned which is why were giving you a free pizza enjoy thanks an emergency Pizza to use when you need it most here you go thank you no matter the reason Dominos has you covered thanks youre welcome get your emergency Pizza to use in the future when you order dominoes online both teams have shot it well in this first half Anish Rob Seth Greenberg Louisville 6 of 12 from three 48 from the field Miami 55 from the field you get the sense both coaches will preach ball security though at halftime yeah making decisions I mean mis taking it too deep right that dribbling the ball in the gaps where to help defenses there and theyre turning it over on the other end its really just Advantage disadvantage of just making simple plays for little overall special situations shot clocks off first play of the game first play of the half short clock situations underneath out of bounds side out of bounds right Jim lener does a great job and they did a great job today working on these short clock situations and foul to give great job right there by Louisville good recognition by coach two on Music yanovich and Louisville still has one more to give one to Music give I would not be surprised we saw a play watch the curl watch on this play all right I want you to watch benley Joseph number four hes going to curl and then Packs going to curl here comes the curl pack Falling Away Cleveland beat the buzzer it doesnt go and that takes us to halftime Miami that final yeah and this is a very good threepoint shooting team second in the country behind only Baylor sky Clark with a three and thats probably not the shot that you want right off the whistle to start the second half omir down low and the rebound comes to Mike James good job Hunley H getting back and contesting that shot at The Rim bad defensive transition no communication Clark missing the open three that time hes now 0 for four popper through traffic Cleveland the putback Matthew Cleveland nine points six rebounds already do the hard things consistently get back all right get back in the play thats a second chance opportunity off a transition Thea really fighting with James now trying to get him off the spot James trying to get posted up and isolated on the Block Clark on the drive and he finally gets this one to go his first field goal nice job of sky Clark they had a double Gap he got in that lane kept his chin on the rim good finish good spacing good good offensive possession omir posting up Huntley Hatfield the running hook Hy Hatfields getting omir a step off the block we get him a step off the block now all of a sudden a little bit more difficult for him to shoot that jump up Percy Miller number 15 for Louisville started the game a walk on making his first start of the Season hes the son of Master P the rapper Hunley Hatfield went right around omir great job no double by Miami theyre getting doing a good job Louisville getting the H Hunley hat posted up on that right block and notice his patience right there get to a little jump hook on the left hand topper blocked by Huntley Hatfield and Louisville can tie with a two take the lead with a three and Huntley Hatfield ties this game at 43 hes got 11 great start for loville right there getting stops getting out in transition connected defensively active defensively coming up with stop after stop right now great cut omir looking for Joseph and a Applause foul sharing the basketball making the simple play getting to the next play thats what Louisvilles done a nice job of to start this second Applause Music half Applause Music Curtis Williams into the game for hery Applause Music Miller popper against his former teammate yovanovich and popper on the follow cant get it and now Louisville another chance here to take the Applause lead 60 run by the cards yovanovich inside too much great look hes got to finish that Cleveland the hammer every time Cleveland gets a defensive rebound hes a human fast break takes it attacks he got to stop the basketball first Ru defensive transition stop the ball build the wall and then defend Inside Music Out James theres the turnover numbers for Miami Cleveland BL again and Applause one opportunistic watch right here Matthew Cleveland tack it Baseline to Baseline get the ball under control Corral the basketball notice his chin on the rim thats a little bit of a high percentage shot great job of Cleveland attacking in transition keep an eye on Nigel pack He Slipped at the threepoint line second going to go he got up very carefully and he is grimacing in obvious pain and hes going to come to the bench as Kean George the Freshman comes in remember pack was battling an ankle injury tweaked it against Wake Forest over the weekend as well he got his foot we see that again he got his foot caught on the back of his of the shoe of Huntley H he did not practice Monday and there was some question if he would go today but went through shoot around today practice yesterday with no issue one thing Miami has done every time Rs made a run they have responded good ball movement right here good recovery right there by Miami this is why I like George he givesa with size and that one hits the rim Here Comes George again Miami looking to run Cleveland through the defense draws the foul Im really big on Kean George for number reason High basketball IQ but watch him sit in the stance keep the ball in front move his feet thats 68 pressure the basketball good hand pressure take away penetration dont need any help thats what he adds to this Miami team 68 multipositional player who can defend the basketball and gives him some perimeter size that can guard the ball and contest shots ACC womens basketball ball that is tomorrow a double header Louisville ad pit and then Miami taking on number 11 Virginia Tech a chance to see the great elizabth kitley and they came off a huge win against NC State at home you dont just roll into Castle colle steam and get an easy W I can tell you that much speaking from experience how far back do we want to go not that Laughter far kans on a 60 run after Louisville tied to the game you know the one thing that happened today its been amazing you know I learned a lot about people really I mean I didnt realize that uh I was working with Al I mean as we were talking yesterday the coordinator notes you were at Starbucks uhh and the guy asked you who the Starbucks coffee was for and you said Al and I said whos Al and you said You Can Call Me Al in the words of Paul Simon and ring Larder but but heres the deal it saves a lot of headache on the back end if I give them an e you should only see what the cup says thats three consecutive baskets in transition floor balance shot selection your defensive transitions connected to your taking care of the basketball and your shot selection but you must have floor balance Kenny pay talked to us about that today Mike James to the free throw line popper the foul Matthew Cleveland mans a human fast break just takes it attacks it gets to the ri you got to stop the basketball first row of transition defense the tradition of Louisville basketball is as rich as almost any in college basketball history in the 80s when they won two championships they were pretty much a perennial National Championship Contender and his program when you think of Denny crumb and Rick patino to follow I mean for what a generation plus you had as much coaching stability as anybody and then its been constant turnover thats been the challenge for Kenny Payne where youre trying to resuscitate and rebuild a program thats had to deal with Scandal and Leadership change and its been constant and a great ownership like you speak to down the mitro you see Payton C I was there for the TDP you see Russ Smith theres tremendous ownership from those former players benley Joseph from the outside Miami has made its last four from the field and they extend to a ninepoint lead thats their largest of the game heres the challenge right now for Lille do the tough things consistently beginning the second half theyve given up nine points in defensive transition good job of getting the ball inside coming out of the timeout thats doing the hard things consistently when you get punched in the face how will you respond you respond by sitting in a stance getting stops getting rebounds being tough defensively and then competing and getting the shot you want offensively thats what Im looking for in the next 14 minutes from Louisville yanovich picks up his third a little ball screen and watch great job Hy Hatfield searching posting targeting and finishing 18 games to show Improvement 18 games to show Player Development all those things are imperative in terms of this freshman sophomore class and then Huntley half field well that time defensively they lost Matthew Cleveland Clark driving through the defense Williams catch and shoot he hits the three and thats excellent offense Baseline Drive youve got Baseline Drift But Williams getting into the window the windows the area all right to create space inion of the p pass George off the feed from Joseph and yvanovich couldnt control the rebound you mentioned these tipping points Kenny Payne talk to us about them there have been times this season Louisvilles in a game things maybe go a little off kilter and then all of a sudden the game gets off track you saw Miami extended nine Louisville finds an answer with Curtis Williams and right now Louisvilles playing four minute games they got to win the next four minute game and that means theyve got to be really solid defensively Miami watch Nigel pack 24 coming off a screen right here Bo little screen screener here he comes tack back in the game Baseline jumper left it short another offensive rebound Joseph A Long three and a rebound to Williams Benny Payne olling his team to run simple plays Applause now and a blocking foul called on benley Joseph is first you know what you can see right now you can see some confidence growing in this Louisville team Im seeing Curtis Williams a little F fist pump Im seeing guys now having a theyre energy givers to each other pardon me second foul on Joseph third a team foul on Miami Jim L going to use this minute 35 to give nor Shadow a little blow get into that 12minute time out and then try to bring him back only two fouls in good shape Casey a very good rebound has done a really good job rebounding the ball doesnt give him that offensive uh punch that obviously oir gives him so if youre louville or you going to Huntley Hatfield here yes without a doubt heres a rescreening a post itll stay with Applause Louisville Coach pay said after you set that screen shape and you got to come to the basketball you cant fade dont get pushed off it right there there it is they get it into the big guy hows the pace puts it on the flooor and a foul before the shot thats K pay seeing a match up saying coming out of this this underneath that of bounds plate Ive got a match up I like and you see what hes saying the H you have to catch it face watch it faces rips puts it on the floor and through the foul on Casey they tried to go right back to their big guy its stol away eny Joseph fourth in the ACC and Steels Casey at the other end with two free throws coming loville done a better job of taking care of the basketball since those first 10 minutes but you got to fake a pass to make a pass no the passer is the eyes of the receiver but right there you got to move the defense with your eyes he telegraphed that pass by looking exactly where he was trying to make a pass ball fake away from it bring the ball back and then post it Louisville has done a better job of taking care of the ball seven turnovers in the first 10 minutes of the game that was just the fourth since Casey entered the game seven for 11 from the line on the season what of the hard things for Louisville right now you cant give up transition buckets you cant give up second shots you cant give pack wide open threes and then offensively you must dictate the shot that you want from who you want to K Tyler Johnson forn red gave Louisville some good minutes off the bench in the first half you had eight points hes got a you see on the right hand side of your screen Hatfields got to work harder to hold that seal Johnson gets the screen from the elbow and the rebound to George this is where hes really good Applause 68 see his size he can see over defense is so easily he can play four positions he can defend four Applause positions how much is pack favoring that ankle Cleveland battle for the board one by James great defensive possession by Louisville keeping everything in front no dribble penetration kept the ball in the perimeter and forced a contested shot James on the dribble Drive blocked by Cleveland Cleveland triggering the break on man fast break patience the trailer rebound Clark Williams the corner three too strong good decision right there Casey has George wide open puts it on the floor the extra pass Louisville recovers and Joseph walked mediate timeout with 1151 to go in the second half Cardinals showing that so dangerous in transition especially off of defensive rebound and then he is a consistent offensive rebounder gets to the glass but if he has an angle he will put it on your head its incredible isnt it you lose Isaiah Wong the ACC Player of the Year you lose Jordan Miller who was a Swiss army knife for Miami last year and offensively there has been little to no drop off Matthew Cleveland is kind of like Jordan Miller 10 hes not the multipositional defender not as sneaky around the basket in terms of like maybe hes back to the basket getting angles but man is he a good player three LEL scorer runs the floor and his ability to put it down and be explosive in transition Kenny Payne trying to get that thing inside again making omir defend good job getting him off the off the block he cant turn this over now good pass great position by Huntley Hatfield hes got 15 remember he didnt play all that well against Pittsburgh only had three points and Kenny Payne said after the game thats not acceptable they need more from their big guy and great Patience by Johnson instead of trying to hit a home run pivots patience lets hacki reestablish in the paint catch and finish really important right now Louisville two stops in a row they got to get two stops in a row b lineup for Miami with Casey and omir out there along with George and another rebound by Huntley Hatfield thats Music Applause one this ball is going inside watch on the right hand side of your screen itll either be a cross screen or a post isolation Here Comes middle ball screen to get him posted up got him heres James and he is fouled he still doesnt have a a field goal since the opening 715 casy picks up the foul but I like him aggressively coming up that pin down and curling it to try to get in the Music lane Mike James got off to a blistering start 16 points in the first s minutes plus 19 for the game non shooting foul so they will inbound from underneath its Miami fifth foul both teams have five fouls both teams have three timeouts Music left George staying with Williams now the Freshman Glenn over Cleveland got the soft bounce I like Glen he knows exactly who he is not going to try to do things he cant do he plays hard hes going to defend he can rebound the basketball and he can catch it in the paint and you cant cant let him catch it that deep really good job time out by Jim look at the upcoming schedule for Louisville boy it does not get easy they get Miami tonight a team thats off a final four and then NC State UNC Wake Forest looks like a sweet 16 team before a top 15 Duke comes to the Y Center and all different styles of basketball right there obviously the pack want to get up and down Alando wake played his best game of the year the other day against PJ Hall Duke with their injury Tyrus Proctor is playing their best basketball develop in their bench this is an absolute huge next four minutes for this L basketball team with that schedule ahead can you win the next four minutes its a Louisville team has not won a road game in more than two years good look there by popper it doesnt go and Louisville can tie with a three down Court comes back out Williams for the tie and Louisville pulls even George the other way they were sleeping in Miami caught Applause him what a great play for Louisville in transition Hunley Hatfield with a terrific Poise to make that play Williams a big time sh cant get sped up right now cant turn it over got to have floor balance you cant give up second shots you got to keep the game in front and get the shot you want there you go but Hatfield strong inside really good ball movement right Applause now Miami has not had much success inside in the half court sets well try it here heres the double omir slips through the defense and draws the foul they have made him work today what theyre doing is to comeing with a big to big double what that means is ball goes inside the other biggest player is going to come and double and weak side theyre going to get a tight eye and force any pass out you cant let that double be split theyre getting the ball out of norchard or mirs hands forcing him to kick it out and then they can close to the shooters and Miami has not shot the ball great from the three p line big picture on those Inside Out doubles yeah its the second best threepoint shooting team of the country just nine of 25 today its one of the best free throw shooting teams in the country and just four of nine today at the strike you know Mir is really struggled right now hes finding him made a free for thats one for four if Im not mistaken now Miami as a team came into the game better than 80 at the line now from Miami youve got to Bow your neck everyone says you know in games youve struggled you havent been able to get stops youve given up 90 points a game in your losses James is fouled so what do you got to do Miami Miamis got to get rid of that reput ation of not being able to get stops it starts with pressure on the ball it stops with making your opponent feel you and it stops with starts with rebounding Applause misses undersized up front that is an issue so you got to pressure the ball the best way ball pressure buys time of defending the post if you dont pressure the basketball now you can sight the post and feed the PO James has 19 they get it inside to Huntley Hatfield working on omir dips under and able to draw the foul and Louisville with a chance for its first lead of the game since Midway through the first half watch how Pati Hunley Hatfield is no double to me Im surprised that Jim Len he can run a double cuz this is not a great threepoint shooting team this Lille team instead of playing oneonone in the block Hatfield taller patient has a really good jump hook get the ball out of his hands run a second Defender at him Zone up on the back side make him a passer tied at 60 and we are super excited about gymnastics on acc Network Friday and Saturday night at nine Eastern all part of three quad meets as Huntley Hatfield gives Louisville its first lead since about the 11minute mark of the opening half and L will give it a little bit of different look right here theyre going to go a little they get matched up out of this a go match up just a little two21 pressure Denny crumb style back to manto man Joseph using the shot face it comes to Cleveland three is not there offensive rebound omir foul on the floor on the board they get the Freshman Music Glenn must finish possessions shot goes up you cannot follow the Flight of the ball shot goes up find your man cut him out then go rebound to basketball both teams are in the bonus so a one and one for nor shadir a native of Nicaragua and he gets the front end last three seasons omir has averaged a double double did it twice at Arkansas saw State once it in Miami if he does it again this year be the first player since 2019 Eastern Washington James Robinson the fourth who average a double double in four consecutive years theyre going to look to post this thing James strong to the 10 got it Louisville by two the steal by Clark good extra pass Clark hits the three Kenny Payne pumps his fist Louisville by five Jim Len is going to let him play a lot of trust in your team you got the 8 Minute timeout coming up in the next dead ball you must have a good possession right now of your Miami George cannot answer and the rebound coralled by Louisville that was a settle right there H in the half court Miami has gotten stuck the last few possessions Louisville doing a good job of keeping the ball in front heels to threepoint line you can feel the pendulum swing heres Clark that doesnt go omir is there not Miami Im trying to play ahead in the defense Miamis missed nine of its 10 last 10 from the field and right that has to do with Ls defense very slow getting into their offense right now mi nice C popper able to sell the foul loo making the right place making a hard hard plays being consistent in their effort really good job hard curl good lefthanded finish and then sky Clark steals the in bounce Pats relocates and knocks down to three good decisions good Miami has been almost Invincible at home the last few seasons Louisville has lost 22 straight true Road games and yet the Cardinals with a fivepoint lead less than 7 minutes to go in a Seth Greenberg all right lets start with Louisville whats the key for the Cardinals to take this home continue to take care of the basketball they only have two turnovers in the second half no turnovers for touchdowns set your defense keep Miami in front limit them to one shot right now Miamis one for their last 10 and then offensively punch that thing inside youre in the bonus play through the post in transition read Advantage disadvantage you dont have numbers run off offense get the shot you want dont let Miami dictate the shot you want and if youre Miami what do you want to do here you got a veteran team you got Poise you got seven minutes left in this game you know its a threepoint game right now commit yourself on the defensive end you got to get multiple stops you get multiple stops try to play ahead of the defense and then the half cour you got to run your offense with better Pace right now the Miamis offense is not the very good Pace Nigel pack back in the game theres the one he was favoring that ankle early popper rattles into three and were tied and thats we said get a stop get out of transition play ahead of the defense now Lille do the hard things consistently dont get pushed out get the shot you want Miami sit the STS push him out disrupt a little bit of his rhythm and rebound to Music basketball Curtis Williams lets it Fly Cleveland hes been a oneman fast break extra pass packed sets and the rebound to Huntley Hatfield who saves it from going out of bounds you mentioned something a second Nigel pack he didnt catch that clean his your your shot making start your defeat and he was not behind the ball and he was not on bounds this things got to go inside are you watching he is not moving like himself go get I dont understand why they are not doubling the post and Huntley hanfield continues to eat hes got 21 hes getting hes patient hes getting two feet into the paint hes reading the defense youve got to get the ball out of his hands he was not much of a factor offensively the last two games but did have three straight double doubles prior benley Joseph cant hit and now Louisville will slow things down I love what lilles doing no Advantage get the shot you want run a set run it with pace execute Clark down the lane heres James contested three its good really good straight game with five threes for James halfcourt execution really solid for this rable team 24 points for Mike James now pack gives it up to popper Baseline in and out no rush Applause Kenny pay really doing a good job orchestrating this game you got to go into bouns hudley outfields going to go at omir the Double doesnt come now he picks up the dribble shot clock at three Clark down the lane the runner tipped up to omir I am really surprised Miami is not trying to do something where they cant Cleveland splashes the three four point a twopoint game and four minutes to go this crowd has finally gotten into it and Joseph def fend without fouling fouling negates hustle got to be disciplined defensively offensively you got to get the shot you want Id go they keep going to Huntley Hatfield hes been battling with omir pop the other way the love Cleveland thunder coming down the tracks getting a stop playing ahead of the defense Louisville sets their defense theyre fine I get a timeout right now but I would challenge my team say we got a threeminute game right here great timeout by Kenny pay P Clevelands been absolutely terrific in his basketball game good kick out shot ready show your hands it starts with your feet up behind the ball and then running the floor defensive transition you get a stop you can play ahead of the defense we got a three minute game Louisville theyre going inside this next Music possession I walk

ready for the NFL playoffs I was born ready dramatic entrances check team of Destiny check nightmare matchups check all the heart pumping playoff action of your dreams check Applause please Im not sure many expected this game to be this close this late here we are Louisville looking to snap a 22 game Road win streak Miami has won 25 of its last 26 on its home floor and E shro the coach Seth Greenberg tied with a little more than three to go and Nigel packs back in this game I would not be surprised if Kenny Payne tries to do some type of dribble handoff with pack and Huntley Hatfield or some type of ball screen so you attack pack playing on a bum ankle but you get Huntley hfield down into the block and I expect my to do somehow some way double the post on on the bounce not on the catch but on the bounce I wouldnt go on Bley Jose if hes their best of hair comes thats a w heres the inside its tipped away Glen and on finish pack the rebound little misdirection to get posted up had posted up on that left Applause block little Spain action back screen for for oh man they had him popper using the shot fake down the lane off the window cannot finish good job that was a ball screen back screen for a lob and then creating a matchup problem good drive by Applause luga James turbines in and draws the foul getting the ball to James in the middle of the floor where he has space really good job really good execution watch you get him to him in the middle of the floor no help pack staying home on the shooter Williams in the corner which gives James a chance to make a Music play three fouls on popper Applause not at stake right here this is what you call a program win opportunity for L its the two shot foul and James with that basket ties his career high of 25 points set that in the season opener Applause a new career high 26 for James Louisville by two talk about special situations time and score late clock plays lets see what they dial up pack puts it up from Deep came up short offensive rebound to Applause Joseph moving standing around Joseph now his three not there a lot of red jerseys and a rebound to Clark and I would say why why you didnt move the ball you didnt move people all right basically both of those possessions were settle threes Cleveland nearly defensively for Miami right now keep it in the front defend without foulon valo dictate the shot play downhill shot clock in single digits Clark tough basket inside great job dont settle make the fishing make a call play Applause downhill Cleveland the long two omir grabbs the offensive rebound and were going to get a foul against Louisville they get Glenn its the Freshman second bonus omir today just three of six from the free throw line on the season 87 to Career best here the length of Huntley haill has bothered all me and he misses the front end of the one and one Miami has a team eight of 15 from the Applause strike 10 and a 10c violation AJ Desai making the call now I think the officials may talk about Music Applause it 28 wait a second the Clock Was set at 28 run that back Applause again we can go if we can run that back that that that missed and that missed free throw there was 28 seconds left on the clock and this is not a 10second violation all so its St but watch what happens when the ball crosses half point I got to get it up across before man that is really close wow that is awfully close and if we can run that back one more time officials at the monitor it almost seemed like the clock started before the ball was touched by the rebounds if you can show that one more Music time ball Music shot possession is established established lets freeze it right at at 19 stop it its at 20 thats it now you know what its its its going to be Miami Music ball Mi thats pretty good officiate cuz Ill tell you in in it didnt seem like it was exceptionally long it kind of caught us by surprises well no doubt about it good team officiating good use of of the clock Applause now for Miami you got plenty of time youre going to go youre getting two for one you got to make sure right now you get you get shot you want you do not need a three I think theyll go fairly quick theres the lob both feet inside the popler its tipped away Louisvilles got it its a two possession game and now Joseph commits the foul against CL you got to we had some clock issues again got two seconds went off on the Music clock thats a special situation played at Miami we could see that again that little curl but if youre going to run the curl for for wuga poor that things got to be at the ring watch on the right hand side of your screen right heres the heres the foul youll see the clock continue to run two and a half seconds so benley Joseph picks up his third foul and itll be a one and one for sky Clark from here on out both teams will be in the double bonus turnovers Miamis inability to really take care of the Applause Music basketball youre Kenny Payne youre Louisville youre trying to find that Beacon of light and whats been a tough couple of Seasons a road win at Miami would more than qualify and it gives this program not just the season it gives this program the type of momentum they have not had in a long time you know thing does it sets a standard this is what were capable of so this is the standard that Kenny Payne can hold his team to all right the next four games this is who we are this is how we win this is our standard right now this is what these guys need to be held accountable this is not anyone can do something once then you got to go validate those wins timeout Kenny Payne to set the defense and when we were at shootaround earlier today Kenny Payne gathered his team near midcourt right at the very end and he told his players emphatically I go into every game believing we can win and then he almost shouted in caps lock to his players he said you have to believe 100 that was that was that was a moment we both looked at each other and Kenny P has been successful his whole coaching career now rebuilding a program especially in the portal age is hard because everyone expects it to be done right away especially in a brand as rich as as Louisville and you do have to win and theyre going to need more of these wins but this shows whats possible I always said the start of the broadcast I said to freshman sophomores and Huntley Hatfield theyve got to basically show hope all right and thats what theyve done today in step one pack a deep three the rebound battle won by Curtis Williams hes fouled by Cleveland and Louisville can see the Finish Line This is not a roster either set thats devoid of talent they brought in some impact transfers theyve had some injuries its been real in fact tonight theyre playing with seven scholarship players its kind of been the case the last last few times out Miami tonight Miami played with seven scholarship players that happened a few years ago but Miami tonight got to full strength with wer coming backer coming back Pat kind of rolling that ankle a little bit but you know for Kenny Payne this is whats possible you think about the Freshman Curtis Williams stepped up and gave him some scoring Glenn gave him a little bit of toughness uh James came out the start of the game a Florida kid came out knocked down shots these are programed wins but you must validate those wins Williams knocks down both free throws he has 13 points hes playing his best ball in his freshman season double digit scoring in three straight games in four of the last five Jim have to shoot around whatd he say he didnt feel good about your R he didnt think his guys were locked in down eight pack kicks to Cleveland Louisville gets the rebound omir commits the foul and Huntley Hatfield whos got a career high 21 with a chance to tack on let me ask you Huntley Hatfield plays like this every night its a different team they dont turn it over its a different team they compete and keep the game in front of them its a different team and when I say hold your team accountable thats what now this is a standard they set they they were close against Texas they were close against Indiana right this is a breakthrough win close against Virginia Tech right this is a breakthrough win now this is the standard doesnt mean theyre going to win every game but you see if you compete you see if you stay together you see if you do the tough things consistently it puts you in position to have a chance to win and they did that tonight Louisville on the verge of ending a 22 game Road losing streak when was the last time that Louisville had a win a a program win now they played these guys last year now remember now they played these last guys last year and they had a chance to win this time they finished Applause it Music Applause Josephs three is not there Tyler Johnson has the rebound and Miami will not foul live by the three you die by the three and thats exactly Miami didnt defend the way they needed to do didnt double the post and didnt shoot the three Louisville closes the game on a 90 run and the Cardinals pick up their first road win since January 2nd 20 2022 they come to Miami and knock off a team that
