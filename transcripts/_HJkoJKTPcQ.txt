when he starred for Wake Forest now in his first season at SMU and we are underway the yellow jackets with the basketball first in their old gold uniforms with the black lettering and the white trim George loves to pass first gives it off to the Freshman who drives strong along the Baseline Jaden moff with the first two points of the day he is also a key for Georgia Tech he he can get to the basket and make plays at a high level and finishes as you can see DJ Edwards along with boy Miller in the back court Matt cross hes an ACC veteran as well having had stops at Miami and Louisville hes got his first three points big time first set from seu they worked on that in the shoo round tonight today and the funny part about it he handed off every time today this point he shot it cross at 38 on the year coming in he is one for one today Lance Terry the leading score on the year for Georgia Tech number zero averaging over 15 per night four on the shot clock kicked Away by Music George and so they reset the shot clock to 20 and Georgia Tech maintains possession see what they come out in first Music off the hesitation its turnover by Lance Terry quickly back the other way Edwards this is the pace SMU wants to play and its great activity on both on the defensive end from SMU they want to get up and down the floor and make create easy baskets on the other end well the Mustangs are back home after being swept by the blue bloods in the ACC Duke here 8962 and then last Saturday then Tuesday in Chapel Hill they lost to the Tar Heels and so trying to get themselves back on track against tech Cross tough Runner no tipped up no second effort by CET yigu and finally Tech comes away with it great activity from SMU to start this game Im sure the coach are pleased to see them attacking the glass and creating great Music opportunities Georgia Tech coming back from its poorest offensive performance of the season lost Tuesday at Syracuse where they just couldnt make their shots foul on the crosscourt pass committed by bofy Miller you would like to see bofy get away from that one its a cheap one to get this early in the game two minutes in 32 Mustangs must had a good game Tuesday against Syracuse but thats going to be an illegal screen and that is already his second personal fight Music foul there are the numbers that were so ugly at the JMA Wireless Dome the free throws were shocking that they missed so many and thats atypical for this yellow jackets team this year they have been good offensively long three by the new man in the starting lineup Chuck Harris one of the tri captains in the starting five today for Andy Enfield nipon you was doing a good job of moving the ball thats one of the thing that coaching staff wanted to implement in this game is get the ball movement back to where it was before they these last two games losing Ryan Mato missed the layup ball knocked out of bounds back to SMU once again great play by Boy creating open shots for his teammates and thats what he needs to do at a high level is get his teammates involved because everyone knows he can score the ball once he gets his teammate involved its going to open up the floor for him you saw number two in old gold Javen McCollum come into the game he was part of the problem shooting the basketball at Syracuse 3 for 13 0 for four from the yard that was after consecutive 20point games yigu Andy Enfield told us this morning his upside is the NBA yeah if youre not going to double him down there go to work dont waste no time he is every bit of 72 265 lb and just freshman every bit of it then he blocks Matumbo SMU having rattled off eight straight points as the basketball again and thats a great sign for SMU they were kind of disappointed in him in the last game cuz he had no blocks against Carolina Edward 112 SMU Big Time shot SMU coming up how have they been getting it done theyre playing a defense with with a in a high level yigu protecting the paint active hand protecting the paint creating easy turnovers and theyre getting on to the run and easy shots and booby Miller is making plays for their team and thats what he has to do for them to be successful well this is a perfect offensive formula to start the game for Andy Enfield his point guard has four assists all of his fellow starters have each scored a bucket Edwards has three cross has three Yus got two Harris has three SMU has four made buckets is assisted by Boy Yes and boy thats the next step for him for him to control the pace of the game control the game to his liking for his team to be successful and make sure his guys are getting great shots one of the big messages from coach Enfield since their last game too boopy was youve got to be more efficient with your shots he was only three of 15 in the loss to North Carolina he says I can deal with three for eight but if youre not shooting it well youve got to pass the ball better strong drive by Lance Terry to snap the 110 run and thats who needs to get going for them to get Georgia Tech into the game a little bit nice drive and dish but a travel yigu shuffled his feet its the first turnover committed by SMU big fella got a little Happy Feet in there he is going to be good yeah hes going to be good good hands Good Feet right and the thing is with him now theres a lot of tall people in this world but theres not a lot of tall people that can move like he can good active hand here comes bopy going one on two little pullup able to knock it down its now out five SMU starters have scored I really like how bops playing the game right now hes really letting the game come to him and not really forcing anything and you can tell its helping SMU out a Music lot Ibrahim Suare number 30 sets the screen George got Miller in the air who picks up the personal foul and that is as you say personal foul number two on the standout point guard for SMU so bopy will take a seat and Karo quendo will come in and this would be a good test for SMU to play a different type of style without their uh 39 point guard out there very AC Edwards tries to track it down out of bounds back to Georgia to and welcome to Dallas we are here at Moody Coliseum with Ste Vinson Im Doug Sherman at SMU is coming off an 110 run to take this early lead and the point guards are the big story coming in Nathan George leads the ACC and assist per game bopy Miller is fourth in the conference yes and boy Miller is setting the tone for this game so far and controlling the pace and unfortunately he has two fouls right now but well see what SMU can do without him being on the court mustaf misses close and yes the two personal fouls after a great start by Miller have him on the bench Kio okendo into the game early for Andy Enfield as they go inside the big fella Chuck Harris got the start today hes got it knocked out of bounds and SMU will keep SMU 2 and2 in League Play Georgia Tech 2 and3 and this is is a game that will keep SMU on the bubble Joe lonardi has the Mustangs in his next four out meanwhile Georgia Tech could use a win here today to help further its cause of getting onto the bubble Edwards the bucket plus the foul great drive by Edwards using the left Music hand great Pace coming off this ball screen seeing what the defense is giving them creating space and get knocked upside the head and finishing top first foul on mustaf he earned it for sure and so Brian Edwards Jr BJ Edwards goes to the line his dad Brian senior played football at ETSU although it looks like hes going to head to the bench and uh has some blood perhaps you got him good do you review that I would think so and it looks like previous plays on review going a review for a potential flagrant foul anytime someone draws blood youre going to go to the video monitor all right and see if it was flagrant lets see here I mean he was trying to block the shot but I would say this its probably a flagrant foul definitely contact to the Head winded up playr foul nothing too egregious though he drew blood so and Ali Cassel confers with the other two officials as the training staff for SMU stops the bleeding hopefully on BJ Edwards and there is MCH and someone else will be chosen to shoot the two free throws and that will be Chuck Harris the 64 Senor from Ashburn Virginia back into the starting lineup this afternoon for Andy Enfield and the 83 foul shooter misses the Music first Georgia Tech has to Chang the pace of this game SMU is really comfortable in all the sets theyre running theyre running cleanly theres no physicality if Georgia K can do that they can change up the pace open a little bit in their favor tiet gorner 69 senior number five is into the game hes got the basketball now first time weve seen him this afternoon little deeper into the bench than perhaps Andy Enfield would have liked this early but goopy Miller has fouls and the injury to Edwards Harris makes it 18 to4 for SMU if the Yellow Jackets going to make a run to get back in it they need that man jav and mullum to heat up and he can scored in bunches averaging nearly 12 points per game he missed time early of the season with a concussion cross terrific turnaround and use of the window hes playing at a high level hes really look patient on this end of the floor shooting the ball at a high clip and just taking what the defense gives now Techs got to take care of the basketball nine possessions they have four turnovers now make it five turnovers and SMU looking to make him pay Harris over the top no the foul underneath comes before Harris released the basketball so says the Baseline official Isaac Barnett although now perhaps is he being overruled by his fellow officials Music Applause I knew they were going to test me again all right youre one for one before even looking at the replay the threepoint shot is under review to see if the shot was released prior to the offensive foul so the offensive foul is going to go against samat yigu who was battling in the paint for position and did the foulc Feld Pinson before the shot was released I think the baskets good all right I think the baskets Music good jab shot call yeah that ball was been gone seems like it yeah did he foul him the threepoint shot is confirmed two for two come on now you got the hang of this thing all listen Im a competitor coach Williams always used to tell us that youre a glue guy youre a glue guy on this side of the court now you like that I like it I like it at the end of the day Im going to try to win everything I can do hes Theo Fenson the former North Carolina Tar Hill how many final fours did you get to two final fours One National Championship all right we got to mention that every time absolutely 237 the Run current for SMU is 12 to3 and again Tech has to take better care of the basketball theres another turnover as Terry is called to the offensive foul o quendo was right there in good legal guarding position Epson is really connected on the defensive end its causing a lot of trouble for Georgia Tech Georgia Tech has to figure it out now this can get ugly real quick Johan trayor coming off the bench here today for SMU onto the floor Harris over Terry for two hes one of four 1000 Point scores on this potent SMU roster I think Chuck har is like to start yeah doesnt everybody yeah former Butler Bulldog one of the carryovers from the Rob laner Rim who was let go after the season and replaced by Andy Enfield with a move into the ACC the coach an said they had two great practices before this game so its no secret and no surprise that theyre coming out with this high intensity right now first foul on cross and thatll send the local kid Duncan Powell red shirt Jr who went to Doo High School grew up just a few minutes from where we are here at Moody Coliseum and said hes got how many friends and family at least 30 plus so he feels good coming off the bench with three quick points two time transfer who began his career at North Carolina ENT and it was interesting his observations about the disparity between being an athlete and an HBCU and now being here at such a beautiful campus with all the best facilities in the ACC very humble kid appreciates the little things coming from the HBCU and Im sure theyre trying to do everything they can to improve those things in the HBCU community Music o quendo had a step on Music George cross posting up on Powell over the left shoulder cant get the roll he has been so productive this year since transferring from UMass where last season he was first team all A10 count it and one by and Dango the sophomore from senagal has a chance for three great pass by Nate George hitting indeno in the in the pocket and Ando making a big time finish going over two theyve got to find a way to tap into nongo he had such a great freshman year rivaling Georgia Tech rates like Chris Bosch and Derek favers and his numbers are still good 127 rebounds a game but Damon stmy says that hes not been as impactful as he was a year ago theres a difference when youre in top with a Scot report now hes not not a secret anymore but indongo has that capability to play at a high level and they need that from him for Georg to take take that next step 69240 very athletic hes got eight double doubles on the year now defending the post just over 8 minutes in Endo off the back iron here comes the yellow jackets down by a Music dozen Georgia Tech flying with two point guards out there between George and mallum how Drive strong along the Music Applause Baseline the blocking foul and that will take us to our next media timeout with the Mustangs on top by a Music dozen his bag poopy Miller G him an easy look early and uh it looks like an ocean out there for him he is jab stepping getting to his side and it looks very easy for him he has a face and hes telling coach hfield hey I need to start every game yep 11 points to lead all scores right now four for six shooting on a team thats been shooting extremely well today as a group the Mustangs are four or five from distance Edwards has one Matt cross also has a three and they have been often running 10 of 17 from the field and have been in control pretty much from the opening tip and with that Andy Enfield can feel comfortable leaving his star point guard bopy Miller on the bench with his two fouls good Gathering released by treor for his first two points Chuck Harris is doing it all right now making plays great Music pass George McCollum Terry three perimeter players pass deflected into the SMU bench and deflex up about three rows into the stands here at Moody Coliseum got ourselves a good crowd here students are still away on their break everybody knew me and you were here Doug as soon as people anywhere in the country know thei pening is coming they show out tell you what the man who just missed that shot said he used to have your poster up on his bedroom wall he was a big Tar Heels fan as the kid said Duncan pow yeah that one make me feel Music Terry Off the Mark empty trip for George attack Edwards back in with h some coton up that right nostril to stop the bleeding he feeds the post into a double team fror again gathers and goes up strong Georgia Tech has to have some resistance inside its getting too easy for SMU a lot of easy bucket for them but smus doing a good job getting the ball inside and making plays its another Yellow Jackets turnover Edwards able to come up with the basketball everything going right for SMU trayor says I want to get back into the starting lineup hes had a hot hand coming off the bench Music Music SMU 32 Georgia Tech 13 everything going right for the Mustangs everything going wrong for the yellow jackets every time they turn the ball over the Mustangs have made him pay 14 to nothing points off turnovers for SMU and thats the difference in the game if you giv them easy buckets theyre already a high powered team that can put the ball in the basket and theyre coming off two losses theyre doing everything they can to get themselves going and Georgia Texas just helping them by turning the ball over SMU coming off backto back losses here against Duke in front of a packed house and then in Chapel Hill they now know firsthand what the blue bloods in the ACC are all about but that only helps you its a great test for those guys to come into the ACC and know what type of level they have to play at to compete with the best Suare said you should have thrown that to the rim to George for me to dunk it instead it was a shot attempt and rattled out Endo is fouled by The Freshman Musto that is his second personal foul thats three I Music think you are correct you are three for three now you getting everything right I used to play a little point guard back in my day you did every time I went to call a game that you were playing in it seemed like all Roy Williams wanted to talk about beforehand was you I dont blame him Music treor has scored smus last seven points but hes denied at The Rim McCollum former Sienna Saint and Oklahoma Sooner brings it back out to Terry he can get to the rim and finish with the best of him in the ACC thats a tough tough finish by Terry and he has to get going for the get these guys back in the game yeah he is Triple Threat score among the best Shooters in the ACC third in the league in threepoint shooting and the ability to finish in the lane Endo from downtown everythings going for SMU SMU is shooting the ball at a high high clip and if you do that theyre going to be very hard to beat anybodys hard to beat you doing that seven different Mustangs in the scoring column the lead is 20 Music call that was a pass trying to find Suare taken away by cross quickly up ahead on a rim run treor the chase down block leads to a held ball good Hustle by Terry and on the possession arrow itll stay at this end Big Time finish right here from Terry with the left hand against the bigs Big Time Hustle by Terry creating a jump ball on the other end of the Court not giving up on the play now Terry a little bit under the weather yesterday miss practice last night but did wind up coming to shoot around this morning Damon stmy the head coach was not at the shoot around hes also a little bit under the Music weather Edwards kicks it back out to Music cross igu gets double team and then the foul comes well step away with 758 remaining a record setting performance by a freshman today in the ACC when we come Music back made a couple of free throws late today to give him 42 in a win over the Fighting Irish Cooper flag is playing like the best player in the country and Im going to tell you right now he is not the projected first pick he is the first pi and Zion Williamson duns way better Im going to put that out there I understand but Zion Williamson is a freak yeah the power that Zion dunks with is off the charts yeah but you can tell when Cooper puts his mind to it you know when he gets within 15 ft hes going to dunk he trying to dunk on your head absolutely yeah and I dont know that Ive seen him stop yet this year and when you know what he did against the US national team this summer and that the players were just raving about him what can we say that tops that when LeBron and KD walk off the floor saying holy cow that just builds your confidence going into the season playing against people like that Anthony Davis bam out bario guys like that it just boosts your confidence U with the block shot forcing the shot clock violation yeah I encourage you if Duke is coming to play in your town get yourself a ticket cuz youre going to want to be able to see him in person hes more impressive in person than he is on TV that kid is flat out box office well now into double figures for Georgia Tech in turnovers that is their 10th and again more often than not the Mustangs have been able to make him pay and even with bopy Miller on the bench with the two personal fouls the Mustangs have continued to share the basketball and seemed very connected today Theo and I love the way how connected they are because they they had good two practices and the carryover is whats important coming off two losses what type of team are you going to have coming out and how are you going to respond thats what tells what type of Team you Music are not that this is any kind of excuse for Georgia Tech but theyve had some challenges this week traveling as so many of us have with the storms that came across the west or uh rather the Southern States including here in Dallas still some snow around on the ground Terry no Howell keeps it alive Fross with another rebound for SMU after playing Tuesday in Syracuse Georgia Tech flew back to Atlanta but because of the storm system coming across the southern states SMU or rather George Tech left a day early left Atlanta and flew to College Station Texas and spent the the night there where it was raining as opposed to then driving up into where it was snowy and icy here in Dallas its a kind of a roundabout way for an extra day on the road as Edwards goes to the free throw Lineo Ryan Matumbo back in also get our first look at Keon Ambrose Hilton number 22 for SMU a 69 senior from Toronto also three fouls on Terry our full day of college basketball rolls on tonight Over on ESPN with three more big games at 6 Eastern number one Tennessee takes on Texas at the Moody Center and then 10th ranked Texas AM winners of nine in a row host fifth ranked Alabama and the night is capped off by UCF and Arizona 10 Eastern 7 Pacific and Theo Im curious to see how the vs bounce back coming off their first loss of the Year Tuesday in Gainesville the gator got him by 30 I would hate to be Texas right now because Tennessee is coming in there p is off stunning that the number one team could lose like that now Florida is really really good and they could wind up in the final four but still I dont know if theyre that good shot clock down to two tough shot good close out defensively by Ambrose Hilton and down at the other end the Throwdown by Tero o quendo SMU is playing at a high high level not much resistance from Georgia Tech right now they have to chip into this lead a little bit and just become a little bit more connected again this is the tempo Andy infield wants his team is second in the ACC in scoring second in threepoint percentage second and assist per game and they lead the ACC in rebounds rebounding margin and bench points and we have seen all of that during the first 15 minutes today and to let yall know all of this has been went out there at point guard o Miller been on the MCH yep oopy had four early assists one to each of his fellow starters and his teammates have just taken the Baton and run o quendo now with eight its contagious at this point the whole team is Music rolling tough to go up against that 7 foot 2in mountain in the middle Music Music Edwards cut off on the Baseline by McCollum back out to cross contagious Applause indeed wheres the number 33 because Larry Bird was his guide dunker his sophomore year at Georgia three times he made a sports Center top 10 dunk a windmill went for number three a tomahawk went for number three my favorite was a facial over a 69 Northwestern Defender that was only number six that night does that one have the potential to be on Sports Center tonight I dont know if that one will make it but I tell you right now SMU has it going they like a top 10 team in the country right now out of the same high school near Kennedy Space Center in Florida as former Florida wide receiver and Football announcer Chris Collinsworth mum tough Music shot lets see if Georgia Georgia Tech can chip into this lead a little bit its going to be an upfield battle but if they keep competing they see what they can do going into half for that mollin bucket it had been a 14 nothing SMU run and they get right back at it everybodys in the ACT Keon Ambrose hilt throws down his first two impressive pass is that behind the back big fella got passes like that okay look like me out there poopy Miller back into the game for SMU playing with those two personal Music fouls big fella got died dont he little behind the back pass behind the back pass to the Baseline to get on that Rim big fella way to go SMU is rolling in Dallas Texas SMU has been in control right from the opening tip everybody seems to be involved in the scoring and in the assist six different Mustangs have assists the offense has been humming although cross misses the free throw and uh I appreciate coach passner saying they got to win their 4minute segments but at this point if youre on the wrong end of this what do you do you do exactly what coach coach said you got to win these little segments to try to chip away at this league anything can happen I mean weve seen this before but they have to stop turning the ball over and they have to make shots at a high level or they just start hitting threes like SMU is doing 12 turnovers committed by George attch and yes SMU is eight out of 10 oh no yigu tried to join the fun couldnt do it we would have had to call the game if he hit that one thats smus got four dunks already to go along with six layups McCollum to the wing H brings it back to Music McCollum look like Ambrose Hilton may have gotten a piece heres cross the trailer up for three no Ambrose Hilton on the offensive glass no one picks him up so he goes right to the basket missed the shot by and Dango pulls it down if they could just streen together a couple bucket that can go into the half time and theyre throwing lives against this 75 kid and as theyve done all afternoon the Mustangs immediately turn it into points at the other end bofy Miller with a reverse layup Georgia Tech just shooting themselves in the foot every single time down the for he turning the ball over Music Dongo Cross Court Powell contested shot cross with another rebound hes been quite a heater grabbing rebounds lately hes up to fifth in the ACC at over eight per game and in conference play hes number one EA to cross for three Nathan George to indongo and the fouls called Harris holding his face on the floor and hes going to be called for the personal foul CHR Sunday afternoon on ESPN and the app its another terrific womens college basketball double header tahina powpow and second ranked South Carolina host number five Texas at one Eastern followed at 300 by number 21 NC State and Stanford should be another great afternoon of Hoops da Staleys Gamecock start a daunting stretch of five straight gam facing ranked opponents so now will we have our second flagrant confirm they didnt give me a chance oh no that was nothing yeah appreciate it that four for four uh does that count yeah Ill give you Music that just grading on a curve cuz youre the new guy ah I dont want it then I want to earn it so now Dongo who originally committed to ruter out of putham Science Academy in Connecticut but then when Carl Hobs left ruter to be the associate head coach at Georgia Tack and Ango changed his commitment and followed to Atlanta he was preseason all ACC good reason you know foul trouble has been an issue for him this year as well he has been in foul trouble well seven different times hes had either four or five fouls in a game this year one minute to go in the first half that has been dominated by SMU Miller to the corner and the shot goes up and over the backboard a missed by Keon Ambrose Hilton one of the three Tri captains for SMU good look at senior from Toronto who spent a year in Tuscaloosa playing for the Crimson tied now in his third year here on the hilltop they need to go for a quick two for one here Music Powell they missed it and you just dont see that in college nearly as much as you do in the NBA another turnover SMU not going to pull it out bad decision by bopy Miller not so much trying to feed the ball just made a bad pass yeah had the right thought but unfortunately had a turnover and now you got to come out the game and that will protect him from picking up a third foul toet gner the senior from Istanbul Turkey back into the game for the second time Music 5 Seconds pass deflected by Edwards it looked like Georgia Tech was the last to touch did McCollum get a finger on it inadvertently definitely look like it at the moment theyre going to keep it with the yellow jackets and indeed Georgia Techs ball with 26 left in the half another yet another Georgia Tech with its fewest points this season in the first half everything going right for Andy enfields punch biggest halftime lead against a conference opponent in over a decade they LED USF back in December of 2014 4915 and it was all SMU and what do the yellow jackets have to do to chip away at this thing Theo they have to not do that um they have to win the first five minutes to even have turnover number 16 committed by Georgia Tech their season worst was 19 and BJ Edwards excuse me hes been in the middle of everything yeah I mean theyre very active defensively right now but for SMU this is a big test for them you have a huge leag what type of team do you want to be do you want to domate and knock these guys out or you going to let them hang around hang around and play with your food VJ Edwards now has eight points five assists five steals to go along with one bloody nose might want to get hit in the face every game if you play like this Music man by Dongo misses the front end and that by the way was smus 10th half to score at least 50 points this season theyve gone for a century in a game three times against F Vim Alabama State and then at Boston College on Pace to go to Triple digits again today Dongo gets one out of two and for Georgia Tech I know coach stamar said what type of Pride do you have are you going to lay down and just roll over for this team or you going to go out here and compete at a high level and try to fight yourself back in this game and just make it respectable at this point Edwards Miller cross working the perimeter this is cross with a back door pass but it carries out of bounds Chuck Harris tried to save it Harris back in the starting lineup to begin the second half and as you pointed out Theo hes making a major statement with his game high 11 points to Andy Enfield I want to be in the starting lineup yeah hes doing everything he possibly can give the coach no reason to take you out the starting lineup after tonight hes doing that former Butler Bulldog spent three years in Indianapolis twotime team leader in score ing as a freshman in sophomore but then with a coaching change his role changed a bit and he wound up transferring to SMU out under his second head coach with the Mustangs Miller comes away with the Music basketball cross from the Applause logo Terry has a step on Harris and goes right to the rim thats a great drive by Terry cross got tangled up with Suare near midcourt and it goes against number 33 in white I mentioned in the first half he wears 33 as a Massachusetts kid because Larry Bird and he talked about the toughness he watched Larry Bird of course on film he was not old enough to watch Larry Legend play in person but the the work ethic the blue collar work ethic that is ingrained in New England Eng thats what he brings to the floor every game Chuck Harris now 14 points I mean he has it going right now hes now three out of four from distance this afternoon about 50 on the year igu with another defensive stop Harris quickly the other way again the tempo SMU wants to play as as fast as anybody in the ACC Miller missfires everything and SMU way comes back out to Music Harris Miller free himself from George now weve seen a couple three long threepoint shots missed BYU you think Andy Enfield at the next stoppage will say Okay fellas lets get back to work in the basketball around yeah you would want to see booy get a better look than that one you just shot one and hit the side of the backboard so you might want to not take one from the L go right after that unless your name is Chuck Harris just keep shooting or just get him the ball and get out the way hes well on his way to a season High thats 16 points he went for 21 coincidentally at Butler back in November against his former Music School the big fella is calling for a traveling violation but hes going to be called for the foul set 2 265 lb cat yigu do big guys get called for fouls that maybe they dont always commit just because of their size 100 but I will give igu a lot of credit he has lowkey been the difference of this game because Georgia Tech is thinking about it every time they go into the paint against him and hes just causing a whole lot of Havoc at The Rim second foul for the Freshman from istan bille Music turkey Nathan George still scoreless has his pass knocked Away by the big fella and hes only a freshman great pass and then to be able to catch that pass and throw it down remarkable they are going to remember this game for igu for him to be this Breakout game for because he is doing it on both ends of the floor he understands the impact that he can have and hes truly dominating both ends of the floor great pass by BJ and for Edwards to understand that he can make that pass to him lot of big guys most big guys you wouldnt make that pass and Coach infield raped about his hands for guys his size they usually have tough hands they dont know how to catch the ball that well but my guy knows how to catch the ball and thats great for him and again we asked Andy infield this morning whats the upside for suat yigu and without batting an eyelash he said the NBA by the way that was the fourth person to foul on mustaf points off turnover 25 nothing thats the game folks Mumbo over that left shoulder no Terry fights for the rebound but because the shot did not hit the rim it is a shot clock Music violation thats some you got hitting in the face all game today Yellow Jack shooting under 30 for the game and this is the second straight clunker offensively the yellow jackets have had they couldnt shoot straight Tuesday and their loss at Syracuse is it something that the yellow jackets arent doing or are they facing good defense Tuesday against Syracuse and today here against SMU its a little bit of both I think igu is really making a difference in the paint right now but also smus activity defensively creating a whole lot of turnovers like you said 25 to zero off the turnovers thats a game right there but I think also you got to come to the realization Georgia Tech has been through a lot this week theyve been through a lot and a lot of guys under the weather and theyre coming in theres no excuse for it but theyve been through a lot and theyre trying to figure out a way to just compete and Im pretty sure these guys ready to go home but theres no excuse if you came out here to play you got to go out here and again they played Tuesday up in Syracuse flew home to Atlanta after the game and then changed their plans to come to Texas a day early flew to College Station where they spent the night to avoid the wor first of the snow and ice here in Dallas before busing from College Station here to Big D another rebound for cross who dribbled it out of bounds and so itll be Georgia Tech basketball when we come back BJ Edwards with the dime to my guy igu running the floor he is dominating on both ends of the floor SMU up big tough spot so again if you can donate at redcrossorg SL ESPN yeah very very tough situation the pictures and the videos that Ive seen and weve all seen has been very sad hopefully everybody can do what they can to help out well as you pointed out during the break Theo we are on triple double watch PJ Edwards putting up some numbers yeah my man has eight points six assists five Steals and again one bloody nose they cant throw it in those Nathan George still scoreless the accs leader an assist per game has not been able to get it going nobody for George Tech has gotten it going today Miller off the Music crossover Daven McCollum pick and roll blown up Dongo turns it over and here comes Harris 19 George throws it up and Lance Terry throws it down Music Applause 5924 so now Andy Enfield uses a timeout to talk things over Mustangs cruising over the yellow jackets Music some of you are doing their part as far as getting the strength of the ACC back up to where it should be um its kind of disappointing seeing where where it was but I think SMU and loo V bringing the the strength back to the ACC well its so good to see the Cardinals back from where they were the league desperately needs Louisville to be Louisville again they seem to be well on their way their next game will be Tuesday up at the JM a wireless dome in Syracuse well they take on a rejuvenated Syracuse team as Powell buries the three Syracuse Beat Boston College today 7971 JJ Starling back for his third game went for 26 to lead the or shout out to the Syracuse but again the biggest game today in the league as far as Im concerned was Louisville going to Pittsburgh in front of a packed house at the Pak the Oakland Zoo was rocking once again in and to show you know what they continue to beat highlevel teams and will continue to move up to standing huge win huge win Music from BJ Edwards the former Tennessee volunteer brings it back out to O quendo and now Edwards who is a product of Knoxville Catholic High School nearly lost it Colbert bad decision throws it away trying to go big to Big to find Johan trayor but jel Colbert with a turnover and hell take a seat that was a product I havent shot the ball in a while so let me see if I can create something y a junior from Houston has had limited run today and he commits the seventh SMU turnover yigu back in the middle for SMU Bullet Pass to the corner George gets it back McCollum no eiku is going to be called for the foul I think and again its I think as much a product of his size relative to those around him he had good position inside didnt he yeah he did I mean sometimes it just gets in the way sometimes youre too big O quendo goes out to B gner back on the floor for SMU hes had an extended run mum for three take making a little runu stays in the game despite having just picked up his third foul Edwards working on Terry down the left side of the lane and he lays it in got screen by his own man and Dongo is tough to front right there in front of the rim cuz sometimes you get in front of your all teammate all right Theo double figures for points for Edwards as George has his first points of the day as Edwards is again on potential triple double watch hes got the basketball now 63 Junior guard thr Music Edwards a little strong that time a column came flying in George to Terry left alone not good transition defense that time by SMU but it didnt cost him this is the time you fight those mental battles youre up 30 you try not to relax and you try to play you want to play with that same aggression well this ones going to go against Bay and Dango and thatll take us to Applause Music Applause Music break two foul watch number 11 in old gold throwing a deliberate elbow to the groin timeout the foul on gold 11 was reviewed after further review the fouls been upgraded to a flagrant two foul number 11 has been ejected white will shoot two shots and have possession of the ball you can see indongo is surprised by it but he will spend the rest of the game back in the Georgia Tech locker room while his teammates deal with a 30point deficit and so your player of the game yigu is at the line shooting two yeah hes that that foul right there and getting toss is just straight frustration and youu the cause of that hes causing a lot of problems down there made doou Music frustrating its been one of those days for Damon stmy Bunch hes playing through a little illness that kept him from shoot around this Music morning and he has watched his team give up an early 11 nothing run a 14 to nothing run and they have been noncompetitive right from the start today and so SMU keeps possession Ry Miller to cross inside yigu shot a little too strong off the glass for treor Man U has to look before just throwing it Music Applause Music blindly colum George mustaf around the perimeter for George attack Po and Suare the other two on the floor Suare playing for the ejected Dongo George got it his second made three here in the second half great ball Movement by Georgia Ted on that Music possession tror hes a threat out there at 611 the former Auburn Tiger who spent last year at UCS Beam with the goutos shows hes got a little something in his bag for SMU my man trar wants his started St stting spot back well he was on the bench to start with Chuck Harris moved back into the starting lineup and both have performed very well today for Andy Music Enfield and now mustaf at the line Sunday afternoon the ACC Network features a womens basketball quadruple header with three top 20 teams number 14 Duke takes on Virginia at noon Eastern then 19th rank North Carolina host BC followed by number 13 Georgia Tekken Louisville and we cap off the day with Miami and Syracuse Yellow Jackets coming off a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Virginia Tech Tony Morgan just joined the 1000 Point Club in that game theyll be part of our quad groupal header tomorrow as number 13 Georgia Tech takes on Louisville geia foul number foul Matt cross with the1 he says his best moment as a basketball player as we take another look was back in his high school days and hes had a tremendous 1000 Point college career at Miami Louisville UMass and now SMU but in high school he was playing in a state tournament game at the TD Garden where the Celtics playing he hit a buzzer be beer to win a state semifinal that is his best memory so far thats legendary I wouldnt never forget that either no and he spent a lot of time this morning talking about his affection for UMass head coach Frank Martin and what he did for him during his two years at UMass layup is good by Suare he talked about how Frank Martin was the one who encouraged him okay youve had a great season in the Atlantic 10 an all conference season youve got one year of Eligibility left you need to go challenge yourself once again and get back to the highest level thats big time from a coach to tell a player that of course you would want him to stay so you can have a great season also but to care about the player and want to put him in the best position for him to get better tell him that is big time and Matt cross he tweaked his back in the season opener missed some time and he continues to have to manage it through an extra stretching dealing with the work of the trainers but he said by and large hes doing well howwell from straight on nothing but net the hometown kid out of nearby doto high school for Music three well the second half has been much more even than that first half as mutumbo and Terry return George and Suare go out George Tech actually outscored SMU in the second half 2320 the the difference of the game is turnovers SMU just created so many turnovers in the first half it it it was just been an uphill battle for Georgia Music Tech how who just made a three puts it on the deck down the lane put his head down and got to where he wanted to go Music Applause Music Miller to the corner trayor rattles it Music home he put 25 on UC Davis a year ago so you know he can fill it up if given the opportunity thats 13 Off the Bench for SMU today all knocked out of bounds itll stay at this end to George attack 755 remaining in a game thats been dominated by SMU Music future players one of three signed ESPN 100 recruits another one of the locals gerain ONeal Jr he is number 100 in this years ESPN 100 along with Jaden TBS and Nigel walls Andy Enfield and his staff has put together a tremendous recruiting class of 2025 and if they want to continue to upgrade as they have from the American to the ACC thats your pipeline you have to do it I mean they got a lot of talent here in the Dallas area so theyre going to have to recruit every single kid that comes out of here we need Germaine to look up we got to see his face yeah my goodness both of them missed their air time I know my gosh Im going to tell them after the game Germaine Jr very much does look like his father to me and so if we were to see his face he looks like Dad not as big as his dad and not exactly the same game but certainly a talent coming here he has great footwork on the Block treor strong move along the Baseline its been a quiet afternoon for the Freshman from buy Maryland hes another one whose father played in the NBA Jared mustaf played four years in the league out of the University of Maryland and was it Andy Enfield who said when he was growing up in Pennsylvania he was a Maryland basketball fan yeah back in the Len Bias days pow goes end to end count the basket and the Dallas native now with 13 points to lead the yellow jackets good to take making a little run I think both teams flipped it a little bit SMU is not turning the ball over every single possession Georgia Tech is getting out and running Andy Enfield may be the best shoot shooter in the building right now no offense the offens he was a 2000 Point scorer at Johns Hopkins University division 3 AllAmerican back in the day and his players recognize that by the fact that they call him Mr midrange they also find the uh irony humorous that when hes coaching them in 2025 he doesnt like them taking midrange shots he wants dunks and threepoint shots but uh they say for elite shooters you may lose your feet you may lose your legs but you never lose the shot that never goes anywhere and so Andy Enfield started talking about as a 76ers fan as a kid he won a regional of the old Pepsi challenge NBA Hot Shot competition it was at the old spectrum and theres Andy on the left he went on to the national competition where he recalls finishing third or fourth but uh the shot that took him to National prominence as a 13yearold now at 55 is apparently still very much alive and well yeah we going to have to go fact check that he said third or fourth he wasnt really decisive on it so Im still questioning all Music right his team closing in on a 12th win of the Season screen mustaf hard to argue that one in a legal screen that sent poopy Miller to the hardwood and hes only a freshman that comes with a learning curve cant move on your screens got to try to avoid him as best as you can and so now he is done for the day having picked up his fifth foul under 6 and2 minutes to go cross from the corner see what Lance Terry does gives it to George sweet reverse and the foul against DJ Edwards wow and thats what Georgia Tech can do they can get out in transition and finish with the best of them but they they dug themselves in a deep hole but right now theyre competing at a high level I know coach DM is proud of that Nate George is just the latest in Georgia attacks long line of outstanding lefthanded point guards how about Kenny Anderson Tony aens Travis best and thats not not even counting all the great righthanded point guards theyve had over the years Mark Price Stefon Marbury Jared Jack Javaris Kinton Jose Alvarado and just to sophomore Nate George has had a terrific first year and a half yeah hes had some great games and hes implemented himself in the Georgia Tech for Port guard U apparently theres a lot of good guys in that list no doubt and they were expecting to red shirt him coming out of Canada last year but uh after sitting out the first three or four games first three games they reconsidered the red shirt ripped it off and he went and ripped off a terrific freshman year 10 points nearly five assists per game and thats a great way to trust in work great pass McCollum with the extra pass would have given George the hockey assist Matumbo Standing Tall inside first two points for the senior from Atlanta course in dad the lake de km Mumbo coming back home to Atlanta was a big part of the reason why he transferred from Georgetown to George attack Edwards continues to put up points nice Flo of up BJ great pass McCollum what was so tough about that pass from Nathan George going Baseline and having to maneuver around pretty much two Defenders on the Baseline and putting it right in his pocket where he can just catch and shoot its an impressive pass from a point guard and you just hope they could have did this a little bit earlier but I love the way Georgia Tak Music PE Mumbo solid defense offensive rebound though SMU back out to Endo for three hes had a terrific afternoon coming off the bench hes into double figures five different Mustangs have scored 10 10 or Music more great kick out for three best shot threepoint shot in the game of basketball is off a offensive rebound Yellow Jackets now with a new season High 21 turnovers to go along with the four shooting a deadly combination another rebound for Powell hes got his second double double of the Year oh the lob is thrown down by Terry timeout Music SMU the yellow jackets theyre going to run through the Finish Line anybody can beat almost had a couple them earlier this afternoon Theo but uh Iowa stayed escaped somebody is going to pull another upset today you can just feel it in that Georgia Oklahoma game coming up scheduled top of the hour here on ESPN 2 well get you to uh Athens just as soon as we are finished here Edwards now with 17 points the Bulldogs according to ESPNs matchup predictor have a 686 chance of beating the Sooners today even though the Sooners are the 17th ranked team in the country Georgias been playing good basketball and theyre at home I can be willing to bet Georgia be ranked after this week if they get this win against Oklahoma theyll definitely be ranked even without it I think Ryan mutambo now with four points the gr transfer from Music Georgetown Chuck Harris who had the big first half give him three more 19 points to lead all scores Music that is two off his season High which came at Butler is former School JV and McCollum has found his stroke here today well assuming SMU closes this thing out with under three to go which they most certainly will Edwards gets his own Miss they have a couple of very winnable Road games next on their schedule o quendo misses Mato has it taken away multiple opportunities now the Mustangs pull it back out if they go to Virginia on Wednesday in the next Saturday down to Coral Gables to take on the Miami Hurricanes a couple of teams struggling so you can Envision a place where SMU if they take care of business games theyre supposed to win and the blink of an eye could be 5 two and really start thinking about hey were on the bubble now lets move off that bubble and get into the field of 68 100 and sometimes this is a good thing for you I know you dont want to learn by losing but coming off two games against Duke and Carolina those spring board you into games like this games that youre supposed to win and take care of Chuck Harris at the line the senior from Ashburn Virginia one more free throw will match his season High 21 the Mustangs had an 110 run early follow that up with a 140 run yellow jackets have really never been able to make a push another steal for Edwards and he throws it Applause down we may have to reassess your take that yigu is the game MVP Im going to vote for this guy BJ Edwards BJ Edwards top floor now he has dominated on both ends of the floor and I might be right there with you he has done it all on every fast of the game assists steals dunks points hes had a big time game tonight 19 points on eight of 11 shooting six assists six steals mumus fouled down the three Music count the basket and the personal against Chuck Harris Wild Card Weekend is capped off Monday Night by an NFC matchup between

they going to deal with AllAmerican guard Mark Sears and the Crimson tie should be a good one as Endo went up to shoot weve got an offensive foul before the Music shot not the result Georgia Tech wanted but Im sure coach sty is pleased to how Georgia Tech came out the second half we get to see a little more of the SMU depth with the score lopsided AJ George A Long Beach State transfer spent the last three years at the beach and was very productive and hes not even in the rotation for SMU thats him number 10 getting the rebound he put 28 on B field last January Dion Ambrose Hilton says dont forget about me Music George dumps it off and its a wedgie for Music Matumbo this type of day has been for the yellow jackets here we Applause go the reaction is for Jackson young and his mustache coming into the game the senior from kville Texas former walkon who has spent time in Texas AM and Hawaii Pacific getting an opportunity to play in the final minute 30 whereare 35 for Kevin Durant okay I just made that up oh its not Music gunshot so as we wind things down your final thoughts here about the Mustangs and what we think they are right now here in the middle of January very impressive win great response coming off two losses and to come in here and dominate the way they did in the full team effort I think coach HFI is very very impressed and very happy with his team well the Mustangs didnt get to Triple digits they put 50 on the board in the first half another 43 in the second half five in double figures an end to end win very impressive SMU wins it 9371 Andy enfields
