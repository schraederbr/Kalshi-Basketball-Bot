shorthanded against a very talented Louisville team Eagles in white Louisville in the road black we are underway our officials tonight Ron Grover Brent Hampton and Justin Porterfield lot of basketball coming your way on a Wednesday night in the ACC this is the first of a triple header L of ACC after dark on the west coast right here on acc Network heres Chucky heer opening possession for Louisville finds rain Smith hes not shy to let it fly goes into the lane comes up empty really good defensive possession there for the Eagles staying in front of the basketball one thing its difficult to do is keep Louisville out of the paint but more importantly you have to defend without fouling well theres first year head coach of the Cardinals Pat Kelce I think hes everybodys coach of the year not just in the ACC but in the country took over the biggest project in all of college basketball and hes turned it around and L of the season it its just been amazing what hes done in such a quick turnaround not just get Louisville back but have them back and winning in a way thats just fun to watch a style thats fun to watch and everybody agrees I think hes the ACC coach of the year if not National Ali oop to James Scott to open the scoring take a look at the Boston College starting five no Chad venning so Jaden Hastings making his second career start what do the Eagles need to do without vanning one I think still opportunities like that Louisville will switch a out on the perimeter you got to take a chance and go to the offensive glass like that but theyve got to take care of the basketball and the biggest thing is defend without foul the back door open Terrence Edwards Jr shakes free when you play aggressive like that you got to look for back door Cuts great job by Louisville and again they dont shoot it great but they put tremendous amount of pressure on you off the bounce got to control the paint points against these guys as well as theend the threepoint line I think its an underrated aspect of the Cal off open three Josh Beetle that rims out no good offensive rebound kept alive Dion Brown Cashes in the second chance point and BC starts four guards they play small and its Freedom up a little bit with the injury to Elijah strong who may come back theyve gone smaller and they spread you out and that puts pressure on the guards now for the opposing teams you got to box out weve seen Louisville give two offensive rebounds up early with venning out for Earl Grants team tonight there is a conscious effort for Louisville to go inside theyre trying to feed James Scott early and often big opportunity for Jaden Hastings and the four Boston College guards out there you mentioned theyre playing small youre playing even smaller without betting out you absolutely are and its freed the guards up to play and now the question becomes when Hasting leaves the game how small will they be he was the backup big vinning got the the both you know 25 minutes a game and he comes in and plays 15 lets see how he handles the larger workload and for a Louisville team I mean they were dominant in January 8 and0 in the month of January they won 10 straight from December 21st to February 1st you want to get back yes to to that winning ways its easier said than none you have to do it on the road midweek game after you lost in Atlanta the Georgia Tech but this team is more than capable and what was so surprising about the loss against Georgia Tech is it came out of nowhere and they were playing as well as anybody in the country during that 10 game win streak absolutely but joria Tech has a talented R and you watch some of those guys play youre not surprised that team has just been riddled with injuries so theres a disappointment in how theyve started but if you know Jordan Tech followed it up they had a big win a Triple overtime win at Clemson last night a chaotic stretch will reset the shot clock here Boston College ball and this is they werent just winning games one possession two possession they were dominating teams at SMU at Syracuse North Carolina and wake Force these are good teams wake Clemson UNC and theyre winning by double digits their defense was dominant I think thats the biggest thing that you saw doing that winning stretch and we talked about it I said it in the open they lost concentration on the defensive end of the floor at georia Tech they were up double digits at the half and then allowed 50 points in the second half and that with a combination of cold shooting allowed the yellow jackets Come Away with the win and tonight as Deion Brown turns it over to Josh Beetle as he was on the line tonights about showing that that second half in Atlanta was a oneoff you flush that you go right back to the team that was so dominant in January and had that 10 game win streak thats what you you have you want to see Pat Kelsey wants to see early he knows this team is going to score theyre going to score points and they they they can be cold shooting but they put so much pressure on you in getting to the rim trior lost the handle and Boston College forces the turnover great job there just being strong being physical trior physical guard big Wing hes playing undiz right now we talk about hes playing a five right now tried to lob it to Hastings instead it ricochets off the rim Louisville pushes it in transition Edwards goes up and under perfect position for the follow flush abubakar trior flying in for the finish first thing you got to do against lble is get back and guard the basketball all Five Guys Brown the floater does not Applause fall heres Javon Hadley one thing the BC has is they have big guards you see Louisville plays inverted theyll post their guards theyll post Edwards theyll post Hatley and then theyll space you out and shoot the threes trior scoop to the hoop and thats a Goen and that brings us to our first stop in the action Louisville doubling up Boston College early abubacar trior has the last four for the Cardinals they for guys that young men and learn a lot about the game you couldnt pick two better guys and of course the current head coach of College of Charleston is former Louisville head coach Chris Mack that program looks like its headed to another NCAA tournament yeah PK didnt leave the cub bear Chris Mack inherited Player of the Year in bovich and he did take rain Smith and James Scott with well yeah didnt leave him everything you couldnt leave him all I left you the player the year in the conference I cant leave you everything Scott with the ball here hands it off for Hadley and heres R Smith quick trigger rattles in and out no good tipped in Hadley got a hand to it they do so they spread you out and its so difficult when youre guarding R Smith you got to cheat out to get to him a little late in that close out got away with it and then you got to box out Boston College has missed six in a row a 3 and 12 minute scoring ground for the Eagles heurn pull up pop nothing but the bottom of the net for Chucky heer this is how the threes comeing they attack you in the paint you sucking you your defense starts thinking you got to protect the rim which you do and then they start pulling up threes and knocking down threes and they lead to ACC and field goal attempts from the threepoint line forget the percentages theyre going to shoot so many threes that eventually percentages theyre going to start knocking them down its a nine nothing Run for the Cardinals they have found an offensive Rhythm early in this one kick to the corner Music Smith urn launches a deep three and hits it backto back threes for Chucky heer he got to throw the percentages Applause out lack of communication on the switch are we switching are we not youre late on the close out he just knocked down one and as I told you hes having a heck of a year I think hes definitely an all conference guard I cant imagine no one would not vote him in what hes meant to this team and what he does is just amazing much needed buckets Donald P Jr snaps a 12 nothing Louisville Applause run and Junior trying to run that off you gamble there in the back court you dont pick up the basketball youre inside of three stops pops knocks it down walks into one here theres some confusion on the ball screen why not Ill have two Chucky headb burs hot start here in the first Applause half youre going to watch both of these teams Let it Fly all night long you said that green light that Pat Kelce has granted his team 31 threepoint attempts per game yes and thats been you go back to College of Charleston it was the same throw the percentages out you cant look at these guys and say oh Chucky hebburn is only shooting 33 I can close out late as weve seen so far the first half no you cant you got to get up and get out there and guard him oh and by the way he leaves the AC assist by breaking it down and creating for himself and teammates urn the hot hand early passes this one off and its another triple this time Terence Edwards Jr drills it and thats whats so concerning when you play Louisville Edwards only shooting 28 but it does not matter Fred Payne answers with a triple of his own thats Boston Colleges first n three of the night and Fred Payne shoots over 40 BF the threepoint line has been playing well in the last few games averaging over 14 points a game over the last five games this the guard play of BC has scoring ability is this a case Randolph where if you know youre playing Louisville you know hey we probably have to take a few more threes if we want to keep Pace well you got to score I think thats the big biggest thing and thats and thats someone you say they play at a pace and a style that you got to do the little things you got to box out you got to find where rain Smith is and limit him when you can but keeping them out of the paint is challenging because they have four or five guys whos capable of beating you off the dribble but youve got to be efficient enough in the offense that you can score and right now youre talking about a team thats losing Chad vinning inside puts more pressure on these guards and thats kind of my point you cant play through vening in the post like you probably want to so you play Four guard just let it fly and if you connect on enough of them you can hang around that play is the prime example Elijah strong strong comes in hes accustom starting and accustomed to seeing Chad vinning inside hes looking for the high low action but hes missed a couple of games hes been out this lineup where BC has started playing better is playing with the four guards and spreading you out Noah Waterman his first action after missing four games good to get him back if youre a Louisville fan its great to see him back and hes someone you can ignore his numbers as well had a thumb injury hes been out all year he came back tried to just play without it P Kelsey decided to shut him down let him get himself healthy and I think its a great idea as we approach February we getting into the stretch run he needs a couple of games to get his rhythm back but he youre talking about a big man that can stretch the cor shoot threes as well and brings much added size and depth to the Cardinals lineup chz Kelly picks up where he left off on Saturday he was the hero H hit the game winner against Florida State and connects on his first shot of the night here they can score I mean theres no doubt about it they got enough shooting and scoring they got a rebound get stopped take advantage of opportunities like this in transition pay the trailer tries to feed it inside the Hastings ripped away but stolen back back pay the floater Hastings the onehanded jam wow Hastings playing it like James Scott being in that dunker spot and attacking the offensive glass great job on the tip dump there and after Louisville got up big its a Boston College eight nothing run to cut it to five love to see it when a big man gets himself involved in the game by going to the glass to get an easy one Lille up five Ki hit the game winner to beat Florida State this team could score in bunches in that comeback they scored 15 points in the final 50 seconds a remarkable comeback and now trying to follow it up here at home against a really good Louisville team the Cardinals 92 in ACCC play when you take a look at the ACC everyone knows Duke is one but Louisville and Clemson kind of 2A 2B and the Cardinals after a 10 game win streak was snapped on Saturday trying to get back in the win column here in Chestnut Hill well thats no question they know what happened last night they were in third place and with Clemson losing theyre back in second place they understand that they know its at Applause stake Hadley draws contct Hastings thought he got all ball and he did but it was Deon Brown who committed the foul first so as you look at the ACC standings you were talking earlier today Randol you feel like theres separations in the pack and a Duke Clemson Louisville has separated and then that bottom three and remember the if youre in that bottom three at the end of the regular season you dont even get to go to the ACC tournament so if youre Boston pal you have to find a way to battle out of the position youre in some teams that are on the outside of the ncwe tournament can look at the tournament and see the run that NC State made a year ago and theres hope some teams are getting Heth you look a noted name you look at a Georgia Tech theyre starting to play better basketball getting ready for home stretch uh for those teams at the bottom this BC team the Miami team NC State your run is now you have to begin your run now because you got youre two and three games behind right your level of desperation has to pick up right now to give yourself a chance to have a postseason yeah you you have to be in it to win it yes at BC now two games behind in the win column climbing out of it you have to take control particularly of these home games regardless of how good the competition is louville a sevenpoint lead Edwards Jr walked before he dribbled so a triple header tonight on acc Network a week from tonight a double header that starts in Atlanta Stanford at Georgia Tech and then number two Duke Cooper flagging company takes on Andre sto yakovich and Cal that is at 9 Eastern right here on acc Network and this is interesting lineup you see with both teams theres really no true big man on the floor now is that more Louisville matching Boston College whos been forced to go small because no Chad venning cuz youd think you know the way Pat Kels had his rotations this year youd wanted James Scott especially with Waterman back or even Frank Anum eBay and they both have play and theyll continue to play but this is this is what I say when I say Louisville is inverted you see Edwards there Edwards and Hatley play like bigs when they match theyll find a match up with smaller guards those guys back you down and then when you come in and help thats when they kick it out and everyone else start shooting thre DC has to do it a little bit differently its got to be dribble Drive penetration or maybe Elijah strong on post up pay cant connect on the Applause triple eper lines up the three missed it Chucky had knocked down two earlier but cant connect there and Elijah strong stays down for Boston College on the other end of the floor and hes just getting back from an injury missed the last four Gam games and hes limping off the court yeah need a KN bump there lets hope hes okay get back out there strong clearly frustrated his last action was at Notre Dame on January 13th and this is just how L plays those guards that was a back you down on a smaller guard get to the rim essentially play like a big thats their version of throwing it inside to a big its through their guards and when you start helping their spacing is great so Boston counts very shorthanded in the front Court R Smith knocks down the triple thats what he does better than almost anybody in the country you have to know when youre playing Lille after on a baseline out of bounds after a timeout if R Smith is in the game theres a high percentage that the play is to get him a shot that time they ran out elevator doors and get him a three off a baseline out of bounds got to be conscious of that youre playing against L Cardinals on a seven nothing run EC scoreless in the last 2 minutes and 18 seconds its allowed Louisville to push in their lead again in this first half Applause Donald Han Jr been quiet misses and heurn digs it out for Louisville urn not on the same page with James Scott and thats a turnover heurn thought it was Scott had the angle to get alive unable to get two hands on that the turnover there not a great possession there by BC on the other end of the cour hand I thought took a contested shot I think they ow to attack R Smith in these ball screens Chucky hit bur is not the guy you want to attack who initiat your offense hes just too good of an own ball Defender Dion Brown in trouble shot clocked down to six and thats a turnover and Louisvilles really cranked up their defensive pressure you were just talking about all the things Chucky heurn does but its almost like hes always had it even when he was at Wisconsin hes getting the guys around him to play like he plays yes its easier to hold guys accountable when they see your the effort youre putting forward and on the perimeter they have really good size length and ability to defend you on a perimeter Hadley open for a three and he gets it to go Javon Hadley joins the threepoint shooting party Louisvilles knocked down five in this first half youre in scramble mode when that penetration starts it starts because Force you in rotation youre going to have to scramble on a weak side and really give the effort a lot of east and west a lot of dribbling those are difficult shots there but H is just hes on a heater right now his last five game shooting over 57 from behind the threepoint line and that ends a Louisville 10 nothing run the Cardinals in the drivers seat here at Chestnut Hill a 12point lead Hatley gets in on a three ball shooting after the penetra better than they do and I think its a trade that helps them now I think its a trade if they dont win a championship in about 2 or three years theyll look upon it and hope maybe they didnt make such a trade but I like it in the short term now Jared Dudley Jason kids certainly have their hands full that Maverick staff in here Boston gives an opportunity for one of the alltime great Eagles to come back you know his number is going to be hanging in this place one day absolutely hes over there watching the game with Sham God and Keith vanie those guys were baller themselves its a lot of great players great minds in the Dallas Maverick organization Dudley scored more than 2000 points in his career for Boston College now watching them take on Louisville DC trailing by 12 Beetle the floater doesnt drop but he tips it in great job spacing you on the floor you drive you kick you drive Closeouts gives you an opportunity when you move the basketball and you play unselfishly gives you opportunities like that even when you miss a shot to get an offensive rebounds because the defense is Applause chasing heres Javon Hadley finds heurn Chucky heurn down the lane everything but the Finish knocked around Louisville keeps it in play and a foul called Louisville a 10point lead they built it with balanc scoring through Hadley Edwards Jr and heurn BC a tough shooting start two of their first 11 but shooting 50 since again we talked about it with them offensively they theyll be an EB and flow offensively but right now they seem to be dialed in on the defensive end for when Hastings is in they seem to want to attack him in ball screens right now and Applause EP bur he got free going against Hastings couldnt connect on the three and Boston College gets the stop one thing thats noticeable when you play Louisville when I say theyre connect is you watch the group they switching as aija strong checks in the game and we notice you know glad to see him back but but with Louisville theyre really intentional about as a group they see matchups they like that time Bings the freshman in the game switches on HB bur he drive kicks it out they wait for hurn to get back at the threepoint line give him the ball and say hey go make a play or take a shot they do that quite a bit when they love match ups all guys are are on board with making sure you take advantage of that Che back again for the cinal Terence Edwards J now the Revival for Louisville built through the trans reporter Pat Kelce year one knew he had to get winners in like chy heurn but its not just tap bir no veterans that have been through the trenches and know what it takes to win veteran group ton of experience but more importantly they all won and in order to win youve got to be willing to sacrifice and thats what hes asking his guys to do a lot is sacrifice themselves for the better of the team and theyre buying in tan Jr hits the three its an 8 nothing BC run every time Louisville starts to separate Boston college has punched back this Sunday ACC womens basketball noon eastern time the Commonwealth class Virginia Tech and Virginia and then a top 21 Battle cow in Southbend to take on Notre Dame Waterman opening the corner got it welcome back Noah Waterman hes missed the last four games he looks good in his return from injury now with Waterman Noah Waterman can come back and and be what they expected from the beginning of the season because he has not been healthy his ability at his size to stretch the floor can add an element to louiso and make them even One Step better great hustle play by Dion Brown to keep it alive he was going for that rebound amongst the trees and Elijah strong back into the game the Boston cge limited options tonight with Chad venning out for the front court so good to see strong back in for the Eagles heres heurn got to cont contain the dribble to keep the ball out of the rim step back three Hadley buries it Javon Hadley he has 10 points in this first half Ela strong strong was thinking that but he gave too much Roman Hadley knocks down a three Louisvilles knocked down four of their last five threes Boston College is shooting a lot better but l still a ninepoint lead and theyve built it with the three ball Hatley knocking down to 63 here in the first half the Lo cardal first 10 points of the game were inside the paint and then you start trying to defend that and in youre in rotation you start giving up threes and thats why this team has been able to even with their injuries and all the the new body and the collection of new Talent thats been so much success here early Chucky heurn is accounted for two of those seven threes in this first half Noah Waterman with his heel on the line turnover Im always fascinated when I watch Lille literally every time I think its a game within a game when you play Louisville Pat Kelce is drawing up something every time he comes out hes not relying on it traditional sets that he has hes always drawing up something new P Junior starting to heat up a two second triple in Boston College is cut it to six two possession game where would BC be without him its just a terrific score and shooter and hes a difficult shot maker he makes difficult shot looks easy you cant give him open looks tror right to the rack for two ouille back up by eight Applause they got to make the adjustment against TR when he comes in you got to back up he has a quick first step when he squares up you got to concede the jump shot against him and make him a jump shot hes only one of six from the threepoint line anyway he do take many so when he gets it and squares up got to back up pain pull up pop a deep two goes Bing both of these teams have been shooting the ball very well in this first half Louisville has made four in a row now Boston College had made their last three before that pain miss two minutes left of this first half 10point lead for the Cardinals on the road theres Josh Beetle spins his way into the lane keeps going for two nice move there no subtle there no midrange shot no pullup jump shots got to get back get matched up with great move there by Beetle getting to the rim Waterman cant knock down the open three Beetle bounces it off his own foot Louisville basketball to your point where would Boston College be without Donald H junor he was a backup on this team a year ago the five guys in front of him look where theyre playing now Quinton post he started the other night for the Golden State Warriors you got two players of the SEC Jaden Zachary at Clemson the top the ACC and Prince of League Bay at Sean Hall yeah I mean you you lose that thats hard for anyone to overcome and I think its more disappointing because its just a sign of the times I dont know if anyone outside of Virginia Tech has lost as much as BC has throughout college basketball in the transfer portal heres R Smith contested trip triple no good little more than a minute left to this first half Boston College has hit four of their last five minute remaining one minute Louisville is shot better than 50 tonight Boston College has kept pace after a slow start the Eagles went down by 15 early in this one thats a possession there Chaz Kellys struggling to get down the court but you had rain Smith with Donald Han having a basketball in his hand thats the guy you attack well Pat Kel is livid because the officiating crew blew play dead and Rain Smith hit an uncontested three they blew it because Kelly appeared injured and obviously you know limps off drives it there maybe he comes down on the foot the offic officials blow it dead right as Smith launches that three Kelsey has a right to be a little F not happy with that one because the same thing happened early and he didnt blow the whistle and stop it and if youre going to blow it you got to blow it earlier right yes much earlier tonight hurn scooped to the hoop for two just too easy there no communication on the ball screen second breakdown on ball screen coverage that per has eight in this first half Louisville back up by 10 that rolled around did not drop for Han Applause Jr 10 seconds left to this first half Smith missed that one three seconds for Boston College a halfcourt Hees Josh Beetle hting and they lost a little confidence on the offensive shots dont fall but your defensive effort got to continue to be there Im sure they got a quick reminder of that at halftime we were here just a couple days ago we got to continue to guard defend Josh Beetle steps on the line Louisville forces a turnover on the opening possession of this second half NBC has to continue to do the little things they actually beat loville in Second Chance points J scoring a 10 to three limiting at Louisville to Five Points in transition got to continue to win the battle 50 balls give themselves a chance to get back try to get this to a one possession game here heres Hadley shot clock down to five puts it up doesnt Applause drop Donald hand Jr had the hot hand in the first half 13 points for BC Fade Away Miss fires you dont mind that shot with him its just a a score you got to allow him to go I dont other guys can enjoy the leash that he has offensively you got to live with those type of shots from him and usually heurn will make you pay from there both of these teams have come out a little flat offensively in this second half after really BC got off to that slow start trailed by 15 and then was even with Louisville both shooting really well Moval over 50 PC at about 45 I love to watch Josh Beetle play as well hes a veteran guy but he knows what he is hes just got four shots you know all I I often say I love to watch a guy percentages tell me a lot about him hes shooting 50 from the field and 56 and three that tells me he knows what he is takes good shots really efficient point guard and Louisville has missed their first four shots of this second half its allowed Boston CS to get back in this game great look inside and just like that two possession game just keep chipping away keep sharing the basketball concerted effort to get Hastings to basketball they know the double teams coming now one thing we didnt have a lot of in the first half was fouls only two free throw attempts fouls coming here as you take another look at the Hastings look inside theres no quitting this team theyre going to continue to fight and again theyre playing their best basketball theyre comfortable theyre confident you know sometimes you just luck into something as a coach and you luck into a smaller lineup which means creat more spacing he said this to us today we just simplified things you know Im not going to overreact Im not going to force things we got smaller guards just run less plays ball screen space deploy dribble drive and shoot but with venning out and for as well as Louisville was played in ACC play youre thinking this could get ugly and instead youre right Boston College has gone small and its work despite that slow start they missed two they missed nine of their first 11 shots but since theyve been right there with Louisville because this is a different Boston College team throw the record out like I said the injury to Elijah strong has forced him and then he was out and then you add Benning being out now now they really only have one big man in Hastings and youre sitting there going how do we play so we play with four guards now that theyre scoring more theyre passing the ball more its putting pressure on other team the opponents Defense heer Forces a go the blow by Chucky heer and thats what he can do count it for two thats on the Freshman ha there hes got to hes wor hes been told you can tell all week about the lob ability of Scott whos going to roll catch the lob but that ball screen set Scotts no longer your Defender you got to help stop the basketball you cant give up uncontested layups the lead back to nine for Louisville but as we just showed you this is a Boston College team that came from down 15 on Saturday to beat Florida State and Donald Han Jr hits the jumper he has 15 to lead the Eagles hes evolving into a guy right in front of our very eyes he missed last year with an injury and hes picking up strong great take Javon Hadley has been a problem all night long he leads Louisville with 13 He and Edwards will pick a match up and if you got a smaller defender on him when they get in a half court no hesitation in trying to post it Music I think R Smiths the guy you got to try to attack Dion Brown does just that right on K yeah hes the guy you got to try to make him work defensively I think attacking ewards and hatling and he bur is not the easiest thing to do theyre really good Applause Defenders heres heer rejected at The Rim by Hastings and then heurn maybe a frustration foul there on beetle yeah great job by Hastings there comeing Celtics tomorrow quiet week for everyone associated with the Dallas Mavericks right come on man the whole world talking about it as as they should I mean the Luca trade man listen Luca is one of the best players in the NBA Anthony Davis is the top 10 player in the NBA uh listen were all shocked no one saw it coming when you hear Nico and Jay kid talked about it that that only uh was between the GM Rob link and him that is truth I was in my bed in Cleveland at 1230 in the morning like you guys thinking it was a fake trade you know what have you seen from the BC Eagles T night uh you know what to be honest with you I came in I was about 5 minutes late when I came in my man number 13 right here was putting on the show Earl Grant you can tell when he runs his sets well organized they know exactly what they want to do people are playing people are playing uh definitely in their in their system uh uh defensively you could tell theyre a switch team one through four switch the fivem man kind of on a little bit we call it a channel one or a drop here but uh they they run their sets they want to shoot threes like the NBA I even seen some couple plays called stack that we that the Celtics and we run but uh I mean Im just taking back Im cuz Im in an arena that I used to play at Im half watching the game half seing you know security that still work here 20 years later man a lot of good memories Im sure for you being here man listen this is what this is the uh City the town that made me who I am as a man and as a basketball player Im just glad to have some good memories here Dad joined by Eagles great Jarett Dudley scored over 2000 points for Boston College played over 900 NBA games so for me Im thinking thats enough basketball youre good instead you decide to get into coaching with the Dallas Mavericks what made you want to stay around the game of basketball after such a successful playing career I think you have opportunities in life you can PL a lot of different seeds and one of them grew when uh Jason kid offered me the front bench I was thinking about playing uh another year or going to the GM program try to become a GM but when he offered me the front bench and I already know youre 3 to 5 years away its the right situation become a head coach so it just SP you know I I basically got to skip three or four steps being on the front bench and who wouldnt want to learn from Jason kid Hall of Famer uh at that time we had Luca you had the Mavericks of the future which we just came off a finals run so for me Ive always kind of been a coach even at DC as a rookie in the NBA and towards the end of my career helping LeBron James and watching film which is kind of a natural God gift ability tied up here good physical contest in the ACC jar we appreciate the time last thing when whens your name going up here Im looking at all the retired names you got to be going up here man listen I was talking about this when I was in college they told me you had to be retired for 20 years what it was some it was some rule cuz Troy Bell I dont know how long ago he got his retired its its been a while and and he he was before me at BC but itll happen my kids will come back here uh its only a matter of time and uh you might see me down the road here you never know its well deserved and its long overdue thank you guys apprciate you guys time I really enjoyed catching up with one of the alltime greats for Boston College Jared Dudley now an assistant coach with the Mavericks theyre in town to play the Celtics tomorrow and while we were talking with Dudley Chucky heurn took a hit still being looked at by the medical staff over on the Louisville sideline well get you an update as soon as we have one yeah he gets in the paint gets the contact and yeah lets hope hes all right thats a major concern for Coach Kelsey in the Cardinals right now hes laughing over there on the bench I think he just took one below the belt and Boston College shooting their first free throws of the night and Elijah strong knocks them both down Applause Music the BCs right there theyre just hanging around can they bring together a few more stops especially with heer out of the game instead Javon Hadley wide open underneath the basket for an easy two yeah thats a switch there Eliza strong didnt see it let the cutter get right behind him and again they cant keep in a game like this you cant keep giving up uncontested layups blown assignments Louisvilles difficult enough to be contested take and Dion Brown knocks it Applause down Edwards Jr through contact draws the foul our next gymnastics meet right here on acc network is Sunday top 25 match up Clemson at North Carolina ACC gymnastics right here Sunday 4 Eastern Time on acc Network and for the Eagles Fred P and Applause CH Baseline out of bounds Ill say it again you got to know where even inbound in the basketball you got to know where rain Smith Music is he knocked down the last three he took shooting two of five from three tonight and Louisville as a team has hit eight from Beyond The Arc tough take Javon Hadley 17 points tonight you did a really good job but defending the play again it was the design for a dribble hand off with rain Smith and Hatley just kept it drove it power in the layup Applause there Louisville has made six of their last seven four in a row and still in the drivers seat a 12point lead Boston College just cant seem to chip away at it theyll get down to six but they cant really get it under six after falling down by 15 early of the first Applause half Edwards Jr bodied up by Payne trying to spin his way Applause free knock to Waterman in the corner no good offensive rebound Hadley what a night hes had looking for more Javon Hadley the sweet Ley hook he has 19 I think you got to double their wings when the guards when they posting up there thats the situation when an offensive rebound you got to get the ball out of the paint against this Team Elijah strong goes up strong for two Applause Louisville continues to play without Chucky heper who exited the game three and A2 minutes ago with an apparent injury try and get you an update as soon as possible on that and this fires that time couldnt connect yeah hand has the green lighting you never mind him taking shots but I thought hes taking a two those last two shots quick he feels looks like he feels he has to score and he does but can be a little more cautious about it pull up pop and R Smith draws contact and we have a stoppage at play Javon Hadley he has taken over this one in Chestnut Hill 19 points for Javon Hadley and hes got his Louisville Cardinals up by 12 in the second half and theyve played okay without him he left at the 155 Mark and Louisville has outscored Boston College 96 Music since and look they can hold on to this 12point lead without him you just hope that hes available for the next time Louisville plays well and even this game I mean with the we DC has confidence in when they come back as I told you before youve got to know what rain Smith is Baseline out of bound plays this team is playing this is a different BC team with these four guards and the back for back court that they have pain coming in as we talked about knocking down three shooting up 40 they can score theres a feeling about them when theyre in these games they can come back once youve done it once you feel you can do it again and so I dont want to count out dismiss thinking that they cant come back and make this a game and just a few days ago Boston College trailed by eight with a minute to go and they won the game in regulation against Florida State offensive foul is the call underneath and if you need a reminder of the thrilling finish Saturday Boston cows Trail big in this game including by eight with a minute to go and somehow found a way to win a thrilling finish Five Points in the last 6 seconds including this thrilling Chaz Kelly heave thats your game winner so as you said theyre going to come in with some confidence nod down hey no matter how many were down we feel like we could come back and win they have the guards that can do it and definitely when you got a guy and DJ that can make shots you know you have a dude a closer they just got to continue to compete and lets see how Louisville responds without their leader for the remainder of this game potentially it was just the opposite for Louisville they led by 11 at halftime against Georgia Tech on Saturday and lost theyve got to be able to close it out down the stretch here and get back to winning ways a 10 game win streak that was snapped on Saturday you know Pac Kelsey and this team want to get back and start a new winning streak Terrence Edwards Jr lays it up and in ends a two and 12 minute scoring drought for Louisville thats a play there with Hast he did a really good job was switching but he left his feet and gave up the angle you cant do that against a veteran team or any really good offensive player theyll take advantage of it stolen away adley got caught in midair it falls to Smith hand off Edwards spins his way in goes up and hits it backto back buckets for Terrence Edwards Jr yeah turn over there you get back you cant match up easy penetration by Edwards getting to the rim and another turnover forced by Louisville B Colleges 11th turnover and the Cardinals continue to capitalize Kai Roots the freshman and it is all Louisville a 6 nothing run and right now BC in a 15point hole Louisville on a six nothing run boy do they need that coming out of the timeout Donald H junor delivers he has that ability just to put the ball in his hands oh create an opportunity for himself for his teammates and great finish there and a timely basket that the Eagles needed desperately big block on the other side by Hastings great job there I thought Scott got away with a travel there I thought he shuffled his feet could call it but hting cleaned it up nonetheless Boston College looking to string together some stops against a Louisville team shooting 51 on the night they get one here great adjustment there by Hasting doing a better job of staying in between the ball in the basket forcing a midrange teardrop securing a rebound heres strong poked away Javon Hadley picked the pocket and pay steals it right back pay off the window and in the steal and the score for Fred Payne and a foul called strong cant believe it on the inside he is living Earl Grant cant believe it either I thought that was really good defense there thats a tough whistle so great job there I thought Louisville had numbers great steal by pay going in with the the right hand in the finish the and that is a really difficult call to make in a game that has not seen a lot of fouls I mean that is just the 16th foul call tonight theres only been six free throw attempts in this game its been a clean game I think both teams have played well Louisville just a little bit more consistent on the offensive end of the oh and a little less turnovers and but again BC is shown when they get down theyve been able to string together some baskets some stops to get back in it and Junior calls the foul on the other end of the floor gives us time to remind you that next Wednesday right here on acc Network dont want to miss this double header at 900 pm eastern time count at Duke is Duke going to be the national champion I think theyre one of about four or five teams that youd have as favorites I mean theyre one of the best efficient teams I think in all of college basketball when you got a player like Cooper flag allaround game and the way that they defend as a unit is you can very well see them cutting down the Applause Nets Hadley on the inside missed it and the other question is is anyone going to beat Duke in ACC play undefeated and really nobodys put a glove on them if I had to put place of bet on it Id say I think the game at L at Clemson could be their toughest challenge remaining nobody picked up Edwards an easy layup and Louisville extends their lead to 14 Boston College is going to look back at this game and theres a couple of possessions where theyve just given un contest a layups like that that theyll look at thats like the fifth layup theyve G theyve gone it this game has been around 10 points all game long Louisville is capital it gives Cardinals the only a 59 chance of making the tournament are you kidding me oh the the numbers are lying folks the computer is broken I spoke with our bracketologist Joe lonardi earlier today he says its more like 85 90 hes got him as a seven seed right now so I think its going to be more about seeding versus will they make it h absolutely anything short of a a collapse here that I just dont see coming keeping L of a lot of the tournament 59 whos making that bet apparently ESPN BPI we need we need better computers the metrics whatever its calculating is lying the ey test has continued to prove that Louisville is not just one of the top teams in the ACC but theyre a team once they get into the tournament that can make a run they can they when you defend the way they defend and this Noah Waterman whos in the game now he gets a couple of gains under his belt as hes finally getting healthy this season and the other thing for Louisville is you look at their remaining schedule Rand off and Pat Kels team its a pretty easy schedule now conference games are tough to win granted but the teams remaining theres really not a team left look theyve got the easiest schedule on the entire ACC the rest of the way and the only problem is in terms of their resume theres not a game that can really help them theyre kind of its one of those you expect to win all of them but it can hurt you if you lose one like they did against Georgia Tech yeah and again they had won 10 straight prior to that game because georia Tech theyre playing well enough right now that they can they can hold on without Chucky hurn being out unless monitor his injury situation going forward because he has not checked back into this game and thats something to monitor when youre talking about soft tissue injuries this team has playing a schedule that way and it only help them but this is where we you and I talked in the past this is why November matters and your scheduling matters because if they were outside and needed to play themselves in a tournament like a Wake Forest it forces them to go undefeated and its not their fault they have no control over their februaries and March schedule but you have control over Junior has had 17 points tonight to join Javon Hadleys 19 this is a Louisville team who played Without Chucky heer since the 15minute Mark in the second half as we remind you terrific double header right here on acc Network womens basketball tips off Virginia Tech and Virginia and then Cal at Notre Dame in a battle of top 25 ranked teams Louisville now has their largest lead of the night 18point lead for a Cardinals team thats been in control since tip off crosscore pass finds Dion Brown he cant hit Applause it good play coming out good execution in three just unable to go down were at a critical point here for BC a lot of time left to try to get back in you got to get stopped nice spin move of bubacar trior making it look easy and L leads by Applause 20 now called on the inside TR just really quick with the basketball Drive feels the contact spins its essentially a post move by a guard you teach guys you drive middle when theyre cut off when you spin the line it just it creates an angle to allow you to finish its great to see guards do that thats just a big man move that guards when youre driving should Implement more in their game that free throw ends a thre minute scoring DRFT for Boston College and ends Louisvilles N9 nothing run theyve ballooned this lead to 19 see if BC has some cool quot pressure here you at the free throw line thats exactly what they Applause do now this is what were used to seeing from Louisville during that 10 game win streak they werent just winning games they were a buz saw blowing teams out six double digit wins during that stretch against some impressive opponents and they have certainly rebounded from that disappointing effort against Georgia Tech on Saturday just so unselfish everyone Buys in commits to doing their job and doing the little things they understand their personnel where everyone is Smith catch and shoot off balance and he missed it Waterman offensive Applause rebound heres Javon Hadley 21 points to his name tonight his second 20po game this season and draw the foul in the paint whats so impressive about this run in the second half for Louisville as theyve done it largely without Chucky heurn who at the 15minute Mark you can see there clearly in pain he exited the game and has not returned ruled out as questionable yeah you see him joking on the bench and lets hope its nothing serious but its a soft tissue injury and he grabbing his groin area there when out back came back on the court seems to be no no no ice no nothing nothing nothing on no RP I just think this could be just theyre up big and they want to wrestle now now his head coach Pat Kelce was not happy with the Bob Koozie award watch list this week and were in Boston so we got to talk about the Bob Koozie award which goes to the nations best point guard Koozie of course a legendary Boston Celtic and coach the Eagles from 63 to 69 so they released the nations top 10 point guard and Coach John Austin which we told you earlier I got to say Im with Kelsey who you cant find me 10 better point guards than Chucky heurn well and if you look at the list theres a couple of combo guards on there just what he Chucky he burs impact on both ends of the floor hes definitely top 10 I I dont know who voted for that list but that needs to be updated immediately and I would add Donovan D at Mex Mexico on that list as well I think hes 19 and six a game they first in the Mountain West I dont know why neither of those guys are on that list I find I dont know 10point guards playing better than either of those two so I have a theory and with Chucky heurn its the stats lie a little bit right if you just look at the numbers okay but look at what he does on defense look at what hes done for leadership for this Louisville team to turn around this program in the fashion he has not only should he be on the list he should be considered winning the award oh youre talking about an all big 10 Defender he should be up for def ACC defensive player the year AG you talk about the impact that he has he has that type of impact on this team uh just I I dont I dont understand it and I dont think theres enough National to talk about even with Chase Hunter the year that hes having it a 5040 90 chase that hes having that hadnt been done its Kyrie Irving the officials blow play dead here anyway were in Boston felt like you had to mention that Chucky eer was snuffed from that Bob Koozie award watch list which goes to the nations best point guard Pat Kelce made his feelings known on social media he sees it every day he knows the impact that he has and and now Javon Hadley is limed off for Louisville thats why the officials blew play dead there so urn we just mentioned went out earlier in the second half and now Hadley getting looked at the training staff whove been very busy in this second half Hadley led the Cardinals in scoring tonight with 22 R Smith passes off to three roots in the corner a fourpoint play potentially count it plus the foul for the Freshman they keep coming at you in wav they just dont let up Corner three by Ru he gets in the ACT Louis one in the country taking on number eight Boston University they have not won a bean pot since 2016 when they beat be thats the four Boston Schools competing for whos the best hockey team in Boston Ive always enjoyed hockey doing the playoffs oh the bean poot TD Gardens going to be rocking on Monday night I can guarantee you that and they raffled off four free tickets to the students that showed up here tonight they just got announced at our final media break I realized when I was younger how tough hockey guy hockey players were when I tried to train with being from Washington DC I tried to train with some of the Washington Capitals capitals and and I oh gosh it was unbeliev was embarrassing to see those guys how strong they were and I tried to ride the bike and compete with him it was laughable I I embarrassed Applause myself the Boston College had hung around in this game and then Louisville went on a 172 run over the last 5 minutes to really balloon this thing out of territory of the potential comeback yeah just just keep coming at you in waves no let up in Louisville and again we talked about them in so many offensive weapons but again theyre back to guarding and defending at a high level and an Aly oop to James Scott three minutes remaining and louville will get right back into the win column after a surprised loss to Georgia Tech on Saturday and Javon Hadley tonights player of the game brought to you by Wendys a team High 22 he was efficient early getting to a spots punishing the smaller guards than the post knocking down a couple of Threes And difficult matchup when you play him you put a bigger body on him he he takes you outside and drives you put a smaller guy up and post you inside just knows what he is really comfortable within his offense and big reason why I also with h bur why theyve been able to sustain this level of success and winning despite the guys being injured in and out of the Applause lineup just felt like Louisville found an extra gear in this second half after a disappointing second half Saturday saw a 10 game winning streak snapped and now Pat Kels team can start a new winning streak after this one yeah you cant start until you get the first one great respond here I think defensively what youre looking for out of the Cardinals and I thought they came up here and really set the tone on the defensive end of the floor a l to Hastings you know hes been a bright spot for BC filling in for Chad venning who missed tonight game with a foot injury he has hes made hes had his spots defensively and provided some Rim protection couple go you dont mind that hes giving them a presence inside hes not the offensive threat that Chad vinning is but defensive and rebounding where he can hang his hat a right on Q Hastings steals it away now when we heard that BC was going to be without vening tonight we looked at each other and said its going to be possible for them to compete but I think you credit Jaden Hastings the young big man filling in for venning for giving Boston College a chance certainly had this game within touching distance really for 30 minutes of it and then in these final 10 minutes allowed Louisville to separate themselves yeah still a reason to be positive with VC this is the at times young group on the floor and again with this guard play and the four guard lineup and make it a tough Music out you know youre just playing a lowerable cardinal team thats just defending and but theyre scoring at a rate sometimes I think this inexperienced BC group is take some quick ill advised shots they could just settle down and play at their own pace and kind of dont worry about the score as much I think theyll find themselves in in more games as we go down the final home stretch here of the season offensive rebound Kai Roots hes provided some nice minutes off the bench tonight for Pat Kels team the Cardinals make a couple of substitutions here with a minute left to play you know they did get up in the first half by 15 294 BC punch back a couple times but overall Id say this is a very comfortable Road Conference win for Pat Kels group it is and its back to what we talked about how they were in that 10 game win streak they were a dominant team doing that stretch and they came here con form and with a dominant performance and they started with another steal here and you can see it because of the defensive intensity they came out of this game and got to be really impressed with louisv going forward theyve had multiple runs in this game you know 12 nothing run 15 nothing run 19 to2 run you put enough of those together like Louisville has and when they went on their win streak thats what what they were doing it was both sides of the basketball not just the threes and the scoring for Pat Kels team but the stretches of Defense where they can shut their opponent down well theyre really good in transition so when they create turnovers they are they get the ball from back Fort to front Court as quick as anyone and again theres so many handlers so many guys capable of pushing and attacking you off the bounce and theyre all looking for that guy when they do so and everyone else knows their Road guards you got to box out when youre playing Lille because their guards go to the offensive glass they dont shoot a great percentage but they shoot a lot of shots because they they go to the glass they create turnovers defensively just a difficult team to compete against because they play out of script theyre not running a ton of sets theyre just playing now they finished this game holding Boston College to a 2 and 1 half minute scoring drought and Louisville improves to 10 and2 in ACC play with a convincing win 8458 here at Chestnut Hill its a great performance there by Louisville DC had a moments early
