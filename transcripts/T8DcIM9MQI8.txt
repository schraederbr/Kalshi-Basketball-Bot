game and you know we were talking with Earl Grant earlier today and he said you know its a game that we we really could have won maybe even we should have won the hope now is that we can take some good things out of it because we didnt right and we can clean some stuff up but well see what happens as the Citadel and Boston College in the home opener for the Eagles here at Ki forum Eagles in that ever familiar mantoman thats what coach Grant really likes Citadels the same way a mantoman team were not going to see much zone Carter Kingsberry gets his First start of the year today A transfer from Iowa Kicks for more And your first threepoint look for the Citadel is good Simple inside out passing Great job by the Iowa transfer Kingsbury catching in the post being strong with it throwing to a relocating perimeter player Fred Payne steps into one And Fred Payne is a little bit strong from three Shaw had a piece of the rebound Then its Hastings but he couldnt finish Yeah hes got to do a better job with that three for three in the first game from the field but older guy like Jaden hes got to finish that one In his third year now red shirt sophomore from Orlando Florida Averaged about 15 minutes a game last year Scored four points came on as the season went on Scored in double figures in that game late against Clemson in March Intense ball pressure from the Eagles on the perimeter And out of BC is too strong for three Last year the Citadel was just three for 24 from three in this building on opening night Austin College coming away with a 6960 victory Third year in a row these two have played Yeah the guys in blue theyre going to pack in the lane Theyre not going to overplay You can see all the blue shirts congregated close to the lane Call it pack and uh packline defense for coach Dworth Hes in his fourth year of his second stint with the Citadel His eighth year overall as the head coach of his alma mater cheering Longtime head coach around college basketball was the head coach of Tulain for a little while assistant with Vanderbilt and Minnesota before finding his way back to the Citadel You can check the books on this I think he holds one of the scoring records at Citadel for threepointers as we talk about it A team may break that this year the amount theyre shooting That is in and out from Chase Forte a grad student coming in from South Dakota Really strong defensive player That kicks up high and its Davis straight on whos no good but an offensive rebound for Aay Wallally whos a native of Providence Rhode Island playing here in New England for the second year in a row But Hastings takes it away Too bad they had a second chance opportunity there and turn the ball over A live ball turnover And now Hastings and they get a blocking foul which goes against the Citadel Well Grant on the other side for Boston College Year five now for Earl He says We you know were we feel like we were better prepared to handle the off season We feel like we did a good job with it We feel like were a little bit better this year And hes hoping that the signs they got out of game number one against a good FAU team and a true road game in game one they can build off of Thats just one guy right there bringing in Shaw from Missouri Hayden Shaw thats a big addition in the front court This guy with the ball is a big addition as well Heres Donald Han straight on Foul is called So Donald Han Jr who really of all the new pieces we can talk about what Earl Grant said was priority number one was keeping Donald Han Jr here wearing maroon and gold and they have certainly done that Last years ACC most improved player of the year How about this guy played 80 of the available minutes a year ago and hes good on the free throw Absolutely critical to keep him here Hes got the green light at all times Hes a goto scorer Certainly has proven himself in the Atlantic Coast Conference Good to see him make a couple of free throws It was an oddity to see him go just 6 for13 from the foul line in game one He was an 86 free throw shooter last year which was one of the best in the ACC Yeah And he got to the line like 160 times I think he led the team in free throw attempts as well knows how to play the contact to get himself to the free throw line So important to see him hit three and tie the game early Boston College after the foul on Kingsbury Thats what the Eagles did the other night at Florida Atlantic They picked up full court not with any trapping just to put pressure on the basketball But the Citadel team theyre going to go deep in the shot clock Played at one of the slowest tempos in the country last year Cles around for Moore Christian Moore against Shaw with five to shoot Moore spins to his right and cant hit at the rim And then a foul on the rebound attempt There you saw the length the great length at the rim of Aiden Shaw Hes active everywhere and just doing a good job not falling for any fakes and staying vertical down in that area This is just a good play by Shaw Strong defense Sometimes the undersized guys which he is can give you problems Shaw played 92 games at Missouri in his career So you just talk about experience coming in being a major factor That was something Earl Gran said Hes like Yeah I know a lot of newcomers and maybe it doesnt look that way but it feels like its a good mix to him with some experienced guys as music well as some younger guys Absolutely Shaw is older now in his senior year Capki who well see is a junior Chase Forte is senior maybe even a graduate student by now Shaw inside for Hastings Gives it right back And Shaw who was losing his footing but they get the foul So we talk about some of the newcomers for Boston College All transfers here Forte coming in from South Dakota Shaw we mentioned from Missouri and Bowden Capky after a year or two at Butler Midwest comes east Stretch four with Shaw Stud length Straight stud length with Shaw Stretch four with Kapki Forte is going to give leadership Shaw goes inside against Adabesi And decent defensive job there by Schola Adabi the senior This one of the things with Citadel theyll push it and get into open spacing You can see how wide they are right now Theyre going to use the corners This is classic five out Logan Applegate is in now The senior came in as a transfer from Drury And they love his threepoint shot Another big one there from Christian Moore Moore was three for seven the other night at the threepoint line That was pure right there Was two for two so far tonight Citadel with an early lead six to3 This is largely zone principles right here The guys in blue just packing the lane cheering Frank P is blocked That is Adabi with an aggressive play to get out there on pain Boy how about that close out You talk about closing out avoiding fouling but he reached up so high his length was so good out of easy that he was able to block that Those are great minutes for him to start the game number eight Adabi listed at 67 Hes an interesting story Well get into it Guess hes got some vertical too We saw that Yes he does started as a walkon at Florida State and goes inside for Hastings and hes fouled with 38 on the timer Not a ton of points here in the early going but the Citadel has found a couple of threepointers by way of Christian Moore the sophomore from Los Angeles who shot 33 from behind the ark music last year as an early six for the Bulldogs then walked on to the Florida State mens team for two years played 15 games I mean you can see the length right So couple coaches saw that and Ed Conroy gets him and had a really nice year last year Averaged over eight points a game played 25 and should just expand on that this year Oh man And just watch him He takes no possessions off That was such a superb effort right there But credit to coach Leonard Hamilton for seeing him in the practice Jim and give him a chance But hes a good leader and hes at a leadership school and hes one of the better leaders of this team Graduated from Florida State with a degree in computer science for coming to the Citadel So an impressive young man Absolutely And this team has a onepoint lead over Boston College after a couple of free throws from Jaden Hastings One thing for the Citadel here theyve already committed six fouls in the first not even 5 minutes of this game So seemed that physical I think we both were surprised by that number You can see here theyre just going to spread the offense out Threepointer Applegate is fouled by Forte So Logan Applegate who they brought in to be a threepoint shooter coming out of Drury and hell get a couple of chances at the line Well theres a contrary view of closing out Dont foul a shooter not a threepoint shooter And you can see you dont go into the body straight on You go at an angle as we saw with Adabzy And boy couldnt get two more distinct ways of moving from a position inside to the perimeter to contest a shot Hows this for crazy cheering stats Applegate last year for Jury 67 threes made The year before that 67 threes made Before that exactly cheering 67 threes made Hes one of four You talk about transfer portal and everything thats going on Citadel took four division 2 transfers through the portal They may not even been in the portal for all we know but this guy was one of them And I think coach really believes that division 2 players can make the transition to their level in the Southern Conference He goes one of three at the line So 75 the Citadel leads Marco Redonovich the first year who had a nice opener against FAU Eight points and a couple of threes is in for Boston College Here is music Donald whos no good from three give the Citadel credit with their half court zone defense You know Eric some sometimes you see zone defenses hands are down their hands are up their hands are wide Theyre doing a good job moving to spots quickly with their feet This is where they just look to test your patience by passing the ball What a backup What a great pass that was And count the basket You want to see a pocket pass off the dribble Watch Marcus Gonzalez here pocket pass that came right from his pocket cheering Another first year from Chicago is credited with two The Citadel leads nine to five Good job with a lefty finish by Gonzalez too And that is taken away Gonzalez all alone Great job in the zone defense reading the passer reading the weak side Watch See their hands are extended their hands are up playing with great enthusiasm right now on the road Theyre four of seven from the floor Theyve made two threepointers 11 to five lead and a blocking foul is called Zone defense is real good with hands up reading the passes and excellent job music just getting away Marco Gonzalez people talking about him Brother Rice Chicago decorated Catholic school in Chicago area Well now as we were just talking about with 1425 still remaining in the first half Boston College already shooting the one and one after that last foul And certainly its important that they get there and and maybe make up a bit for what they did the other night at Florida Atlantic only shooting 50 at the free throw line That was definitely a factor especially late in that game So Serge something that they talked about worked on of course Now theyre having an opportunity to get there early in the game when theyre 0 for six from the field and six for seven from the line So thats basketball for you Kick out three in and out but a FLYING REBOUND OUT OF BC out of nowhere I tell you he takes no possessions off Wow Yeah Center field on that one After the miss from three from Braxton Williams the Citadel leads 136 and the Eagles still have not hit a shot from the floor Is it here with hands Not for the moment as a blocking foul So theyre doing so much well but BCs going to get so many free throws here in the first half This is just a great job Again a lefthanded bounce pass gets the cutter And Citadel like Boston College uses the corners quite a bit And when you shoot from the corners the weak side rebounding angle is right there for the taking You can see he had a beautiful runway right to get that back in And even there look how far out he was when he started that run Think hes athletic But both these teams will use the corners on offense and attempt to spread the defense out And one of the results is that becomes a very good offensive rebounding angle Well a good sign for Donald Han Hes five of six at the foul line to start this game That last foul going against Applegate Misses one here He has five of Boston Colleges seven All the Eagles points have come at the line so far 137 game early in the first half Citadel winning the rebound battle now 84 out of BC Straight on three is good Jolola out of BC Give him the game ball now No hands down Very confident shooter right there Not going to take a lot of threes but if its there hell do it A ninepoint lead for the Citadel Donalds hand is short from three Rebound available Its hand and that is in and out 0 for eight from the floor to start this game for Boston College And only two offensive rebounds So that board is being won by the Citadel with eight defensive rebounds or seven defensive rebounds and the Citadel is six of 10 from the floors They havent missed very much Wallally the Providence native sliding lap left hand No Good job by WallE playing off of two feet as he got into the lane with the short clock If the Eagles want to go quickly Ham thought about it Got to get into some rhythm here against the zone Theyve got some shooters out there Here is Aamoda His first threepoint attempt is no good But an offensive rebound and the put back goes First field goal for BC belongs to Rodanovich Rodanovich doing a good job Hes in there to be a perimeter shooter and he comes in as shot ready There he contributes with an offensive board Get the second chance point The threepoint attempt was from Jason Oamoda a transfer from Baylor whos a native of Massachusetts Lyn Mass Nass to shoot for Gonzalez against hand and to the corner Another three out of BC Too strong that time and hits the trailer Fred Payne is too strong BC just trying to beat the zone down the floor Got into the lane with it Eagles are seven of nine from the foul line and one for 11 from the floor This ball is not sticking It just moves on the perimeter You can tell theyre trying to find the best shot available Deep three no good Thats off of Adabesci and out of bounds Boston College when we return to Ki forum A heck of a start on the road for this He has been so good so far at music both ends of the court Offensive rebounding here Defensive block shot at the other end Stretch the defense as an offensive threepoint threat and showing strong enthusiasm He has five points and five rebounds already in seven minutes of action Eagles just need to find their rhythm against the zone Sometimes when you see it for the first time each season this does happen Reddanovich coming inside Nice finger roll So Rodonovich has both of the Eagles field goal makes and did it in ways you dont expect You think hes coming in just a deep shoot but he got an offensive rebound put back there He takes the ball to the goal nicely Young freshman a native of Montenegro Played 16 minutes in the opener had eight points and a lot of that was late in key moments in that game on the road against FAU in the opener Hes got a rebound here Good defensive recovery by the guys in blue shirts as the Eagles try to push it Theyre just going to drive it And there it is Theres Fort Tank has his first two Its clear theyve come out of that timeout talking about driving the basketball against the zone Those are two tough tough drives Of course theyll be in the bonus pretty soon at the free throw line Of Boston Colleges first 11 attempts seven of them were from behind the arc Its probably more cheering than they would want when theyre going right in their time under O Grant Single digits in the clock right now but you can see no real panic for the guys in blue Christian Moore step back high arcing three is no good And Bowden Capy pulls the rebound for BC This is where Fortes leadership as you can see with the balls got to come out Hes a veteran guy again trying to get in the lane off the dribble does a good job keeping possession Hits Rodonovich good from three Its exactly why we thought coach Frant brought him in this early cuz that is indeed what he does And just like that a nine nothing Boston College run has squared this game at 16 Just just dont want a careless one This guy can really shoot the ball but hes confident here on the drive aggressively attacking the shot blocker to contact This is good inside out passing Hes trigger ready Trigger ready on each catch on the perimeter So already seven points after eight in the opener Last foul went against Fred Payne for Boston College Caleb Steager freshman from Dallas is in there for the first time for BC Thats a lob inside Psky read it really well And as Samoda ON THE RUN AND HE GOT THE cheering BUCKET AND THE FOUL applause How excited is this guy playing in Boston for the first time after transferring What energy to push the ball down the court just beat the zone defense down And oh by the way Im going to go to contact and get to the line Super athletic Thats what we know about him Knew he could run the floor like a deer with speed and quickness This is a big portal edition from Baylor He played his prep basketball in Phoenix but as you said native of Massachusetts from Lynn didnt really find his way into the rotation last year for Baylor Played 24 games averaged just 16 points per game You know theres still the part of the transfer portal where you know maybe youre not in the rotation at one place maybe you are at another place and you can kind of find your spot and he comes back home and has a chance to do just that And you find this actually coaches are pretty solid with that too If you want to find better opportunity go find it You can do it right away Coach Grant this is a good get a Boston area guy to come back Its 1916 Boston College Theyve scored the last 12 points of this basketball game after a nice lead for the Citadel That is Kingsberry whos out there with two fouls It rolls off the rim but an offensive rebound for Moore Gonzalez kicks back It cycles Moore for three Is off Actually felt like Gonzalez didnt realize how open he was I dont think so Yeah offense kind of had to circle through and there is Kappy Zone defense got back They had five guys back but they didnt play post defense on Kappy and you can see right there thats the inside component to his game Well see him take a threepointer as well Great inside outside threat at the four spot So now all of a sudden the Citadel has missed seven in a row from the floor and the Eagles have scored 14 consecutive points Heres Davis Moore finds it against Asamod Moore spins and gets the bucket Eight points for Christian Moore Christian Moore The second leading scorer last year Actually prepped in New England with Avon Old Farms His sophomore year from Los Angeles Reddanovich in and out Got a confident stroke though right now Sure was Good job by the the Eagles setting a screen in the top of the zone getting into the lane a little bit and creating a catch and shoot play on a penetration and kick or thought about it again Instead he drives Its blocked So Oamotos been active early and he walks into a three and is a little bit short And then a foul on the rebound attempt sends us to a timeout on the floor Well did that change in a hurry after the Eagles struggled from the floor early A 14 Now remember those plays last year end of game we see officials go review on their own They could not do that any longer The coaches control that TAKE IT AWAY B SCORES Defensive player of the year in the summit last year Showing you why he averaged just under two steals per game last year here Forts been around This is his fifth school but again we talk about that experience point and he really fits that for Earl Graham Kingsberry spun gives it off Gonzalez the freshman against Forte four to shoot Kingsberrys got to get up He does but he couldnt hit Yeah give the Eagles credit Eric Lots of red lights on that possession Forte finds Stiger whos good Well that was what he was recruited for as well Caleb Stager six fight of Dallas Jesuit High School Thats what he is A marksman It is a 192 Boston College run over the last six minutes and they lead 26 18 Back to Ki forum in 30 seconds Well heres why he was picked as the Summit League defensive player of the year last year That is not easy to do to get that lead hand to the dribble Most important thing is he stays low His shoulders are low Guy knows how to guard the ball He was first team all summit music last year as well 18 points a game three assists two steals as we said Got to the foul line a ton after coming in from Northwestern State He was with GF Coast State and UNCC Asheville prior to that And now here at Boston College this team up by eight with six minutes to go here in the first half Eagles and the Citadel How about the Eagles 15 points off their bench right now Thats been a factor out of BC coming back into the game against Hastings And the foul goes against Jaden Hastings His first foul No he really didnt have to He was in a good stance He was squared up nicely He didnt have to reach in that spot But this is a new role for Jaden Hastings this year Higher expectations Hes been an understudy in his previous two seasons So two two pretty good players You see him there with a good strong edge But they really like between him and Kathy It gives Boston College some nice size inside and theyre cheering pretty excited about where those guys are each in their third year in college Or cant hit on the fall away Forced a difficult shot Eagles defense really cranking up in the painted area right now Donald Han back for the point guard Forte to reset with 18 to shoot He drives against out of BC Hes trying to come around Kingsberry on the pass Its out of bounds and will stay here Well see as we get more mantoman Youll see the volume of ball screens that the Eagles like to play off of Theyve got a number of sets where they wind up screening the dribbler Theyve got wide spacing especially in the corners And off the inbound 10 to shoot for Boston College with Shaw back in there Shaw kicks Forte got to go Just one on the timer and he draws the foul against WallE Actually Wallally did a good job It was deep in the clock though Thats You just got to define your hands right there But he did a good job with his footwork Unfortunately just got tough there Watch this close out Hes up Just goes into it too much And that is his third personal foul and puts Boston College in the double bonus for the rest of this first half You know ironically we were talking about all the fouls that the Citadel had committed early and said Oh there might be a lot of free throws This whole run for Boston College has actually not been at the foul line Yeah Yeah Yeah Bench guys have come in as we said done a nice job being aggressive I think the second wave of players in the rotation really up the tempo nicely Run is up to 202 now for Boston College over the last 719 Theyve made seven of their n last nine shots from the floor after starting one for 11 Still only two for 11 from the threepoint line too Thats a tough foul right there when youre way down the end of the court Its Aiden Shaw the senior called for the foul Gabe Hernandez a junior came in from Barry University is in for the first time One of those D2 transfers we mentioned This is where the Eagles can be good Just sit down guard put pressure on them Big the big switch You can see the court is wide open right now trying to find driving lanes Littles doing a better job packing it in Thats turned over Davis is trying to find Kingsberry but its Steager in the way and he walks into a three but its strong Freshman being overly ambitious right there They did a great job on the weak side as they tried to throw to the long corner with the pass Getting a little more time today after playing five minutes in the opener on the road against FAU Eagles just doing a much better job You can see sitting down in their stances Hastings there Better job getting to back door cuts But this is just solid D right here Watch this steel on the weak side You know that offensive player was driving it with an intention to pass You can see he wasnt looking at the rim Was a good read by the young freshman Stever coming up with the steal But only the fourth turnover for the Citadel Just one on the timer Kingsbury up and did not get it off cheering Good defense from Aiden Shaw Sure was the undersized Carter Kingsbury tries to take him into the post Be creative there and tight Is pretty physically strong but the height matchup is distinct there He played 13 games his first two years with Iowa before jumping up to 23 last year Averaged about 7 minutes a game Ed Conroy had a connection with Fran McCaffrey the former Iowa coach Thats kind of how they got Kingsberry on his radar He stings inside and he throws it down Good job against the zone driving it driving the ball to the baseline getting one of the middle players to come out and help out Diving right to the rim for the easy catch and finish Smart play by Kingsberry to throw it off of Hastings So itll be the Bulldogs ball Forte and you know kind of just adopting the chip that Earl Grant talks about a lot on the shoulders of this program as they try to build their way up Feels like a pretty seamless fit here to BC you know and chip on the shoulder is just what youd expect from a journeyman like him Hes been a lot of places Kingsberry got inside finds Braxton Williams You see Kingsbury no time left Great job defensively Kingsbury tried to go to the baseline throw that pass to the corner red lighted by the Eagle defense I mean its completely flipped as this first half has gone on Boston College started one of 11 The Citadel has gone one and 11 since that point from the floor as the Eagles have gone on this 232 run Again change of defenses go a little more zone try to keep them spread Eagles in a five out set right now Donald Hans no good from three defended well by Kingsbury Sure was Theyll probably talk a little bit about patience against the zone They just move the ball quickly go inside out Theyll find some good shots Good job by Payne guarding a zoom handoff No good on the three but the put back goes out of BC inside Thats adamant every time You got to get a body You dont have to go deep into him with a box up but you got to get a body in front of him on the offensive glass Fred Payne floater Got it Fred Payne with his second collegiate start the other night This is his third Such an exciting young player Out of BC fights a lane but he missed Caught a break overrushed him Caught a break Good recovery defense by the guys from Citadel there Here is Hands Wow Crazy shot goes for Donald Hans Thats his first field goal of the game Hes got seven points after he made five free throws earlier Theres the miss from out of BC And then Donald Ham at the other end Just Donald H getting into the post area getting tight to the rim showing his creativity Number 13 How about 13 free throw attempts the other night at Florida Atlanta Donald H Oh theyre going to need that in a big way And and hes made them today which is a key Theres the whistle and a foul after the make from Braxton Williams Eagle certainly in good shape You dont want to get an and one but again a good pocket pass again playing off of two feet want to challenge him but you knew he was going to get tight to the rim and create this round situation So Braxton Williams a senior came in from Valdasta State this year and hes no good on the free throw 80 seconds remaining in a first half Just seen some big swings Heres Forte Tryson connects cheering Eight for Chase Forte Knows how to find the paint That was a zone They were wide Just drove the thing When youve got dribble skills like him against his zone you can let him stick the ball in his hands and get in there and try to create out of BCs had a nice half Seven points He hits Davis whose threepointer is no good Whistle and a foul on the rebound attempt You know Davis is one guy who has not scored in this first half Someone we talked about off the top of the show and Boston College has done a nice job He was in foul trouble a little bit earlier so he was off the floor but theyve done a nice job keeping him in check Hes a recognized scoreer Absolutely right again driving it and its hand wide open but he cant hit the three Another foul on the rebound attempts Chase Forte just continues to do a strong job being strong with the basketball Gets middle of the paint gets a spot up pass Hes going to be will be so effective this year creating opportunities for his teammates off his middle drive Hes a a guy that can score fore and hes a guy that can playmake Coming up in our halftime report well go into our ACC network studio Taylor Tannenbomb in company previewing the ACC season Joel Barry and Luke Hancock Highlights and stats coming up as well Christian Moore makes at the foul line Thats nine points for Moore which matches his total from game number one Boston College winning the rebound battle at this point at this point by 11 1514 That was a number against FAU Boston College had 52 rebounds in that game Yes it went to overtime but 52 rebounds is the first time that Boston College had 50 rebounds in a game since November 10th of 2017 against Maine when they had 51 in the opener You know that was a high possession game Florida Atlantic and the Eagles both wanted to play with pace in the opener Got a little frenetic from time to time But that was a that was a true road environment that Boston College went down to against a good FAU team Forte was trying to get it to the corner Actually almost went in Then Kapky finds the rebound and cheering he scores For Bowden Capy just staying with the play and tight at the end of the half Threepointers no good from Braxton Williams And Boston College totally flips the first half after one point trailing music 167 zone and kicks for pain and it cycles for Forte who finds Donald Thats what we were just talking about You knew Forte knew he had to spray the ball a little bit if he got in the lane get his scoreer going Boston College finished that first half 12 of 18 from the floor Theres a kick for Moore and he drives and it cycles around for WallE up top Wallally who had three fouls in that first half so had to sit for a decent chunk of time there The Providence good extra pass there to get WallE a nice look at the goal Heres Han trying again Quite had the shooting stroke so far Hes just got to play through it right now It hasnt been his night so far Pan just one of eight from the floor 0 of six from behind the arc but does have six rebounds Eagles backing up and packing music in their defense just a little bit here Just not chasing on the perimeter maybe as they were early in the ball game Just trying to stay between their man and the basket Kingsberry driving has to go against a double team out of BC came in for the followup and Boston College has the rebound You can see Forte just gave it up to Fred Payne there to try to get him going too But changing defenses doesnt seem to matter Man or zone Heres Shaw for three Tough one Yeah tough one Little bit of speed from WallE Finds its way to out of BC And now straight on three is no good So now neither team can make a shot here early in the second half Theres a wellcontested three by the Eagles And a blocking foul called as Fred Payne comes driving in Now this Boston College defense has really packed in a little bit more Not chasing on the perimeter not letting the wide spacing with all the passing that weve seen from the Citadel opens up a driving lane for sure and there was a rim block right there Good D by the Eagles We know that is Earl Grants bread and butter ever since he came here to Boston College from the College of Charleston Pretty not pretty was the initial mantra Forte fits that and he gets that roll First in double figures for BC is Chase Forte Double figures again Two nights in a row to start the season for the junior the graduate student Eagles again Pressure defense on just sit down Pressure the ball Job by Forte taking away the driving lane Theres the threepointer We didnt not see a ton of Logan Applegate in the first half No Off the mark there Donald Han doing a good job with a close out there Had a high hand in Applegates face Pace has slowed a little bit to begin this second half Theres an extra pass for Han as he backs down against Applegate with 13 to shoot and Han falling away and hes got it Just finding his game Primitive things not happening Get into the post area Excellent job with the dribble post up game Its a good job by Jaden Hastings here You can see hes not chasing anybody but hes got that length that he can sit back and go with a cushion still challenge the shot Yeah quality defense that whole sequence Boston College with their largest lead of the game right now at 18 Now a foul called away from the ball against tied up with Hastings This a real good job by Donald Han using the dribble play They give him a lot of room here Give him a whole side to play Finds his way Gets a nice easy turnaround Midrange game So much expected from him this year The goto scorer Rich Grant giving him the green light at all times That was a good illustration how they love to give him space to create his own shot off the dribble Something he can do facing or with his back to the basket as we saw there Oh thats a good screen on the weak side He had him Theres Fred Payne Got his defender moving finds hand drives and the Red Sea Pikes Donald Did it ever Well look not the most efficient day in the world but hes found his way to 11 points Thats important They tried that back cut Really good read by Forte Sure was You said they theyve covered that back cutting very well Shot applause How about that radius for Shaw Watch this Watch music him get up and what a radius Perfectly delivered and that it can be able to exceed that projection a little bit And a foul right here Talk more about that on the other side It is a is a bit of a gauntlet Only four teams made it to the NCA tournament last year 4624 the Boston been around a lot of different places coming to Boston College for a grad year and cheering feels like just you can hear it in that answer that hes going to fit right into the culture that Earl Grant is trying to build with this program as they try to exceed expectations this year Terrific poise at the podium there Clearly you know one of the things you always look for in these early games as a coach is whos got the competitive character the IT factor I think he does in these first two ball games You know we talked so much about the new age of college athletics and the portal and on on you know Earl Grants mentioned this a time or two that you know its still about finding the right group of guys They still have to come together Theres still theres going to be growing pains for all groups Coach Grant certainly is up for the challenge of this but I think hes got a high quality point guard here and Chase Forte And you can see in watching them play his fingerprints are on every possession offensively and defensively 10 points so far five assists so far as a playmaker You can see the confidence they have in giving the ball and putting in his hands like he is right here Not that its the biggest factor with where the score is right now but the Citadel just four of 10 from the foul line today Boston College leads 462 Eagles trying to open up the court with some wide spacing Forte no good but the rebound finds its way down to Kafky who couldnt finish at the rim Yeah hed like to have that one back again Probably would have used the backboard better And you can see out for it defensively but does commit the foul Yeah got beat by the rim runner who was his man Second foul on Kafki This was the big thing for the Citadel coming in right You can see it with where they were ranking They just struggled to shoot the basketball a year ago and that was the big piece for Ed Conroy trying to find some pieces to come in and be able to increase some of that shooting Yeah nobody likes those analytics uh for any season And when you shoot the ball at that level you put tremendous pressure on your defense and your rebounding And their defense couldnt get to that level to really offset that kind of shooting And they had to play at a slower tempo last year Scored 66 points a game and went deep in the shot clock in a lot of possessions Cashes Bonasi scores his first point of the game from the foul line 20point lead for Boston College 5 minutes into the second half Fred Payne for three Its no good Fred Donovanic finds a rebound inside and its out of bounds Itll stay here So look BCs doing this without the threepoint shot music tonight They are just two of 19 from behind the arc This guy here is going to be pretty good too As you said dead eye shooter but he showed us he can put the ball on the floor And just in that possession too hes going to compete for the rebounds Comes in from Montenegro A little bit of international experience He played for Montenegro at the U20 European Championship Bivision He averaged 16 points a game in seven games Thatll hand foul applause DJ again getting into the low post using his dribble game Citadel choosing not to double team stay with the people on the perimeter So he sets himself up nicely gives him a lot of room there You can see below him was Aiden Shaw in the dunker spot just trying to relocate to give him more room and get in position for a tip in Donald Han as we said the ACC most improved player last year was an 11 point per game production increase up to 157 points per game last season And you know you you made this point that now hes not that he wasnt relied upon last year but now hes really relied upon And and games like this where maybe you dont have your A shooting touch but you got to find a way to get your points This becomes a pretty legitimate factor in becoming that type of player And his teammates know it and theyre watching his example right now And this is part of his growth But hes shown some good opportunities in his low post game off the dribble Nice take to the basket and Marcos Gonzalez has had a couple of nice moments here The pressure sure was excellent job by Marcos with the left hand Eagles needed to wall up better though Thats a guy they could have walled up and closed the door on him right there in tight Rodanovich strong from three Now Rodanovich very very confident He looks his defender down We saw that at Florida Atlantic Your hands are down Hes going to shoot it Nice extra pass but the follows not there from just looked like he felt like the defender was closer than he was Han now scoops inside this foul We see Han get to the postup game And now we see him just a almost like a stampede cut Run right through the pass and take it right to the goal just to find a way You can see this just go rip it go to contact and be creative with your finish Guys in blue try to block a shot rather than as we saw at the other end wall up and make this shot difficult So Donald Han with 12 points today Hes six of 10 from the foul line now So its been a little bit of something early in the season This is an 86 free throw shooter last year Was now 12 for 23 at the line to start the season About that double figures right there Double figures free throw attempts to start the season Finished fifth in the ACC last year in free throw percentage Such a valuable guy if you get him to over 150 free throw attempts on a season Heres Davis whos been in foul trouble all day for the Citadel playing on three right now Nice take inside the Gonzalez Couldnt finish at the rim Good exchange to the dribble and Gonzalez got a good look at the goal again Donald Han from the elbow and that finds the roll Shooters roll for sure Got the midrange going and hes definitely taken more shots in the second half Braxton Williams inside Nice take by Williams Sure was It was a good wall up there by Kapki He went right through him Forte drives with a held ball before Forte went up with the shot The foul goes against Gonzalez No Citadel not backing down You can see again just a tough take to the rim A good wall up there to try to stop it Playing through contact The fifth foul of the half on the Citadel and Forte continues to have a strong day Thats 11 points Eagles now 13 of 18 from the free throw line He mentioned it It was 50 against FAU Both teams really struggled from the foul line FIU was almost better from three than they were from the foul line in that game They made him in overtime though and that was a difference maker hit Gonzalez tries to get it out for Williams who finds it Little handoff inside Ball starting to move again for the Citadel Threepointer Williams Yes that was a great spot up Starts with the drive in the long corner there Excellent job by Gonzalez finding the open shooter Braxton Williams up to seven points His first made three Donald no good from the outside How about Adabzy That was his 12th rebound Games leading rebounder Another corner three Not there this time Citadel is 4 for9 from behind the arc Good block out by Tapki to get the games leading rebounder Counts all the same Jason Oamoda Had to smile Look at him Hes smiling He knows that is his first three as a member of the Eagles That will be a memorable one I dont think these fellas will let him forget that either His first one Another assist for Forte Thats six tonight And then a foul on the other end A threepointer from Acamoda He has six points And Boston College ever since the early moments of this game has been in control of their home opener music They had seven games decided by five points or fewer They were not able to win any of those games and they feel like theyve been able to add at least some pieces to try to change that number a little bit this year And they had two losses in late February One to Wford by a point who wound up going to the NCA tournament and they had a onepoint loss in Chattanooga who won the regular season in the league So they were there in February Threepointer as good Wow What rotation on that catch and shoot Hes up to nine points which is a new careerh high for Jason Oamoto and went to Baylor to start his career Played 24 games last year limited time and they are hoping he can find a home back in his home state of Massachusetts Was a beautiful rotation on the ball as you saw 68 200 shooting over the top Got good hands We showed you before Runs like a deer Forte drives right hand is going the other way There was one that might not have been there They closed down that driving lane pretty well Might have been time to pass the ball but 55 and white Hopefully a bright future here for the Eagles One of four transfers joining this Boston College team Eight newcomers in this year Good job covering the back cut right there for early in the first half We saw those pocket bounce passes Three ball straight on for Davis is no good All contested by Steer Rodanovich on the drive Left hand scoop and the follow by Hastings He was hungry for that one as soon as it got near the rim Jaden Hastings He has six points today Boston College leads 5935 How about that drive by 88 tell hes played international ball Davis spins off and is fouled I mean you say the word confident right It just feels like its We heard off of him We heard he was athletic Theres his nondominant left hand just doing a great job into the slot right there Whats that adjustment coming from the international game coming over here to the States Yeah and hes a unique international player in that he didnt play any prep school ball any junior college ball Came right right off the boat as they say And hes had great experience in the under 20 or under 18 I think it was the under 20 team he was with in the European Championships where he averaged 16 and nine skilled Keenan Davis finally gets on the scoreboard with that free throw Again had been in some foul trouble today So that was most of it Hes knocked down a couple of free throws here Three points in the game Just really looked to go middle ball screen for Forte Give him some space to play You can see theres one gap there He shouldnt be driving that one Just pitch it out And the foul goes against Adabisi Its a tough matchup at times Try to get around 69 240 So Jaden Hastings who again is you know you go into year three youre adding on to your role a little bit tied his careerh high with four blocks in that first game music against FAU He can be an excellent defender Hes got the wherewithal taking the freshman to school And hes got a block right there First block of todays game for Jaden Hastings Reddanovich walks his way into a three A little off the mark there And then out front Williams scores Just not a good job by the Eagles with conversion defense Shot taken nobody getting back And good run of the floor by the guys in blue Williams has nine Following up his eight points in game number one See Eagles opening up the floor just a little bit more Middle ball screen Let Forte music play in the middle of the third of the floor Solo post up in the low post get into Hastings That is out of bounds off of Boston College Theres the block from Hastings Well he can protect the rim and be avers piece of that one right there This is an even better look at it Retrieves the block shot Keeps it alive Does a good job not to leave his man until the last moment drive inside out of BC against Hastings Wasnt some size there Yeah sure was around for Williams whos too strong from three Offensive rebound though and Davis nice little handoff for out of terrific job by Keenan Davis getting into the lane Soft rotation by the Eagles led to the passing lane showing up Double figure game for Aabisi But Donovich fakes Hands got his defender in the air Asam is in and out but an offensive rebound for Hands Great Hes up to 17 points Great possession inside exterior passing Extra passing Getting a second chance opportunity cheering Seven rebounds now for Han And another block from Hastings Well he timed that right just like we were talking about on the last one Eric Rodanovich running the floor Nice tap by hand Rodanovich from three is a little short So neither team has had the threepoint shot today Eagles have done a lot of everything else though And Fred Pay got it and a foul applause and cheering Boy super job by Hastings Thats the big block there and then the Eagles running the floor Theyre up big Donalds hand certainly has here in this second half He scored 10 points in the second up to 17 He likes these home rims music on the Commonwealth A side of the building Post up game midrange game Drive the ball to the rim Trying to stay patient He knows who he is Hes trying to stay patient and deliver appropriate scoring But one of the stories offensively for the Eagles is only two turnovers at this point And both by freshman Theyve been very good with the basketball Theyve been very good on their twopoint shots Theyre 19 of 27 from inside the arc Theyve done it without the threepoint shot today Just got to keep challenging themselves to guard in the half court area 10 to shoot Williams was trying to get it off late in the timer Hastings with a nice rotation Creates the turnover 10 turnovers now from Citadel Boston College has scored 11 points off those turnovers This is their largest lead at 24 in a game Remember that Boston College trailed by as much as nine in the first half Fred Payne a little out of control there and then a foul on the rebound attempts You know clearly they tried to get the ball in Freds hands in the middle third of the court Donald Han set a ball screen for him and went to his dominant nondominant right hand Single digits digits tonight for Fred Five points on two for seven shooting Still trying to find his shooting touch early in the season One of the things for Boston College right now Chase Forte comes in running the point BC is without Luca Taves for a little while early in the season so it kind of forces Fred Payne into that second point guard role Eagles are fortunate Theyve got three perimeter players with excellent versatility to play any one of three spots Backtoback fouls on Hastings So that is four on him Itll be interesting to see one thing that Earl Grant said at that you know media day a couple of weeks ago is you know if we can get to a point where we can get Donald Han to be more like a two Yes Then you might be starting to really work with something here We havent seen a ton of that yet early in the season but thatll be something to watch Theres very subtle difference between the two and the three I think hes talking more about the catch and shoot opportunities Hes 0 for seven on his threes tonight Donald Hes got seven boards Thats what he gets from that wing spot I mean this game today for Donald Ham is is just feels like the ultimate go figure it out right without the a game And and to his credit he has done that 17 points seven rebounds despite 0 for seven from three That last foul was the fourth on Davis Still struggling a little bit from the foul line Seven for 12 tonight out of BC who was so good early as a double double today for the Citadel 12 and 10 Good job by Asamod Asamotto doing a good job guarding the ball into the painted area End up getting Fred Payne on that foul Yeah Fred with the slap down You know you get in there rather than going down you want to go up Sometimes a foul doesnt happen So Christian Moore both teams were in the bonus in the second half Christian Moore hit those two threepointers early His numbers really went up as the year went on last year averaged just a little under nine points a game but it was almost 14 points a game over his last 14 games of the season last year Double figures 11 times And this just kind of built off the end of what we saw in his sophomore year Yeah actually hes actually been an excellent free throw shooter Hes got 11 points tonight Trailing by 22 and a little ball fake and draws the foul Good job by Donald H Set a down screen Sever making the cut Gets himself back to the line and Boston College will be in the double bonus the rest of the way This will be free throws 13 and 14 attempted by Donald Han tonight And remember a lot of that was early The Eagles were not hitting shots They started one for 11 but they did manage to get to the line hit their foul shot which stemmed the tide for a little bit until they were able to get going offensively One of two here still shooting 32 from the field not able to really capitalize in the threepointers going four for 21 at 19 and certainly was an important factor for them to narrow the separation of the scoreboard making some threes again Good job covering the back cut Moore driving and he scores against Asamod 13 points for Christian Moore Christian more determined to get to the rim on that one Steager cut They dont know about that You cant leave him on the perimeter Little stunt Penetrate Kick it as his defender stunts Quick catch and shoot Hes a 40 threepoint shooter last year for Jesuit Dallas Now in his freshman year Morris having himself a nice day That is 16 points for Christian Moore And a timeout taken by the Citadel Will take it with him 68 47 Boston College trying to win on their home floor Had enough opportunity there So you go in youll look at them see if they were contested not contested see how the pass got there see how the screens got there to set them up Theres hand on the drive Nice find for Shaw Got his own rebound against Adabisi and best path was just to take it himself I mean Shaw had the right instinct to try to dunk the ball as he cut from that corner Just got to finish it with more power You can see he gets into the lane nicely Now you just got to power dunk that That was a good wall up though by Alisi Alisi is really a strong defensive guy Might have been one with Shaw might have come down two feet Pump faked again gone back up Easy for me to say dunk the ball laughter Aiden Shaw coming in after 92 career games at Missouri One of four transfers on this Boston College roster Forte another one Hes the both two good gets in the portal Heres Han spinning turns hand kick of the friendly roll but a rebound by Shaw He tked that one for you He made that up I like the hands to grab that snatch rebound cheering What a luxury it is to bring in someone whos played that many games Absolutely At a high level a high college level right And they take it a step back practice in that level as well That was a Missouri team that made the NCA tournament last year Boston College after dropping the opener on the road to FAU And lets take another look at this play inside Whoa Wanted to make a statement there and he did Disappointment on that other finish As you said this is an experienced guy with great length active everywhere to be a rim protector Yeah You saw why he shot over 60 for his career That was a tough rotation to crack into during Missouri last year Rodanovich comes back in So now you know with 3 minutes to go here the Eagles up 70 to 47 when youve seen some of the performances that weve seen from Boston College today Again it does not absolve them of the fact that they were unable to close out that game on Monday but it does at least continue to bring some of those positives out of game number one along here early in the season Dont forget this game started poorly for the Eagles as well So they theyve shown some resilience Coach Grant remarked on the resilience down at Florida Atlantic as well even though the scoreboard didnt right We keep talking about the end of that game The Eagles were down early in that game and they were able to fight back and and be in a position where they could have and and arguably even should have won that game Threepointer no good that time for Williams And thats a quality FAU opponent And again its a a a task going on the road and playing game number one in a true road environment Youll have a couple of those this year be on the road against Temple coming up in in a week and a half You cant minimize when you talk road environment at FA I mean that was a Final Four team two years ago Those fans are used to winning Nice take that time by Caleb Stager Hes got eight points Caleb showing the left hand off the drive He too has shown that hes more than just a deep catch and shoot guy Back in 30 seconds Boston College with their largest lead of the day at 26 Good effort all the way around as Steager goes to the basket music 7347 Boston College leads starting to discuss it The Eagles music will stay at home Theyll take on Central Connecticut on Tuesday before another true road game on the road at Temple Its a return game Temple was here last year Back home for Hampton and then theyll head to Charleston for the Shriners Childrens Charleston Classic against Davidson and then Tain music or Utah State Central Connecticut a real favorite in the Northeast Conference I think thats one of three or four NEC schools that will play the Eagles this year in the nonconference Central one of the better ones in that league along with Long Island University Yeah itll be interesting because you come out of that Charleston tournament youll get a Harvard team thats picked a little bit higher in the IB than they have the last couple of years Could be a dark horse Everybodys talking Yale in that league but Harvard Crimson could be right there And then you got LSU here in the ACC SEC challenge virtual sight game with UMass this year in December in Springfield Its going to be an interesting nonconference slate for Boston College Now the shooting woes just continue to hold back The Citadel 32 overall in this game 21 from the threepoint line as Dante Kur the sophomore from Richmond Virginia and 50 from the free throw line They just havent helped themselves finding extra points either at the charity stripe or at the threepoint line Well certainly not as many attempts today as we saw in game number one They had the 59 threepoint attempts as that is put in by Capy in the back door He has six The other thing is as BCs on a little seven nothing spurt here I think you like the diversity of you know Zohans going to be there right Oh yeah You know game one it was Kafky that we came on the air talking about today It would you know probably be Forte and Asamoto with a nice day Rodanovich again So its not just one person No And theres a lot of figuring out to do with the rotation I think itll be a little different thinking tonight as compare it to the other night I think weve seen some eyeopening or at least eyebrow raising efforts tonight from some of these Eagles off the bench 30 points off the bench tonight Kappy inside and hes fouled Kapy this good inside outside presence You saw there a good setup in the low post area Determined footwork to get to the rim Got himself to the free throw line But this is an interesting puzzle as you suggest Eric for Boston College to kind of sort things out Eagles are going to get a couple of their walkons in the game here Will Egimire and Jack Donna always nice for the home opener Yes absolutely Get on the stage acknowledge your boys in the gym Rodanovich kicks threepointer No good But an offensive rebound and another chance here for Boston College Jay we got to cap the EU Get it back out Yeah its taken away Yeah Final seconds of this one Corner three is no good Another rebound finds its way to the Citadel Gonzalez had some nice moments as a freshman Thats out of bounds Its interesting watching Kappy in the past You try to recruit someone you dont get them Thats kind of it Ro Grant recruited them hard It was him and Hastings who he was recruiting that year Now hes got both of them As we said long ago 16 starts last year at Butler So its not like he wasnt in their rotation but shows the value of interpersonal relationships sometimes Wise old coach will always say dont burn the bridges with recruiting Capy gets the rebound here Thatll just about do it cheering 76 47 the Eagles win their home opener over the Citadel A lot of respect
