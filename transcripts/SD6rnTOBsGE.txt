Von Franklin a 67 transfer from South Alabama both guys bring scoring experience playing experience they had 31 starts each last season and theyre bettering guys so Tech will see what they got tonight at The camish Pavilion now Franklin not in the starting lineup tonight but they expect him to be a part of the group that closes out tight games for Georgia Tech Lance Terry one of five starters in the opening tap of the Season belongs to Clayton State in the hands of their graduate point guard Brian Coffey this second Clayton State 820 a year ago Ricardo Sams on the drive his layup wont fall and Devo Coleman secures the rebound here come the yellow jackets look at Tex starters Rodney Howard the senior anchoring the base of that Fame zone defense Rodney starting his third straight season opener for the jackets Kyle Sturtevant the other veteran in the lineup and then a couple of sophomores and Davon Smith and Debo Coleman his third year of college basketball but with that covet year sort of been at the controls pulls up inside the lane leaves it short and thatll belong to Georgia Tech and yellow jackets playing four around one offensively uh look for them to make a concerted effort to get the ball inside to Howard early on in this one hes got the advantage on the inside Tech finished 11th and scoring last year in the ACC the season as the inbounds pass deflected by the true freshman Bryce weinmanson Applause and for the jackets of course two years ago ACC Champions John they finished in the top five of the ACC in each of those two seasons prior to last year when they finished 14th out of 15 five and 15 and ACC play power with the size Advantage but a long way from the hole Terry down the right side floats it and too strong another offensive board for the jackets itll stick with Georgia Tech one thing you notice here in the starting lineup for Clayton State not a lot of size John theyre down one of their top players Jalen Shaw who will not play the night theres head coach Vince Alexander in his second season there is Sean Dudley Blackwell on the bench in fact Shaws sitting in the second row Music Sean was the second team allconference player for Coach Alexander last season thats a big void to fill especially with the 611 Howard anchor in the paint ing first foul and Rodney Howard so Ricardo Sams limbound foreign look at the starting lineup for the Lakers a bunch of new faces in the lineup for Clayton State Music Brian Coffey the second Ricardo Sams Jr the few veterans weinmanson Harper and lucky all freshmen getting the start tonight for Clayton State this is an exhibition game for Clayton State and will not count towards their record for Georgia Tech it counts that threepointer halfway down and out Davon Smith secures the board and hell push tempo Around the Horn Terry three off the rim no good Rodney cannot handle them rebound Vince Alexander as we said in his second season feels like his group has a little more cohesion this year they had tons of new players a year ago as he took over they returned four or five starters from a year ago but many of them not playing tonight Music Georgia Tech showing zone so a little man switching up the Zone Josh passner known for switching defense forcing turnovers out of his half court Zone sets part of what makes them the toughest Scout in the ACC according to Josh pastner what they do so versatile in their defense Smith with a crossover pullback no batted back to the perimeter scrum on the floor and jump ball will be the call both teams with the Jitters early on with the shooting but the hustle is there teams combined over 10 so far Yellow Jackets oh for six from the floor Music our officials Mark schner Caitlin Milner and Ben sturt Music not what we expected from Georgia Tech offensively John they shot the ball extremely well and their scrimmages against Tulane that Vanderbilt 80 points plus in each Terry trying to get free a threepointer for the top of the arc wont go Howards second chance that wont fall and the putback again knowing finally the seal is broken Rodney Howard with the first points for Georgia Tech this year Howard keeps hitting the boards hes going to be on his way to a 15 plus rebound night very active I like the body on him right now looks like he shed some weight in the offseason looking lean Applause weinmanson over to Harper Clayton State tough time getting into the lane settle for a fade away jumper from coffee Smith on the pedal the pass to Terry wont go Howard sticks it back hes already got four foul level pit fellow with the hustle running the floor Rim the rim gotta love that four points five boards already for Howard havent even played four minutes yet Applause besides it seems he has it jarred Loose by Smith jackets with the steal Lance Terry with the elements and then Liz Perry welcome to Georgia Tech his first points as a yellow jacket an electric Jam Springs like that he took off with the runway Harry taking his presence felt in his first home opener at the Cambridge Pavilion Scary Terry transfer from Gardner Webb we were told John hes got some serious first season in front of a crowd new faces on the team youre gonna miss some shots from the perimeter early you cant replicate the pressure of playing in front of a live audience in an exhibition especially with those closed exhibitions that the yellow jackets played against Tulane and Vanderbilt house tournaments connectivity and forces the turnover senior from Norcross Georgia its third year as a jacket Sturdivant a heavy play coming from behind the action got his hands on the ball and I think for Kyle youre looking for him to kind of be the floor General and sort of a Steady Hand of this yellow jacket team David Smith finger roll off the glass it is Applause Junior from loganvilles got his first points of the night start of it will be a leader on this team playing the point guard nine of his last 19 games last season he went without a turnover hes a heady player high IQ guy can facilitate the offense hes going to play hard and hes a veteran hes got minutes under his belt Davon Smith can be whistled for the foul there second team foul on Georgia Tech and going back to Sturtevant John I mean hes got the most returning minutes of any player on this Tech roster and that assisted turnover ratio as you mentioned didnt turn the ball over hardly at all the back half of the Season 21 against ACC competition last year 21 conference games and thats seven ACC games in double figure scoring hes not going to have to score for this team every night but he can do it you see the three right there Clayton State coming back in on the scoreboard yeah Wes Williams he was their leading threepoint shooter in their scrimmage against Clark Atlanta shot close to 40 percent from Beyond The Arc last year at six foot nine he has got some serious range Sturtevant probing to Howard at the elbow Avon Smith finds a little space and rattling around out certain event the offensive rebound leads to Howard of the nolook pass and before the shot the whistle Rodney for a turnover called for the walk I had him shuffling his feet Ron he was anxious to get it up there move the feet turn over for the jackets fivepoint lead both teams starting to settle in a little bit and Jayvon Franklin makes his Yellow Jacket debut the senior from Little Rock Arkansas this is his sixth year of college basketball and John in an era of the transfer portal you think you find a lot of college coaches power five level they almost prefer to bring in a more veteran player threepoint bucket there from Kobe Johnson so do you bring in a true freshener you get a guy like Jayvon Franklin whos got one year of Eligibility remaining but has played a lot of college basketball 31 starts at South Alabama again he had a couple years experience Junior College also played at Auburn and Miles Kelly with a pure stroke sophomore from Parkview High School Carlos Sims Fade Away off the back of the iron Applause behind the back to Miles Kelly Kelly finished his high school career at Hargrove Military Academy but Atlanta Georgia native Stone Mountain specifically with the left Jayvon Franklin nice touch for the big fella jackets heating up five of the last six I think theres a guy 17 feet and hes got you know hes got ball handling skill hes agile he had a nice extension there can knock down the midrange look for him to bring a lot of energy Off the Bench to this jackets lineup and when they play small ball minus Rodney Howard he will anchor the paint and be called on to rebound the basketball shot from coffee wont go to pass underneath Sams has it swatted from behind by Franklin Kelly Corrals in loose ball Franklin nice job off the basketball being a disrupter Kelly with the step to the hole and one Miles Kelly his first and only start last season the ACC tournament hes a guy who had a lot of confidence those last five or six games last year for Georgia Tech John yeah and hes a guy that I look to for this jackets team he can step up you know your minus Jordan not sure minus Michael Devoe two graduates that scored 53 of the points for the Jackets last year miles is Gonna Fill that Gap he should have confidence hes not going to be deferring when hes on the court to two other seniors hes a guy that could really make strides this season as a sophomore and in that one start against Louisville in the ACC tournament he had a careerhigh 19 points 15 the previous game against Boston College as he misses the free throw temp cant complete the N1 combined six of nine from three in those games as well Tristan Maxwell the onball defender guarding Johnson and hell go to the line for two Jalen Moore also checking in for the first time this year Applause Music the drive nice hesitation drew the contact Miami Florida native by way of Saint Petersburg Community College yeah he encountry Jackson Who transferred it were teammates at St Petersburg College now both Clayton State Lakers Johnson misses the first free throw theres a Miami flavor on this Clayton State roster Ricardo Sams from Miramar suburb of Miami to test on Johnson and Jackson also got Dudley Blackwell who wont play tonight Johnson hits the second free throw snaps a 70 run for Georgia Tech Music threequarter court press from the Lakers Jalen Moore going Baseline taking on Williams Kristen Maxwell hasnt played a whole lot over his Tech Career in fact hes appeared in just six games entering this year across two seasons more whistled for the offensive foul nice work by Wes Williams Applause feet were set on that play nice job jalon Moore a little bit out of control on that one he had his best game as a jacket last year Jalen Moore against Clayton Stadium 13 points in 13 minutes flash real highend upside in that game hes another guy that can make strides with opportunity Jordan 13 ACC games last season another threepointer there from Wes Williams just a third triple the night for Clayton State last year when Tech defeated Clayton State 10353 Clayton State really struggled from distance they shot just 15 from three Music to break 1510 Georgia Tech with the lead over the Lakers Wes Williams feeling it got the stroke working early in the season opener Music opening night mccamless Pavilion 1510 Georgia Tech with the lead over Clayton State and one notable face not here tonight Eric Revenue who spent the last six seasons on Georgia Techs coaching staff John took the associate head coaching job at Oregon State hes a West Coast native and wanted to get back out there and that presents so quite a loss for Georgia Tech what made coach Revenue so valuable I think experience personality his ability to connect with players you know congrats to him on getting home out west I know that was probably a hard decision he and Coach passenger great chemistry but you know he was Final Four coach as an assistant at Stanford coach the Lopez twins the college twins Mark Mad Dog Madsen he developed Biggs I mean here Ben Lammers James Banks Moses right guys that have gone on to play professionally oh thats a void to fill Tavon Smith finds some open space in the lane and it wont fall Franklin was there to slam it home it was above the cylinder he was he had some bouncing pogo stick action there his hand was above the square plenty of athleticism on this team question for Georgia Tech is what do they do without that Bonafide rim protector lets get a defensive foul against the jackets theyll be on Jalen Moore its his second 15 fell here in the first half for Tech but John thats one of the big questions for this team defensively is you dont have that trademark rim protector for Georgia Tech like theyve had so many years under Josh passner how do they overcome that tonight maybe not as much a factor against Clayton State moving forward thatll be a score yeah thats where defense becomes you know some of the parks Five Guys working in unison when you dont have that shot blocking rim protector Howard hes going to hold his own down there but hes not a guy thats going to bounce up and Swatch Ace see shots left and right so its going to be a development of of the young talent and understanding of the game watching film with assistance you know its all going to come together it comes with experience it starts here tonight at one point coach Pastor is quick to make as Debo Coleman drills a three thats his first points boy Debo Coleman he was so impactful as a shooter last year led the team shot 41 from Beyond The Arc had more threes his freshman year than Michael Devoe did in his first year as a yellow jacket Stevos got some range too he hit that from one step inside the sea on the kremlins court logo going again with the ball in his hands goes left into the lane wont fall Wes Williams with the rebound but those bigs for Georgia Tech the confident they can move their feet so theres a second try that time for Christian Chambers goes transfer from Columbus State Jalen Moore Scoops it off the glass jackets stretch the lead six points two possession game one game transition they give up a bucket but right back at the Clayton State Lakers coffee down the aisle long rebound belongs to Kobe Johnson Chambers walled off by Kelly and airball Yellowjackets secure it Vince Alexanders team getting after it though both ends on the floor playing hard tough shot for Franklin the ball Kobe Johnsons got it Georgia Tech defeated Clayton State by 50 points in January of last season Applause hanging around here a little further three of six the long range for the free throw line that time wont go for back 11 redshirt freshman South Cobb High School Powder Springs far here from Midtown Atlanta Music Applause Tristan Maxwell pulls the trigger too strong Kobe Johnson the rebound ahead to coffee contact and theyre going to get Tristan Maxwell for the valve what do you got here John the feet from the left late on the actions thats a block and well have a baseline out of bounds situation 26 on the shot clock but now six thousand at half for Georgia Tech Lakers will be shooting the rest of the way Bryce winderson true freshman inbound to the 60 Junior Ricardo Sims back underneath to Johnson nice job with the waiting out Sturdivant but couldnt finish another loose ball and hands of the Lakers and its Kristen Chambers with two hand slam it was a nice based on all the pounds play they just missed the layups and fortunates able to get two on the board not the orange I can see before Howard wide open Lane and he flushes it Rodney Howard now with six points you know with an open post Sparky lucky cant take the risk on that unless youre going to get a hand on it and left the driving lane wide open for Howard threepointer wont go Coleman accelerating up to Kelly Kelly lets the flying transition off the front of the rim no good fit ahead Sams with a twoand jam Clayton State Applause backtoback dunks Sams is the second leading return score on this roster of 93 points per game last season hes looking to get in the double figures he scoring this season on his averages so its seven minutes and 22 seconds the Yellow Jacket lead down to four Rodney Howard with his twohanded slam and on the other hand Ricardo Sims with an answer Music turnover competing coach Alexander said were not afraid to run with this jacket team were gonna play hard were going to get after it and that was the style he wanted to bring to Clayton State they want to play fast it was a program that was really in a tough spot they did not win a game the season prior to his arrival of course he only played nine due to the covid19 pandemic but 820 last year and theyve got a lot of pieces back this year although some of them not available tonight including their preseasonal conference selection Jalen Shaw food on his left foot but Music theyre not looking for energy and effort tonight Coleman tries to get it to Smith and its deflected out of bounds itll stay with Georgia Tech three seconds to shoot Georgia Tech has taken high percentage shots 21 of 27 attempts have been two point field goals so theyre not settling theyre just you know missing shots some Jitters first game of the year good contest at the buzzer but Debo Coleman Works through bakilecki gebo Coleman he might be the best shooter on the floor this season for Georgia Tech and I like the call by Josh pastner three seconds on the clock get it to your you know big size guard in scoring position and Debo knocked it down great execution a good play call by Josh passner Corner three from coffee wont fall Davon Smith all the way to the rim and it gets stuck ball belong to Clayton State theres a lot of nice pieces on this roster Johns to try to figure out who that leading scorer might be yeah anyone can step up theyve got some depth at each position uh theres no clearcut favorite um what I like to see is is the tempo the style of play theyre getting to the basket they had transition on that possession just missed another layup but style of play the jackets are executing playing fast theyre just not making shots right now Tech leading by six six minutes and change left in the first half inside lucky steps out pulls the trigger gets it cocky lucky redshirt freshman its a nice job offensively by the Lakers attacking the zone you want to try to attack in the middle get it to the high post and work out and they executed great Sun offense on that possession lucky knocked down the 15footer Howard in the high post Applause sturt of him he drives cant finish but he got slapped on the arm there so hell go to the line maybe just the second foul on Clayton State and theyre gonna go against Kobe Johnson another possession for the jackets three feet from the basket high quality shot missed layup what a great shot Howard with the handoff of the high post Sturtevant did a nice job turning the corner he stayed with it hell have a chance to earn his points the Norcross Georgia native senior shot 78 from the line last year and Music first but on the topic of star power John for Georgia Tech this year and Coach passers made it no secret he says the star of the team is the team the theres a lot to be said to that I mean philosophy right there philosophy 101 its got to be a team effort um there is no star and these guys are new guys playing with each other for the first time in a competitive regular season game its about knowing your role accepting your role listening to your coaching and you know youre going to grow as the season goes watch film assistant coaches will work to identify you know what is the identity of this team Im not sure we know yet weinmanson off the coffee youre not playing this game a year ago he was out injury their point guard puppy Johnson around the perimeter Randy Howard A Long Way From Home on Wyman coffee penetrates has the strips turn event with it here come the yellow jackets on the run down the left side of the lane wont go but Sturtevant headed back to the freethrow line good hustle Play Active hands Smith gets his hands in there sturdiven high IQ point guard to transfer from Southern Cal hes had three years on the flats hell get to the line again all academic honorable student at your point John there havent been many turnovers from either side the team just missing missiles right now this is the first of two Brian Coffey will get a rest but foul by the way was on weinmanson his first jackets 36 percent from the field Clayton State 33 percent sort of better for those free throws now with three points today Sams guarded by Howard gets a step on his man and beats into the lane theyre attacking that high post Sams the quickest advantage on Howard with the rip through Music and a foul off the ball and glance Terry druitt hes going to be on weinmanson thats the second now and the Lakers playing small ball you see a strategic substitution Howard out Franklin and maybe a little more athleticism defensively guarding that high post where the Lakers have heard the jackets of consecutive possessions Kelly flashes open in the corner wont go Sams with the rebound Music down to the corner thats Harper he got it two points for Travis Harper II jackets trying to run after a make instead of having to turn around pop he got him way to answer by the senior Sturdivant Parkers talented hes got good DNA his dad played basketball UAB 199498 and here comes Smith the other way wide open he lays it in Avon two of eight from the floor now Applause double jackets ahead by seven Terry nearly lost his footing Sams the extra pass to Chambers and a beautiful timing by Christian Chambers got his man in the air drew the foul and got the bucket Josh Pastor was not happy with the defense Professor went right to the bench substitution Debo Coleman coming in itll be Chambers at the lane when we return Clayton State continuing to play with high energy Music on open at night yeah defense whether you want to see active hands blocks uh group effort deflections uh both teams getting after it uh but 50 50 balls coach pass will preach we want to win 5050 balls Clayton State early on in this one has gotten the best of those you see the run out on that play transition defense will be a major factor in deciding this one over the last eight minutes after Georgia Tech dominated Clayton State and the first eight minutes John on the glass Layton state is actually out rebound of the yellow jackets since the 12minute mark yeah and I mean the the defensive assignment of Howard having to guard that 15foot ISO situation Georgia Techs had to go small to adjust to coach Alexanders roster and theyre giving up some height so Clayton State getting out for a game rebounding as a team and we spoke with some members of the Georgia Tech program before the game John and given that James Shaw their big man Clayton State not playing tonight it kind of presents a a unique assignment defensively having the guard essentially five Shooters you dont see that very often in the ACC ENT yeah thats tough to prepare for one especially if youre playing mantoman you put your post players outside playing 25 feet from the ball guarding ball screen action dribble handoffs it can be challenging uh I would look for Coach passenger to throw a heavy dose of that zone defense which has been so good to him during his career and its not a lackadaisical Zone its an active Zone guys play Big theyll Force turnovers out of that really puts teeth on the offense on their deals just a third foul miles Kelly by the way Chambers hits the first free throw transfer from Columbus State Kelly will head to the bench and Jalen Moore back on the floor Chambers he shot 87 from the freethrow line last year rare see him miss one like we saw earlier Applause strong Applause a lot of confidence uh you mentioned rebounding uh you know being missed out being out rebounded you know thats the absence of Devoe and Usher are two guards that rebounded the ball tremendously well and theres an adjustment to that you know Georgia Techs got to have Five Guys hitting the glass especially their perimeter and that rebound in and off the hands of Debo Coleman Clayton State trailing by three and with the basketball here late in the first half coach Alexanders got to be pleased here its one thing young sophomores guy like Kelly Debo you know these guys kind of understand its not all about scoring its not all about offense like defensive rebounding for a guard huge stat if you want to find minutes rebound the basketball on both sides Sturdivant alleyoop to Smith off the backboard didnt have a timing quite right sort of it seizes it back more blocked and fouled as theyll whistle Travis Harper but he got more than just the ball the shot by Georgia Tech putting pressure on the Lakers still having a tough time finishing but the effort is there tempo I think if they play fast thats in Georgia Techs favor Clayton States going to try to play with him though Jalen Moore sophomore from Birmingham Alabama said he might have the most upside of any player on this Georgia Tech roster John Moore standing six foot seven hes got some length hes got some some bounce I even heard one of Techs staff members comparing to Moses Wright as a sophomore where the highs can be really special but that consistency can prove elusive for me its one of two free throws hes a late bloomer is a threestar Prospect AllState player out of Gardendale High School in Alabama he does he has a lot of upside what he needs is minutes on the court of that freshman crew last year he was the one that received the fewest minutes in meaningful plays and see play that is seven to shoot coffee beats his man high off the glass too strong more the rebound see a skill set you know for his size handle the ball right there decision Magnum thats cant turn that ball over and thats where he can develop Harper surging through off the glass the lead down to two just over two minutes to play in the first half Georgia Tech Clayton State this is a regulation game for the yellow jackets an exhibition for division two Clayton State Tristan Maxwell in the short corner kick out some more lets it fly from Deep a hair too strong good looking shot feet were set shoulders Square the back of the rim now Brian Coffey and his career in North Florida spent a couple years at Middle Tennessee State now in his sixth year of college basketball the second at Clayton State coffee down the right side hes tied it up with 90 seconds to play in the first half the Lakers have come to play now they have a chance to take the lead following the turnover chambers of three no and more kids hang on to the rebound Smith tries to win it back but theyll say his foot was on the line Laker basketball Clayton State turn in the corner and thats the value of you know turnover on one end you got to forget about that lockdown defensively Slide the feet every possession matters Clayton State will have a baseline out of bounds situation Terry checked into the game of the dead ball and Clayton States going to call a timeout Lakers have tied it up against division one Georgia Tech just over a minute left to go in the first half Music Music Clayton State has tied it up against Georgia Tech late in the first half the yellow jackets have led by as many as nine tonight Lakers have not LED yet but John Clayton States hit five of the last seven field goals meanwhile Georgia Tech has not had a bucket in nearly three minutes yeah in the first half with the jackets are shooting 36 percent from the floor credit Clayton States defense really getting After Five Guys contesting shots the jackets have missed some bunnies oh thats where you cant afford to take plays off on the defensive end and I think theres been a few cases of that in the last five minutes where the jackets just if not theyre talking down defensively and Howards absence you know you dont have the rim protector in there thats been noticeable Point jumper from coffee wont fall another turnover in the backcourt coffee swatted Away by Smith and theyll say golden and count the basket and Clayton States got the lead six turnovers now for the jackets and you see it right there Smith hustling to get back into play thats going to be goaltending Clayton State forcing some Havoc causing turnovers theyve had eight points now off of sixth Yellow Jacket turnovers all right entrepreneurs have come in the last two plus minutes 15 16 second differential between shot clock and game clock Applause Christian Chambers has a game high eight points he passes off to Harper Applause and the student section might have gotten into the head of Travis Harper he was listening to the crowd and he says my fault my fault students caused that early shot done shot clocks off 19 seconds remaining in the first half and only five team fouls for Clayton State so they have one to give they can get a little aggressive defensively as long as theyre not following a shooter they want to break the action break the flow so you can see the offensive drought for Georgia Tech Miles Kelly trying to end the first half on a high note gets it to Franklin squares up towards the basket Maxwell flashes across now its Kelly on his hands nearly lost the handle out Tim Maxwell threepointer no air ball put back yes Jayvon Franklin ties us up in half 20 minutes in the books Georgia Tech Clayton State tied at 34 Yellow Jackets getting all they can handle and more from division two Clayton State got ourselves a ball game on opening night at McCandless Pavilion and attacking Clayton State the yellow jackets have their starting lineup backhab on the floor Carls tournament receives the impound from mid Court it goes right to Rodney Howard in the high post its guarded by Ricardo Sims Music and he promptly turns it over right into the hands of Travis Harper II Music offensive foul called against Harper nice work by Debo Coleman atoning for the turnover defense Alexander not not a fan of that call uh Debo nice job turnover on one end hustle back make a defensive stop thats maturity thats getting to the next play see the body the lean in Debo had his feet set outside of the Holden Circle good defensive effort jackets with a chance to answer Clayton States defense is set man to man Tech shot just 36 percent in the first half just a number of open looks and now theyve really had trouble turning the ball over the last five minutes of game action thats two turnovers to begin the second half not the vision for Josh passing as they left the locker room yeah came out with the set play went for two back doors on the first possession uh miscommunication and then second possession again a back door play and miscommunication between two players its Harper down to Sams in the high low Clayton States got the lead Lance Terry transferred from gardnerwebs and quiet so far two points Davon Smith passed a little high in a way to Howard looking for Sturdivant underneath Yellow Jackets being stifled offensively Sturtevant spins pulls up in and out Howard is put back yes second ship eight got even at 36 Harpers pass deflected by Sturdivant here come the yellow jackets in transition Smith to the rim off the glass of them yeah I think if youre the jackets Howard is your X Factor and hes hes going to Anchor the defense hes going to rebound he can start those breaks the Freshman weinmansons triple wont go offensive rebound for Sands stumbling out of bounds its to wymanson hes stuffed like Coleman sturdivin feeds it ahead Smith slows it down no look to Howard hes fouled big man will go to the line for two any play by Davon Smith with the lefthand shuffle pass to Howard heres Howard defensively gets the loose ball quick Outlet Smith pushing in transition and those are the type of pockets that the yellow jackets will need if were going to create separation in this one Clayton Stakes here to compete theyre getting after it I mean D2 versus your ACC Powerhouse down the road this is uh you know this is as big as it gets for the Lakers number 20 West Williams returning for Clayton State Travis Harper now with three fouls heads to the bench getting coached up by Rashad Lewis former Mercer bear in his first year as an assistant at Clayton State Howard shot just 50 from the free throw line last year Applause its a lead back to three largest lead of the night for Georgia Tech is nine points foreign Applause Jack is playing his own defense here Cross Court pass coffees three too strong Howard his ninth rebound of the ninth Applause Sturtevant lost the handle recovers but turns it over too many turnovers in the last 10 minutes or so of game time for Georgia Tech but if they steal it right back Applause Terry lets it Fly buries it Lance Terry his first three former Bulldog from Gardner Webb shot 35 percent from threepoint land last year Applause player on this Georgia Tech roster has scored more College points than Lance Terry hes over 600 now at five tonight 10 seconds to shoot coffee with the floater got him foreign Music Applause field goal eight feet from the basket and Georgia Tech needs to do a better job of container Debo Coleman off balance one hand sinks it and Tebow now is seven points with the tech back to the Zone match up they required Howard to run that Baseline and leave the paint tough tough assignment for Howard short Corner halfway down and out but Sams the offensive rebound and two points for the sixth year senior from Miramar Florida all six years at Clayton State Music Howard left the pain to contest the back side of the Zone was late recovering and Lance Terry gonna go to the line at the foul that go against Bucky lucky thats his first Lance Terry at the line Terry foreign he was tracking to get a high major offer but broke his foot and there were many schools that stuck with him in fact the only offer he had entering that senior Year John was from GardnerWebb he took it Music hes a guy whos very successful at GardnerWebb honorable mentioned in the all big South points against Duke 14 points against Georgia playing for GardnerWebb last year 2019 while playing high school ball with the hurdle school he took out NBA star Anthony Edwards who played a holy spirit Local Atlanta private school in the Georgia Independent School Association Championship so thats one he probably wont forget bragging rights on that one especially considered Edwards was an AAU teammate of his Howard gets it to go hes got that high Advantage The X Factor for Tech and the Yellowjackets have now stretched it to eight as theyve hit five of the last seven shots Howards gonna dig down the conditioning defensively they need him on the floor you cant show any weakness hes got to be out there on the court hes the X Factor wymanson kick out threepointer wont go that time for Wes Williams Applause coffee just inside the line got it Brian Coffey from Snellville Georgia out of Shiloh High School Georgia Techs perimeter just a little late on the rotations and box outs on the weak side of the zone whats a spoiled lead for the yellow jackets Rodney Howard a game high 11 points fighting hard at The Rim the jackets back with the lead of six Music Josh pastner in his seventh season at Georgia Tech and one of his Hallmarks John has been the defense and I wanted to show this year by year progression of the Georgia Tech defense and you look you know oscillating between the top 10 the top seven its important to note that theres probably 360 teams in college basketball so those first five years John they were in the top 20 percent defensively then it kind of fell off last year I think a large part of that was because they didnt have that true rim protector and they also had a lot of new players trying to learn that zone cheer for the yellow jackets theyve got some more returning experience with those freshmen now sophomores question is can they get back to that top 20 percent level in defense across the country yeah I think so its uh its going to be five guys working together Rodney Howard has the potential to Anchor the interior hes got the size hes not a shot blocker like uh Moses right by any means but you know GT was number one in the ACC in threepoint football percentage defense last season and theyre doing the job tonight Clayton States three of 13 from three so I think thats a key stat the way the games played today right on cue defense is forces a turnover the flip side of that John is Tech on offense under Coach Josh Pastor has struggled more times than not I was talking to coach earlier and hes kind of felt like a root canal at times he did have that top 25 year of offensive efficiency when they won the ACC Championship but it was a pretty severe fall off last year but I think the hope is even if the defense doesnt get to the 25 levels weve seen it at some times in a coach passer they do feel like this is a group that can shoot the ball better than many expect unfortunately we have not necessarily necessarily seen that tonight and the turnovers of plague Tech especially in the last five to ten minutes of game action yeah I think Josh pastner and staff have done a great job identifying and recruiting Shooters and kind of addressing that this may be the best shooting team on paper that weve seen well see how it translates on the court but theyve got to be optimistic about the perimeter shooting that this roster is capable of and how about Debo Coleman he put the Lakers on a MerryGoRound there as he loops around and the lead back to eighth Applause Colemans me a big part of that shooting prowess too exploded that time Applause from Mackey lucky and that right there is a shot that in those early years with James bakes Ben Lammers Moses Wright that was getting swatted away plants Terry in the car buries the second three that matches Georgia Techs largest lead of the night jackets heating up thats two threes now 10 points till hes in double figures in this first game is the yellow jacket another clean look that time Brian Coffey hes now got 10 points and another three for Lance tearing hes getting his confidence 13 points four of seven from the floor largest lead of the night for Tech and the Lakers continue to answer and keep pace and coffees heels on the line Lance Terry hit 57 threepointers a year ago hes got three tonight College Park natives playing at home the transfer from GardnerWebb making his presence felt in his first game on the flats he had 30 schools reached out to him when his name hit the portal Shows Georgia Tech chances you said to play Closer To Home Applause doubledigit Advantage for the jackets for the first time tonight Miles Kelly sophomore the pure stroke and a foul on the floor is going to go against back 11 Debo did a nice job moving off the basketball using his body force and contact through the foul its a heady play by Debo Music he performed extremely well last year of course shooting the ball they think his game could really get to the next level this year keep in mind hes the highest rated recruit of the Josh passenger era for Georgia Tech I lose Mr Florida basketball a top 40 Prospect coming out of high school at 19 points in a game versus Lamar last season so hes capable of knocking a challenge Applause linemans in the true freshman to Sims hes bothered by Howard finds a window to shoot it around the rim head out yellow jackets with Kelly bringing it down Howard cant handle the pass he recovers and Rodney Howard has already secured his fourth career double double now with 13 and 11 thats the value of Kelly being on the floor he had three fouls in the first half but he can push Tempo finding his big man Howard for the layup and Bryce weinmanson from Ponchatoula Louisiana Music fell by Lance Terry thats his first and theyll put weinens in at the line got over 1300 career points in high school his parents both student athletes at Southeastern Louisiana mother played womens basketball and played baseball rice 1300 points scored at an enderville High School in Louisiana Music High combo guard and knocked down the three tough player getting a chance to start against an ACC opponent tonight Applause and Chambers back in as Wes Williams takes a seat second free throw for weinmanson he got it Applause start a fan over to Terry is he still hot you bet Liz Terry feeling it thats his fourth threepointer of the night Lakers got to find him late feet were set that cannot happen if your coach Alexander Squad doing his best Jose Alvarado impression I can shoot Applause Music it belongs to Ricardo Sams and the Lakers Applause Chambers lost it but we got a foul on the floor its gonna go against Miles Kelly well step aside the largest lead of the night for Georgia Tech Lance Terry welcome to the flats Applause Music Applause Music Applause foreign Music lead for the yellow jackets how about 14 second half points for Lance Terry he is outscored Clayton State in this second half and John we knew he was a guy who could be a real scoring threat for Georgia Tech this year we did not see in the first half man is he making up for lost time in the second 20 yeah hes been done a nice job running the court finding the open spots five of ten from the field four of eight from three hes two of two perfect from the line at 16 points and 19 minutes of play jackets shooting 625 percent from the field in the second half Chambers out of the timeout his J wont fall Powers got the board now with 12 hes just too shy of his career high she said on opening night last year and Kyle started then weaves his way in and lays it in for two Music Clayton State about a bucket in the last two and a half minutes foul on the floor Music its gonna be on Kyle Sturtevant thats his first Applause its one thing Georgia Tech needs to improve on this year John they committed 18 000 night last year that was the highest total in the ACC yeah its certainly an area they were outscored by uh you know just shy of five free throws per game and ACC games by opponents and those games you know theyre usually decided by one or two possessions so thats a stat you dont want to give away points at the free throw line thats one of Josh fasters goals on a nightly basis to have more free throw makes than free throw attempts like you said they were minus 100 on the year in conference play another foul this ones going to go against Rodney Howard its his second okay and thats easier said than done thats what I mean as a former player former coach thats a tough one its a great goal but to get that to translate to your team you got to preach preach preach and coach and watch film and guys got to adapt and its got to be a Pride Staff well that was another weakness too not just the amount of free throw attempts they were giving up but they shot below 70 from the line that was among the bottom three in the league second free throw for Harper too strong Howard another born one shot of his career high now with 13 Point Edge for Tech taking on division two Clayton State opening night the canvas Pavilion Music text on a nice job second half pushing Tempo and this is a light roster for Clayton State there you see another dunk at the bucket by Howard hes got the double double already now hes 13 points 15 points 13 boards monster effort and 18 minutes of play for Howard foreign Music Applause the lead is up to 19 and we got a Timeout on the floor called by Clayton State watch your head Yellow Jackets high flying and pulling away in the second half 48 Lance Terry a big reason for the jackets getting separation in the second half hes gone for 14 points since halftime four of those from Beyond The Arc hes five of ten from the floor getting it done in his Yellow Jacket debut its got five buckets tonight four threes and event one hand Jam we saw at the top of that package so a 19 point lead for the yellow jackets John I think this is uh encouraging sign to see Georgia Tech shoot the ball so much better here in the second half and halfway down ripping away Jalen Moores got the rebound look at what the yellow jackets have done offensively in this second half compared to what we saw in the first half quality shots and sometimes it just takes one to fall you know as a player whether its a layup a free throw and then once you get hot you know the confidence kind of spreads across the team and Clayton State they found a light roster theyre missing a few of their key guys not a lot of depth I think conditionings been a factor Georgia Tech continues to push the tempo impose their will and theyre getting high quality shots theres some Maxwell in on the front that time by the way all six of those threepoint attempts have been from Terry and the Georgia Tech as they battle at The Rim certifamp the other way and hes shaking up after that fall and hes helping him up Music but Johnson also getting some help Applause okay its been a 60 run over the last 90 seconds for 10 nice job but the left drawing the contact looked like Kobe caught a turned his ankle or caught a little cramp in the calf but both look to be okay nothing too serious sort of been shaking it off getting focused at the freethrow line where he was three of four in the first half Sturtevants with seven points five assists two turnovers that assist the turnover ratio is going to be critical for him thats his primary responsibility to be able to distribute the ball and take care of him he gets his fourth of five free throws tonight last foul by the way was on Kobe Johnson hits them both and he had some doubledigit performances last year but the primary responsibility is going to be handling the ball and being that veteran presence on the floor point guard position so important in their extension of the coaching staff on the floor you know last season he had the advantage of deferring to Devoe and Usher hes got a different role this year and then he looks ready to go boy in Clayton stayed to hit three of their first five threepointers John theyve missed 11 straight now as that ball swatted Away by Jalen Moore yellow jackets in transition no look bounce pass to Maxwell hell go to the line as he draws the foul heard of Jalen Moore with the great defensive effort off the ball look at his athleticism the extension here boom came from nowhere starts to break your best offense is good defense and that was it on display right there if you were gonna rank the yellow jackets on Raw Talon I think Jalen Moore might be at the top yeah hes got the frame hes got the whip its got the length the skill is there he can handle the basketball for him its about you know minutes played getting experience game experience and its a confidence thing at that point Maxwell hits the free throw after lymansons charge for his third foul and look John I mean theres a lot of guys in college basketball that you know they have talent they have upside can you get them to that that level and look at Josh pass and his staff they have shown in abilities to develop on an extremely high rate I mean the Jose Alvarado Moses right Ben Lammers James Banks a lot of guys that reach their potential especially a guy like Moses right he came in and he was rather inexperienced when he arrived on campus finishes it as a senior being the ACC player of the year now Associates coach Anthony Wilkes assistant coach Julian swans theyve been with Josh they know what he wants um you know he doesnt have to tell them whats important and those guys are valuable members of the coach pastors Style Music Applause Music asked me a foul on Tristan Maxwell that will step aside 25 point lead for the yellowjack its hard to believe this is a tie game at half the jackets pouring it on a 100 run as we speak foreign Music Music Music foreign Music Music weve talked about some new faces on the floor for Georgia Tech how about first year assistant coach Brian eskelson who spent the last eight seasons in the ivy league at Harvard where he helped the Crimson its a three conference championships under the leadership of Tommy Amaker and John his background seems like a good fit for Georgia Tech yeah Id say so a majority of his time spent at Harvard but also rice Stanford some high major programs hes young 34 years old can hit the pavement get on the road recruiting um hes got a good eye for Talon and you know its a global game now you can go anywhere and get players and the sell an Institute like Georgia Tech and the City of Atlanta you know you can see a couple guys on the roster for Georgia Tech coming from overseas yeah a couple of freshmen uh Carol martinov and Fred Paul bagatskis as the referees are working on their official were having some whistle issues here on the floor were told but for Coach eskelson I think one of the the biggest appeals for him was his recruiting prowess not just on the trail itself but specifically in amongst you know High academic players academically driven players you coach Stanford rice Harvard those are guys and players you have to be familiar with so hes recruited that type of player a number of times and as familiar finding those players that can be hard to find at times and thats what Georgia Tech is going to be in the market for when it comes to player acquisition hes got to be fired up what an Institute to sell you know one of the best in the world academically and one of the best cities in the world and playing in one of the best leagues in the ACC thats a great package to go into a home and sit down with mom and dad and say you want to be part of this Music so shot clock violation another turnover for Clayton State still over six minutes without a bucket curious well see some of those younger faces in the final seven minutes of this one nearly turn it over Miles Kelly rescues it hes playing with four fouls similar for Vince Alexander on the recruiting you know Trails he can go into homes and you know get the D1 transfers get the junior college guys hes got the city of Atlanta to sell hes right there located next to the airport great recruiting tool and then quite say to competitive division two program well I had an interesting conversation with him John obviously were obviously navigating this new era of nil and transfer portal and theres been a lot of ground shaking in college athletics recently and Coach Alexander pointed out look because of the transfer portal a division school like us we have more access to high school players because there are fewer opportunities to come out of high school and go D1 because you have schools at Georgia Tech for instance who are opting for transfers from mid major programs as opposed to recruiting that High School freshman yeah its the landscape of recruiting has changed tremendously you know theres more of a value on prep schools you have the overtime Elites out there so some high school players forfeiting forfeiting their amateurism to go try to make money early you got the NBA G League its a different ball game from when I played and on the flip side in college then IL now I encourse passenger addressed this in his season opening press conference last week that you have a lot of players in the ACC that may not have come back but because they do have a chance to make some money as the floater goes for Clayton State you know why not come back I know youre a high major ACC basketball so therefore I think the league is a little older now than it might have been a few years ago and thats not even factored in that extra year of covered that with the building Maxwell pulls the trigger on a three Off the Mark more an offensive rebound he hoists it high through Conte draws the foul nice finish by Moore hes got the size you know he can play a 34 hes agile uh hes the guy that can step up for this yellow jackets team and strong finish there took the contact and I think its also important to stress look its no secret we showed you the preseason poll at halftime Georgia Tech picked to finish last in the ACC foreign part of that as we mentioned teams returning more Talent than might have been expected in a different year in a prior era but looking ahead at this roster John I mean Georgia Tech its an eligibility standpoint its not going to lose a lot of players next year I mean Davon Franklin has we gotta jump ball ruined from the Baseline they dont belong to Clayton State coach Alexander asking for an explanation there take another look at this Moore got up on the contest he was just a little late getting into the action um rotations you know hes doing a great job hes got seven rebounds on the knife Jalen does but its defensive lapses right there he was a split second lead he got caught steering at the basketball and you know as you get into competitive play ACC play thats a dump foreign protection is going to be a big challenge for the tech this year how do they solve that five seconds to shoot for Clayton State coffee ball in his hands Rises up and gets it at the buzzer Music I like Jalens potential to be a you know second leading rebounder type guy you know third leading rebounder if he gets the minutes and he develops he as the package where he can do that and Davon Smith lays it in and so thats why again John you know this season I think Georgia Tech feels like theyre going to exceed expectations but aside from Jayvon Franklin everyone else has at least one more year eligibility Beyond this year so I think for a nucleus like Georgia Tech you know looking to take that next step forward this season one more look at this play by Davon Smith if you find a way to finish at The Rim because he has such a great ability to get a step on somebody hes got such speed such bounce if he can find a way to finish those chances John it can be a real threat hes a playmaker in 23 minutes hes hes been productive you know eight points seven rebounds you can push Tempo hes from defend hes a guy thats gotta step up you know with the loss of Usher and Michael Devoe theres minutes to be had and shafts to be taken I dont think you have to tell anyone out there that Maxwell underneath wont go more back with it off balance takes a hard fall and go to the freethrow line again some more now with eight rebounds to go with his eight points put together some a nice stat line Music its so similar to what we saw against Clayton State last year from Jalen Moore when he had 13 points and six rebounds just 13 minutes Allstate at Gardendale High in Birmingham Alabama Music Josh pass us a guy that AAA in ACC play is going to play six seven guys a majority of the minutes I think with this roster um you know theres a little more depth theres a little more shooting Off the Bench uh you know youre gonna play fresh hes played nine guys a significant amount of minutes double figure minutes tonight so thats a new look jackets team in 202223 yeah he said dont think is a nineman rotation weve seen those nine men tonight and Jordan Mecca might be that 10th guy to get Rodney Howard in the foul trouble thatll be another thing to watch Music rebound from Jalen Moore in the Athletics has just got to excite you so much about number 14 speaking of the 14 how about what Georgia Tech saw in the Gridiron on Saturday theres like an old number 14 Joe Hamilton Zach Hiram great come from behind victory for Coach great key to win youve known run key for some time havent you yeah hes the first guy I met as a freshman on the flats I was a suburb kid from Boston and he was a Alabama boy and he talked a little funny and we hit it off but uh he had a he had a stellar football career and obviously doing great things with the jackets on the Gridiron so congrats to coach Brent key three wins under his belt and count the basket for Jay Von Franklin Music as we step aside the yellow jackets have put up a 50 Burger in the second half sophomore Miles Kelly see a lot of that this year on the flats Music foreign Applause Music Music Applause Music Applause Music celebratory mood here on opening night in mccamless Pavilion but it is also a time to step up for the Yellow Jacket Community Michael Eisenhower toy drive the 22nd annual toy drive begins Saturday November 12th thats this Saturday and benefits the Atlanta Childrens Shelter you can go to randallrightcom for more information and you know Michael Eisenhower its hard to believe John 20 years have passed since weve lost Michael Eisenhower at the age of 23 and he was a teammate of yours yeah he was a great guy a guy worked out with Daley you know we were the same size worked out in the weight room post work individual lessons uh spent a lot of time with Michael and it was a it was a sad story but his family and the Georgia Tech Community has carried on the tradition of the toy drive you know to celebrate his memory and then rightfully so Jim you know a chance to donate toys go rimrodcom or Saturdays home football game against Miami 3 30 kick Applause smile Im you know we just had so many good memories and uh you know we had to guard a guy named Alvin Jones doing this seven foot center and we were both you know six eight six seven guys we were right at Alvins elbows and you know doc King the legendary former dentist who was traveling with our team and he used to look like put your mouthpiece in Michael John put your mouthpiece in Alvins Gonna Get You so we had some great memories playing together here on the flats well Dr Aaron King passed away just two years ago Miles Kelly hits the jumper and you know its really its amazing how many people are still around the Georgia Tech Community and who knew Michael first and you being one of them and a number of other staff members in the athletic association his memory still lives on fully uh here even 20 years later as the yellow jackets will Sub in most of their starting lineup here Franklin Maxwell Coleman and Kelly head to the bench Ronnie Howard by the way has a chance to matches career high tonight hes got 15 points for shy of his career high hes also got 13 rebounds one shot of his career high lineman Center three ball wont go William steps out of bounds another positive for Georgia Tech John the yellow jackets havent started out of the gate with a win since 2019 theyve stumbled out of the gate you know losing to Mercer and Georgia State a couple of years ago back to back and then obviously recovering and finishing with an ACC Championship then lost to Miami Ohio in the opener last year yeah theyll have four days to prepare uh at Georgia State thats going to be a tough one Georgia states got a brand new facility that place will be rocking uh be a nice road test early on in the season for the jackets that they have acquitted themselves well especially in the second half John I think its disappointing as those first 20 minutes were this has been just as impressive the jackets are shooting just shy of 50 in the second half and I put a 55 points and committed just four turnovers yeah Id say they responded whatever coach pastner said to him at halftime theyve held Clayton State to zero for eight for three in the second half under 30 from the floor so the defensive efforts been there the protected the ball and shot started falling I said in the first half but Tech took some good shots they just had some Jitters and its been a its been a great performance in the second half for Josh pastors jackets well I dont know about you but I feel like you know this is a Georgia Tech team that you know the defense you hope will improve from what it was a year ago but the offense really needs to take a significant step forward this team wants to accomplish some of their goals this year and thats tough assignment knowing youve lost Michael Devoe and Jordan Usher but they feel like the some of the parts they have a bunch of guys who can score who can shoot could be a guy any night yeah theyll have to adjust quick you know you got to adapt to playing on the road four nights from now or five nights at Georgia State the miscommunications you got to try to cut those mistakes out of your game uh they threw a couple bad passes out of bounds on the back doors Fearless errors those were things that on the road regardless of an ACC Pony or any D1 opponent those are things that you got to get under wraps here in practice the next few days and during your film sessions assistant coaches can really coach guys individually and prepare for Georgia State third event with nine points tonight and now look at couple of the freshmen Fred Paul baganskis from Latvia making his Yellow Jacket debut along with Carol Martineau from Ontario reclassified to be in this 2022 senior class high school that is Martinez by the way chose Georgia Tech over Missouri Northwestern Wisconsin footer Canadian was a big time Gap late we start prospectly Bloomer he was confident and which Pastor went in there and got him now getting some minutes here on opening night thats true freshmen in the hands of mccask over to martinov foreign Music Smith gets another quick two points and the yellow jackets this bucket now have six players in double figures tonight and thats that balance scoring that I think is going to need to be a nightly feature of this Tech Team said it earlier its hard to believe this was a 3434 game at the break jackets just put it on please stay in the second half Falls for Ricardo says we want for Clayton State this is a group that was picked to finish fifth of the peach bill finishing second to last last year out of 10 teams special things keep in mind they were without their best player of the night Jalen Shaw for about 25 minutes and Brian Coffey lays it in and I think most importantly for Clayton State they have some continuity from a year ago I mean that roster last year was just tons and tons of new faces its Maxwell Fade Away Jay wont go Martin out of the offensive rebound hes got a chance to pick up his first points has a jacket here from the free throw line and for the Lakers coffee and Sams have combined for 29 Points theyve shot it well from the floor um and you know you throw in Jalen Shaw to the mix thats a nice Trio for Coach Alexander to go to war with in division two competition markzenov who spent last year at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey thats the sixth ranked academic High School in the country Music now a couple of the WalkOns checking in always a chance to recognize their hard work Hammer Nichols Braden Daniels Monte Hill Coleman Boyd rebound belongs to Nichols threepointer for boys and its going to belong to Clayton State its a John final 30 seconds here what were your final thoughts on an opening night for Georgia Tech mens basketball I really wanted to see Boyd knock that one down number one you know those guys put in the effort uh day in and day out Boyd can be a leader you know in the locker room and on the bench shes got experience uh being around coach pastner so I my first thought was I wanted that one to drop for Boyd but uh overall good good performance on opening night youve got three days to clean up some things go over the Georgia state Scouting Report uh and get ready for your first road test which is always uh always a tough one and a buzzer wont go your final score Georgia Tech 93 Clayton State 63 the yellow jackets behind a 59 Point second half cruise to
