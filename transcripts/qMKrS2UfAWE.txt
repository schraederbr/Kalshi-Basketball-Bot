First Saturday in 2026 a great slate of games in the ACC and we are underway in Winston Salem Its the home team Wake Forest that starts with the basketball Beloo got a good look from three Couldnt open the scoring Take a look at the Hokei starting five You mentioned it Randolph Coming off a thrilling triple overtime win against their ranked rival Virginia Lot of players logged a lot of minutes Nobody more than Ammani Hansbury 13 in black has it here 51 minutes against the Cavaliers Thats a big part of this game here You see the guards come back Miles Coven comes back for rebounds Kind of help the front line guys out on the offensive glass As you take a look at the Demon Deacon starting lineup undersized on the front line You say attacking the glass is going to be a big key today Both of these coaches Mike Young included said with how desperate Wake is right now you have to be careful of a fast start Hes worried about hey they cant want this game more than us We know theyve lost a couple of games and weve won six in a row Their desperation win here cant outweigh our will This will be a physical game Both teams are really good defensively and as weve talked about and well get into these coaches are really familiar with one another Folks former coaches in the SoCon now here in the ACC Heres a talented freshman Christian Gerak couldnt shake free And another good defensive rebound by Wake Forest Its a big emphasis for the Demon Deakons today Second rebound there where the guards have to come down have to run it from defending on the perimeter and help on the defensive glass Great job there by J Paris Disease finds Harris lines up a three Cant connect Good look there by the Geeks Juke Paris I think is a much better shooter with his feet set Good applause take away Threeon one Bel went to the rim to open the score Omaha Belaloo W is very aggressive in their ball screen defense at the point of attack Not many teams blitz ball screens or hedge hard as Wake Forest does They create a lot of turnovers in doing so Dallas in attack mode Lost the handle The applause weight is dialed in defensively to start this game They have And youre not used to this Its hard to simulate in practice when you dont practice this way Theyre in the passing lanes after the ball screen action Theyre looking to overplay taking away that first pass Great job there creating turnovers turning into the offense at AD Dallas who has shown flashes throughout this season why NBA scouts are so high on him but just 19 years old still looking for that consistency two early turnovers on the road against Wake Forest to start this game misfires from three Both of these teams still looking for an offensive rhythm in the half court The only points have come in transition today Another good rebound Juke Harris looking to go coast to coast Harris fouled on his way to the rim Great job there Again when youre struggling to score youre struggling from three offensive defensive rebounding pushing him on the other end And so you dont have to play against a set defense is what you want to do Theres Steve Forbes Wake Forest head coach in year number six as the head coach of the Demon Deakons here You look at their schedule to this point two onepoint losses in nonconference play to top 10 teams now Michigan and Texas Tech This is a totally different season if cheering they find a way to win those games But you got to turn the page and you could rejumpstart recalibrate this season with a win at home against a 122 Virginia Tech team In hindsight you look at those two games they were definitely there and they were up seven against Michigan who looks like theyre the best team in college basketball Wake team has been their toughest game so far Deets here off to a solid start here Got to continue to pick up things on the defensive end of the floor They got to hang their head here Rely heavily on this back court and these guards Now they have done it with defense in the opening three minutes holding the Hokei scoreless Virginia Tech coming off their best performance of the season A ranked win against their rival with a triple overtime thriller Christian Kak the freshman was huge in that game 17 points 19 rebounds in the win against Virginia Most rebounds by a Hokei since 2011 in a game There was his head coach Mike Young He was heaping praise on his freshman Gernak who got thrusted to a tough spot You think youre going to be behind Toby Lewal cheering whos been so consistent on the front court from Virginia Tech He goes down injured and Katak stepped in beautifully But its not just Lal its Antonio Dorne gets injured He was the third string guy Not expected to play cheering much He gets thrown into the starting lineup First game he gets 17 and six against Elon cheering And in the ACC opener he goes to 17 and 19 rebounds Those are the three injuries for the Hokes right now Tyler Johnson joining the two big men alive to the rim Trey rebounders throws it down They try to keep Gak in drop coverage to protect the rim but hes not very athletic Hes not an above the rim big Great job there by Trayvon Spiller setting the screen and then rolling A Dallas can create from anywhere on the court that time tried to find Gerak and missed him Thats three turnovers for the freshman from Greece early in this game Its a great job turning a corner there Wake does a great job of lifting the shake guy on the weak side Cant tag Spill is there a catch and finish Virginia Tech still searching for their first basket Their only points today have come from the free throw line Turnover is a story early And Jris theyre going to cheering count the basket Thats the continuation that is now needed for college basketball A new rule this season And Juke Harris takes advantage for a threepoint play the oldfashioned way When youre struggling from a high threepoint line this is a way you keep yourself in the game You continue to attack As you can see he had already picked up his dribble Was on the way into his shot Great ball by the officials No one as good as Juke Harris Not many drawing fouls and getting to the free cheering throw line Does complete the threepoint play Its an 82 lead early for Wake Forest a team that needs this win at home after they lost their last two to end December the defensive intensity the steel and the slam Onehanded JS Spillers rocks the rim again Just what you wanted if youre a Wake Forest fan Get get off to a fast start cheering and applause If youre Mike Young youre concerned with about your group Youre coming in off a triple overtime game cheering You knew Wake was going to try to force turnovers Right now Virginia Tech is a lot of really careless with the basketball Another takeaway Alive Coin He hammers it home Miles Coven on a rack attack and Mike Young says give me a timeout You talk about confidence and how you regain confidence This is how you regain your confidence You start and when Neil Abdal struggling to start this game He did roll his ankle against UVA I dont know if thats hindering him coming off the ball screens but hes careless with the basketball Four turnovers five total here for Tech leading at nine points for the Deeps Hammonds in the game Really tough to keep out of the lane Hell be asked to settle this team down and get them in the offense And for as good as Wake Forest has been to start this game in a nine nothing run just brilliant for the Demon Deacons You dont want to give Virginia Tech any momentum with that technical No you dont You had got off to a fast start here Virginia Tech struggling to score here in the half court and another turnover That is six takeaways for Wade Forest against Virginia Tech in this first half They cant cash in on it though Although Spillers great hustle almost stole that ball cheering away from Hansbury Itll be Hoku basketball right now Jay Virginia Tech Every time someone comes off that ball screen theyre trying to make a play and its an adjustment Youre not used to getting trapped or hard hedged off of ball screens when your defenses Your bigs are sitting in the lane Wake very active putting the big man up on the lane Step back three short for Jaylen Bedford Its not just the six turnovers by Virginia Tech Its that Wake Forest has nine points off of those turnovers And heres another bucket Good take by Cal Nice after he was scoreless against NC State last time out Hes the guy Steve Fors would love to see get off the roller coaster But the up and down he needs some consistency out of his experienced point guard And with his speed and ability to make that floater he can get in the paint whenever he wants Hanssberry attacking Beloo Missed it screaming 10point lead early for the Demon Deacons They have certainly thrown the first punch Spillers doesnt get that to drop and Jay with all the injuries as well This isnt a very deep Virginia Tech hocus group now Gird well defended never gave up on the playsberry cleans up the spill for two Easy answer inside I think hes a tough matchup for this small screaming front line of the Geeks Monty Hanssburg having his best year having it all the ACC kind of a season with the Hokes being down here early Expect him to get more touches on the offensive end of the floor Have to imagine Hansbury is one of a few with tired legs though after 51 minutes in triple overtime cheering against Virginia on Wednesday Quick turn around You go on the road albeit only a twohour drive Wide open for three Its good Jaylen Bedford makes the Demon Deacons pay Great opportunity there with numbers Harris falls on the ground Got to hit the ground and get back up And now Virginia Tech stealing the momentum away up and down makes it a onepossession game A 10point leads down to three screaming cheering Shot clock ticks down to 10 Spillers has a step Cant use it though J swings it right back and draws the foul taking trying to figure out a way to settle down and get back into this game here and they get an open three by knock down a corner three defensively really active themselves starting to settle down creating offense from that defense with his personal five run trying to get the hopes back in this game on a seven nothing You just said it Bedfords got the last five Off the inbounds Coven Good look from three Cant finish it Offensive rebound Keeps it alive for the Knicks Mason lost the handle Spots up from three Cant connect Another offensive rebound Trying to battle through Hansbury Two 240 lbs Hanssbury not going anywhere count plus the foul Ami Hansberry did it on defense and then cashes in on the offensive end A chance to tie the game from the line Whats whats happening right now is Ben Hammonds coming his game to set his group down Hes moved Abdales off the ball on the wing and now theyre starting to find their way in the paint creating havoc for the Daks Once you get in the paint theres no shot blocking at the rim for Wake Forest They have to be really aggressive on the perimeter and do a good job of guarding the basketball at the threepoint line That help you get to the rim Less than two minutes ago Wake Forest led 144 The Hokes on a 10 nothing run in a minute 50 Pull up three goes begging Wake Forest has now missed their last six shots Its allowed Virginia Tech to erase a 10point deficit Good ball movement Finds Hammond Missed it for three Its a game of runs Both team now answered the run Theyre starting screaming to settle down Steaks continue to move the basketball Big three Miles Colby throws it from the corner and fires Wade back in front Miles Colby has been their best player I think their most consistent player here in the first half of the season First made three of the afternoon for the Demon Deacons They missed their first seven Turnovers continue to pile up That is eight in this first half for Virginia Tech And thatll be a goal Count the basket for Mai Mason and the Deeps are back up by five Great start here by the Deeps responded to that loss Theyre up Jay Alter with you Weve got a good one here between Wake Forest and Virginia Tech The story early this game and theres another one is the turnovers by Virginia Tech That makes nine turnovers against the Hokes who Wake Force has cashed in for 11 points off turnovers And thats the second one on Hansbury and hes got the first foul on a rebound and thats the second foul on the screen I often say to Bigs you got to protect that first foul Can Virginia Tech get back into this game with their best player Hes not their most talented player but he is their best player Mason misses Virginia Techs not used to playing without Psbury on the court They just played 55 minutes the other night against Virginia He played 51 of those minutes He needs to rest Good look from three is short Bedford gets the rebound Misses the layup Very physical rebound And a foul called against Virginia Tech Didnt know if that was going to be a jump ball or not Sincere Jones called for the foul Spingers there on the block I was getting hit in the back of the head there This is going to be a hard played physical game Youre going to have to match Virginia Techs physicality So far here in the first half the Geeks been up to the task Fivepoint lead for Wake Forest And another two here Big time dunk Omaha Belaloo Mike Young was concerned about the guard play of the Gigs controlling this game They come at you in waves and volumes All of these guards have the ability to attack you off the bounce screaming Abdales finds Bedford Pull up Pop Distant offensive rebound keeps it alive cheering for the Hokes And a foul called Baker there getting in the paint Teeth of the defense laying it off Omaha Blue You wont get an easier look than that Great cut from the baseline and finish So after Virginia Tech went on a 10 nothing run to tie it at 14 Wake Forest has answered with a seven nothing run of their own and another turnover That is 10 turnovers by Virginia Tech in a little more than 10 minutes Could that be the fatigue of coming off a triple overtime I think its a combination of both Its fatigue and its also the Digs are really aggressive Theyre up Theyre being physical themselves Theyve been challenged C4 has challenged this group and theyve been up to the task here in the first half Well the Demon Deacons already in the bonus Seven fouls committed by Virginia Tech in this first half You commit seven fouls you turn it over 10 times And Virginia Tech averages on the season under 10 turnovers a game 96 Today they already have 10 Wake Forest This is the front end of the one and one The good news is youre only down seven I mean this game the way Virginia Tech is playing theyre lucky theyre not down nearly 20 Dallas 5 seconds to shoot Tried to go inside squeezes cheering to Gerak So hes swiped away with four seconds on the shot clock I doubt its Ted Gak He needs him to roll a lot faster Hes stringing it out Great job that time Hes been more patient in the ball screen Gerak cuts either hes open or the weak side guards open 4 seconds here at the end of the shot clock to try and end a threeminute scoring drought Got to go quickly here A pull up three Nothing but air And thats a shot clock violation Sincere Jones the freshman unaware the shot clock was low He made the mistake The play was for pursuit to get it off his staggered screen I think the freshman popped out He caught the ball Didnt know what to do with it And turnovers continue to be the story 11 turnovers committed by Virginia Tech in the first 11 minutes of this game Wake Forest is capped in for 11 points off of those turnovers Good look from three Harris missed it Hes got to keep taking those shots Thats a good look Hes in the midst of a slump right now I said coming in and another screen and another offensive foul And thats against the freshman Gerak Thats his second So even though Virginia Tech has a clear advantage on the front line heightwise they their big men are in foul trouble now They have And my thats your third string center I dont know where you go from here laughter Hansberrys got two Geraks got two And Hanssbury comes back in the game with those two fouls And and Gerach stays in as well Theres not a lot of options when you got multiple guys out And Mike Young has said Look when we get whole this teams going to be really really good And theyve done well even with the absences of Toby Lal Antonio Dorne and Tyler Johnson screaming Its a lot missing on that front line Toby Lal is for his size Hes a double double himself He says to everyone You better get us now 10 seconds to shoot And another offensive foul for a push off Isaiah Pasha used his forearm there and its another turnover Great job there too Harris stand in front of the basketball cant extend that arm Theyll call it every time I dont think Ive ever seen something like this out of a Mikey uncon coach team Remember they average under 10 turnovers a game They have 13 turnovers one shy of a season high against Virginia Well that was in triple overtime Weve barely played 12 minutes here Another lob and a foul called And thats the third foul against Christian Gerdak Virginia Tech in foul trouble The turnovers have piled up and Wake Forest is leading by seven people be objective with football laughter I can do I have to do it with basketball I dont have to be with football A great year Nine wins in his first year Hes come in and a lot of life and exciting football for the D Bright future ahead And that win last night in Charlottes carried over a good positive momentum and vibe here at the Joel today A lot of people coming in talking about that win last night and a terrific season Wake Forest had of the football field The Demon defense on a nine nothing run right now Theyve grabbed control of this first half Virginia Tech has missed five straight shots They dont have a point in the last 5 minutes here 13 turnovers in this first half Jaden Shu a deep three Offensive rebound Hanssbury Hanssbury calling for it He gets it Also slims up the triple Cant connect Another offensive rebound Long possession for the Hokes Just a little short You wonder about the triple overtime game Jones draws the foul Hell go to the line for two You got to be concerned if you wait for us because you should be by ahead by a lot more He completely controlled this first half Virginia Tech with 13 turnovers missing a lot of open shots Now the officials are huddled up Sincere Jones drove in with authority Drew the original foul call and now the officials are giving signal that there may be a technical foul as well Steve Forbes not happy about it Theres Mike Young and Steve Forbes Theyve been going at it for a long time Started in the SoCon Steve Forbes at ETSU Mike Young and Wford Theyve been battling each other for a decade now Weve just been told its a double technical So those offset and Jones will get his original foul shots because of the common foul screaming cheering And now thats Hanssbury Hes got to come out of the game So its 10 and 13 right in the middle of your screen Aidens and Hansbury They were given the double technical So Hansbury thats his third foul He has to come out of this game Just got to be smarter than that You got two fouls Coach trust you to put you back in the game cheering And again hes got three fouls and hes got three bad fouls And you expect more of an experienced player and someone is playing as well as Ammani Hans And Christian Gerdak on the bench with three fouls as well So Virginia Tech has to go ultra small here Calm fouls his own miss And Jay they had planned to go small but that was with Hsburg Hansbury at the five Now hes on the bench Three fouls here He cannot come back and win this game till the second half Shot clock down to six Heres J Carris in attack mode Harris goes up with it Nothing but air And thats a shot clock violation before the dunk To your point Randolph statistically speaking Virginia Tech should be down by 15 or 20 Theyre only down eight Theyre still within striking distance here Definitely within Youve got to be concerned about that if youre shooting forth with your group You love what theyre doing and you want to keep it but you got to know cheering Virginia Tech is going to respond Six minutes without a field goal Seven turnovers during that time 14 turnovers in this first half and only down eight Hammonds in Dallas has got to create offense for this team Heres Hammond trying to provide the spark Hell get two from the line This is what he was so good doing against Virginia when he had a careerhigh 30 points on Wednesday night 16 of those points came from the free throw line Yeah hes really fast with the ball in his hands and he lives in the paint When he gets the basketball right now for the remainder of this half youve got to corral him bring extra bodies and help and try your best to keep him out of the paint and do not foul him Hammond comes off the bench for the Hokes Hes not a starter but 28 minutes per game off the bench he plays starter minutes And in that triple overtime win on New Years Eve a couple of days ago he was the reason why He did in the overtime game He essentially took over getting in the paint as you can see Seen every ball coverage you can imagine Love to get to that midrange pull up and cheering hes coming at you in transition Look out This is the second cheering Heres Harris Everything running through two and gold right now offensively Golden got it swiped away Bedford has it One on four and draws the foul Now Bedford really had nowhere to go there Four gold uniforms suffocating him and somehow gets them to commit the foul and will earn two from the line Your weight force you got to take care of the basketball and find a way just run your offense Theres no rim protection You dont have to force anything This is a small Virginia Tech lineup in right now Neil Dallas is the biggest player on the floor and he starts the game as your point guard Just be patient Let the offense come cant afford to give Virginia Tech turnovers right now to get them back in this game Yeah if you dont count Abdales cuz hes a guard The tallest forward on the court is Spillers at 67 But Jay part of the reason why Wake cant pull away is they still struggling from behind the threepoint line Theyre only one of nine here in the first half And thats been a bugaboo here for the Deaks The inconsistencies behind the threepoint line They keep taking them far as their DNA and the way theyre building Theyre really small in the front line Thats not the strength of this team and thats just going to be the makeup of this season Theyre going to live and die with the ability to make threes So the officials reviewed who committed the foul It was originally called against Miles Kovven which would have been his third That was a race and instead gets to two and they said it was Jaylen Cross who committed the foul His first screaming Edford misses them both Three cheering missed free throws consecutively here Virginia Tech they are really struggling the offensive end of the floor Only 16 points here shooting just 23 from the floor And if thats not bad enough theyve turned it over 14 times and its allowed Wake Forest to control this first half Deeps lead by nine Great job there by Ky Le getting to the rim Continue to put pressure on this lineup now Theyre really small This is the guy thats got to get going for Gene Tech Handed a three Got it Big Hammond Hes the igniter offensively Its just so tough Hes not known as a really good threepoint shooter but its so tough shooting only 31 from on the year from behind the threepoint line rejected Defended well by Cincier Jones screaming Got to corral the ball here You cant leave him oneonone Heres Hammond Good pass Leaps with the dunk underneath Jones the finish but all set up by Hammond And Steve Forms takes a timeout as the Hokes cut it to four Have not led in this game Big Force has led by as many as 10 That lead is down to four Virginia Tech has been really solid when theyve not turned the basketball over Theyve defended the D2 So you got to feel good about it with 14 turnovers here Youre only down four And what has kept Wake Forest from separating in this game Because it feels like theyve had the momentum theyve had control but they havent created that separation Tell you theyre just struggling from behind at the threepoint line Its just its just part of their identity And and thats just the way this team is going to be going to be played all year long The way their style is going to be played cheering they space you well They play with pace and theyre just not making shots Their defense has held up but at some point your defense cant hold up if youre just unable screaming to score enough points to help you out Harris knocks them both down from the foul line Thatll help Sixpoint lead for Wake for 4 minutes and 20 seconds remaining in this first half These are two really good defensive teams This will be a physical hardcore game I dont think either team will run away Heres Hammond Hes trying to be the spark offensively Good turn around and knocks it down And the problem with him Jay is you try to trap him Hes so fast He draws a ton of fouls attacking your big on ball screen You either have a change of ball screen coverage Well Pammans going to take over this game Quarter three No good Offensive rebound Kick out Kice got it Nick Ces drills it Calm me has had himself a really strong first half Just the second three of the half goes down for the Deaks Virginia Techs made their last three shots Hammond whos been a part of all of them Two makes and an assist Bedford called for the clear out cheering Tried to swing it to Hammond It was defended beautifully by Juke Harris Shot clock down to nine We step aside again Wake Forest up seven 315 remaining in this first half Good takeaway Threeon one Belaloo went right to the rim to open the score applause Omaha balloon This collaboration intended to strengthen the muscle features Sorry guys laughter Randolph Childress is number 22 hanging in the Raptors Demon Deakons leading by seven Virginia Tech They have struggled offensively but only down seven Bedford trying to make it four out of three It just rims out no good Itll stay Hoke basketball They only have Oh the shot clock does reset to 20 because it hit the rim Right now theyre just battling their way back in Theyre not getting clean rebounds Wake Forest is on the defensive end of the floor Again early in the game the guards were cracking down getting defensive rebounds Right now theyre spread out because Virginia Tech is starting to make shots Dallas very quiet in this first half Passes off Bedford a three Got it Nothing but the bottom of the net for Jay Bedford Taking a half court Wake Forest only has 17 points Theyve got 13 points theyve scored off of turnovers and credit Virginia Tech Theyre struggling offensively Lob and not the easiest finish but Spillers gets it to go for two Yeah they had a lot of success here early on that empty side ball screen No one to help on the roll Hand was moving before he secured the ball Reathers it Shot clock ticks down to 12 Bedford launches another and hits it again Backto back threes for Bedford Turns over But you ask for shooting youve got shooting Virginia Tech started this game four of 17 but theyve made five of their last six Theyre right back in it Threepoint game under two minutes to play in this first half Shoot going for the tie is to short Thats not a good shot Its quick shot The other threes have come within the flow of the offense The floater falls Nick Cal has found his groove of his first down Hes got none He does Four assists Hes done a really good job when hes gotten that paint Shoot from the same spot This time he drills it Its a twopoint game screaming Love the confidence of shooters When you miss he doesnt care Takes a ton of confidence to come up Shoot the next one right after you miss one Val weaving through the defense Got a good look Couldnt finish it though screaming Sh Nothing but air Felt he had the high hand Forced that one Now I really love the confidence laughter Got to make him when you take three in a row They shoot stick or the official there laughter Tyler C Someone got a piece of it right Yeah its a just left it short Little turbulence in the air there Now Virginia Tech has overcome 14 first half turnovers They shot just four of their first 17 They trailed cheering by as many as 10 in this game And here they are with the ball down two a chance to take their first lead of the half Weights failed to separate and Mike Youngs team has roared back here I mean these are two evenly matched teams and Mike Js got to be pleased with his troops Multiple starters on the bench with three fouls Not very deep with injuries You got three players out with injuries and now you find yourself only down two points with a three here to take the lead Jones that three miss fires Heres Harris BLOWS BY DALLAS WHAT A take care splits two at the rim Great drive and finish there Looking for contact Fischers didnt caught it but great finish The Hooks can hold for the final shot of this first half trailing by four 10 seconds left in it Id give him space I think he can beat anybody off the dribble Theyre going to put smear in a ball screen Got to get it out of his hands Aales a three Missed it screaming Neil Alis the talented Frank scored this in the first half But Mike Youngs a little sore No excuse He came out he had four turnovers to start early Only two field goal attempts Hes got to get going here in the second half Hanssberry he spent a lot of time on the bench in that first half with foul trouble Hes got three Good floater there to start the second half And its a twopoint game And Jay they want to put the ball in Dallass hand because of his size And with Wake Forest being so aggressive in a ball screen action he gets to throw over top of the defense Kick to the corner Cooper Schwer the junior knocks it down Good answer there by Wake Forest Whos worried about threepoint shooting Its just the wrong guys shooting You need to get your big guys out there knocking them down Thats all thats going on Wake Forest just two of 12 from three in that first half but they bury their first take from deep in this second half Heres Shu wide open Hell usually make you pay Missed it there Great job there running him off the line You want to make Shu put it down That time it was a little flat Calmise That floater falls Dice Hes been brilliant Hes got 11 I think that shot there all afternoon and I think he needs to continue to be aggressive getting to the rim and when they come and rotate to drop it off If not you keep shooting that floater Five assists to go along with those 11 points The Demon Deacons lead by seven Bedford was the bright spot offensively of the first half for the Hokes but misfires there now with the foul trouble the front line Its keep attacking the the bigs You want to attack 13 and 32 Both in the game with three fouls Spillers goes right at Hanssbury They missed it Had a reach in there on Miles C Thats his third foul So how can the Hokeies get their star freshman have Dallas going after that disappointing first half He doesnt need to force anything I mean this is a wellbalanced team Its just the next guy up right now Hes coming off Hes doing his job in the early offense Hes coming off when Wakes aggressive in that ball screen action Some of the scoring that these other guys are doing is because of the attention that hes drawing And you can see Wake is trying to keep Miles Coven and his size and athleticism to guard him because you know bother shot his eye view in his eye level so he can not control and take over this game Another ball screen action again He gets to throw over the top when hes knocking on it away which hes done frequently in this game Thats his seventh turnover You said it he had four turnovers the first six possessions of this game He just cant find a flow right now on the road against a Wake Forest team desperate for a win at home after they lost their last two to end December He just needs to be patient I think hes picking his dribble up and theres no need Hes 69 He sees over the defense No one is bothering the shot screaming Gives it away AB Dallas now on the receiving end of a turnover Goes right to the rim up and under for two His first basket of the afternoon Lets watch and see if that shot can get him going Heres Coven Lines up a triple Missed him Offensive rebound keeps the possession alive Palise goes with the floater again and his touch is right on the money 13 points today A lot of them have come to rank Yeah I I know this is an analytically driven league and youre monitoring shots at the rim and the three but in games like this you got to make the adjustment and allow him to continue to do that You can see here again gets in the passing lane here nearly loses his balance with the up and under Kisha has just done this all game long Just get to that road Has great ability great touch to finish there Id like to see him screaming continue to do that Get down here stay in attack mode not settle for his many threes Dallas trying to get going here You just saw his first basket of the day You can see the flashes of what makes him a top prospect that has the NBA scouts giddy Just looking for the consistency game in and game out Its going to happen Just 19 years old Yeah hes got to settle down and just be patient Went for the poke away there and swatted it out of bounds Wake Forest a sixpoint lead They have led throughout Virginia Tech has not led once today Demon Deacons led by as many as 10 Got to get some offense in the half court It is said they turn it over Credit to Virginia Tech Theyve done a great job of staying in this game They are only in this game because of their half court defense When they havent turned it over theyve controlled this game Every time in the first half it felt like the Demon Deacons could separate and close the door Virginia Tech made sure that that door stayed cracked Now could they put together a run and grab a lead for the first time today Still trailing by six Good spin move inside The freshman Christian Kak draws a foul Hell get two at the line And the concern you have for Wake Forest is Kak and Hanssbury didnt play much in the first half And those two guys have been their leading scorers during this sixgame win streak screaming mentioned it in the first half but Gurak was so vital in that thrilling triple overtime win against their ranked rival Virginia on Wednesday night New Years Eve 17 points 19 rebounds Just a freshman screaming plays with so much confidence takes him from the line and its a fourpoint game Theyre actually out of the same high school Paul to six BBI as Ben Hammond and Dukes Harris and Patrick Gamba Duke Harris off the mark there Offense beginning to get a little stagnant for the Neman defense Hansbury pull up pop Got it Hes a gifted scoreer gives them the versatility Hurry does of playing small ball five can slide to the four tap you off the bounce better shooter than his number show off the window again hes been the goto guy Nate Cal up to 15 continue to probe and get to his spots foul off the ball itll stay Virginia Tech ball trailing by four the Hokes not going Hasberry showing you he was in foul trouble early but hes not losing his aggressiveness Continuing to battle Virginia Tech on Wake Forest a fourpoint lead They led throughout but the Hokes refused to go away Virginia Tech on a sixgame win streak Hey Jay I guess the Hurricanes belong after all huh Yeah exactly laughter That was the big talk coming in Will they get in Will they not Well they have proven they belong David Shoot fires the three off the mark Another offensive rebound Dallas crosscourt pass finds Bedford goes up strong and its a twopoint game Bedfords been really good here really consistent performance with the inconsistency of lineup screaming for Virginia Tech here today for Wake Forest Dave Cal has the last six Has it here cheering saves it from going out of bounds A season high 15 for Cal Misses that three though You just want to continue to get in the paint Good things happen and Nate Calm gets two feet in the paint A Dallas a three way off the line I think one of the things that hurt him in the past not so much today its been shot selection And thats Neo AD Dallas talking about there and Cal drills the three on the other end Wake Forest backed up by five Hes got 18 which is now a season high at 18 And he scored the last nine for the Demon defense Well has been the conductor Passes off this time Spillers a three Thats not his shot I think coach fors is really pleased with that field goal tote attempt Get a rhythm offensively Kyle Me has it going Hanssberry left all alone in this Virginia Techs getting good looks Cant knock him down right now Sweeter finds J Carris on a cut and hes fouled Hell earn two from the line applause This is the best way for us is looking in the half court offense here Chuke Harris has made a massive sophomore jump I made the comparison to John Collins here You can see the comparison from the freshman to sophomore year Thats a massive jump in production Both of those guys I I think hes just one Its opportunity Both guys are the freshman It takes time coming off the bench And then once the confidence comes in it comes with opportunity and preparation Hes physically stronger Same thing with Collins Just flourishing here in this offense And hes not onedimensional I think he can improve his ball handling and creativity off the bounce but really good shooting really good cutter and when he speaks I think hes a highend shooter And with that free throw Duke Carroll has scored 10 points in every game this season All 15 of them 10 or more Deacons up seven havent trailed since tip off Pans in the game I think it makes the groove much better So they moved up off the ball and gives Her some some womens side Yeah Gives him womens side Hes been the most consistent scorer for Virginia Tech this season For trying to get something quickly to Noah Bale This is a dangerous group for Virginia Tech because now Hsburys at the five laughter offensive group and youre able now to put Hri at the five It becomes a matchup problem It be interesting to see if Wake Force will start to double team him here He can catch it in the mid post driving really good at scoring with his back to the basket Scores it in so many different ways He didnt play a lot in the first half So look for him to be uber aggressive here in the second half You know the stats are one thing and Hansbury has been a consistent productive player for Mike Young with 16 points per game nine rebounds per game But Mike Young has been so impressed with his intelligence his basketball IQ He picks things up so quickly and he told us he settles the ship when he when we need him to has certainly done that during this six game win streak Well remember he had him as the starting fiveman to start the year and then with the injuries happened it forced him to go big with Gerat and Mike Young was worried about what lineup he needed to have and Hanss ability to pick up everything and help the team out So the officials have a clock issue Were going to take our under 12 media timeout Fivepoint game a good one in the ACC how critical this game he is early in the ACC season Yeah massive game the first Saturday in January Wake Forest trying to bounce back after disappointing backto cheering back losses for Virginia Tech 122 a sixgame win streak Theyre undefeated in the United States Randolph their two losses came in the battle for Atlantis Mike Young Its been a master class particularly with the injuries he has had Two starters Toby Lal Tyler Johnson out Antonio Dorne another big man unavailable Theyve continued to just find ways to win Thats where theyve been challenged on the injury front Wake has done a really good job with this schedule this year A three Get it Two threes today for Cooper Schwagger And he can do that And he will get that shot Better shooter from the threepoint line than Trayvon Spiller Hes knocked down two here today The immediate answer Neil Gonzalez trains it I think hes better as a waiter because hes free He takes the decision making out of his hand He could just be in attack mode Back to a onepossession game Mar goes baseline into traffic Dumps it off Schwagger righty hook No good How about the hustle to keep it alive cheering Sebastian Akins screaming Harris I go and attack Hansbury He has three fives He can afford to pick up a four here Aens a three off the mark and another offensive rebound from Wake Long possession for the Demon Akens and the catch in Mak and thats a big three Sometimes it takes effort like that The fact that youre struggling to get field goals from the threepoint line sometimes effort cheering just cures it all screaming Clearance going right into Harris Double team comes in swings through it and its a travel Double team coming Hansbury tries to spit the double team Shuffles his feet Keeps going for the travel here but great job here Multiple offensive rebound efforts And thats the basketball guys rewarding you with an open threepoint shot Best time to get a three Everyone knows its after offensive rebound Defense is trying to scramble Big shot there sixpoint lead for Wake Forest as we tick near midway through the second half Deakons have led throughout by never more than 10 Great ball movement and an easy two Sebastian Aens wait for firing into THEIR FLOW OFFENSIVELY HES PICKING up with Kishs left arm and getting to the midrange shot Taking a pull up Not forcing anything Bedford in attack mode Well defended Now its Hammonds turn to try and create something And he does Ben Hammond Hes there when the Hokes need him Both teams are running really good action They struggle to score early We win a rock fight early Looked like now the offense is starting to pick up by both teams That rims out for Miles Look at K Both teams just continue to lead the basketball Bford step back three drills it and cuts the lead in half cheering Had himself a game here today Shot the ball really well has knocked out four threes Akins lobs it up deflected and stolen away Hammond tripped as he was going back up court by Akens A frustration foul after the turnover and Hammond went down hard Just a great job here You just dribble hand off and allows Hammonds to turn a corner Difficult shot on shooting a runner going left and Beths just filling it Creates space with the snapback Knocks down his fourth threepointer here Jingitech still scrappy trying to figure out a way to stay in this game But Dunsons tip off Went down 144 early Havent trailed by more than that 10 continued to hang around despite never taking the lead in this game Virginia Tech Jay you want to keep put pressure on a group for grouper struggling with confidence like that Jay Bedford continued with the high hand Knock down a couple threes and try to run him off the line Shows you he can finish up the rim with a nice lefty leg Bedford with 18 Virginia Tech on a seven nothing run over the last minute to cut it to one a season high 18 Hands it off Schwagger got it stripped Hanssbury all over screaming it Hanssbury a double double today 13 and 10 Bedford Good patience there by Virginia Tech J Not forcing anything there Theyre on a run right now This is how you sustain the runs by winning offense Hsbury fires Virginia in 10 for the first time today cheering and applause The Huskies lead First lead of the day 70 run Instead of forcing out you continue to run offense Virginia Tech now on a 100 run Got out of the game here in They just have to put the ball in their guards hand and forces them to make plays And the inability of their front line guys to make shots outside of Swagger forcing these guards to shoot over Bigs on the interior makes it tougher to get sometimes Out of the timeout shot clock down to eight Big counties a season high 18 Calling for the clear out He only has 4 seconds to shoot Step back deep three Missed it One thing Virginia Tech has done very well is not turn the ball over They had 14 turnovers in the first 14 minutes Since then only three The reason theyve come back into this game and we said it in the first half Wade didnt bury him and put him away And they had opportunities A 10point lead early but the Hokes hung around and now theyre leading by two Trying to steal one on the road Twopoint lead on the floor He started impossely Hammond drew the foul Coming off a careerhigh performance 30 points in the triple overtime win against Virginia 16 of those 30 came from the foul line confident from the strike A quick turnaround after you play three extra sessions against a ranked rival and you know slow to get going today on the road early start but the way they have responded in this second half hes showing you they are the real deal they are and screaming again theyre only going to get better as they get healthy then Hammond has been nothing but a spark blow coming off Mike Youngs bench and every team wants something like that everybodys fortunate enough to have guards like that or anyone like that coming off their bench right now looking for someone to car the offensive load with a scoring drought of three and a half minutes that has allowed a 12 nothing run by Virginia Tech for the step up Yes they dont have guys that just get the ball to to go make the plays Contested shot but Harris and its got to be Juke Harris but you got to get sets to get him an advantage early on Hes not a oneonone guy but he has the ability to create space and that midrange is money Looks like he heard you Randolph He did exactly what you were asking for there Back to a twopoint game Lost the handle Holden has it The steel cheering and the slave to tie it at 62 Bedford transition three Got it The immediate answer Wade slow to get back and Jaylen Bedford makes him pay Hes got 21 I know Steve Forbes is pulling the strands of hair he has on the top of his head right now tonight You give him a basket after a layup What a shot Shoot Harris Count it Plus the foul A chance to tie it at the line Lets hope Drew Harris is okay He took a big shot there Somehow still got it to go Take another look just takes the contact there and he also falls on that same side that he took the contact Its a great job of taking contact on and finishing Hes done it all year as many free throws as he has field goal attempts Its good to see him get up applause And its the fourth foul against Ammani Hansbury Hes been the catalyst of this comeback for Virginia Tech So an interesting decision to make if youre Mike Young with Hansbury sitting with four fouls now Harris trying to shake off that big hit Knock down this free throw to tie the game at 65 A little more than six minutes remaining in regulation Now with a onepoint lead here this is a big decision Its a big chance Mike Young is leaving Ammani Handboro in the game What would you do I would sit him into the under four right now if I could And I think you got enough offensive options out there to protect him And you see Mike Young thinking the same thing Hansberry does check out for Cincere Jones They do have a depleted front court with Toby Lwal Antonio Dorne and Tyler Johnson all out with injury screaming Harris hits it Tie game applause applause and cheering Six minutes remaining What promises to be a fun finish between Virginia Tech and Wake Forest kned at 65 Foul called against the Demon Deacons Steve Forbes not happy about it And this will send Virginia Tech to the line for a one and one because the Hokes are in the bonus the rest of the way I know Steve Forbes is upset about the call Its been a physical game but its a guard to guard switch Theres no need to push or foul there cheering just make the switch I mean Forge is hot And he knows how desperate the Demon Deacons need this win at home after disappointing losses to end December I dont think theres much of an argument there and he extends his arm And I think if he uses his body he gets away with the foul But when you extend your hand he give the officials no choice And with those two free throws Jaylen Bedford has a new season high 23 points cheering Gives Virginia Tech back the lead Elmese that rattles in and out Doesnt drop Head for the hot hand No good that time This will be Wake Forest basketball with 531 remaining with Deags trailing by two Bill Cington is asking Mike Young if he wants the challenge But Mike Young is going to use it Mike Young I think was buying some time there Absolutely he was to to make sure his bench got a level The previous call out of bounds is being challenged So new rule in college basketball you have the coachs challenge If youre using it in your room youre out Wake Forest basketball Lets take a look And that does look like No Uh Miles Coven Coven Yeah Kovvens left hand there was reaching in and might have touched it last instead of Sincere Jones with the angle that Miles Coven is coming in and where the ball goes I think but does he knock it off the hands of Sincere Jones and is it indisputable evidence right because you need to be 100 sure to overturn I dont know if there is enough there to say theyve got to overturn it You know Kovs definitely poking through but who does it go off of last I love what Mike Young did You go over and talk to the official laughter to give your guys enough time to try to replay Players do it all the time and they tell their coaches to challenge I dont think the players understand the significance of that timeout that coaches need if they get it wrong and it has to be in indisputable to overturn Well its been a great chess match as it always is between Mike Young and Steve Forbes Theyve been battling for a decade now First in the SoCon now in the ACC Well theyre now the old guard at this conference the two oldest coaches and theyve got a long great history great respect and admiration for each other and they both said These games are always close and competitive And sure enough weve got another one here Forbes told a great story at ETSU It was Steve Forbs bobblehead night So he takes out and gives a bobblehead to Mike Young Well Mike Young kept flicking it throughout the game They called him the four stands wait for his basketball cheering and applause challenge So after a lengthy review they just announced here that the call stands So Mike Young loses a timeout loses his ability to challenge the rest of the game And Wake Forest keeps the basketball down two Sure Mike Young wants to give that Steve Forbes bobblehead a flick right now after losing the challenge Hes telling Bill Coington That conversation with you cost me a timeout You should have just inbounded the basketball I should have left you alone laughter So now both teams just with two timeouts the rest of the way 5 minutes and 30 seconds remaining Demon Deacons with the basketball trailing by two Lets pay attention to that Jay and see if they need to challenge a call Calmise picked up his dribble Risky pass Spillers saves it for the Demon Deakons Harris for three No good Offensive rebound keeps it alive I think Wake got away with the back court violation there And now they get a foul applause cheering Just the third foul called against Virginia Tech in this second half This was the over and back Does look like Bedford might have got a hand on it to negate the over and back I thought Trayvon Smith was the one that actually tipped it out toward half court Calm me draws the foul again This time hell be shooting Good bounceback performance for the senior guard from Gilbert Arizona Nate Calmese after he was scoreless against NC State on New Years Eve He has responded with a season high 18 points today And thats a play there They cant challenge her looked like he got all has been rock solid here today Can he help close the game for the Deeps Were desperately in need of a win here at home Tied at cheering 67 under five minutes to play applause Whos going to be the hero down the stretch Sincere Jones An unlikely one Misses from three applause and cheering Wake Forest playing with some pace Calmise screaming Now backs it out screaming Spillers into the lane Goes up left missed it Battle for the board but the ball awarded to Virginia Tech And now Juke Harris urging his coach to challenge it And I think you learn a lesson that laughter youd rather hold on to that timeout and hold on to that challenge right Yeah You do in a game like this you know its going to come down to the end Every defenders want it Its just not enough time Its so fast sacking so fast Even on the benches its not not easy for coaches to get the final quality Hammy cant cash in up ahead Spillers leaking out Hammers it home Demon Dickens lead applause cheering applause Thats a double team coming Bedford Hes had the hot hand and it continues Jaylen Bedford a season high 25 Dwayne Force you got to go early in the double team He knows its coming Steven Duke playing through Cal right now He goes up again The floater doesnt fall cheering Look for some action here again Get the ball to hand that Nick Mos for post up Hansberry playing with four fouls Has a mismatch here going against the guard Calise swings it to the corner The extra pass Bedford missed it that time Three minutes remaining Tied at 69 A critical game at the beginning of conference play coming down to the wire and a foul called off the ball against Miles Coven and he has fouled out and Kovven just picked up his fifth foul with under three minutes to play Funk is coming and Winston Salem tied at 69 basketballatch tomorrow Thats right Well see you tomorrow Remind the next step around the corner No American children So Miles Kulov is just fouled out of this tied game with under three minutes to go for an off ball foul Lets take another look See him trying to cut through Its an accidental hit He bumps into Dallas You can see here Is it the extension of the arms I I think hes just hes running through and expecting Neo Dallas not to be there Its an accidental contact and undeniable contact though That is a big loss for Wake Forest down the stretch of this game tied at 69 Virginia Tech with the basketball Okis coming off that thrilling triple overtime win against a range rival Virginia A sixgame win streak Theyre looking to extend with a road win and they give it away Mai Mason got his hand screaming This has got to be Nate Reese again coming on fast Hes got to go make a play Spillers in the paint Goes up with the left off the window and in for two Wake Forest leads applause Hmon down the lane Contact for two Big H All he does is deliver What a game What a game Now you have maybe the smallest player on the floor but he might be the toughest Jay has the ability to get to the rim and finish with the trees Right back to Spillers Twohanded jam Trayvon Spillers Backto back baskets applause Back and forth We go to Joel A critical game of the beginning of conference play in the ACC Hansbury a three Its good Nothing but the bottom of the net Ami Hanssberry Oh Virginia Tech back in front Back and forth we go You dont want to miss this finish Timeout Hokes up by one Give me Youve got to give Ammani Hanssbury and this Hokes team so much credit Every time they have trailed in this game they punch back here It started with Spillers got the transition dunk before there gets the slip to the rim No help And here that aggressive ball screen defense backfires against the Deaks Hansbury steps in and knocks down a three Wake Forest desperate for this win at home Case in a three Backles in and out The tip in Spillers Count it PLUS THE FOUL applause TRAYVON SPILLERS Just got a finger to it through contact and a chance to make it a twopoint lead at the foul line Talking about playing with 11 in desperation a motor and a will and a want to And thats Hansberrys fifth foul Ammani Hansbury has just fouled out of this game That is a big foul He has been so critical to Virginia Tech to the line One shot There it is You see Hansbury contested late commits that fifth foul Spillers makes it He has scored the last seven points for Wake Forest He is willing the Demon Deacons to the finish line applause as they come to their feet of the Joel Wake a twopoint lead A minute to play Hammond weeds through traffic No finish there to clean up the spill Christian Gak ties it and Steve Forbes uses one of his two remaining timeouts with this game tied at 76 Great job there High eight by Ben Hammond initially with the ball screen action Both teams I think now are going to attack their centers in ball screens Hammond with the split And what you tell your guards is not to get the shot blocked That leaves your being oneonone against the guard Kak with the offensive rebound and put back Winning plays made by both teams late in this game Oh we said right before tip off Team Forbes to the Demon Deacons need this win at home Theyve lost their last two at one point losses early in the season to Michigan and Texas Tech Those were missed opportunities You have got to find a way to win this game Tied at 76 screaming How do they do it Well J 26 seconds left on the shot clock The question is one you got to ask do you go with a quick hitter here That will give you the last possession one way or the other If you take this shot clock down then now Virginia Tech holds the last shot if you dont score So I think thats a critical decision here Well see what Wake decides to do I would take the two for one option Can I get Kyle Me the type of action on Duke Harris on some weak side action And remember Trayvon Spillers who scored the last seven for Wake It could go his way Calmises got to go if they want to get this off before 30 seconds remaining Spillers goes up that rolls around Doesnt drop Battle for the rebound Looked like Virginia Tech had it but they lose it and it stays applause Demon Deakons ball underneath their own hoop And Mike Young cannot challenge this call because used his coachs challenge but the officials can review it right But he hes calling for it This will have to be the officials decision Mike Young cant impact his decision applause And the officials right now are saying We got a pretty good look at it We dont need to go to the monitor Wow Now Steve Forbes has just taken a timeout It does seem like Bedford was the last to touch that basketball Its a lot going on with that blade Looks like Bedford Hag was trying to squeeze it Spillers was digging his hand in there trying to rip it out So Steve Forbes has just used his final timeout The officials by the way are not going to the monitor and they have the ability to do so with under a minute to go Mike Young used his coachs challenge He cant force them to the monitor So this is going to be Wake Forest basketball No timeouts Theyre using their last one here Both teams are discussing Jay right now if youre wait or miss you got to get back And thats your defense Mike Young youre talking your group about the amount of time thats going to be left Theres a 5second difference in the shot clock right now So theres plenty of time to go the distance Youre just making sure your group is prepared for the situation if they need a two or three Wait right now again I think its K So its got to be Duke Harris Put the ball in their hand Allow them to make a play for and Virginia Tech is very comfortable in these situations Theyve been in this situation all season long already Four overtime games Thats already the most ever the Hokes have had in a single season and they are 40 in those games So if this goes back Yeah they theyre coming off backto back overtime wins against Elon and Virginia So if this goes to overtime well thats same old story for Virginia Tech In your wake youve got a chance to take the lead here in regulation Lets see if they can execute out of the timeout Thats what we were just talking about Virginia Tech has lived in overtime this season The good thing is Jay why not free basketball I dont have to run you to the airport so I think were going to be good laughter Fun finish here Buckle up 7676 Wake Forest with the basketball Calmise a season high 20 points to his name today Shot clock ticks down to eight Calm calling for the clear out Yeah get him to his right hand Step three applause What a shot The senior delivers Take another look Hes been the best player on the floor for the all afternoon long Here he gets cut off that right hand Great step back spinning in rhythm Nothing but net Big shot puts the defense up three Now Steve Fors has the decision to make Does he foul or not Well we saw this last night between Notre Dame and Cow We referenced it earlier Notre Dame was up three in that game They tried to foul fouled too late The referee said it was in the act of shooting and Cal makes the three to tie it and then takes the lead from the free throw line and wins So if you are going to foul you better do it before Virginia Tech gets into that shooting motion 6 seconds left 69 seconds as it is Well see early Usually you want to commit that foul if youre going to do so right around the half court line And Mike Young has used his final timeout Look Mike Young now on his bench Jaden Shu has not been in the game much Jaden Beth cheering had the hot hand Hes knocked down four threes A lot of times to run ahead run a play to execute Virginia Tech can run the baseline who was after the Cal three No time outs for either team immediately Steve Forces are going to be either across applause the court Yeah why not And the reason why Jay I think you can do that too is like you know in college basketball you dont advance it but Virginia takes a lot of time out So whatever play they run there you got to go look for it Its important to know Virginia Tech has only committed five fouls So to get weight to shoot free throws theyve got to foul twice and they only have 51 seconds to do it And these are moments where youve got to be prepared for in practice Youre in front of your bench Youre going to communicate these things Virginia Tech has to be lined up manto man and prepared to try to get a 5second count or a foul Dallas the freshman from Greece made screaming the first makes the second for Virginia Tech to reiterate they need to foul quick and they need to foul twice before Wake Forest can shoot one and one Both teams out of timeouts Teams are going small Theyre getting ball handlers in Juke Harris the inbounder gets it in quickly to Akens Foul comes in Wake Forest will have to inbound it one more time That is just the 16th foul against Virginia Tech So the Hokes have to commit one more And critically you cant let too much time come off the clock here Youve got to foul immediately Watch out for someone going deep Cal is there Foul comes in quick 31 seconds remaining The best that Cal can do is make it a threepoint game and its a one and one So you have to make the first to earn the second Jay Ive said this before I Im a big fan of making the first free throw and missing the second one When is 3 seconds left There is no timeouts The counter to that is if you dont make it way take a 75footer and you lose the game But I take my chances for someone rebounding the basketball taking one dribble 31 seconds So it wouldnt be a half court he necessarily if you can advance the ball quickly It is if its Gerta laughter Lets see what Cal Me does here over a 90 foul shooter makes it And now Virginia Tech can inbound it which is why you were advocating that he missed there Now what you can do is foul again if youre Steve Forbes and then that prevents them from getting a game tying three off Look for the long touchdown pass similar to what Wake Forest has used Theyre trying to Bedford is fouled with 17 seconds remaining And the best he can do is make this a onepoint game So Ill ask you again Were talking about free throw strategy If youre Jaylen Bedford do you make the first miss the second and give yourself a chance at an offensive rebound Well thats all you have to do now is a tip in Got to make the first you got to miss the second to the line Not a lot of time to throw it back to the inbounder with 3 seconds left Got to be able to throw it up and the Dean Tech able to do that Well Bedford misses the first cheering And now theyre going to have to hope for a miss and a quick three A lot has to have happen in 17 seconds Jay needed to have that first one Well Wake Forest is desperate to end this twoame losing streak pick up their first conference win Theyre 17 seconds away Hokes looking for a miracle and theyre not GOING TO GET ONE WAKE FOREST wins it
