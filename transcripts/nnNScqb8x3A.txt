best to just let these guys sit maybe another game in hopes of where Duke is going to go in this regular season feder Rico Federico and filipowski get us started the pit line up tonight for Jeff Cables got the Freshman Jaylen low and here is Henson whos their leading score Blake the fifth best score in the ACC and feder Rico inside for an early dunk and the Panthers on the board Duke in the manto man Weston I think pit actually surprised them by passing the ball to filipowski driving down the lane so filipowski defended by feder Rico heres Proctor Caleb Foster back to filipowski with feder Rico defending at the Block hell make the move Fall Away against the double team has missed low the recovery fifth different starting lineup of the year for John shy Hinton a three ball from the right wing 57th three of the year for the seventh best threepoint shooter in in the ACC Blake Henson W hes the seventh best threepoint shooter overall hes really struggled in conference play that is a great sign for the Panthers Rock to the drive batted away recovered by Austin here is low Panthers dont have numbers called the third possession The Freshman is Bob Carrington heres Henson double team coming from filipowski lost it going through traffic recovered jayen Blakes first turn over the night pit heres Blakes making just his third career start tonight for the Blue Devils made two a year ago the lowski the catch theres feder Rico and deflected out of bounds by low all right you were talking a moment ago about pits opening possession feder Rico went right to the basket well feder Rico does a really good job in that screen and roll situation just sliding to the basket and thats what he did and I think filipowski was a step behind it looked like he was a little surprised heres McCain whos been on a tear backside rebound for Henson there a couple of markers here tonight for pit if theyre going to try and pull this upset theres low soft jump shot in the lane for jayen low out of Missouri City Texas 7 nothing the Panthers and Foster Drive all of a sudden pit is rolling here in the first couple of minutes Well w theyve made a couple of shots and thats what theyve really struggled to do well youre not kidding shooting 34 from the floor in their last two ACC games the loss at home to Syracuse earlier this week and the loss the last week with Duke and there is a twopointer from Carrington and a timeout for John shy 2 minutes and 18 seconds into the ball game the Panthers nine the Blue Devils nothing at camon 49 on February the 12th and his teams gone pick and roll here Dan for a fast start well his team relies on the pick and roll and right there everybody just drops away from low and hes able to stick it in the basket and here this Carrington with a very tough shot Carrington takes a lot of tough shots and if hes going to make them thats really a positive for the Panthers filipowski heres McCain and Austin there over the top of the screen tend to shoot for filipowski working on feder Rico bullies his way to the Lane hell draw the foul on the six 11 Jr from Finland feder Rico feder Rico his first itll be number one on the Panthers and thatll put Kyle filipowski to the line and thats what were talking about Wes all the skills filipowski has theres no defensive help he just takes the ball right to the basket if youre going to stop him youve got to get to him while hes dribbling the ball and if you do that then hes likely to pass it because hes an excellent passer hes increased his scoring average in ACC play Alone by five points from a year year ago averaging nearly 15 or Im sorry Dan hes increased it by three points in the ACC averaging 17 a game against the conference nine rebounds against the conference hes second in Block shots in conference play hes 12th in assist by the way in case you need to polish up there and you can see hes shooting the ball very well in the last two games now interestingly West he struggled from the free throw line a little bit particularly in conference play but those two looked good yep sure did he had 30 last Saturday in the win against Georgia Tech and hes got Dukes first two tonight low Fall Away out of the corner and the rebound for Proctor sophomore from Applause Australia heres McCain trying to take Austin into traffic jumper rattled out and hence in the rebound for pit Panthers are 13th in ACC play in rebound mark and Duke is fourth rebounding is going to be a thing here tonight if bits going to have a chance I absolutely think it is but the Panthers would prefer that there not be a lot of offensive rebounds for them to get theyd like to make their shots pit comes in dead last an ACC play at 38 seven on the uh low on the drive was seven on the shot clock and another basket for the Freshman jayen low there was a screen and a switch and low was matched up against filipowski and he just took him to the basket ninepoint lead for pit Proctor to filipowski out front Foster High arching three is good Caleb Foster 16th three of the year hes now six of his last 11 in ACC play thats just great ball movement Foster is not going to get very many better shots than that Carrington skips it to Austin Blakes nice job taking away the Baseline Austins got got a size advantage against Blakes he might want to try to go further Carrington is going to draw the filipowski foul thats going to be his first its the first on the Blue Devils pit with a strong start Panthers with a sixpoint lead and free throws when we come back to Cameron a cant miss ACC basketball double header knock down James the Bell Kelly one of the best in the country Taylor Tri knock it down number four NC State host Duke while number 13 D Jeff Cables team tied for third in the regular season a year ago went to the NCAA tournament and posted 24 wins there was high optimism in Oakland about where the Panthers might be but this conference can be a uh a rude thing if you dont get off to a good start in the Panthers here are the details on nonconference and Conference and really the shooting numbers are the most glaring yeah it really is West they were 92 in nonconference play but you can see they have not shot the ball well in ACC games they are a team that relies on the three and thats almost two fewer threes per game but a really good start tonight the Panthers starting out five of six as you can see right there the Blue Devils only one of six pit has only attempted two threes and theyve knocked one down and I think thats the Panthers have been taking the ball inside the arc trying to score and they shoot a lot of Threes 45 of their field goal attempts in conference games Come From Beyond The Arc but they havent done that tonight so far after the filipowski foul Bob Carrington freshman from Baltimore goes to the line first of two free throws hes got his third point he is kind of personified the struggle the last two games hes just four of 26 from the field and two of 16 from three but but hes got four points and you know you hear coaches say it and people kind of laugh about it but it the games a lot easier when the ball goes in the basket and certainly gives you a lot of confidence when youre shooting it and the balls going down well and Jeff capable and his entire staff today was talking about hey we just see the ball go in the basket you never know theres Philip palsky and hes fouled by Henson filipowski is a very very difficult matchup for the Panthers and you dont want to get H in foul trouble so Philip palski will go to the strike first on Blake Henson who turned 24 the day after Christmas Kyle at the line already two for two tonight and now has his third Point quick reminder to you we got a double header for you on acc Network Tuesday night Rees Davis John Chrisman will be at the Yum Center for Dukes visit to Louisville and then Cory Alexander coach beheim and I will be at the castle for Boston College and Virginia Tech following thats Tuesday night on acc Network live on the ESPN now and you guys ought to have fun there the hokes with a huge win on the road today a win they desperately needed sure did and a terrific second half from that law firm of kadur coutur and padulla and theres a foul on a lob for feder Rico Ron groover has called Ryan young Dan for undercutting here feder Rico yeah I think think so Wes as we take a look at it here feder Rico sets the screen and goes to the basket and young is trying to get back and I think they call the foul West because he drops the arm here if he doesnt swing that arm then maybe hes fine but again you see the Panthers trying to take the ball to the basket not simply relying on the three sixpoint lead for pit weve played five minutes here at Cameron tonight Henson step away three is good pair of triples for Blake Henson hes got six the lead back to nine for Cel team filipowski on the drive skips it for Proctor a three spins away Henson the rebound Henson has knocked down both of his threes West Carrington launches thats a two on the line and pit one and done Foster all the way to the basket boy Wes it seems like Carrington or excuse me Hinson is involved in every defensive play hes got to be really careful that he doesnt pick up that second foul yeah he and federo with one each heres leot beating McCain off the dribble against Proctor and hell draw the foul from Proctor pits initiated to go to the basket here paying off Wes I think its an entirely different approach than we saw in the first game but the Panthers have decided theyre going to attack the basket theyre going to try to get in the lane and theyre going to try to score inside the threepoint Arc which is uncharacteristic for them ishma leot from Prince Georges County Maryland transfer from Rhode Island only had two points in the first meeting 12 days ago he is the fourth best free throw shooter in the ACC and I said it after the first one yes you did yes you did hes missed seven free throws in 50 tries and you see Austin and feder Rico come out of the ball game and for the first time tonight we get a look at guo Diaz Graham who had started the last seven for Coach Cel and the second one by leged is good for his first Point Duke is just one of their first eight from the floor now theyre one of their first a West but here you see Hinson match up against filipowski and that is a dangerous matchup for the pit Panthers power has also checked in for Duke young freshman here he is left corner free ball away and it bounds off and Carrington collects skip for low he will launch from L left and itll hit the top of the glass and bounce away well once it hit the shot clock W it was a dead ball yeah but it had a lot of drama yes it did have drama and it would have been very interesting it would been on Highlights everywhere if it drops in the basket fair enough uh without Mitchell and without roach tonight John CH indicated us hey look our deps going to be tested here a little bit the bench is going to be important youre seeing power here early Ryan young relatively early Jeff CES responded will Jeffers has checked into the ball game wearing 24 for the Panthers to join Diaz Graham and Jeffers is now matched up against filipowski heres Proctor on the Skip and the three is good Tyrese Proctors 19th three of the year his seventh in ACC play thats a really good twoman game with filipowski and Proctor yep he survived the one of 10 performance in Road games at Notre Dame and pit but Proctors got a pretty good shooting eye when it comes to playing a camera sevenpoint lead were seven minutes in the Panthers the ball five to shoot here is low taking Blakes the soft floater is good for jayen low and jayen low is one of those guys whos really developed as the season has gone on West hes played pretty well recently lead back to nine Philip palowski Jeff capable holds both arms up in the air is almost to say hey guys we ought to gear down here a little bit want to make sure you get good shots and you dont want to be get involved in a track meet against Duke particularly not in this building low left of the lane filipowski the rebound Dan 611 and handles it like hes 61 look at this all the way in stripped out of there by legot and then Diaz Graham raped across to commit the foul and that will be the first on guo and the third on the Panthers and this is a situation where Proctor gets it back to filipowski the defense goes to cover him and so Proctors wide open thats just a nice job between those two guys then we said the Panthers theyre trying to get the ball in the lane and low very nice little lefthanded push shot there yep against a really good defender in Blakes theres a block by Austin on the shot by power off the Applause inbounds McCain picks up low heres Leed off a Applause screen back to Jaylen low Diaz Graham going to help does with five to shoot theyll skip it jeffris thought about it low deep three from the front hit the rim crocked to the rebound thats really good defense that time the Duke defense didnt allow the Panthers to penetrate filipowski and a foul going to be taken by low and thatll get us to the Under 12 timeout so the Freshman from Texas will draw his first pit with a ninepoint lead first half continues from Cameron in a moment to Fed Rico to start the game and then the pass for an easy play by Hinson so after those two assists okay now hes going to shoot the ball and this is what weve seen from him getting the ball into the lane hes missed one threepointer but otherwise hes getting into the middle of the lane and hes scoring on those short jump shots tell you what hes got one of the more fascinating ties to the game Jaylen Lowes Godfather is John Lucas II and John Lucas II son is Jay Lucas who sitting on the Duke bench with John sh how about that Duke with the ball Foster will trigger the inbounds and filipowski with Diaz Graham defending tough match up for guo but pit managed to scrape that out of there I thought Austin came in with a nice job helping out leg it all the way to the basket tapped home guo Diaz Graham Wes that was just all l Drew all the Defenders and nobody was there to block out Diaz Graham who doesnt do a lot of his scoring from the inside lead is 11 for pit with nine minutes gone in this first half Foster a standing three got it Caleb Foster Dan when it leaves its hand you think its going to burn up on reentry to the basket absolutely Wes but when hes got time to set his feet like that you just have the feeling that everyones going in the basket just a gorgeous Stroke by the young man from Harrisburg North Carolina eightpoint lead that ball got thrown by Henson I think at The Rim in hopes of a lob heres McCain a three now all of a sudden the Blue Devils dialing it up from behind the line first it was Foster and then the California freshman McCain bangs one home well the Blue Devils have cut the pit lead to five at 216 and Dan there four for nine from three here in this first half well so when when you get wide open threes that was a great pass but here in transition again pit cant turn it over you turn it over like they did on that law pass bounced off the rim its a long rebound and particularly in this building the Blue Devils shoot the three extremely well in transition Duke has six points and 26 seconds and just like that just a fivepoint pit lead after Jeff cable timeout here is Henson working against McCain Shawn Stewart is coming to the Ball Game The Freshman from windir Florida he helped with a double team and then young blocked it out of bounds he thought he blocked it off Hensons head Ryan litigated for a possession that belonged to Duke and instead John Gaffney who works with Ron Grover and Clarence Armstrong said no well keep it here Ryan Wes I think its a good idea to try to post Hinson up on the inside but keep in mind that Hinson in ACC play in five games only has two assists when the ball goes into him hes going to try to score Carrington all the way around couldnt finish Austin they dont know the shot clocks going to expire and theres the shot clock violation ball never did hit the rim on the original Drive the ball never hit the rim and then Duke never ever got possession of it so it was a it was pit was the team in possession the entire time fivepoint lead for pit young playing with the explosive jph Stewart whos on the floor for Coach Les all of a sudden this is reminiscent of the first game against pit when Duke really lit it up from three in the first half Proctor again cuts it to Applause two heres Leed in trouble Austin firing away feder Rico couldnt get to it heres Proctor and the Blue Devils can lead with a three tie with a two McCain tries to beat Leed into traffic that got blocked out of there and finally feder Ricos got it pit trying to turn the floor here is Carrington scooping for Henson layup good eight for Blake Henson on his third field Applause goal and Pitch shows you that if Dukes going to turn it over they can get it around and turn it into offense very quickly sure can Foster now young burrowing down on feder Rico back the other way nicely done Ryan young doesnt score much but he scores enough Dan yeah he does West and he does it the oldfashioned way hes just a back to the basket Banger inside excellent Passer First twopoint basket of the ball game for Duke and lean has it rattle out at the head of the circle mcain trying to flip a screen young skips for Proctor for the lead and its a Applause wedgie possession favors Duke Yep this is Young you see no help is coming and hes just able to bull his way into the lane feder Rico 220 lbs is not really strong enough to keep him out of there if hes going to have that many dribbles but hes hard to double team as he just showed you hes an excellent passer 20 to shoot for Duke off the reset Applause McCain tend to shoot Proctor on the drive fouled and its going to be on Carrington itll be the first on the Freshman from Baltimore it is the fifth on pit free throws and a chance to tie for Proctor when we in the first half Wes theyve done a great job moving the basketball theyre getting wide open threes its not like these have been contested they made nine first half threes against the Panthers 10 days ago and they are on Pace to do that again today I mean some of them have been in transition the Panthers have turned the ball over a couple of times and that has led to a couple of Threes yep Proctor going to go to the line hes got two threes Fosters got a couple and McCains added the fifth and you can see the damage has been done from the free throw line and the threepoint line and the Panthers whove made five of their first six have only made four of their last 13 and theyve turned the ball over a couple times theyve missed their last four threepoint attempts that is seven now for Proctor in the ball game Tyrese just the fourth sophomore captain at Duke and he hits both here won you get the idea that hes sort of rounding into form yep he struggled with injuries but at his size and his skill set hes a guy who can dominate a game from the guard position ties a game at 23 Carrington and the Panthers all the way through heres low off to a terrific start in his Cameron debut well great job by the Duke defense Carrington shoots over young but misses pit tried to get the ball in the lane couldnt do it and then were forced to settle for a long three yep and Carrington has struggled shooting the three in conference play Kick Out Foster heres McCain long three for the lead six for McCain hes got two threes Fosters got two threes Proctors got two threes but the ball goes in and out side to side west it forces the defense to collapse and you get a wideopen opportunity Carrington the drive kick out Austin a shot fake and a two rattles in for Zack Austin from Winston Salem a transfer from high point where he was all big South and he has been playing better as well Wes it just takes a while to adjust from the level of the Big South to the level of the Atlantic Coast Music Conference heres young with PTO Rico defending 12 to shoot fights through and travel Wes he took that a little too far and the pit Panthers they you can see theyre not going to help down on young nor should they because hes such a good passer dont forget double header of womens basketball for you tomorrow right here on acc Network get you start at noon Reynolds Coliseum number four NC State welcomes Duke then at 200 well take the trip down I40 Louisville and Carolina presented by Food Lions Sunday double header of the women on accet work and always available on the ESPN app Fall Away Carrington and pit back in front second field goal for Bob Carrington hes got six in the first half and Carrington makes that shot with a very very high degree of efficiency pH lowski threw it away tried to go to Proctor deflected heres low going all the way down the scoop on Foster and it rolls off the front of the rim feder Rico volley balled it up in the air but it didnt go and Ryan young I think has lost a contact and pit has got the basketball on the turnover its three away from Henson is good you figure young could see him out there that was good very good 3026 and a time has been stopped by Ron Grover for Ryan young to get the contact may be taken care of here its a 7 nothing run by the Panthers and Blake got a little better Vibe about his game tonight than maybe hes had in the last four well hes hit all three of his threepoint attempts two of the rim transition and here the Duke manager saving the day they went out there and they found the contact lens well Blake Henson last four games averaging 13 points shooting just 29 from the floor 26 from three tell you what Ryan young got the saline and it was was right back to work and theres the look at Blake hinsons nonconference and Conference numbers Dan and its just you know when when youre and his hes like made almost two fewer per game himself and he is a guy thats got to score for pit and you see those numbers in the nonconference thats what they need from him and just not there in conference games now of course everybody who plays pit goes into the game Thinking weve got to stop Henson that hes the guy got to control and so far that strategy has worked but hes had a really good start tonight second Team all ACC a year ago preseason all ACC this year pit won 24 games a year ago went to the NCAA tournament heres McCain a three back rim Miss leg at the Applause rebound ahe of five minutes to go in Carrington working against filipowski tough match up for the Freshman there but filipowski moves his feet very well Le it La better Rico somehow got it at home second field goal for the Junior from Finland and thats something that we did not see from the Panthers in their first match up against two theyve been trying to get the ball to the big guy on that screen and roll situation sixpoint lead again for pit heres Proctor on the drive layup good Tyrese Proctor now starting to initiate a little bit of offense to try and get the Blue Devils grooved won when the ball moves around the perimeter like that inside and then around its hard for the defense to react you not only get open threes but you get great driving LS heres Carrington lob again and feder Rico caught it and flushed it six for feder Rico Federico sixpoint game and that that drive down in the Middle with that screen in the middle of the Court Georgia Tech used that against Duke very effectively and pit is trying the same formula here in the first half filipowski thought about it skip for foster shot fake step in two good for the rookie I really like Caleb Foster Dan Well w that was one he saw Leed flying at him just let him fly by took one dribble and knocked it down he looks very comfortable out there sure does leg hell fire away at the top back rim Miss and a new 20 Welly Hinson thought about it he sure did didnt he standing in the logo out there on Coach K Court spinning on young got him to the ground and Le it finishes and thats taking advantage of the mismatch when theres switches going on the guards have to take advantage by driving the ball to the basket the big guys have to get inside sixpoint game again filipowski had it poked away Lega tried to save it and did to Carrington heres Carrington lob feder Rico the catch put it on the deck and travel Wes he needs to catch that and just put it right in the basket thatll get us a timeout 258 to go in this first half and Federico Federico on the back end of the lob from Carrington Pittsburgh leads Duke by six at camp Music screen and then come right down here and the guy I wants you to watch is right here Caleb Foster so lets see what happens here why is feder Rico so open now right there young has to commit this way heres Foster standing right here hes got to get in front of feder Rico because if he doesnt then this is what happens and you alluded to this its kind of a play that Damon sty and Georgia Tech had success with last week I think it was Bayan Dongo on the back end of a couple of lobs for the jackets right well the the the guard has real a real decision to make he cannot throw that lob pass until Ryan young fully commits and thats what happened that time and if Ryan young doesnt commit then low or Carrington whoevers driving in there has to be willing to stop and shoot the jumper terrific playmaking by pit sixpoint lead for the Panthers heres filipowski working against feder Rico backs down now turns over the right hand and scores Kyle filipowski now first field goal Dan comes with 233 to go in the first half just his six points feder Rico can well nobody can nobodys going to guard filipowski that close to the basket when hes got that much time and iss able to take that many dribbles Jaylen Blakes back in the ball game he threw the assignment on Carrington into the front court now Shan Stewart has come back as well as Carrington works against the freshman and now we get a whistle and a foul off the ball on Blakes again you have that screen and roll situation you have the screen theres the switch Blakes is matched up against feder Rico and hes trying to push him out and gets called for the foul four fouls on Duke here in this first half five on pit Roo inside matched up against Blakes now switches with filipowski there goes leg it through hell scoop it away for Austins three bounds away slapped off the glass feder Ricos got it Carrington fast ball high to Leed who Flags it down thats some catch sure was heres leot on the drive hell feed it to Austin right hand push is good Zack Austin with four terrific penetration on the drive by Leed wasnt the prettiest play in the world but it worked Philip palowski guns one for Proctor and another three and heres Henson with the long rebound tell you what underneath the goal is not for the meek tonight by the way no and Hinson now with five rebounds West heres Carrington with the shot clock at 12 filipowski on the switch defends Carrington hell take it all the way through got to the base line now scoop with the left hand what a great job by filipowski to move his feet and just stay in front youre not shooting over Philipi McCains three and another rebound for Hinson Dan On The Backs side Hinson has played very well Wes and its amazing how much better you feel when your first couple of shots go down hit a team thats lost two straight and four their last five theyre one and five in the ACC got a road win at Louisville heres Carrington another Runner with the right hand and an offensive foul will be called on the Freshman hell become the first player in the ball game with two itll be six on pit with 33 seconds to go here in the first half this is a situation West where hes got Blakes in front of him what Stewart helping out well if but with Blakes is standing there Wes what you have to do is jump stop and make a pass or shoot the jumper but Stuart Stewart was there too helping out and Blakes just set up thats a call you dont see very often this year turnovers the fifth in the first half for pit whos got a sixpoint lead and Proctor going to work this all the way down filipowski going to come help with a screen switched to feder Rico Proctor the dance in the three power the rebound and the stick back Reston the amazing thing about that is thats powers first twopoint basket this year 3834 despite the bucket at the Panthers with the ball 26 meeting all time dates back to 1938 next door at ard Jim when they played for the first time heres feder Rico hard to the basket blocked by filipowski or at least blocked enough that it didnt go down well and that counts Wes y filipowski got a hand on it feder Rico not strong enough to force it in he walked young did start and travels and starts the second half with filipowski so Duke sizes up here with John absolutely they have made an adjustment because pit with those TW we showed you theyve got 20 inside points and Duke is trying to correct that issue Carrington into traffic skipped to the corner Austin thought about it tend to shoot for the Panthers Austin trying to get Baseline with five to shoot now Henson launching over McCain and he hits Blake Henson now with 14 and thats the kind of shot that Blake Henson makes when hes playing really really well and that is not a good sign for the blue devil filipowski trying to post up Henson and is going to pay for it with his second foul rot Gro off the Baseline tags Hinson with his second first of the half on the Panthers now Hinson has some deep deep range and he is way out there and hes got to let that one go Wes because the shot clock was expiring and hes letting the Duke students know a little bit well Blake Henson is one of those guys he thrives in the other guys place doesnt he and the more you woof at him hell turn and woof at you terrific guy whos unbelievable athleticism heres filipowski against feder Rico and blocked from behind I think Clarence Armstrong Austin or feder Rico it is on feder Rico itll be his second second quickly on the Panthers to start the second half and thatll put Philip palski at the line Wes and you can see in on this play feder Rico simply doesnt have the strength to stop filipowski from getting to the basket when two big guys meet like that and John Gaffney talking with Clarence Armstrong here somebody bleeding young maybe perhaps yep Ryan young will have to come visit with longtime Duke basketball trainer Jose fona now give them 20 seconds to get this straightened out and if they cant yep dont forget we got gymnastics for you on acc Network tomorrow afternoon Pittsburgh visits number 19 Clemson at Little John Coliseum coverage starts at 4 right here on accn and streaming live on the ESPN app thats a first year gymnastic program down in Clemson this year off to a great start must not been a lot of blood there because Ryan young he was obviously the guy bleeding but he came over and just wiped his mouth with a towel and then hes fine looks like a little bloody lip as our ACC Network crew Zooms in on young free throw by filipowski is a front rep Miss thats his first Miss from the line tonight Wes mm and in conference play he was under 60 second one ready and thats good seven now for flip he hes been active inside with thats the fifth time in this game that hes been fouled sixpoint lead for the Panthers Carrington with Proctor defending tried to fire it through and turned it over to Foster too long a pass Foster on the drive and blocked out of there by Austin and a block called on Carrington will be his third and the Third on pit this is great reaction by the Duke defense that is just too long a pass you got to throw that up in the air to the big guy Foster moves very quickly we showed you on the last play or a play in the first half when Foster didnt move to cut off uh feder Rico but he did that time Foster first free throw good Caleb Foster is one of these guys with a free throw percentage of 60 hes now 19 of 31 at the line he just doesnt have enough attempts hes got too good a stroke to be a 60 free throw shooter is what Im getting at a guy who can shoot like that youre absolutely right Wes I mean the net barely moves 4137 fourpoint game pits up the three from Henson in this second half heres feder Rico skip for legot thought about it step in two rattles in for ishma legett thats a good decision there Wes back to a sixpoint Advantage Proctor in this twoman game with poor and filipowski has been really effective and now theyll try and get it to Young almost too hot to handle out front for filipowski tend to shoot hell launch on the three and hit second field goal for filipowski four in the half 10 in the game now for the 7ot sophomore Westtown New York who had 26 in the first meeting on 11 to 12 shooting you just cannot give him that much room Beyond The Applause Arc Henson now feder Rico and the hit offense at 25 ft here with 10 on the shot clock this is great defense theres low he had a great first half tried to finish that too strong off the back iron Foster filipowski and going to be called a foul going to be called Jeff cable thought it was a travel and instead Zack Austin his first thats the fourth on Applause pick filipowski gets in there he stops yeah you know you can he can see coach yep sure can heres young Proctor threepoint lead for the Panthers paror lost the handle on it got to the Baseline tried to throw it out of bounds John Gaffney went down in the corner its going to stay with Duke with nine to sh shoot is Gaffney okay hope Bo went down in the photographers lap hes trying to get out of the way did he catch something in the ear there think hes okay well the ball went off leg it hit Leed out of bounds and so thats the first time its out of bounds the balls out of bounds when it hits something out of bounds and it leg 9 seconds on the shot clock John ended up in the lap of longtime ACC photographer Robert Crawford on the Baseline down there and I think I hope Johns okay yeah I think he Applause is Proctor working on leg it thats an offensive foul thatll be the second on Proctor the sophomore from New South Wales in Australia nice job first of the half on pit nice job by legga moving his feet and its the foul there because that arm goes Applause out so its a threepoint Applause game Dukes extending their pressure yeah pits really having a hard time getting started in their offense last Touch by young as he red it away from loow but thats what theend did successfully in the first half they got the ball into the lane the Duke pressure has pushed out here to start the second half and made it more difficult for that dribble drive low for feder Rico the catch and flush feder Rico feder Ricos got eight now the lead back to five and thats what you have to do with him throw the ball up and a hand check on feder Rico is going to be his third thatll be the fifth on pit here in the second half this just a great throw on the inside you throw it up there and neither McCain or Proctor can get it and Federico doesnt bring it back down he just takes it right back up and dunks it so Jeff cable has to take feder Rico out and thatll bring guo Diaz gram ring 25 for the Panthers back on the floor from tenar and the Canary Islands McCain fouled by Austin and thats six now on pit and for Austin what now and Austin draws his third I think Blake Hinson is going to be very fortunate that he do get something called on him so second on Austin six however on pit and here goes McCain to the line and now Austin gets the technical W he was asking for that excuse me not Austin but Henson so Hensons coming out of the ball well this is the play Hinson is trying to talk to his teammates and McCain walks into them and theres a little bit of a dust up and then Hinson turns and starts gesturing to the fans so theres the technical foul and by my count thats the third Henson now I dont know that he got the technical there Wes he said something to somebody and it wasnt the fans three on Music Henson and now pit has three with three as McCain hits the back end won that thats a serious problem for the Panthers because Hinson is a guy that all the defensive energy is devoted to he just keeps talking and whos he talking to I dont know I dont know but he comes out of the ball game but the officials heard something they didnt like right so McCain 84 at the line hit one of two a moment ago and now these are the two shots on the original fou yes thats correct you shoot the technical shots first and then you pick it up where you left off and the the foul was on Zach Austin first of two here so just to catalog this three on Carrington three on Henson three on feder Rico heres the way it sets on The Ledger for Jeff capable McCain has eight and a chance to draw Duke to within two and does and West Duke has been doing it like pit did in the first half driving the ball into the lane the Panthers have fouled Duke has gotten to the free throw line and the Panthers really have a problem now with so many guys in foul trouble Diaz great trying to help leot jeffris is on the floor to replace Henson leot got caught in the air heres Austin now for low tend to shoot hell Beat Foster to the paint fall away is no good and the rebound for the Freshman Stewart McCain on the drive Fall Away tie game 11 now for Jared McCain and this is a situation Wes where the Panthers really have to show some points you feel a run coming from the Blue Devils heres leot on the drive and one for ishmail leot well that is one tough move there seven now for leot hes pits leading score in the second half so McCain gave him the lead briefly and then at the other end the foul on Proctor and leot fires pit back in front well Blake Hensons back on the floor for pit and we were trying to see if we could find what uh West cost him the technical he and McCain are talking to one but watch here the referee is looking right at him and listening to the conversation and and then Ron grber just pulls the trigger yeah there you go so I I dont know what he said it must have been some sort of a magic word though and heres the foul problem this is really a issue for pit because Carrington and Hinson are their two leading scores so heres legot to try and finish the an one and cannot missed the free throw well that was a big bass now the Panthers have to dig in on the defensive end and lets see if they go right after Hinson Hensons pits leading score hes got 14 tonight Diaz Graham with filipowski handling backs down lost it momentarily and then fires to Stewart who had it blocked and fouled by Diaz Graham second on guo Seventh on the Panthers with 1457 to go Dan Laughter pH I hope you like free throws yeah filipowski just bowled his way into the lane thats a really good dump off right there to Stewart Sean Stewarts just five of nine at the free throw line hell get two shots here and the free throw no good dont forget tonight after the game Kelsey rigs has National Champion Luke Hancock National Champion Carlos Boozer and the Hall of Fame and National Championship coach Jim beheim in studio for nothing but that late night Chronicle the day in the ACC what a interesting day its been Stewart missed both fre throws and theres a foul on Blakes reaching through itll be the second on Blakes and third on Duke of the half I mean wins today what a shot by Kadir copelan Syracuse to beat Miami at the horn Virginia Tech the road win in Raleigh Wake Forest put 90 on the board and hit 18 threes in Winston Salem and Virginia finally won on the road yeah Pete Georgia attack by nine in Atlanta and Clemson a road win against Florida State there is leot firing all the way through on the drive hes got six and a half nine in the ball game and the lead back to four for pit so with the crowd going crazy Duke K just tied the game Leed has just made two really really tough plays to put the Panthers back up by four Foster working against Henson three ball got it five in the half 13 in the ball game now for Caleb Foster and again Henson has those three personal fouls West so its going to be really difficult for him to guard out there leit spinning on Blakes into traffic turned it over to filipowski Blakes now took the contact couldnt finish the shot but hell get a couple at the line on Carringtons fourth that is four on Bob Carrington with 56 to go now hinsons got to be worried about Foster driving by him so hes got to play off and Foster recognizes that and just buries the three and Carrington picking up that fourth personal foul when pit has turned it over Duke has been able to get out and run and that has been a problem for the Panthers Jaylen Blakes first free throw of the night is his first point started for the third time in his Duke career tonight did Blakes out of some Somerset New Jersey as you see Carrington to the pit bench with just better than 6 minutes gone in the second half on his fourth foul Blakes hit them both and were back to Duke back to a onepoint lead again 50 to 49 and of course Blakes is starting because roach cant go yeah roach and Mitchell tonight and theres a foul on Blakes in the midcourt area thats his third four on Duke John Shys telling him yes pressure the ball but we dont need a foul just as hes dribbling the ball across half court Diaz Graham for low trying to get rid of it Jaylen picked up on his dribble shoots it out front Austin heres Henson with McCain defending Henson at the front oh my goodness he drills a three how did that one go in the b 17 for Blake Henson pit back in front of bucket you know theres theres tough shots and then theres impossible shots Foster this is the same situation we just had trying to work on Henson kept his hands up forced the Miss Diaz Graham the rebound that is a great job by Hinson just moving his feet staying in Applause front low couldnt get by filipowski Henson a catch and shoot got it Blake Henson now with 20 Dan and he hadnt missed from three six out of six from out there nine in the second half on three triples and a timeout taken by Duke so Blake Henson has stepped up what a line drive at the head of the circle look at this one somehow someway and and this is a no doubter right here Hensons got 20 pits got a fivepoint lead at Cameron its blackburg Earl grants team at the castle at 900 Tuesday night all for you on accn and streaming live on the ESPN app Blake Hensons got 20 or more in a game for the eighth time this year Dan for the third time in ACC play and Pittsburghs got a fivepoint lead here at camperon this has been a very gritty performance by the pit Panthers they shot the ball well jumped out to that 11o lead 11point lead but Duke has battled back and taken the lead a couple of times and each time the Panthers have responded inbounds Proctor for foster with young filipowski and McCain on the floor for Coach shy Diaz Graham low Austin leot and Hinson out there for pit and an offensive foul on Ryan on filipowski rather and filipowski needs to be careful hes pretty upset thats his second its the fifth on Duke and I both of the guys sort of lost their balance and filipowski arm flies out there and as weve said before when that arm flies out there thats an automatic Panthers the fivepoint lead they are seven of 10 from the floor in the second half low cant find a route Diaz Graham a high arcing three Henson slaps it out pit gets a press 20 and McCain is almost faceu guarding Hinson now theyre going to do everything they can to keep the ball out of his hands Jaylen low with seven to shoot with filipowski defending try to beat the big guy of the basket a little soft Fall Away rattled off and Austin got his hand in the net thats basket interference even though the shot didnt go they stopped the play and now well get to the Under 12 timeout breaking the action at Cameron Saturday night ACC basketball continues in a moment get it going if the Panthers were going to have a chance and boy has he gotten it going west hes made all six of his threepoint attempts some of them easy some of them hard but Blake Hinson is a guy who can make tough shots and when he gets hot he is very difficult to stop and hes got the Panthers rolling if you saw the first meeting 12 days ago you wouldnt recognize this game now no absolutely not but Wes the other thing you have to also say is that while as well as the Panthers have played Duke is playing without Jeremy roach and without Mark Mitchell and those are two guys who averaged 30 points a game together for the Blue Devils in ACC Play Foster McCain Proctor filipowski and Ryan young so the Blue Devil size back up here out of the timeout and keep in mind Hinson has those three personal fouls young trying to post him up inside Proctor winding through to the foul line missed everything young tried to save it young did save it off of Henson didnt he kick save and ab by Blake Henson well Henson was laying out of bounds he was halfway in and halfway out and again the balls out of bounds when it touches something out of bounds and it touched Hinson who was out of bounds heres Young on the cut and the score second field goal for grad student Ryan young Wesson its interesting Duke has made eight threepoint baskets thats their seventh twopoint field goal and filipowski is limping out there yep I dont did he twist an ankle here oh yes yes o and remember Duke I mean they they they dont have a lot of guys and so this could really be a problem yeah Mitchell and roach not playing as Dan told you a moment ago its been Stewart and power off the bench for John Shire tonight Jaylen Blakes got the start and filipowski is trying to lace up his shoe a little bit tighter to go and he says hes good and he tells Ron gr Im good to go theres a look at not only Mitchell and roach but also christien Reeves whos now missed tonight his 11th game in a row after a hip injury big 71 sophomore from Charlotte whos kind of had his second campaign here in Durham sidetracked leg it with Proctor defending and McCain is just not leaving Hinson Look at leg it spin through couldnt finish the shot terrific move to get the look heres Proctor and Duke trailing three filipowski now somehow like it is matched up against him yep skips it across McCain for the tie C it Jared McCain eight in the half 14 in the ball game locked up at 55 lets see if the Panthers have another response and hinsons got to move he just cant stand there in the corner low on the drive it rattles off Diaz Graham the rebound Im impressed with Jaylen low tonight Dan Fearless Diaz Graham saw Fall Away how about it guo Diaz Diaz Graham that is his second field goal to the ball game now Four Points pit back in front and if Diaz Graham can score on the inside that really helps the Applause Panthers filipowski heres McCain shot fake got Austin to fly by and McCain hits a two they call it a two John GNE signaling two from across the scores table so were tied at 57 theyre going to look at it I guess during the break well see got a ways to go for the break though yeah they can Hinson is just standing over here in the corner low the Lefty floater so basically with Hinson standing in the corner and McCain standing right next to him theyre basically playing four on four at the moment and Ron grber just swung by the scores table Dan to say were going to look at that 5957 pit back in Applause front nine to go here at Cameron Proctor filipowski thought about it into traffic threw it away to leot pit trying to turn the floor heres leot on the drive and scores terrific second half now 11 for ishmail leet eight in the half on four field goals and filipowski you know he drove in the lane and jumped up in the air and spun around and had no place to go with the ball and Diaz Graham punched it away itll go out of bounds itll stay with Duke with 18 to shoot filipowski thats that may work on the playground but thats tough here and Leed West he makes another tough shot boy leged and Jaylen low have really sparked the perimeter attack tonight for Jeff Cables Panthers and thats been important because remember Carrington hes got those four fouls yep bub still on the bench heres filipowski shooting a three thats good filipowski with 13 now in the ball game thats his second triple of the half so Duke still theyve now got 10 threes and eight twopoint baskets and 8 minutes to play in a onepoint Panther their lead leit with filipowski defending Foster thought about helping and did and knocked it away and theres a foul on leget after the turnover its his first its the ninth on pit and itll get us to a break when we come back the score might be tied its a onepoint lead for pit right now in Duro not Jared McCain hit a two or a three here and I think theyre going to stick with the two which was the call on the floor here well Wes that is really really close its really close and so I think its one of those things that if you called it a three in the first place I dont know that you could change it and if you call it a two I dont know that you can change it just doesnt look like theres anything indisputable there I mean Ive seen tight fits here and theyve called it a two they have called it a two so the score holds its 61 60 and youre not going to see anything closer than that thats right and you know what give them credit where credits do they did everything to exhaust the angles they looked at all the possible options itll still be a twopoint shot for McCain but now Foster is going to the free throw line with a chance to give the Blue Devils the lead yep so the foul was on leot by the way and that puts the Freshman Foster at the line first on ishma leot out of Prince Georges County Maryland and the transfer from Rhode Island a turnover by legot created this opportunity legot tried to force it that time yep first of a couple here for foster whos two for two make it three for three dont forget Wednesday the Huddle crew reveals the 2024 ACC football schedule each team including Cal Stanford and SMU well look at keyweek specific matchups its a 2hour program starts at 5 Eastern right here on acc Network also on E ESPN 2 and the ESPN app Duke in front of Point Foster hit them both and one thing that has happened is Duke has taken Hinson out of the game although McCain is going to pick up a foul trying to guard Hinson going to the goal and the foul on McCain The Freshman from Sacramento will be his first it is six on Duke thats the first time in a while Wes that Hinson has moved on offense yep Austin has come back in the game theyll lob it for feder Rico hes going to wait on help and its low who circles back out s and a half to go its a onepoint Duke Lee heres low teeing up a three got it J shot Jaylen low has got 11 tonight that is his first triple of the ball game hes now in double figures for the third time in the last five Applause games twopoint lead for the Panthers filipowski with fto Rico defending Henson stood took it blocked thats four on Henson and the goal gives Duke the tie fourth on Henson is the 10th on the Panthers Philip house the basket in one Dan well heres the original play the switch not bad defense by Young now the question is youve got to be in position before the offensive player plants his foot before he leaves the floor and Hinson was just a little late Philip palski at the line now hes got his fourth field goal now 16 points hes six of seven at the line Duke in front under seven to go with Applause Cameron and Lows been the guy sure has here he is on the drive again got caught in traffic Scoops it up lefthanded wont go feder Rico had it rolls to the ground and young took it from him but ended up sliding into the pit bench crossing the near sideline so itll go back to the Panthers that was some play by Young because he sort of Dove like over top of feder Rico lots of times the guy will get a foul landing on top but watch Young he flies over the top although he does go out of bounds so 31 on the shot Applause clock and Jaylen low is going to put it in play Jeff capable having a long discussion with Clarence Armstrong and Ron G R concerning something here and grs going to tell Jaylen you have to stand out of get out of B play yeah theres a l for feder Rico now for Henson catch for three and good he does it again sure does 23 now for Henson hes got six threes in the ball game the lead back to two or be you pardon seven seven threes in the ball game and turned over by the Blue Devils low into the front Court Austin will try Rim off low or leg at the rebound put it back up got knocked down no whistle heres Duke in transition McCain for foster now filipowski feder Rico plays with three out front Foster Applause terrific look absolutely a great look and a really nice job by Duke to create that opportunity expect Foster to make that one five and a half to play at Applause Cameron six to shoot for low trying to drive by filipowski all the way through out front Austin with the shot clock going off an air ball this once again you have to be impressed with filipowski ability to move his feet and defend a guard whos trying to get past him filipowski just never gave up on the play low gets on the side and filipowski just moves and creates a tough passing Lane 6765 pit Blue Devils won 12 days ago 75 53 it was kind of over before it ever got started young in traffic traveled with it backing down hell turn it over see and theres Hinson standing underneath the basket doing a little dance and you know I dont know that you want to draw the attention of the officials again you already got one technical foul well the next one will be your fifth in the showers right yes absolutely I mean I know hes exuberant thats one of the things that makes him such an interesting guy but you got to be careful heres Henson with Proctor defending Henson into a double team with filipowski fallway was well short terrific Twan defense by Duke there the double team really worked heres Foster Proctor hell shoot for the lead and Austin the rebound and he got fouled on the play I think thats seven on Duke so hell be shooting thats on young Wes once again we see when Hinson does get the ball in the low post hes not looking to pass it hes looking to shoot it so Zach Austins going to go to the line the red shirt transfer a junior classification from Winston Salem hes got six in the ball game he is a 75 free throw shooter pit only took one free throw in the first half they were one for two Dan this is just their second attempt and its a one and one for Austin he knocks it down the young man all big South at High Point a year ago averaged 14 points he wears number 55 to honor his mom who passed away at 55 and he got both free throws there well hes had a solid game tonight Wes made some defensive plays play got a couple of rebounds lead is four feder Rico filipowski ran him into a screen Fires for three Carrington now on the floor with four the rebound for pit so pit has Carrington on the FL with four and Hinson also has four Applause yep tend to shoot heres Carrington foul line fall away and bat around Proctor the rebound feder Rico hit the deck heres Proctor front Court Duke Trails four filipowski the three in transition and young the rebound and a foul on feder Rico will be his fourth so the foul on feder Rico is going to get us to break 335 to play free throws for the Blue Devils two of them on every common foul the rest of the way both Duke Gams this has been as gritty a game as Dan you and I have seen this year fourpoint lead for pit trying to stun number seven Duke last time the Panthers won it Cameron Tim gerich was coaching them Dan they beat number three duke 7169 that was February 10th 1979 last time they beat Duke was three years ago yesterday at the Peterson Event Center 7973 Blake Henson has been the star tonight 23 third time hes gone 20 or more in the ACC this year heres Ryan young at the line and a chance to snap a Duke drought the Blue Devils havent had any points in the last seven minutes and the free throw good 100 39th Collegiate game tonight for Ryan young and Ryan young just doing what he does I mean hes in there battling for the rebound 24yearold native Stewartsville New Jersey started his career at Northwestern second year here at Duke twopoint lead for pit the basketball Henson heres feder Rico Carrington had a very quiet night not anymore wow three ball from Carrington gives him nine and Carrington is a guy Wes who has really struggled shooting the three in ACC play thats his first one tonight that is a big basket pushes it back to a fivepoint Panther lead Proctor remember Carrington plays with four heres McCain against Austin into traffic now Foster a triple to answer and Foster but out of bounds was low he threw it off a low think Carrington telling Ron gr sos Jaylen low but itll stay with the Blue Devils in a new shot clock well thats one that low should have tried to get and Carrington young just backs off on the screen that that they were supposed to switch and he didnt this is one where low backs off oh hes on the ground yeah hes out of bounds now you cant review that because were not on under two minutes right thats a Miss by this crew here in Dura but he was out of bounds before he threw the ball heres McCain the scoop and the score terrific move by Jared McCain hes got 18 now a dozen in the second half Duke to within three with two and 1 half to play feder Rico now Carrington Applause Carrington working on young twopoint shot too strong feder Rico tried to keep it alive McCains got it Duke can tie with a three thats good defense by Young forcing just shot over top Proctor for filipowski now double team coming hell roll into traffic dump it for young Bur goes up and feder Rico I think got a piece of it and another rebound by Hinson whos had a good night on the boards too and Jeff capable wants a timeout he brought low into the front court and now the pit coach and Duke grad native of fville and part of basketball royalty if you want to know the truth the capable coaching tree and of course both these teams tonight continuing to raise awareness of ALS that took Jeffs father from us a few years ago that dreaded L Gs disease and John shy and Jeff cable came together not only they do it for the first meeting 12 gays to go Dam both these schools wearing Hoops for ALS shirts tonight to continue to call to this dreaded disease we saw some folks here from the ALS Center at Duke University honored during the course of our game its just a terrific collaborative effort on behalf of these coaches and these programs well of course John sh and Jeff capable worked together for a long time they friends yep and terrific competitors here tonight and no surprise in that vain either no R you talked about the grittiness of this game and both of those guys gritty applies to them Carrington now for Henson heres feder Rico handing for Carrington Proctor trying to help Blakes is there too Austin the screen now filipowski lob feder Rico the catch he lost it and were going to get a foul called Clarence Armstrong defers to John Gaffney I think they got Proctor it is on Proctor and thats his fourth foul West this is a very difficult pass right there feder Rico does does a nice job making the catch holding his pivot foot oh its on Blakes I thought okay as I looked at that replay I thought Blakes is the more likely candidate it is four on Blakes on Blakes okay now feder Rico federo is 18 of 42 at the line this year Dan one of eight in ACC play yep so this is not an ideal situation for the Panthers born in Egypt raised in F missed it and now you got to dig in defensively threepoint Applause game 75 seconds to go at Cameron McCain on the drive challenges and scores 20 for McCain now and a timeout taken by John shy with 107 to play in pit leading 7271 he wants to do some offense defense substitution hes going to want to put Blakes back in the game terrific second half for Jared McCain Dan wow McCain really has done a nice job West reading this defense he sees hes matched up against Diaz Graham on that play Then he reads the defense hes got an open three he lets the defender fly by now that was a two hes got Hinson he knows Hinson has to be careful so he drives it to the basket hes done a great job getting the ball to the goal thats the last play and Jared McCain 14 in this second half well hes been big in the second half Wes and this is a night where even though filipowski has 16 he has not been the dominant force that hes been the last couple of games but McCain with 20 Foster with 15 Proctor with 10 theyve all picked up the slack and again its we have to remind you again no roach no Mitchell tonight yep 35 in the ball game 21 in the second half McCain and Foster together onepoint lead for Duke bit seemingly had answers tonight for Duke on these runs whos the guy that takes the big shot now is it Henson the games leading score heres low with 10 to shoot hell fire and hit Jay low 14 tonight for low and two huge threes 7571 Blue Devils probably have to attack here and the ball hit hit the sideline right in front of the Blue Devil bench with 336 left after jayen low has hit two enormous threes Dan here in this second half well the officials are talking about this they ruled it was pits ball and low youre right Wes hes really played a solid game tonight Austin to put it in play in front of the Blue Devil bench got to get it in bounds hell burn a timeout pit will have one to go and so Jeff capable will go back to the drawing board ninth time this year by the way pits hit 10 or more threes in a ball Music game Panthers have 10 tonight as do the Blue Devils these two teams are 20 45 from three in the ball game so if youre Jeff cable here you got one timeout John sh as you see hes got one timeout and get a look at our game reset double bonus for Duke one and one for pit here which is why Jeff Cables trying to put his best free throw shooters in the game mhm you know theyve got Henson and four guards in the game thats because theyre looking to get the ball in bounds and they figure theyre going to have to go to the free throw line and as you pointed out Wes its a one andone yep for the Panthers but the first thing you have to do is get the ball in bounds right and again this is this is a hard place to throw the ball in right here and obviously you cant move if youre the inbounder yeah Dukes got eight fouls and double bonus obviously for pit for the blue dos so filipowski is going to defend leot and the inbounds pass here you just got to come hard to the ball legot trying to get it in bounds looking for help and went to Carrington and it got knocked out of bounds off of McCain and theyre going to look at it they are going to look at this and the ruling is that its the Panthers ball and theyre going to go look and see who had touched last so John Gaffney and John shy with a quick conversation well maybe not so quick well yeah good point and so John gaffneys talking to both teams here well who touched the ball last well Im not sure Carringtons right middle finger little finger Im not sure he ever touched the ball and John Gaffney standing right there looking at it West you know you think in this particular play if he touches es the ball the ball moves I dont think he ever touched it Im not sure he did but well see kind of look at the ball right youre looking almost to see if the ball changes its rotation it doesnt look like it does not it doesnt change its rotation it doesnt change its trajectory and again Wes just as we saw earlier with that weather its a two or a three you have to have indisputable video EDI evidence to change the call and the call is that its pits ball well pits head the lead for better than 34 minutes of this ball game and were down to our final half minute here tonight at Cameron and of course theyve shown the replay we just showed you a moment ago and the crowd here at Cameron reacting well of course they think its their ball so thats the way theyre going to react thats what a good home crowd does absolutely and we got a fourpoint game one more look I I I just dont know that theres enough there West well see its not our decision to make I quit uh I quit hypothesizing this year D my New Years resolution thats your New Years resolution no hypothesizing no hypothesizing yeah and well see what these guys come away with the technology on This Is Amazing by the way well it is Wes and I think weve gone on long enough uh you know if it were up to me there wouldnt be any reviews lets just play so Ron gr John Gaffney having a look of course the crowd here at Camerons convinced that Carrington touched it Jeff Capel and his staff still huddling with pit John Shire and Duke have broken apart here at the bench Ron Grover now lets Clarence Armstrong have a look and Sh is trying to get some degree of a basic interpretation from John Gaffney as to what they have here well everybody wants to know obviously and John Gaffney is kind of explaining to John sh hey look you know what we see the hand we dont see the ball change so and again Clarence Armstrong and Ron Grover checking it twice second time groovers had a long look at a play here in the last what 6 and 12 minutes or so obviously Wes this is a very important call but I think if it takes you this long then the video evidence isnt indisputable right so Ron Gro being the referee and they just want to make sure they see all of them all the the possibilities and all the potentials Dukes got an eight game win streak on the line pits trying to snap a two game losing streak well the guys are going to have to like warm up again and here we go another angle this was super slowmo and extreme close up I just dont think he ever touches the ball Wes I always the only thing Ill tell you is I look to see if the ball changes Direction and I dont see the ball change direction after change direction it doesnt change rotation it its theres nothing there to indicate that Carrington touched the ball right and again its so close that I dont know how you can be sure and if you cant be sure you have to go with the call that has been made so Ron Grover talking to Clarence Applause Armstrong so now theyre looking at the time theyre going to are they going to give the ball to pit or to Duke theyre going to give the ball to Duke I Applause think so this long review and finally theyve gotten to a point where they feel like they can overturn and guessing that Carrington has contact with the ball so now theyre checking how much time should be left right so they want to get the clock right its still a fourpoint pit lead Duke is going to have the ball Baseline at the corner here and 33 four maybe five Dan well see what they come up with 336 when the ball went in bounds and at least three has to come off so its a fourpoint game with 332 left well and the most it can be Wes is 333 right and so Duke will have the ball 332 is where it stays okay all right so Caleb Foster will put it in play everybody needs to do some jumping jacks or something to get warmed up again remember now Carrington Henson feder Rico all on the four on the floor rather with four fouls Fosters got to get it in bounds and almost turned it over heres McCain firing for three off the back iron feder Rico the rebound filipowski the foul and thats not a bad foul Wes its its still a one and one three on flip nine on Duke and feder Rico missed his last free throw and is now one for nine from the line in ACC play and feder Rico was in there simply because it was defense thats it if they could have gotten the rebound and gotten the timeout they could get him out of there so what the Panthers did right there is they bought 7 seconds and one and one for Federico Federico pit tonight at the line its just five for eight how about that well that is a big free throw keeps it a fivepoint game here comes TJ power to replace Jaylen Blakes and hes in to shoot threes absolutely cuz as Dan told you at the end of the first half he has a single twopoint basket on the season yeah he had made nine threes that was his 10th basket on the year and it was a two free throw second one no good so its a fiveo point game heres Foster all the way to the Baseline put it up Carrington fouls him and Bub Carrington has fouled out of the game with nine points and 198 seconds left to go Wesson that was a break for the Panthers even though Carrington gets his fifth personal foul and has to leave the game that ball almost went in the basket that would have been an old fashion threepoint play first foul out of the year in conference play for BB Carrington and its his first disqualification on fouls this season so Carrington has fouled out Foster going to go to the line he is perfect there four for four to shoot two shots and he can cut it to a threepoint game if he hits them both well and you still have feder Rico in the game if youre the Panthers and here comes jayen Blakes for TJ power but he can be subed in its a two shot foul so he comes in after the first shot doesnt he but theyll just go ahead and take care of that maintenance Music here so heres Music Foster a rare Miss well you have feder Rico in there to rebound the ball West but if and here theyre going to send just going to switch Le it and Austin Panthers are going to put Diaz Graham in the game second one by Foster is good so that is now 16 for foster Diaz Graham only a 58 free throw shooter in ACC play but again you have to get the ball in bounds here now he can move inbounds heres low and a quick foul with 179 left so jayen low going to go to the line and the foul is on Caleb Foster its his first but its 10 on Duke so two shots now for pit on every common foul and the Freshman who has hit two huge shots here in the second half from Missouri City Texas goes to the line for pit and a chance to push it Dan hes got two possession game hes got 14 points hes got six assists left it short just his fifth Miss of the year in 19 tries thats his first free throw tonight Wes yep so heres feder Rico back for Diaz Graham still a twopossession game make a miss here and he made it now by making it though its its a fivepoint game so the three has to come into play someplace here heres Foster trying to get to the basket kicks for filipowski hell launch and hit now filipowski now and John shy uses his last timeout I believe here its 7775 and 99 left to go in the ball game at Cameron well its a fivepoint game so youve got to defend the drive to the basket and this is a situation where filipowski just steps back behind the threepoint line everybodys chasing after the guards and they forget about him filipowski is the best threepoint shooter out there hes got 19 tonight thats his third you dont often see a stat like that Blue Devils hit 10 threes against Georgia Tech that was their 11th tonight well Wes the Blue Devils are also 20 and 25 from the line the Panthers only 7even for Music 12 but Wes as you pointed out its the double bonus for both teams so if the Panthers can get the ball in bounds and thats you know a question pit has one timeout left so the first thing you got to do is get it in bounds and then if he get it in bounds Duke is probably going to foul right away so somebodys going to have to make a free throw Blue Devils playing without Jeremy roach Mark Mitchell tonight Pittsburgh came out in the early stages tonight and showed the Blue Devils it was not going to be like it was 12 days ago at the Peterson event center and Jeff Cables team trying to knock off the number seven Blue Devils but 10 precious seconds left to go to pull that upset and the first win against the Blue Devils at Cameron for pit since 1979 heres the inbounds pass and low is fouled promptly by Foster itll be his second and Jaylen low who hit one of two a moment ago back to the line for a pair well I think if youre the Panthers thats where you wanted the ball to go that was a really nice job of screening and low came right to the ball and the difference in making one or two of these is enormous for Jeff Cables team you got to hit them both to create a twopossession chance and less than 10 seconds what a big moment for this freshman and he is hit two huge field goals here in the second half thats good I mean Dan you it is rare to see a rookie make his debut in this building and play as fearlessly as jayen low has tonight for Jeff cable well this is the big one right Applause here its a fourpoint game well now you try to force the Blue Devils to take as much time as possible bringing the ball up to court and obviously you do not want to foul anybody heres Proctor hell fire for three and hes fouled and the foul is on feder Rico and thats his Fifth and Jeff capable knows exactly what you just said de and he hoped his team would not Applause do and Tyrese brocker who is 81 at the line this year and two for two tonight has not scored in the second half Wes theres just no reason for feder Rico to even try to block that shot and you can see Jeff Cables Music reaction feder Rico feder Rico is going to foul out with nine points and five rebounds tonight and he fouls out with 4 point8 left to go and he puts an 80 free throw shooter on the line yep first time hes fouled out of a ball game this year here is Proctor and the first one no good free throws are a little harder in these situations Duke and only cut it to a twopoint margin even if he hits them both Diaz Graham has come on the floor to replace feder Rico Proctors got his 11th point on his third free throw of the night here is Young now for TJ power well and thats this is a rebounding move right here if he misses this one then the Panthers really have to do a great job blocking out would you miss it with 48 left or would you hit it I think Id hit it okay he shoots with the Miss and now if youre going to miss it Wes you cant miss it like that you have to hit the rim right and he did not proor Applause didnt and this is the problem he misses the rim yep and the ball has to hit the rim if it doesnt hit the rim its a violation so Diaz Graham stays on the floor here with feder Rico having fouled out Dan told you hes not a really good free throw shooter the inbounds is leg it then you got Henson low and Austin all in the back court and I think Ron groover wants to double check the clock here yeah now the clock cannot start until the ball hits until somebody touches the ball after it hits the rim so the clock should not have moved and this hes telling hes telling Le its a spot throw in he cannot run the Baseline Here Comes low toward the basketball they got to get it in bounds and its Henson tried to get it right back to low and instead Henson is fouled by Foster thatll be his third and Blake Henson the games leading scorer with 23 goes to the line for his first free throws of the night Wes hes got two yep but he is not with his you know as as good a scorer as he is hes not a great free throw shooter 67 on the year he is perfect from behind the line tonight he is hit seven threes in seven attempts yeah but thats the the longer line hes at the free throw line now first of two thatll make it four and that put pit on the doorstep Dan and thats a big one yep Wesson what was the number you were giving me 21 ranked teams yep if you count losses by Baylor in Kansas today thats 21 top 10 teams that have lost and here is Duke at the horn itll Bound Away and for the first time since 1979 pit has won at Cameron and Blake Henson goes and leaps on the scores table across
