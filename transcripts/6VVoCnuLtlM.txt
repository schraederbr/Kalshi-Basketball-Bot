in early December to Georgia Tech Syracuse at 10 and three they are one and one in the conference losing at Virginia just won over the weekend against pit and Duke wins the opening tip at Cameron were underway Mitchell giving it up here to The Talented freshman McCain at 63 out of Sacramento California hes putting his stamp on the early part of the Season hell draw a foul here by Chris Bell hell pick up number one in the opening seconds youre going to see Duke utilize Kyle filipowski a lot in this offense I think its a difference between where he was at the beginning of the Season as opposed to where he is now being more active them playing through Kyle and also those guys being more decisive him and Mark Mitchell turning facing making decisions quickly more like NBA than probing for long periods of timei with a touch M Kane on the drive coming in averaging 12 and hell knock down the jumper to get Duke started tonight and look at the Syracuse starting five judin is the man getting 19 points a game JJ Starling is the Notre Dame transfer the orange play a lot more guys than they have under Jim Bahan theyre playing nine and its a very young team they roll deep they have nine sophomores on this team young but they play with a sense of urgency and what you just saw right there by mints that is one of his Specialties ranked six in the nation and free throws per game and today during shoot around in The Scouting Report it was not to give him any energy or any any space on the court to crowd him and to funnel him into help because he wants to get to the free throw line he makes a living at the free throw line its had a big year H 33 against LSU 28 against Cornell certainly an ACC Player of the Year candidate Bowski is as well on the other side for the Duke Blue Devil so were seeing some Talent here the Duke starting five Bowski Mitchell another big at 69 roach is so so reliable and Duke getting proor back as you mentioned coming off the bench well see how that affects their mix because they were playing well without him so Mark Mitchell shoot that ball there shooting 5 in the threepoint line but you like the decisiveness and this is what D does they get out and they try to runowski nice save lines it up for Foster in and out and going to be on the line there and a turnover youre talking about Mitchell being more decisive well talking to John Shire today hes obviously in the shooting slump and one of the things they want him to focus on is when you catch it be more decisive catch shoot catch or pass or catch or drive but make a play be aggressive and make a decision and thats what you want to see from Mark Mitchell be a screener be a rebounder and play with Incredible effort Bell lost control one it back and now throws it away roach with the pick goes one on two and count that basket that was as Bill cumington Jr took a seat on the Baseline trying to make a call it should have thats a am1 I mean if you could do that kind of stuff in the park I mean you it hits the glass yeah thats thats an n one that is tendon hey thats how you to jump when uh when we worked out I saw you with that ver Le my dreams many many years ago its a fun dream though the cloud at 74 plus up top a misfire by mince almost got enough iron to drop through and now come the Duke Blue Devils new can Syracuse have met 21 times oh nice move there and kosi thought he got hit on the arm but no whistle well thats where Phil palsky is going to be able to have a field day whenever theyre going to have nahem mlau come out and guard him he can put that ball down the ground and drive Applause through and welcome to Cameron indor here on a Tuesday night that is Judah Min a talented guard but a Syracuse Orange going up against number 14 Duke and a cold start as Chris Bell missfires there on the outlet Jeremy roach trying contact and gets it to go and hell be at the line so Duke off to a pretty decent start Bell will pick up the foul and he already has two J Williams Deo what a what a big time move look how hes slowed down his Pace its one of the things that older guards are able to do cuz they understand how to change speeds hes holding the arms up to show you hes too strong but thats really because he changed speeds and understanding how to shift gears and then cracking into the defensive player once they leave their feet thats how you get am1s savy senior you say that sometimes in college basketball these days do you indeed yeah indeed a 61 start trying to add to that angel gray with us as well Dave OBrien alongside the Duke Legend Jay Williams they loveing having you back here in Durham by the way yeah we we had some issues parking Adel gave me a little bit of a hard time you know we saw one thats not right yeah well we saw one security guy four guys let me pass through I felt like I was going to meet the president um but we finally got through and it was all is well but it its its good to be back here in Durham and these are both programs that I have a lot of familiarity with obviously Syracuse Jim beheim coached me when I was 17 18 years old wow for USA basketball and obviously playing and having my jersey retired here is pretty special so you should never ever have difficulty parking I couldnt get into the building today Dave thats amazing something wrong with that its like the FBI is here I mean thats the level of security detail we have thats going to be tipped and it will stay on this end 7 to one both of these teams are playing good basketball right now theyre both streaking in the right direction and of course the first headtohead meeting as head coaches between John Shire now in year number two for Duke and Adrien red ay in his first year at the helm taking over for the great Jim beheim Dave I have to say this you know one of my favorite singers is Frank Sinatra and the song I did in my way it is beyond impressive I just see Cis knocked down a threepoint shot there I got to get a hand up but that both coach arrey and Coach Shire have replaced Legends coaches that have transcended the game of basketball frankly in our Sport and both these programs feel the same but they also feel very different they have made it their own obviously with alrie theyre playing manto man and style of pace and then obviously with Duke and John Shire and him making it feel like his this its beyond impressive Mal Brown unable to connect inside 1552 to go here in the first half and a timeout Duke on Top seven to four will you te it up beautifully walking in the footsteps of Legends alltimers both of these head coaches headtohead tonight at Cameron indor made a point that they are going to be their own people and they are going to have their own Concepts and their own strategies and I I think its absolutely brilliant for how theyre transitioning in college basketball angel gray has more yeah guys for John sh success came early and he told us its a continuous challenge to actually trust his gut and to make the program his own but he did have some advice for first to your head coach Adrien autrey he said its very similar but Im also telling him good luck he laughed about it earlier when we had him on the broadcast but coach autrey said theres no filling in the shoes of Coach beheim but he can take this piece of advice coach beheim told him you know these players better than most guide them protect them hold them to a standard of what being a championship program requires and both of them blazing their own Trails picked off there by men circus a one for eight start and one for nine now on the Miss by Brown as it hung tantalizingly on the iron they are going to count that thatll be interference take a Music look yeah here one of the things in which Syracuse is really good aaging around 12 and half steals per game Judah mens in particular he roams around the half court area and if youre not strong with the ball he has very active hands and he gets his hands on the ball he is a talking to Seth Greenberg today hes a city guard hes one of the best twoway players I think in the game of college basketball that was a strong finish there as brown goes all the way through the 68 offall they love the many things he can do very versatile for Syracuse oh hes active he puts he applies pressure on the ball he funnels you into help and they get out and they run tough scope wont fall by Roach just at a fivegame stretch with 22 assists and only three turnovers heres Starling and hell Swit into three hes been having a lot of trouble hitting the three just 26 that looked very sweet yeah hes a capable threepoint shooter with time at 21 points at Georg toown 16 at UVA I think really him finding his rhythm from the outside opens up lanes for mint to get into those GS even more nice bounce back for the orange here eight nothing run you want to see Kyle filipowski work for position down low and demand the ball Kane on the drive hell scoop it up and in freshman whos hitting 45 from three so you have to honor that two but goes to the rack for the bucket and he ties it up J McCain has been extremely special um not only does he put the time in the gym but I really think not having Tyrese proor for four games Force guys like Caleb Foster and Jared McCain have a lot more responsibility and play through challenges you know thats one of the hardest things for young guards to do Dave is when you make a mistake typically guards get subbed out but when you dont have that Reserve there these guys are forced to play through and I think that experience is going to pay dividends filipowski going up high to try and tap that one away so take a look on the drive by Brown going in strong and just defensive transition and once again mens call for that ball screen over and stalling just hands ready knocking down that shot you know the how they guard that ball ball screen is going to be really important are they going to Blitz it to get the ball out of mins hands are you going to hard hedge to get over the top but you have to be disruptive because mint is really good at making quick decisions with the ball meanwhile young is in filipowski out just picked up a foul Min may have forced that jumper young going for the board has it knocked out of play and it will be Duke basketball and this is what you want to do with Min you get him in you funn him in to help and R young having a really strong contest using that wing span to contest thats what you want to do you want to make shots difficult for him proor with it just back from that ankle injury nice feet for young cant Music finish and a whistle here with 1251 to go in the half the Duke got everything he wanted there but young could not get it done and the foul will go against young his first Ryan young his veteran like experience it goes such a long way you talk about him and Jeremy roaches a Senor he had that stint during the Bor game which he made some critical plays that really helped him pull that game away um his decision making his effort defensively and his basketball IQ I think really helped this team in a big Way Oakland Zips the pass and on a play intended for Benny Williams downstairs theyve turned it over now three times hey he so Duke with the basketball coming in number 14 other than losing a home game by this point in the season that was Arizona back in early November statistically its been about what you expect from a Duke team thats going to be tipped out and will be Syracuse ball the Duke shooting 49 37 from three duke is averaging less than nine turnovers per game which is top five nationally obviously losing to Arizona at home this was a different place with the the student section um rocking but that was a its still the thing you question about Duke and I think Duke has a legit shot to win a title is the physicality can they play through tough stretches when teams try to out match them with physicality oh look at it move the ball there beautifully and Mitchell will lay it up and in that was textbook his first bucket now John shy said something around Mark Mitchell today that really stood out for me he said learning how to embrace a role is one thing crushing it is something different right and Mark Mitchell really embracing that being decisive with his decision making but crushing it is the next level of him taking that role to a different level Mitchell right down the lane and cant get it to roll in but hell be at the line as he draws the foul dukez grabb the lead 11 to9 on the orange and when we come back after the break some Ridiculousness thats the lead in you want to wait around for this what does that mean and his name is Jason kid thats about it man Jason kid Gary Payton maybe but Gary getting up there in years Jason kid to me is probably the only one I would take over Mr Williams how about that that is vintage vintage Dicky V vintage J will as well pretty spectacular first off let me say Dicky V I hope youre doing well Im excited to have you back here with us we love you buddy uh it its incredible that Ive been doing this for 18 years and Dicky V is still one of the most relevant people we have in all of sports so and yeah playing for Coach K was incredible Doo I mean uh obviously playing here wrecking that Jersey um and then become a twotime national player of the year but everything was earned nothing was given and and uh I I think thats the thing for all these guards I spoke to them today you know you have to go out there you have to go take it because when you wear that those four letters across your chest you cant be hunted you have to be the Hunter and thats for any program and thats what Adrians doing with Syracuse basketball you know keeping his players hungry implementing a new style and and thats the biggest challenge we have today in college basketball you know can you be yourself and can you play through everybody telling you how great you are all the time and remaining hungry was a very tough on the Baseline give him four points so who who steps up there I mean thats been such a mark of great Duke teams under Coach K in the point guard role the great guard play once again its Mitchell getting really active in that painted area give him six I think Dukes always been known for their guards obviously Kyle filipowski is you know up for National player of the year hes going to be a first team AllAmerica needs a special player but how they defend on the perimeter how they Den not pass passing Lanes I think Jared McCain has really came into his own Im curious to see where hell be towards the end of the season but having Tyrese Pro their back and the way he can Ball Hawk right there apply pressure and kick the ball ahead has a 4 to1 assisted turnover ratio how their guards play will dictate their level of success well Thursdays Pack 12 basketball game coming up on ESPN in the app its Caleb love and number 10 Arizona looking to bounce back against KJ Simpson and Colorado thats at 930 eastern time we saw North Carolina get off to a really cold start earlier tonight against pit miss the first what 10 shots and then rallied in that one North Carolina special team RJ Davis is special we talked about GPL as you see tyres Proctor there the NBA you know High School league is just those type of shops RJ dares can make it to with the best of Mitchell with the rejection Blakes gives it up jumper will be off the back iron so not there for Proctor the point guard missed three games after rolling that left ankle against Georgia Tech and the whistle with nine and a half to go into the first half and theyll get filipowski for number two thats what Duke basketball is everybody doing what they do off a ball screen here does a great job of probing gets into the lane and its a strong finish with the right hand and then on the other end get him back defensively Mark Mitchell just being active I mean thats when you look at him he has the frame and the size of somebody that should be a defensive stopper an enforcer body kind of reminds me that Ron test with the way he can use his strength 69 powerful d by the way 21 and two when Mitchell scores 10 points or more hes off to a nice start in this one and you know a lot of times on Scout reports youll see teams laying off and playing off of him giving him you know almost playing those mental Jedi Mind Tricks I called them with take the shot we dare you just because youre open doesnt mean that you have to settle for the shot you can absorb that space and attack and I think once again being decisive is what John Shire wants Mark Mitchell to be all the time well he came in one for 20 from threepoint Lane its at the line Jason K used to say that all the time in the league I remember playing for the Nets for a short standing one of our teammates is like were open and uh Jason was like well youre open for a reason okay so let not settle its in The Scouting Report yes exactly these coaches are smart they know what theyre doing proor bles will give it up Foster on the wing Deep by three and the ball and will hand off for foster shot clock now down to three hes going to have to get it in the air Syracuse crashing the glass Benny Williams coming up a strong 158 re Bond game against pit on Saturday thats where M doesnt need to bring the ball down its giving it up off the window one fall for Bell and a whistle I I really like what sah is doing defensively youre seeing Mintz get Ryan young in that ball screen which I think he has a field day but for nem McLoud if youre 73 74 do not bring the ball down you are the tallest person on the floor keep it high turn make a play at The Rim you bring the ball down to the level of the guards thats where those triple ways come from transfer from Florida State hope is he can help fill the void of Jesse Edwards went to West Virginia a surprising departure although maybe shouldnt be in this age of nil yeah I mean you have to recruit players on your own team each and every year and uh its one of the hardest things in college basketball on top of n fou was on young his second so were talking about you know the somewhat crazies in the background the questions going to BJ will stamina them cuz its an older crowd that they have what it takes to go the full 40 well when you typically see Cameron crazies well theyre its like everybodys over 40 thats the problem we um you know typically when you see the Cameron crazies they theyre running on the bleachers I mean we saw people literally gingerly thats how we will walk up the bleachers D limping a little bit in my case yeah Foster B get it up and thats what m cloud has to be great at indeed size in the frame just to be vertical Bell flips it to the corner and Syracuse has had a number of sloppy turnovers thatll be six in the game for the Music orange I dont know about you I find it fascinating that coach beheim has now got behind a microphone hes working some games for ESPN and hes been in the studio a little bit from all the reports I get he loves it hes having a great time I um Ive never known Jim not to say something funny I mean I spending time with him hes one of the funniest people there is and I I love that hes able to let his hair down its a joke cuz we both have no hair but I I feel like his true personality comes out and you know some of those Rivals coach Kay and Jim beheim some of the best of friends with the way theyve Coach USA Basketball together and listening to those guys tell stories Ill tell you over a glass ofo theres nothing better Dio indeed only 2000 wins for CR out L thats going to be up and good as Foster gets in the lane his first bucket Caleb Foster with 18 points he had against Baylor I I really think he adds a different dimension and you know he lets the game come to him but the next step is for him to take it to the game and be aggressive the way Judah mince is getting into those m range SPS its coming in averaging 19 watching him shoot hes just one of those pure Shooters as we saw today in the shooter on Foster cant answer there one and done Syracuse with an opportunity here to take the lead but cant do it theyll turn it over again heres McCain short Vin again on the attack airborne and yes well there are two Duke players that joged back on defense and you can tell John is John Shire is pretty annoyed by that you turn the ball over you better make sure you get back on defense with the sense of urgency so Syracuse grabbing the lead beheim Cameron crazy moment if you missed it the first time you want to see one wait for it a little bit there exactly start at 100 16 games for Jim beheim in the early 90s he was Jims assistant and now taking theres another dunp there by Mitchell he has eight so Duke back in front by one Cloud putting it to the deck back out for Mintz its trying to make a move at the foul line on the spin and denied by Blakes and he comes away with the basketball roach in transition guess who again and Mitchells going to the line and what an incredible pass right here by Tyrese Proctor you talk about eyes in the backer head how about on the side out of your head with the vision there to find Mitchell and once again we talked about it at the beginning of the game for Mark Mitchell to be the X Factor for this team be quick and decisive catching the ball finishing strong through contact at The Rim I truly believe his defensive effort his intensity and his ability to finish at The Rim could really help this team go to a different number threepoint play set a big first half pressure here by the blue doubles Taylor find the lane open up leans in side almost made it and hell be headed to the stripe he tomorrow night top teams in the ACC squaring off on ESPN in the app big man PJ Hall leading number 16 Clemson hes had a heck of a start of against 10 and2 Miami and Coral Gables coverage beginning at 800 eastern time he Im Im going to tell you right now Dave I really like Clemson Im not off Miami yet uh I think Miami has a way to go but Clemson and PJ Hall is a name that people at home need to know about he is 68 can knock down the midrange shot can knock down the three can put the ball down on the ground and hes not afraid to put his nose into things he is one of the toughest players in this league I think be behind Duke and North Carolina Clemson is right there hes averaging 20 points a game number two in the ACC Duke by three roach putting on a brakes Bel outside the three makeing 46 Mitchell feel pretty good about himself see all right youre being decisive but still you can shrink the court just because you have that space doesnt mean that you have to settle you can absorb the space Drive hes been getting to the rim but still once again you like the fact that hes being assertive Steward with a second foul for the Blue Devils talking about all that space I mean look at look at look at this space right here were going to see you see that space absorb attack that space attack that space if you can attack that space thats where you put a guy like nahem McLoud in a predicament utilize ball F hes jumping get him in the air crack into him get to the free throw line so it be Taylor at the line for the orange know something else Dave that stands out here similar to the Georgia Tech game where KY filipowski only took around eight shots Two Shots thus far in the first half you really want to see him be more aggressive when hes on the court but also demand the ball Mitchell certainly been doing that proa will give it up power straight on and that didnt touch a thing one up a pass for Mitchell takes the hit and makes the shot this just having a great half give him 13 and Counting and josy told us today like this is who hes going to be for his career hes going to be an energy guy is going to be a guy thats going to attack the bodies of The Bigs and I talked about having that Ron R test like upper body frame he can play through the contact thats what his specialty is the cloud second foul so this one for a 14point half with about 5 and A2 minutes to go for Mitchell who came in averaging 11 and five very respectable numbers but hes blowing right through those Duke by six with Min not in the game where does the scoring come from for Syracuse foul with 515 left and against Tyrese Proctor so the big donut there for one of the best players in college basketball only 7 minutes yeah I this is going to be what teams are going to do they uh when the best way to attack the opposing players the opposing teams best offensive player is you do that defensively you attack them and calfi palsky got into foul trouble and thats going to be what Duke is going to have to deal with every single day if I were playing against Duke I would take him in ball screens I would tell her bigs utilize heics get him up in the air get him in foul trouble cuz thats when Duke will be vulnerable thats 18 points and nine rebounds the game on the bench right now Mitchell is the guy filling that void on the drive roach an offensive foul thats a call there by Jamie lucky that was the right call sometimes when Jeremy roach starts driving its that off right hand that he extends and theres really no need to extend it there you can wrap the other players arm by keeping it in tight close to your body thats a little trick that the veterans do playing angles right yeah Music 2723 you extend that arm Dave theyre going to call that every time every time swatted away power getting up there and denying him on the Baseline Duke is really not giving him a lot of space to operate and and this is what mint wants to do he wants to get to the free throw line he loves drawing contact great job to stay discipline and block the shot over the top good entry pass for the dunk from Malik Brown Applause Syracuse has made a nice bounce back here bounce back a couple of times within two on a row to Cameron indor du is won eight straight against circus and 10 to the last 11 McCain to the Lane scoop ball fall for him now the orange with an opportunity to tie but take the lead again another in the lane off the back iron no but theyll get a second effort let giving it up heres copelan got a good look quality of a possession for Syracuse far in transition cant hit it quer Copley coming off 22 also nine rebounds against pit hes the ACC player of the week and now suddenly both sides going a little bit cold under four minutes to go in half number one proor on the spin STS it so Dynamic off the dribble and hes really good at attacking angles and getting to the spots on the floor where he wants to be D lost that game against Georgia Tech and their only ACC tilt so far theres the slam down from Malik Brown knows exactly what to do it in the lane give him 10 so the Blue Devils with a basketball twopoint Advantage three minutes left in the half Foster wants to go oneonone drawing contact no and its brown with another rebound a really tough possession for Duke right there the ball kind of stuck to Fosters hands didnt really get the defense moving side to side J minz nearly threw that one away its a difficult angle by Starling rich with the rebound and theyll blow the whistle theres a foul Ill tell you one thing Dio Duke is sure happy to have Tyreese Proctor back look at the eyes here and how hes probing the Cor for seeing that space and I tell you he puts you in a spin cycle catching you in the iso he can give it to you any way he likes well I would look good in orange Doo I dont know Mitchell at the line lets toss it to a you would not look good in the orange Im just going to say that right now but guys both teams coming off of a little bit of a break and it was very interesting speaking to both of the coaches and how they needed to manage both of their teams giving them some time off for Coach s he said I just wanted to make sure that I was managing the voices in their head as well so really looking at how that Queens game and how everyone was very cohesive he was very pleased with that and for even on the other side for Coach ay he said I gave them 4 days off I need them to understand the importance of the work life balance and since it is the New Years I couldnt let them leave without talking about the New Years resolution coach Sher said Im preaching be present he said to himself as well understanding whats the most important thing is Syracuse for Coach ay he said its a little bit different I need to still do a vision board but he said I need to get some to get better and something every single game and he said Im going to make sure Im going to read work nutrition but something has to get better each game Angel Ill tell you the most impressive thing that you did that whole breakdown right there with those kids eating popcorn right over your hair Im tell that is talk about Focus thats thats incredible well Ive already had a pretzel Ive already had a pretzel dropped on my head can I have a can I have some popcorn can I give you some popcorn oh thats see thats thats were in time of giving what a great kid thank you Mitchel at the line by the way cuse out rebounding Duke 23 15 wow whos going to tell Angel the kid had a her finger on her nose before he dug that Pop N Im joking angel Im joking its the holiday season Duke by one Mitchell with another one coming he makes 71 he was N9 for n at the line against Michigan State so hes one of those foul Shooters who gets hot he is in a big half with 16 if VI are Syracuse right now with the way that Min has been playing two of seven from the field having eight points not playing that well thats almost a point for every single shot hes taken as he gets to the roack here yes he did I mean they they are they are playing quick theyre playing decisive Cal Phi palsky is in foul trouble this is Syracuse basketball people time to wake up this is what its going to be 247 whistle here at midco at Mid court and Duke by the way old for eight from threepoint distance Thursday Pack 12 basketball in ESPN and the app Caleb love and number 10 Arizona looking to bounce back against KJ Simpson and Colorado that game at 930 eastern time well get Bell for his second foul on the Syracuse side to send Blakes to the line he had a 15point game against Charlotte but his minutes have been limited against the top tier opponents and these are the things that remind you of Jim beheim just like the the mentor right the the grabbing the get getting the game the passion that he has I mean he also missed a play on Chris Bell where he reach and hes down on the ground saying why reach why reach right there fun him towards the side bring him towards the side is one of the brightest young minds in the game of basketball in coach Al young pick it up Min and to reach out a whistle young didnt think so but a foul there just over a minute to go and thatll be number three on Ryan young 610 grad in a twopoint game Dave I really look forward to in the second half us breaking down how stylistically the Syracuse team is such a different team you know watching the way Jim used to recruit for that matchup Zone and now with the ferocity they play manto man it feels it feels the same but its a completely different brand takes I think a little bit of getting used to for certainly a generation of of Syracuse F several Generations this is different the faster in your face they apply pressure and they attack the rim with Reckless abandon I think there are many things to compare though to all the great years Jim beheim had and thats Jim brought in so many terrific players and coached them up no good players when they got the ccus theyre tremendous when they left on the MIT another slam does it just feel that Mark Mitchell was everywhere on the court I mean hes engaged defensively hes active hes getting 5050 balls hes communicating and everything hes doing is hes finishing strong at The Rim Duke by Applause two Taylor giv it up thats going to be an offensive on the charge copin number two they talk about Mark Mitchell just once again being a screener rolling Proctor finding him in a strong twoand finish at The Rim just the level of energy he brings to the table its you know I was talking to Andy infield over at UFC about how energy has used his effort and its a skill level that lot people dont bring and thats what Mark Mitchells bringing about half a minute to go duke by two here in the first Music down everything hes doing is with effer 5050 balls and it gets the steal but also finishes strong in transition and thats what every guard wants their big to do the you beg them to run the floor finishing through contact 18 points so far in the first half and his energy is infectious for this team its one of those missing aspects that when he plays this way even though Kyle filipowski has two fouls he gives you 18 points and Duke has a twopoint lead now number 25 has been the man for the Blue Devils and you know theyre dominating in one area and thats in the paint outscoring circus 6 to 14 Mitchell is the number one reason why every time you look up hes flying through the lane so about 2 and 12 second difference between the shot clock and the game clock shot clock down to eight heres Proctor straight on got an excellent look couldnt get that one to go chance for a heave here mince on the drive got it up there but cant make it and the first half Duke has failed to hit a threepoint shot they are over nine Beyond The Arc but with Cal Phil palsky and pal trouble theyve dominated points in the paint as well so 26 to 14 they still have that Advantage which is why they have the twopoint lead filipowski averaging 18 points a game a donut here in the first half and a quick whistle here thatll go the other way lets toss it down Angel Jay I can add a couple of more adjectives that coach sh expressed as far as Mitchell he said hes been our stabilizer our attacker hes done everything we need him to do at The Rim especially in the absence of Kyle filipowski I asked him about that he said hes picking up two bad fouls hes played seven minutes we need for him to be better on the defensive end by the way just picked up his third foul yeah filipowski has been that over the last four games hes been way better offensively McCain downtown yes the three so that took less than half a minute to clean that up and he has seven I think G was telling me a great Stat or incredible stattion that uh its been over a th games that Duke has made a three we did not expect the first one to be today right like never like never yes JJ starting with a pullup and feathery touch Notre Dame transfer grew up outside of Syracuse in Baldwinsville New York getting a chance to come back home and he has five Syracuse is not backing down with the way stalling has played mint and brown the guards have gotten where they wanted well thats a classic filipowski move right there but that little spin to the right and he takes care of the oer and so its the dke blue doubles by five mint looking to answer styling again looking to use the screen pulls up and knocks it down Big Time shot you see the body control how he bumped off he bumped off Foster right there with the left shoulder didnt extend that arm to get offensive foul but that thats a thats a pro likee move at 21 against Georgetown so he can fill it up filipowski again shovels the pass mitel on the spin of the Applause slam now he matches his career high with 20 I know this from experience there are times when bigs can feel lost in games when you have a lot of good guards C filipowski is demanding the ball thats what you want to see from your star player leaning inside Brown yes thatll roll home had a really good first half quietly didnt he he just went the work down L on the Block I mean he got couple offensive rebounds got some chippy points thats what you need from your front courner is 14 Syracuse has been able to answer All Night Long at least to this point the entry for kosi all alone for Music toe hes a different looking guy in the opening minutes of the second half theyre finding Applause him thats a dangerous guy outside the threepoint line getting inside draws the foul thatll be on McCain on a slow down well KY filipowski warning the ball down low on the Block going against Justin Taylor Whos 66 and what a big time pass right there finding Mitchell and then the seal over the top the seal thats what you want to see Kyle filipowski dominate down low on the Block and look at John shires parents there still attending games still being as passionate as they were when John won a championship back in 2015 you know such Family Affair here a Duke for everybody concerned its worn the uniform or coached 2010 I dont I dont want to make John younger than what he is hes 3 five yes hes young enough hes young enough actually since taking over for a living legend to Coach K he seemed very very comfortable in this role almost as if following Mike shashy anybody was going to be able to do it comfortably it was going to be John Shar knowing him as an assistant coach for as long as I did I always called him a young Brad Stevens I thought he had a pretty uncanny ability to see the game but also connect with play ERS and I I think thats something thats really important for him and Coach alry as well then being younger guys connecting with the players and learning how to push and motivate the players differently Bells third foul for Syracuse on the cut M Kain couldnt get it so Duke did everything right except the Finish straight on Mintz left it short hes 38 out there roach trying to make a move strong lost it Syracuse buckling down defensively heres Bell and he gave it away picked off by Foster roach up ahead tip toes in and lays it up for two Bell just leaving his feet right there and thats what you dont want young players to do they get into those gaps leave those feet to make a pass well weve seen it so many times over the decades the first five minutes especially here at Cameron indor for Duke and they take off and theyve opened up a lead here 46 to Duke with a threepoint lead over Syracuse and Duke has that threepoint lead mainly because of their freshman Phenom right now with jerck McCain who has been unbelievable in his last four games but coach Shyer gave him High Praise he said he is one of one and unap apologetically himself he said there was a back toback game where he was in a slump he said since then his confidence has been oozing I talked to him earlier he said I do my nails its something that I picked up over Co he said I like to feel good I then play good over the last four games hes averaged close to 20 points also leading the team in points as well he said I Envision every single thing and wants the win tonight Jay will youve told me that for years you feel good you look good you play good yeah and painting the finger fingernail makes you shoot 45 from the threepoint line please do so Syracuse throws it away take a closer look is that hot pink oh wow Christmas colors whatever whatever does it for you I think it is Merry Christmas chly what that is whatever it takes filipowski surprised you dont do that to your fingernails uh you shouldnt be surprised not remotely Deep by three proor gives it up stolen away by mince mince has brown with him over the top of the slam Brown he is 16 orange keep coming back keep coming back roach will bury the three hes 46 beyond that Arc Min with the big steal on one end and then once again Mark Mitchell making a read so many bigs try to force that issue end up getting a charge but great body control and great awareness with his eyesight to make that skip pass to Roach to knock down the th yeah Mitchell had such a strong night on both ends hin backs it away shot clock out to six inside Brown hes not going to miss anything that close hes been burying those all night Music 18 Brown also an outstanding Defender he a lot of deflections Proctor filipowski gave it away thats where you just want filipowski to go up strong and the guy was late on the rotate from the weak side take a second go up strong owered it at The Rim its just been off tonight butter Copeland on the drive denied Brown firing it nice save on the deck the Duke Blue Devils thats Mitchell again in transition Proctor for a Applause triple Music Applause 5247 whistle inside underneath the basket willll go against Duke I tell you Min does a great job that thats how youre supposed to play defense youre supposed to still Ste the ball on the left side of the floor with your outside right hand in case you miss you can recover defensively textbook defense by minz and great feed up top in transition thats the one of the reasons why hes one of the best defensive players in college basketball pror just picked up foul number two McCain will take a Applause breather opop misfired pass They Come Away with it though oh heres Starling no filipowski tearing it away Le Devils trying to add to the lead roach just hit a big three seconds ago off the fake in traffic and Proctor will draw the foul having active hands is something Duke always wants to do but going back to Judah minz he he is a a talented player there been you mentioned Dave he had 33 points against LSU he is that offensive Rhythm that when he gets going Syracuse becomes a different team and he has not had any space today to operate I think as of right now he has 16 points but four of 11 from the field and its just been difficult for him to get to the free throw line as well I mean free throw T hes eight of nine which is still good but you feel like he should be at the free throw line getting 15 to 16 free throw attempts per game been a big reason for for the orange success 10 and three coming in and took his name out of the NBA draft consideration to the surprise of many he returned to Su Id say red arrey is one of those who was a bit surprised well look I mean the next step for him is knocking down that jump shot right from the outside we were watching shoot around today he turns his white foot inward he kind of shoot his hip his feet are off he dont seem set the ball comes off the side of his hands if he can add that jump shot um that thats an explosive package that can take this game to the next level thought about a three there gives it up for Williams cant drill it filipowski another rebound hes not scoring but hes getting to the glass here in the second half theyre going to get min there for the personal 12 35 left and Duke opening up their biggest lead Saturday afternoon on acc Network they have the first basketball triple header of the New Year Virginia taking on ncate to begin that at 200 Eastern FSU taken on Virginia Tech and finally number 14 Duke and Notre Dame in South B should be a great afternoon of Hoops on the ACC Network Dev who do you think the best team in the country is in the country in the country right now Im looking at Purdue Purdue I think with the way Fletcher lawyer plays Braden Smith when he plays a top game and zachi they are yes they are the best team rebound tipped out battle for that loose ball and itll stay on this end itll be Dukes but I think its wide open well you know and you see teams have surprising losses obviously Arizona FAU youve seen Purdue struggle with you hope they dont see Northwestern in the tournament right um you know it does feel like there there are upper echelon teams Kansas I think Kentucky has a pretty high ceiling as well def with their bigs and their guard play I think Duke is in that category as well and North Carolina sure out of the conference power goes down and a whistle here with 128 showing and that foul will go on copelan thats number three onut here Copeland 66 sopore for Philly so this is one of those danger zones that Syracuse has been able to overcome every time tonight where it looks like Duke is about to make a breaka away run but the orange come right back they force the turnover they hit a big shot filipowski downstairs power has lost it itll go the other way well once again great defense by Syracuse but I Im going to say this Dave Duke fans in college basketball is in for a treat next year if you have not heard of the name Cooper flag one of the best players to actually Dawn this Duke uniform in a wow as a freshman he is a special gifted player uh consens is one of the best players in the country country uh he can do it any way you want it any way you want it and he has Moxy he has swag and he is a compeer like he he competes each and every possession where it is he can really talk it too not better they playing for Kevin Bole coach Kyrie Irving at St PS the K swishing in a three and Duke bolsters the lead to Music 10 bars trying to fight back heres Starling mince driving it hits it somehow hit off balance and got it to go is 18 we talk about just quiet yeah thats what I said I think hes the best tough shot maker in the ACC and one of the best her is in the country and hes talking to Tyrese proor I mean he is engaged right Music now Ro it with the catch back out should just kept going just keep curling right to the rim he had an easy lowski shot clock down to six fading away yes so Duke adding a lot more out of their star here in the second half he did not score in the first half copelan left it behind picked up by McCain hell fire you paint whatever you want to paint Jared McCain you want to paint your toenails you want to do whatever you want to do you keep doing that if youre shooting the rock like that Jared McCain is on Music Applause one and Duke just making big shot after big shot I heard Jared McCain was special but seeing it up close in person theres a run for the Duke Blue Devils and thats a class they do this all the time 132 over the last 3 and a half where does that come from you know as a former player here we used to call that blood in the water and timeouts or huddles where you feel like hey if we get the ball going in a couple of times you know lets just try to blow this open lets try to get a five or sixpoint swing get a couple stops you knock down some threes in transition those are momentum Killers for other teams and Duke has more offensive Firepower than Syracuse and now youre even seeing him go into a Zone trying to change it up forc the Syracuse to set up for shots from the outside Williams thatll rattle in Syracuse needed that one desperately second half Duke five for five beyond the threepoint line they were 0 for nine in the first half John you know I dont know my apologies for going to John I dont know why I thought that but its there are times as a player here as you see terar McCain knocked out another one where you just sense it you can look at the opposing team and see that okay here are one of these runs and how are they going to respond and if they cant come back and knock down shots to counter your run thats where the game starts to get a little out of hand Copeland just did back to back now Syracuse coming down and making shots they had to have under n and a half remaining here at Cameron Duke is on fire Foster hits Blakes to the foul line did not take the shot McCain gives it up roacha lifts he buries it on a triple and suddenly here in the second half Duke cannot miss beyond that Applause line seven for seven since halftime we give Duke a lot of credit for knocking down shots but Syracuse has to stay tagged to Shooters multiple times theyve lost people off dble penetration Opel catches fires no and thats what you dont want bab you dont want there to be a shootout picked off by Brown on the drive tipped in by Brown after the Miss by Music Starling Malik Browns out a night he has 20 is more than double his average of nine theyve needed every one of Music them shter shter Brown wanted a two McCain around the back stops misses Williams there for the rebound Syracuse needs a run now prevent Min from driving inside Applause 6856 on the crossover and an Aaron pass tied for the allei that opens up roacho the other end give him Applause 15 so Duke hit in a comfort zone so just points off turnovers once again you talk about for Syracuse you know 15 turnovers in this game not taking care of the ball thats a slick pass and its going to lead to a potential threepoint play itll be brown again the line filipowski went for the block well he carried the load Every Which Way defensively and offensively with KY filipowski with two fouls in the in the first half mark Mitchell with 18 points career high 20 points but he hasnt really had to do with Dave as much in the second half because the threepoint shooting for Duke has really taken off well theyve been unconscious beyond that line since halftime something clicked filipowski also contributing a lot more here in the second half offensively not a big number but six points also has six rebounds Syracuse will be at the line here well when we were talking to John Shire I remember asking him during shoo round what have you found with Tyrese Proctor not in the ball game and he said you know the the ball doesnt stick as much the ball moves and the ball is energy right so it finds when the ball gets rotated around and guys are being unselfish it naturally finds itself to the hot shooter and that is intentional for a guy like Jared McCain to be open and knock out those shots at a high clip from the outside circus still very much in at Brown by the way with 23 points a career high that a huge roll tonight for the orange lowski on Brown good duel there and six great defense better offense a good job by Brown not giving any space or giving even an inch to the bigger CA pal vce looking for a seim has it batted away roach again on the attack lays it in defense into instant offense he has 17 points 74 59 Starling denied the lane outside for copelan Rebound picked off by by the Blue Devils so 6 minutes to go and Duke trying to put this one on ice here in the next couple of Music minutes Syracuse in dire need of a big Music stop up to spin and hell draw the foul you know giving a Target is something that Kyle filipowski has gotten a lot better at look at that left hand right there thats a Target and also making the post pass is a really underrated Talent of Tyrese Proctor and once he gets to his spot thats what an AllAmerican can do he is comfortable being uncomfortable and he gets on the Block its hard to stop him once he gets the ball that deep second foul on Benny Music Williams so about to go into double figures after a big zero in the scoring column in the first 20 and give him 10 points also a lot more demonstrative with the way KY Kowski has been calling for the ball yes different player yes well also when your guards go 7 to seven from the threepoint line it opens up the paint to go to work I would think filipowski going up for the rebound and its knocked out of play itll go the other way and for more on the sevenfooter lets toss it down to guys its impressive just seeing Kyle filipowski on the floor right now for his team he had surgery on both of his hips to shave them down to allow him to be more flexible and bendy as he said coach L Lucas nicknamed the sophomore two hit flip in the off season which he says hes been tremendous tremendous as far as moving with no pain he told me it was about a month where he could not move at all so the fact that hes still on the floor living out his dream is impressive shav down his hips that that doesnt sound like a fun day at the office no that that sounds painful just a little bit Kowski wears the number 30 to honor John shy who wore that number when he played you know if shaving down your hips makes you a first team all americ if painting your fingernails makes you shoot 48 from the threepoint line obviously these strategies are working Dave oh baby give me the nail polish then because Im not other thing sounds oh man Im not going anywhere near that so 7759 Mom and Dad here as you mentioned when it comes to every game its incredible to see how theyve came to games for John as a player and now for him as the head coach of Duke University and both for coach and ay talk about dream jobs coaching at a place where you coach under your predecessor two guys who are Hall of Famer Legends of the game and then being able to implement your own strategy your own style and do it your way um what an incredible opportunity for both young young coaches both of these guys you know draw on family to be able to do that to step in those shoes of those two head coaches red ay in year number one gives a lot of credit to Seth as well that one will rattle home yeah Seth brought him on as aobo director of basketball operations at Virginia Tech and red said that that was huge for him just hanging around Seth learning so he said that was a gigantic part of his career to be around Seth you say learning around Seth thats what he said absolutely question matter he being praised filipowski and the digs continue and the points continue for filipowski G him 12 all in the second half and all seriousness let me say this about Seth Greenberg he is one of the most attentive and passionate individuals I think we have in the game of basketball no doubt and and not only as a coach but just in the Game of Life um and and big shout out to Seth and his brother going through cancer weve talked about that multiple times in studio Seth were praying for you and your family man we love you brother I think Seths gotten to that point you know in the studio where you cant think of it without him you know hes got that great delivery the great Passion all that information always a lot of fun to listen to including tonight slapped Away by Williams a shot clock at four is a time out on the floor were going to hear from Seth on the other side 79 62 Duke looking pretty comfortable here again 7962 Duke on top of Syracuse here just under 4 minutes to go if Syracuse is going to crawl back in it whats job one well you have to get some stops on the defensive end and you got to stop Duke cowsky now is starting to go to work considering theyve been able to open up the floor with their threepoint shooting but it starts with defense for Syracuse and then getting some transition buckets thats how you get a stop right there thats thats great defense thats stop the shot clock violation but Duke shooting 76 in the second half say say that again 76 and seven for seven from the threepoint line you know Dave here and Seth Greenberg talk about Caitlyn Clark you can make the argument she is the biggest player in college basketball mens and womens oh you think so I mean you tell me a player more recognizable than Caitlyn Clark shes going to break every record and might come back to school to do it again next year right yes right could have another year if she wants Applause it just incredible how good she is and Angel at the buzzer time and time again I had her victory over Indiana at the buzzer last year in front of a packed house in Iowa I thought that was ridiculous shes done it time and time again again tonight you think Angel agrees with me that Caitlyn Clark is the most recognizable player in all of college basketball I do I think she has been absolutely unbelievable just from points assists how she makes everyone else better on the floor even if you have an assignment to stop her theres nothing you can do about it but I think too angel Reese might be up there as well with being recognizable and even the nil deals coming into play as well well you know when when Angel was out for that what four game span and then returned it was like the number two story on Sports Center I mean every highlight all in sports all were seeing are Angel Reese or were seeing Caitlin club right nonstop its incredible for sport now the womens game is just been so much fun to watch Skyrocket and the interests and the level of play has been amazing and the thing is you know people why would Caitlyn Clark come back to school well because the money shes going to make is exponentially greater in the college game than it would be in the WNBA sure shes earned it 7966 a little run here for the orange but do they have enough in the tank just over 2 minutes to go Bowski and the Blue Devils on top 7966 R good living right here having a time of his life great seek Su tonight I look at the agility look at the dexterity I love it thats what its all about the holidays right spending time with your kids grandkids yeah this time of the year at Cameron Indoor you can upgrade your your seats because the students have yet to return to campus and a bit of an older version of the Cameron crazy fill all of those seats we were talking to Angel before the game and she was stating how you know and I I watched it on TV the Arizona game know with the students here this is a different place its still loud here with the grad students dont get me wrong but when the kids are on campus I would probably say Allen Fieldhouse and and Cameron Indoor Stadium are probably two of the loudest stadiums Ive ever been in thus far in college Baska totally agree timeout simile Hall gets loud too Arkansas unbelievable Im pushing to do a game day down there this year are you I mean it just that that watching that place and what theyve been able to accomplish down there Eric musman and the style in which he coaches the pace of play its its really incredible to see I think thats a great basketball town and a tremendous Arena Iowa State I did one game in Iowa State my hearing has yet to come back and that was 10 years ago so unreal 7966 Duke and red Entre in the orange trying to make their way back in this Music thing that man Mark Mitchell first half put Duke on his shoulders carried them to a twopoint lead and then Duke started hitting threes finally in the second half havent missed theyve been shooting the lights out since the break inbounded for roach out of the double trying to get free nearly gave it away Mitchell will cross the line heres McCain so no turnover for the orange there under two minutes to play well Duke now going to go to their delay of game strategy here just taking time wind down the clock and get a good shot towards in Mitchell gave it up with one to shoot McCain trying to get it up there and a whistle a foul on the jumper theyll get CAU for that one trying to slow down McCain and those are plays where it just coach arrey cant do anything but laugh see in the replay that was actually a foul or not but you you play well the entire possession defensively and then you foul with one seconds left on the shot clock thats every coachs nightmare so fouling Dukes best foul shooter main 89 the reaction I mean thats thats I say thats every coachs worst nightmare right there its you know youre getting down to 21 and then you make a foul its just like thats just contest a shot without foul please you know I I think Adrien ay is going to be just fine as a head coach I love the style in which Syracuse plays I love this team you talk about mint and the way he can play Brown has played well Copeland I mean they have talent do theyre going to be a force in ACC when things start going well for them offensively I mean its they already won five games in a row but I theyre going to be just fine in this confidence want to rebound it better but theres depth hes playing nine guys and they play manto Man a lot of changes for Syracuse little roller in there but proor got three and knocked it down Point number 10 and 11 for him under a minute Syracuse unable to make that run in the end Duke paid several in the second half to put this game ice and Duke played a a tough game you know Syracuse gave him a fight in the first half once again The X Factor for Duke at times is not down that three and knocking it down you know in volume cuz when they are a good threepoint shooting team it opens up the floor for Kyle Philipi to go to work down low theyre a different ball team thats a triple boy Duke is ridiculous from a threepoint line in the second out werent they so it just gives him a different Dynamic da eight for eight cuz then you cant afford the double palowski down low on the Block you have to stay home and one to one and thats where he starts to go to work so the Duke faithful delighted tonight here at Cameron inor as the Blue Devils beat Syracuse again and they make it nine straight and 11 of the last 12 against the orange so its official Dave now that Jared McCain is shot
