the only time these two teams are going to play in the regular season they could determine a lot here today all right watch the matchups in this game the you know Hunter Tyson whos he going to guard whos going to guard Hunter Tyson Jordan Miller for Miami is a handful in terms of a matchup and nor Chad omear hes only six feet seven but he weighs 250 pounds he has been a real issue for everybody hes played against down on the inside Tim clockerty Keith Kimball Earl Walton on the whistle and the Tigers will have first possession and a bounce pass early for Hall with the right hand and Wooga Poplar the rebound for Miami and heres Nigel pack for a team that averages an ACC play nearly 78 points a game against the best or second best scoring defense in conference play Clemson allowing under 66 a game and throw away by pack and the canes turn it over on their opening possession now Miami doesnt really want to play against that set Clemson defense any more than they have to theyd like to generate some turnovers and get the ball down the court before that defense can get established well we mentioned Isaiah long hes matched up on Chase Hunter as the Tigers work on Miamis mantoman every both teams started mantoman and thats no surprise Tyson and thats not a surprise either Tyson as we said has had a fabulous year 55th triple of the year for the grad student from east of Charlotte on Highway 74 in Monroe North Carolina Applause shefflin is matched up against Jordan Miller thats a tough matchup for Chef all the way from Miller is good boy talk about underrated undervalued call it what you want Jordan Millers terrific he really is hes a very very skilled offensive player hes got all the little moves just like the one you saw right there here is shefflin this is Galloway who returns to the lineup after missing a couple games Reverend Galloway on the board he gives them just something that they dont have without him and that is the ability to get in the lane and break down the defense as well as to shoot the three OMeara against Hall interesting to watch how Clemson switches here against what Miami does and theres the pressure point for the Keynes offensively left hand shot by Miller omir tries to make the save 10 to shooting Wong on the recovery Baseline Miller tried to scoop slapped out and out of bounds it will go to Clemson there was only one left on the shot clock and of course when you talk about the canes Jim larenega nominated for the Basketball Hall of Fame and rightly should be inducted at 73 years of age 713 career wins he and Brad Brownell 1116 wins combined meeting today and Wes interesting enough these guys Brownell and Jim lehrenegger meeting for the 26th time thats an amazing number here is Galloway on the drive he draws the foul a couple of free throws coming on the omir foul itll be his first and the First on Miami we talked about Galloway and his ability to get to the basket that time domir just didnt handle the screen very well and Galloway went looking for contact so heres Brevin Galloway 80 percent at the freethrow line Clemson number one in conference play in the Atlantic Coast Conference at nearly 86 percent at the line and the free throw good for Galloway and of course we mentioned Brad Brownell the Tigers alltime winningest coach with 236 wins and he went over the 400 win mark with a victory against Duke in midJanuary both these guys by the way have 110 ACC wins if you dont think thats any good thats tied for temp all time in the conference and the list ahead is pretty strong as they say most of it in Springfield heres Wong a three ball off the back rim Hunter Skies Miami does a great job getting back on defense they want to set that defense and make the other team play against it look at Hall whirling and did he turn it over he did and in the process fouls Isaiah Wong first on the junior PJ Hall this is going to be tough for TJ hall for PJ Hall to back down omir omir is just too big and strong and Hall loses possession of the ball and then thats not a good foul and that Brad Brownell is telling him now hey youre not going to be able to do that against the guy the size of Amir pass the ball Ben Middlebrooks onto the floor for the first time give Hall a quick break three minutes into the opening half pack heres Wong back to pack Poplar spots up and hits Luca Poplar sophomore from Philadelphia with his first basket well an ACC play Wes he scores about six points a game but hes much more valuable than that hes long hes athletic he can defend and he can score when he needs to 46 percent field goal shooter heres Galloway catching shoot three seven of Clemsons 10 belonged to Brevin I think they missed him the other night yeah that was just one of many vacancies the Tigers had in the loss at Boston College Boston College played very very well they can really guard you they are awfully tough particularly up there at the Conti floor long three long rings the bell 40th triple of the year for Isaiah Wong and Wes its interesting he can really shoot the three but I dont think shooting the three is the best part of his game hes really good getting the ball into the lane hes really good in the midrange Galloway cant answer from the wing Poplar the rebound threepoint tiger lead and heres Wong trying to split some pressure Applause Poplar inside omir and one middle Brooks the foul on the North Shadow mere dunk Applause so Miami bidding to tie the game on five in a row were gonna stop with a step aside for a break here look at that Poplar one hand and the hammer from omir chance to tie when we come back hi Im Wolfgang Puck Senate but you can with Barbara Kennedy Dixon who passed away almost five years ago from cancer but a twotime AllAmerica threetime First Team all ACC twice the tournament MVP and of course an honored Jersey here at Little John Coliseum and was an athletic department administrator here in Clemson our coaching for 31 years and thats how you end up in the Ring of Honor Dan by the way all of that and uh on our weekend where they celebrate the mens basketball alumni great to recognize maybe the premier Legend in womens basketball here at Clemson free throw by omir no good as we rejoin you 109 and substitutions really both ways Middlebrook stays on the floor omir was set to check out but Walker cannot get in the game after the missed free throw well Amir was actually sitting on the bench after the timeout his teammates reminded him that he wouldnt shoot the free throw and Galloway turned his back Tyson threw it into the really good seats across the way and here comes Walker and Bensley Joseph into the Miami Lineup and boy Anthony Walker the third 69 junior from Baltimore and Bonner one of his impact guys is Bensley Joseph 62 sophomore from Arlington Mass what both Walker and Joseph come off the bench and are wonderful role players for this Miami team Joseph is an outstanding Defender and he can shoot a little bit a little bit sloppy here early West and each team I think is very fortunate that the turnovers theyve had have not been transition turnovers to allow their opponent to get down and score easily remember now were talking about Styles making fights at the top remember now Miamis the best field goal shooting team and ACC played almost 48 percent Clemsons number one defending field goals Miami really good in threes Clemson number two defending threes and theres a turn and score for Hunter Applause five minutes gone Poplar and heres Joseph against Hunter interesting to follow the matchups today too Dan absolutely and Clemsons really pushing the defense out Joseph into the corner three ball ring the bell for Jordan Miller thats going to be a really hard matchup for shefflin because Miller he can shoot the three and so if you lay off of him thats a danger if you get up close to him he can drive right by Jordan Miller leads the hurricanes and assists in ACC play Galloway caught in a double team and a whistle and foul Wesson what were seeing early here is Miami is really trying to trap and turn up the defensive pressure on things like screens just to try to surprise the Tigers Jim larenega would like to like his guys to generate some turnovers to get some easy baskets here comes RJ Godfrey who by the way in his played 32 22 minutes the last two games and averaged six points and six rebounds a reason I mentioned 22 minutes Dan thats double his conference average in terms of Court times why hes played very well and in a game like this I think hes got a little more quickness athleticism than shefflin he may be an important guy trying to match up against Miller Godfrey double team again the travel going to be ticketed to the young freshman six seven 235 pounds terrific young player for Brad Brownell is RJ Godfrey Clemsons third turnover Miamis got a pair so in the first almost six minutes twisty you get the impression everybodys still settling in well not him heres Callaway and a foul called on the way up and itll be against Poplar so Wooga Poplar is going to pay for one the Third on Miami and a couple of free throws for Galloway those are the kind of turnovers each team is trying to avoid Wes Applause so Galloway will go to the line and hes already got seven free throw good dont forget Tuesday night another mens basketball doubleheader Pittsburgh whos got the weekend off theyre headed to meet Louisville at home at the Peterson Event Center NC State travels to number six Virginia and after the Cavaliers lost today and the way the wolf pack were tested Dan by Georgia Tech that one has got plenty on the table doesnt it oh wow thats gonna be a heck of a game yep thats Tuesday night the doubleheader here on acc Network Wes one of the things that went really well for Clemson against Boston College is they made all 16 of their free throw attempts theyre four for four today so far here is Poplar on the drive the scoop and we got another whistle and a foul and thats on Godfrey so RJ RJ Godfreys first its the third on Brad Brownells Club and I believe Poplar is going to end up at the freethrow line as a result here where Poplar is the guy we talked about the fact that he is uh hes a terrific athlete and he doesnt have that many freethrow attempts but he showed you right there he can drive the ball to the basket free throw good Applause and of course when we talk about free throw shooting these are the top three in the ACC Clemsons one Duke two later tonight of course and Miami three poplars got four hes only had two double figure games in the last six one of them was a 14point effort at Florida State and you see Harlan Beverly see the floor for the first time Junior from Detroit who missed most of last year with some back issues but has provided key minutes here 14 minutes a game in conference play look at Dylan Hunter now a double team got it to Gottfried Applause Miami really trying to apply the pressure Galloway heres Gottfried thats a three and that is good third three of the year for Godfrey very Bonner like I thought with the shot fake and well you know hes now three for four in ACC play shooting threes at the answer at the other end the three ball goes pounding for Walker Applause heres middle Brooks Galloway short hairball hits the in line itll go to Miami I Im not sure that Brad Brownell wants that particular shot now he wants this shot this is just a really nice job by Godfrey to get his feet set he was really close to the line got a home Rim got a home Rim didnt he you know Miami is a little bit undersized and I think Clemson would be well advised to move the ball try to create some mismatches on the inside Beverly to Wong omear back on the floor remember hes got a foul look at butcher oh wow long squeezed the trigger from between two tigers and last Touch by Clemson says Tim cochrony so it will stay with Miami with eight to shoot heres Nigel pack to replace Isaiah Wong now Jim lehrenegger nice move here you get Wong ahead of what might be a dead ball at the under 12 heres Alex Hemingway to play for just the second time since midDecember played 15 minutes the other night at Boston College Walker turns with a right hand on Godfrey OMeara the rebound and fouled on the way up and I believe middle Brooks catches the foul he does thatll be his second four on Clemson first tiger with two and nor Chad omear who was the Sun Belt Player of the Year season to go to Arkansas state to the line one of the critical transfers into Jim lareneggers program twoshot chance in the first one no good dont forget Thursday night a womens basketball doubleheader for you Olivia miles and number nine Notre Dame hosts Pittsburgh at six and then NC State and Wake Forest from WinstonSalem and of course the deacons with the great star Jules Speer right here on acc Network always available on the ESPN app ear hits his first free throw in three tries and Clemson with a twopoint lead tigers are five of their last seven from the floor hutter pestered by Joseph and theres a foul on Joseph banging into Gottfried but as a defensive player Youre simply not allowed to blow right into the guy setting the screen against the rules is that it is its uh its its not approved theres Alex Hemingway second game first back at home its going to be an adjustment for him Les trying to get back into the swing of things PJ Hall returned as well by the way on the middle Brooks foul heres Hunter Chase to Dylan and then thrown away trying to go crosscourt to Hemingway here is pack on the layup and were tied first points for Nigel pack West they had PJ Hall on the inside but Bensley Joseph put such great pressure on the ball handler that he couldnt see it theres Chase Hunter and hell call a timeout Walker and Beverly had forced the double team for coach laronega time out tied at 17 at Tiger Town Music foreign but Bensley Joseph does a great job jumping up in the air so Dylan Hunter cant see him and instead Dylan Hunter throws the ball across the court and Nigel pack is just waiting for that and so what Clemson wants to do they want to put the ball in PJ Halls hands inside but when you get pressure on the guards on the outside sometimes they cant see to make that pass Brad Brownell and his staff knew Miami would pressure at the defensive end of the floor whats whats made it work here Dan well I think what has made it work for Miami is theyre not doing it every time right you know they come down the court and they they dont pressure they just play regular defense and then like the second or third time down the court all of a sudden theyre pressuring you when Clemson sets the screen and the Tigers simply havent reacted very well I mean Clemsons made some threes but PJ Hall has not been a factor in this game Jim larenegger and his staff tried to take off one of the big portals in Clemsons success heres Hemingway on a catch they return it to Hunter now 10 to shoot Chase caught in a double team here it is again fires it out front Godfrey tees up another one off the rim and boy Hall thought he was fouled by AJ Casey but instead the rebound from Miami well again West that double team off the screen PJ Hall was alone inside but they couldnt see him yep thats where the double teams are coming is off those screens look at pack just circles the half court on the dribble and gets it back from Beverly and the three spins out let for Hunter Hemingway heres Hall trailing trying to get it to Godfrey on the Block RJ strong to the basket five for the freshman and the difference there is BJ Hall is big enough he can see over the top of Nigel pack and thats great position by Godfrey inside guy Godfrey inside and a really really nice move Beverly attacking hanging jump shot got through the rebound Hunter wants Godfrey to help him now Hemingway launches jumped out of the hoop now Hemingway hes got a you know hes got to settle into the game but I think thats too quick in the corner of three ball off the arm of Bensley Joseph Music now lets see if Miami traps this time down the court heres Hall with Casey back to Hunter Chase working against Joseph A Little Fall Away and the rebound for AJ Casey hes a 69 freshman from Chicago got a Whitney Young High School which is one of the more heralded programs in Illinois Applause gets Hunter kick out long three Beverly how about you Harlan Beverlys 83 of the year and its on the board to give Miami the lead at 20 to 19 by an ACC play he comes in shooting only 27 percent but thats what Miami wants to do they drop the defense down and theyll kick it out to a threepoint shooter Tyson rips it for him and way inside Hall first points for PJ Hall come with 9 22 to play in the first half thats a really good job by Hemingway to pass up the three and get a better shot all of this and Wong on the bench and Casey on the drive scooped it up Tyson pulls it away and thatll be a foul on AJ Casey itll be his first itll be five on Miami Here Comes Wong omear back onto the floor Casey and Joseph out West this is just a situation where the Clemson defense reacts down on the inside trying to cover a pack and pack does a great job finding an open man across the court Homers return Miller Wong Beverly for Miami Weston the guy who stayed in the game is Godfrey yeah see theres the Trap again into the corner here is Galloway tried to slip it inside turned it over was trying to get it Godfrey heres pack ahead for Beverly and Miami thats when the canes are at their best and thats what they want to do they want to force turnovers and get easy baskets heres Hunter back for PJ Hall three ball away front rim missed Tyson tried to keep it alive and it ends up in the hands of Jordan Miller Applause Harlan Beverly on the drive and omir took it from Tyson and scored thats just great hands Wes we talked about the fact that Amir they list him at six feet seven but hes weighs 250 pounds and that was just power he just overpowered 100 threepoint lead from Miami heres Hall trying to help Tyson with a screen Miami hedged on the double team now Galloway into the paint Brevin squeezed it up it fell off the iron Godfrey missed the follow chance and heres Miami now in a bit of a run its a run keyed by their defense Wes Music threepoint lead for laronegas team with seven and a half to go Miller a three Tyson the rebound omir wanted a foul didnt get it and OMeara hes hes talking to the official coming up the court Hunter out of the corner double team Hall Tyson and Wong got a hand on a pass intended for Galloway we thought it might be good two teams in the top 25 battling here today Clemson thought brought to you by Food Lion well if youre in Miami youre looking to create extra opportunities and here they do it on the offensive boards and this is just North Chad omir who is an outstanding rebounder particularly offensive he just overpowers Hunter Tyson who himself is one of the best rebounders in the ACC omearas got 16 games Im sorry 12 games this year with 10 or more rebounds his high is 16 against Syracuse and he does a terrific job in this young man from Nicaragua and you mentioned six seven 250 pounds he averaged 18 and 12 last year at Arkansas state with 20 double doubles Stan well I dont care where you get your double doubles when you get 20 of them youre getting them hes got three rebounds today theyre all offensive rebounds yeah in fact Clemsons been blanked at the offensive window Galloway on an inbounds to Hunter and heres the Trap again you cant run away from it cross court for Chauncey Wiggins whos comed in middle Brooks into the ball game as well out of a double team back for a Wiggins three wow ninth triple of the year for Long Tall Chauncey Wiggins wow when Wiggins has some time Wes he can shoot the three well he squared right up there tied it at 24 oh what a fun game so far huh glad were here appreciate you all being a part of it deep three from the tiger paw off the back arm for back and then stolen on the outlet by shefflin into the lane goes Miller and the score turnover an immediate reward for Miami shefflin just never saw him just never saw him thats the thing that Jordan Miller does hes such a smart player another turnover for Clemson and another one that results in an easy basket twopoint lead for the canes and theres an unforced error on the missed connection to Hunter Poplar and omir coming back from Miami during the break shuffling gets the rebound and he never sees Jordan Miller who turns around and takes a look and thats a very easy play for Miami Applause now neither Middlebrooks or Hall on the floor and omeares back out there was shefflin heres Wong pack into the lane Tyson defends tough shot and Nigel packs got four you cant guard him any better than that that is a really tough shot Nigel back they list him at six feet tall he got that one up over the six eight hundred Tyson there is Tyson trying to get into traffic gets to the basket but a whistle foul was on the deck Earl Walton will ticket luga Poplar with his second and that is six now on Miami pack drives into Lane and Tyson is in great position Wes and again thats a six foot guy going up over a six eight guy so Poplar out Harlan Beverly in and heres the luxury of the depth that Miami has Poplar coming off at sophomore and of course you get Beverly the 66 junior who averages about Five Points a game two Off the Bench shot fake and a hunter jump shot that bounds away they Scramble for it and Wongs got it in the open floor trying to get to the basket around three tigers and then he threw it away trying to roll it out on the bounce pass to pack fourth turnover on Miami Wes whats happening is when the Clemson big guys middle Brooks or shefflin set a screen the Miami guys are double teaming and just ignoring them shefflin heres Wiggins Applause now shuffling around omir got him in the air cant finish but draws the foul pretty crafty basketball for me and shefflin thats a really good play by shefflin Wes he has looked over matched a little bit in this game so far but at that time he made the nice spin move got to the basket and thats the second foul on North Chad omear so Amir will go out of the ball game I believe theres uh Anthony Walker has come to the table shefflin to the line hes 75 percent first of two is no good dont forget tonight about 8 30 Eastern time the nothing but net crew breaks down the day in the ACC highlights an analysis of all the games and a look ahead to the best games in the coming week Kelsey Riggs with the national champs Barry Boozer and Hancock on accn shefflin gets one of two for his first point Miami by three Walker did come in the 69 junior to replace North Chad omear and each team going with a little bit smaller lineup Wes Miller against Tyson and lefthand Runner no good tapped home his own Miss nine for Jordan Miller and theres that guy again Dan what a quick jump you know he shot the ball bounced down and bounced right back up fivepoint lead back to the biggest of the afternoon for Miami heres Hunter with pack on him Chase into traffic Tyson launches and hits Wes Im telling you they got away with one right there did the Tigers because that was a very weak pass from Hunter it looks like he didnt get everything behind it they were fortunate they didnt lose that ball 14 in Miamis 30 have come in the paint and every once in a while they throw one in from behind the line Walker was shuffling back to Isaiah Wong on the drive and a foul coming on the drive and free throws for Wong and the foul will be on Wiggins itll be his first five on Clemson well this is just a great job right here by Jordan Miller he he gets the floor and goes right back up Hunter Tyson went to block the shot and took himself out of the play two shots for Wong eighth best freethrow shooter in the ACC Applause Music and Bensley Joseph for Nigel pack in the Miami Lineup Longs got three points couple of rebounds well Wong is the guy who can he can Cruise along having three or four points and all of a sudden he explodes before now and backcourt pressure offered by Joseph against Hunter and Joseph is a guy who can really pressure you yep heres Galloway who started off really Pace Clemson early shuffling hands to Hunter right back inside they go and shepler sets it down West what did I just say theyre ignoring the shefflin when he sets the screen and that time Clemson was able to find him inside and make him pay for it Tigers to within a point travel on Bensley Joseph that will get us to the timeout the under four if you will tigers and canes and Ian sheplin puts his name in the book here watch here here theyre trying to set the play and you notice Miami and thats Anthony Walker right there he is matched up against Ian shefflin and watch what he does when shefflin makes this handoff well he goes and then Hunter is able to get around him and so you got two guys trying to guard hunter that leaves a mismatch down on the inside shuffling does a great job getting positioned thats what Clemson has not been doing effectively when Miami has jumped those screens the Tigers have not been able to get past the double team if they can get past the double team West theyve got a four on three and they took advantage that time and you can simulate as much as you want but top games a lot faster until you see it yep one point game here is Hunter again now Tyson long three for the lead to shoot over it Dan well thats a thats another good way to do it but see Walkers playing off of him because hes trying to prevent him to throw from throwing the ball inside Clemson back in front on the third triple of the half for Hunter Tyson Walker tried to answer Hunter the rebound Tigers want to run here Applause I think five in the white might be feeling it Applause live for Hall saves it for Tyson juggled the catch now soft jumper thats a heck of play Wes thats a heck of a play by Hall to get the ball and then that was a perfect pass that Tyson just juggled but he didnt take a bad shot well step aside Clemson on a run to take a fourpoint lead Music follow the league and theyre people that talk about the league well people who follow the league and talk about the league know how good a year Hunter Tysons had Dan a little run here shows you well Tyson he hits the jumper because they give it to him wide open and then they run out and they contest the three the next time hes able to drive the ball past and make a really tough shot all the building blocks he and PJ Hall and Chase Hunter to a degree are put in to what is a terrific season so far for Clemson so far PJ Hall did a great job West to run that pass down yeah that ball was headed out of bounds Jordan Miller inside offensive foul Hunter Tyson draws that one Hunter Tyson is a better matchup defensively against Jordan Miller whos able to have his way with shefflin but Tyson I mean he moves his feet hes got his position established and Miller runs him over fourpoint lead tigers on a 70 run the last 95 seconds and change Miller now will draw Tyson defensively and heres Wiggins inside for Hall strong to the basket look Casey did a terrific job defending the rim he sure did but if youre Hall you got to make that shot you got to use your power and get that one and that was rejected by Wiggins weve got a couple of good plays at the basket by Defenders and again pack is six feet tall and Wiggins was standing there waiting for him thats a nice job to avoid the foul long back rim Miss well if youre Clemson you got to take advantage of the fact that Wong is struggling offensively putter PJ Hall trying to help with the screen Chase on the drive left it short Isaiah long tries to create an opportunity for Miami who Trails four Beverly against Wiggins behind the back nice pass terrific layup Nigel pack Harlan Beverly with the full bag of tricks how did Beverly even see him Wes stops the 70 Run by the Tigers Hall squares jumper bounds away PJ Hall had a tough game in BC the other night and hes having a tough afternoon so far yeah just 104 and a three ball off the mark from long Applause thank you here is Hunter walking it into the four course we go inside of a minute looks like everybodys trying to catch them this has been a very intense Full House in Little John Hunter has shot fake now hell take back to the basket scoop it bounces off tough tough shot Wes twopoint game and the dump for Beverly in transition seven off laronegas bench for the Detroit Junior Weston sometimes when youre taking tough shots it allows your opponent to get out and go its just almost like a turnover five second differentials we wind down this half locked up at 35 Applause foreign Brownell shouts the offensive set he wants for his team 10 to shoot Applause back for hunter from Galloway four to shoot heres Hunter working around three balls off the back rim four seconds left heres Wong hell race it across the mid Court Galloway Wheats then heres Wong and he wont go because the horn had sounded so theyre tied at 35 two of the best teams in the ACC Clemson is 102 in the league Miami is eight and four Virginia Pitt calls for Miami the only guy with two personal fouls for Clemson is Middle Brooks but of course hes not in there at the moment Applause Music no bear heres Wong and Poplar as Miami gets their offense going here Applause and Wong had a very very quiet first half but you cant that wont continue and there on cue is Isaiah Wong his second field goal both are threes and he has now got seven in the ball game and Miami hes got an early threepoint lead here in half two and I think if youre Clemson West you got to play good defense but youve got to be able to score consistently because Miamis going to put points on the board Tyson and the double team had a charred Loose by Papa 12 to shoot and heres Hall with omir and PJ working on the big fella lost it turning into the lane Hall will go to the deck and a hell ball will go to Clemson Wes and again we see PJ Hall struggling trying to back omir down omir just wont give way and Hall isnt able to handle the ball when the defense comes to help out four to shoot for the Tigers and the Baseline for Chase Hunter and heres Galloway who went a long time without scoring after a hot start and that three is off the rim well its his last basket was at 16 31 left in the first half pack out of three rattle out Applause Galloway trying to use the hall screen shuffling for Tyson back for PJ Hall three ball well okay I cant work at the Block Ill step out here man hes a pretty good threepoint shooter 23rd uh or 20 20th three of the year for Hall 38 all the score each team has been in the mantoman defense Miami doing a lot of pressure and in the first half well see if they continue those double teams in the second Poplar with Tyson trying to cover tend to shoot long on the bounce off the omear screen thats what Isaiah Wong does and the jumper wont go Hall tried to keep it alive fresh 20 from Miami if they want it Jordan Miller and he almost threw it in the backcourt terrific save by pack heres Wong but with 10 to shoot another offensive rebound from Miami three ball pack got it and a deep one for Nigel pack his 53rd three of the year his first today now the extra opportunities Wes are really starting to add up for the Hurricanes yep threepoint lead again from Miami Hunter Tyson will try and tie cannot omir the rebound I think if youre Clemson youre satisfied with that shot by Tyson every time of course youd like to see it go in but Clemson relies on Hunter Tyson to make that one a great majority of the time here is Miller with shefflin 10 to shoot again trying to go to omir here is Miller skip back Poplar will try three and hit how about this three threes by Miami to start the half and the lead its largest now for the canes at six calling omir again PJ trying to roll on omir with a right hand scores it well that book looks more like the PJ Hall were used to seeing West got himself to a good spot and hes able to get up over omir Applause cuts the Clemson deficit to four early here in the second Applause Miami can really put pressure on your defense but as they got a lot of guys who can contribute pack slides through Hall blocked it shuffling the rebound heres Hunter stops and Pops nope and the rebound omir Applause when you get a wide open one like that Wes I think you have to take it theres Poplar step in two and he knocks it down I dont how many is Miami missed here in the second half my goodness Keynes are five From Poplar nine in the game in the lead back to six they are four of seven from the floor here in the second half including three threes well Wes remember one of those threes came after an offensive rebound so they got back one of their misses and converted it into a three heres Holland OMeara again PJ right hand jump hook rolling now seven and a half nine in the game for PJ hall now Clemson which played very well defensively in the first half really has to dig in now Wes they may have found something inside with PJ Hall remember omir has those two personal fouls heres Wong trying to use that omir screen Miller of three wow Miami now has got four threes in their fivemate field goals and the lead its largest at seven they are four for five behind the line to start the second 20 minutes heres Hunter kick out for Hall three ball away long rebound pack ahead Hall stole it intended for omir Outlet to Hunter ahead for Tyson Galloway short and it will Bound Away out of bounds and that will get us to a timeout a long distance flurry from Miami here Dan well these guys can shoot at West we said theyre one of the best offensive teams in the conference theyve got a seven point lead hello like threes youve come to the right spot here in half two well these guys they only shot 25 percent in the first half West but they have a lot of weapons theyve made four or five threepoint baskets here in the second half and West the fourth threepoint baskets have been made by four different guys poplars made one Millers made one Wongs made one Pax made one now pack shot it from where it might be five points youre standing out there in one of the tiger paws one of the tiger toes seven point lead and the ball from Miami Poplar and here is Nigel pack Applause Walker on a hard drive against Godfrey whos spelled shuffling during the timeout long in traffic and one Wes that is one of the things that is so difficult to defend about Miami that we talked about how long hell go along and you know he just he doesnt seem to be doing very much but then all of a sudden when they need points hes able to go and get a basket hes made a three now he drives into the lane and scores first on the red shirt freshman Beatle and Wongs got six in the half and make it 10 in the ball game Clemsons in a little bit of trouble here its a 10point game this is a point in the game where if theyre going to get back in they got to start crawling in Tigers who are riding a 15game win streak here at Little John Coliseum before they back off Beetle now Josh four of 20 from three this year Hall double teamed and a foul going to be called on Isaiah long and the head coach of the Hurricanes right here in front of us not particularly happy with the whistle Wong is trying to get there while Hall is dribbling the basketball and he doesnt make it Hall is picking up the ball if he gets there well Hall is dribbling the ball the referee lets him take it but usually theyre not going to let a guard slap down when the big guy is holding the ball we dont see Beetle and Hunter together much for Brownell but we are here in this exchange with almost six minutes gone heres Hunter floater good Chase Hunter now just his second field goal been a quiet day for number one it sure has and just as it was quiet for Wong in the first half and hes gotten going in here in the second Hunter needs to get going in the second half for Clemson Miami the ball with the eight point Advantage Poplar on the drive had it knocked away tigers in transition three on two Hunter a little Euro floater no good they crashed the glass Tyson couldnt control it Miami trying to Turn and Burn and a carry by Miller he faked the ball hand off and Jim larenega who uses that whistle to get his clubs attention hes got one of the best whistles ever Wes hes holding the ball and he rolled it he rolled it picked it up in his hand and then started again thats easy thats the old world B free dribble isnt it the one way to roll it back for those of you not familiar just Google it Joseph checks in hes a defensive stopper hell get Hunter for Miami when Godfrey is back in the game because shefflin is having was having a hard time matching up against Jordan Miller yep heres Hall skips it to the corner Hunter a triple couldnt ask for a better look for Chase Hunter Wes what are the tigers Miss 17th straight field goal attempts in the game against Boston College and Boston College played pretty good defense but all of the shots that they missed werent contested shots this is what were saying when you play Miami Miami exerts offensive pressure on you they score and that net puts pressure on your offense to match them and so far here in the second half the Tigers havent been able to do it Beetle commits his second hell stay on the floor and there is a twopoint basket for Wong now all of a sudden hes got eight make it 12 in the game ten point lead again boy the flurry from Miami the four threes to start the second half are the markers here in the in the ball game fatal on the drive turns with the left hand omir clears it thats great defense he Beetle drives into the lane and theres four green shirts standing there waiting for Applause Clemson is 14 on the glass poplars three and got for clears Applause got to make sure in this sequence that either Hunter Tyson or PJ Hall handle the ball in scoring position Hunter and Omer and Poplar took it away nor Chad the floor and cant finish but they get the rebound Poplar scurries through and collects it 30 rebounds now from Miami is really mixing it up with a lot of people out there hes got to be careful Walker on a hard drive into the corner and a three ball just barely misses graze the rim off the hand to Joseph and now all of a sudden we get a break at the Under 12 here Miamis got a 10point lead Isaiah Wong leading the way for the canes in half two Music theyre all kinds of Food Lion this afternoon on acc Network and Miamis built a 10point lead here at Littlejohn against Clemson and Dan the rebound margin is plus 13 and you see the note 24 straight wins for the canes when they win the rebound margin Wes they have really done an outstanding job on the boards and so far Clemson has zero offensive rebounds so for the Tigers it really is one and done yeah and the other thing Clemson hasnt been able to get to the freethrow line theyve theyve attempted six free throws made five at Boston College they were 1616 from the line so they were able to get to the line but Miamis playing good defense without fouling and here in the second half Miami started to put the ball in the basket on a regular basis and its a 104 Advantage rebound wise for Miami in the second half Tigers down 10 as we rejoin you Paul heres Hemingway off the screen Applause thats what Hemingway does hes a threepoint shooter West and hes a catch and shoot threepoint guy and were going to get a foul on beetle and it will be his third all here in the second half third on Clemson well she see an awful lot of illegal screens called on offensive players but you know if theyre established and set the defense cant just run right through him Walker tried to bounce into Amir the catch on Hall and hell miss the shot but PJ Hall will get ticketed with his second and four now on the tigers with a couple of free throws for omir one of the things that happens here with Miami knocking down threes that forces the Clemson defense to push out a little further and so that creates a oneonone opportunity inside for omir and again at his size hes only six feet seven but that hes very muscular free throw is good six now for omir dont forget a special edition of all access the ACC life Monday night at seven oclock and this is about the Civil Rights Movement Dallin couple hosts a journey that features ACC student athletes and administrators from all 15 member schools as they made the move from Montgomery to Selma and of course the Edmund Pettus Bridge seven oclock Eastern on acc Network and always available on the ESPN F 7 for omir now and the lead is a dozen well they can post him up inside because of his muscularity and thats an offensive foul on Hall Walker did a terrific job stepping in the line of fire and the collision by Hall will make it his third and the fifth on Clemson when again theres the double team of the guy coming off the screen and that time Walker reacted perfectly to help out on the inside so thats two quick fouls on Hall and lets see if Miami tries to go back to omir with Clemsons defense worried about the threepoint shooting theres not a lot of Hope for Hall inside well you said we started the half maybe with Clemson trying to gear in on omir to get him a third and now Halls got three Clemsons got five fouls Miami won here in the second half here is Beverly rerouting on Hemingway and thatll be an offensive foul on Harlan Beverly using the left arm his first second in the half on Miami Sometimes the best defense West is just to get in the way and thats exactly what Hemingway did he was beaten off the dribble and Beverly made a mistake pushing off Walker Switched Off on Hemingway Clemsons gone three and a half without a basket trailing Now by 12 Hunter Galloway that was partially blocked by Bensley Joseph just scrambles out there sure does here is pack of Fall Away and omir had it lost it Hunter away into the corner Galloway three first points since early in the first half double figures now for Brevin Galloway and that was a basket that Clemson desperately needed West Tigers cut it back to single digits under 10 to go Mir with Hall defending and off the foot of North Shadow mayor and turned over to Clemson Tigers looking for baskets and this is a nice job by Galloway to run to the open area and Hunter finds him and then down on this end Hemingway does a nice job helping out against omir and forces the turnover now can the Tigers convert again heres Hall on the post hands to Hunter shot fake Galloway little floater Hall the top follow first offensive rebound of the day for Clemson on PJ Halls fifth field goal five in a row and Jim larenega smartly punches the time out here Miami doesnt need to turn it over or give Clemson any more momentum in a building where theyve won 15 straight Applause when the details take precedence the rest just three halves Dan West it sure has been hes made four of his five field goal attempts hes helped out very well defensively and hes had a little bit better success against omir and now Galloway drives to the basket and because he draws the defense including omir Hall is in position for the first offensive rebound of the game for Clemson so Hall is has it rolling a little bit but Clemson needs to get somebody else going here in the second half Hunter Tyson hes only taken one shot here in the second half and he missed it OMeara and Hall remember one playing with three one playing with two heres pack all trying to help step back pack three wow Nigel pack was six in the half a pair of Threes a dozen in the game in the lead back to ten another great deal you can do about that if youre PJ Hall he did everything he could to try to stay in front of him but Hall cant guard him out there right corner Galloway inside heres Hall and score but and thats fine Wes thats exactly what Clemson needs to do but its going to be hard to come back if youre trading Twos for threes PJ five for six in the second half now from the floor for his 11 points Music Wong now heres Packers riding the hot hand now Wong attacks on the dribble with seven back for pack and a long three again Tyson the rebound Tigers trailing eight Applause and eight minutes to go here at Little John Hemingway a little floater rimmed off Poplar the rebound West they got to figure out a way to get 100 Tyson the ball inside against Ruger popular hes really got an advantage in there though mayor squeezes It Up and Under Chad OMeara his third field goal gives him nine four in the second half and Miami pushes it right back to double figures he does such a great job using that big body of his and PJ Hall has to be careful I gotta bring some help and its dangerous because Miamis got threepoint Shooters out there in the corner Hemingway knocks it down Alex Hemingways first points since December 17th on his 28 threepointer well now can you get a stop Wes yep thats the question for the Clemson Tigers Miami has had great Precision on offense here in the second half Wes we talked about other really good offensive team pack had it Rim off oh yeah Applause keep your eye on five in the white here its been a quiet second half for Hunter Tyson hes three away from a thousand in his career by the way hutter bounce pass Hall fouled on the way up by Nigel pack third on Miami first on the sophomore from Indianapolis Nigel Packs been terrific well this is really a tough Hall is doing everything he can but Peck just drives him off with the dribble and then drills the three wow Dan just in case you were wondering thats one thing that I was not wondering I know I wonder about a lot of things but Im not wondering about that third time since 1960 neither teams been ranked by the way third time third time since 1960 first time since 1958 I think that nobody named shasheski or Smith is involved in the game nothing or any you know Smith Guthrie Doherty Williams free throw by Hall is good front end of a twoshot chance for PJ Hall dont forget womens basketball for you on Thursday night double dip Olivia miles in number nine Notre Dame welcome pit to South Bend and then NC State Wake Forest follows from WinstonSalem at the Joel ACC basketball on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app Pauls got them both and Middlebrooks get a couple of minutes in here banging around with nor Chad OMeara tigers are within five TJ Hall has 13 points in the second half West and the Tigers really need to get somebody else going you know the hunters two for ten galloways three for ten long through two screens in the catch and middlebrooks the switch defensively thats a nice job by Middlebrooks right back do it again long three and the rebound for Tyson who just squared on ochado North Chad OMeara to get the box out theres a loop ahead and Middlebrooks the catch and score to within three are the tigers as we go inside six to play Poplar and here is pack against Chase Hunter on the Drive Middle Brooks there seven to shoot feeds Miller Missed It rebound Middlebrooks putter oh he shook North Shadowmere couldnt finish thats a tough shot pack on the drive and draws the foul from Middlebrooks third on Ben Middlebrook six on Clemson and a couple of free throws coming from Nigel pack Applause Chase Hunter does a great job with the block out of omir and then for one of the few times today the Tigers get out running nice job by Middlebrook to get down the court before everybody else crowd booing at the replay on the board here at Littlejohn as pack goes to the line and knocks the free throw down 84 percent but just the 20th attempt of the year for Nigel pack that might be a big turnaround in this game the two that chase Hunter didnt get because he was forced into a difficult shot and then the free throws here Pax got 14 now with four rebounds and three assists and hes got eight and a half and Miami back by five Hemingway now heres hunter in the double team skip into the corner for Tyson nice recovery by Miamis Wooga Poplar on the drive slips it middle Brooks he battles for it lost it unless you have to dump that on the doorstep Middlebrooks couldnt finish fivepoint game under five to go knocking it back get a better shot than that long trying to beat Galloway all the way into the corner heres Poplar a catching shoe got it Wooga Poplar eight in the half 12 in the game Wes he has been a huge offensive factor and what a play by Wong to find him five straight by Miami to push it back to Hemingway trying to cut into it its short Middlebrook tapped it up off the glass and it went in Wes he missed one that couldnt have been any easier and then that was an unbelievably tough one great Hustle by Middlebrooks degree of difficulty pretty yeah sixpoint game long trying to set up Galloway the span the layup beautiful twist and score by Isaiah wall Wes I cant tell you how important it is in a game like this coming down the stretch to have a closer and thats what Isaiah Wong is yep 14 points now for Wong 10 in the second half eightpoint lead Galloway on the attack he will squeeze and score Wong draws the foul his second fourth on Miami time out as we go under four in Little John Applause the network basketball is presented by Food Lion the official grocer of the Atlantic Coast Conference Music running a food pantry can be a lot of work 25 previous meetings in their coaching careers of Jim larenega and Brad brownells got a fivegame lead on Brownell but Ill tell you what both these guys are grinding and so are their teams heres Galloway going to the breakdown to draw the foul for more Galloway just does a great job using his pivot foot on the inside nobody comes to help Galloway is a powerful guy and thats thats a basket that the Tigers really needed Omar Miller Wong pack and Wooga Poplar and PJ Hall back in for the stretch run we wanted to know who from Clemson was going to help out PJ Hall and here its been Galloway again Hunter Tyson has been quiet in this second half has only attempted one field goal Galloway knocks down the free throw hes five for five six and a half 15 in The Game and his return to the tiger lineup after a lower abdomen injury forced him to miss two games now Nigel pack against Chase Hunter foreign jumps out on Tyson and haul the rebound and Clemsons playing Heming Hemingway and that has allowed Tyson to be able to match up against Jordan Miller and thats a much better defensive matchup for the Tigers here is Tyson trying to score on Poplar got in the air and the cylinder right its on Poplar Tyson established his space here right Dan yeah and you cant jump into that space and this is exactly what happens here Tyson has the ball and he jumps right into him thats thats called the cylinder unless you have an imaginary cylinder around you thats basically your space and you cant jump in there and create contact theres Hunter on the handoff they try to get it to Tyson instead heres Hull you wandered at the half about 24 in the white threepoint game under three to go thank you here is pack inside score tough shot Nigel pack what a shot he has been terrific Applause Wes we talked about this Dynamic backcourt these guys are make plays back to a fivepoint Miami lead Tyson thought about it he will shoot back rim Miss really good defense by Poplar Tyson I think has a better advantage against Poplar on the inside on the outside I think Poplar can handle it Omer Wong now with help Galloway played under the screen the drive and the shot fell out West I think were in must score territory for Clemson here inside two to go Hunter on the drive came to a stop finds Hall against omear boy has he put on a show in the second half inside 90 seconds to go and a Jim Blair and Nega timeout 126 to go in a threepoint game with the Tigers and canes 273 from Miami and Nigel pack is taken to Center Stage Wes we talked about having closers and pack is just like that I mean you this guy is six feet tall he uses his quickness to freeze PJ hall and then gets the ball up past him thats just a heck of a play PJ Halls got 19 in the game but Dan hes been all over the place 17 of it in the second half well he does a great job they find him here and he those are the kind of shots he was struggling with in the first half but he just Powers his way to the basket as we are very accustomed to see Music Applause you know Miamis got veteran ties an excellent guards and thats exactly what you need in this kind of a situation Pax circles around Hunter plays all the way through for it now heres Pat at the top Miller with Tyson there five to shoot lost it on the dribble two one Millers forces it it grazes the iron they Scramble for it omir got it back and draws the foul unless you have to get that rebound to fear the tigers that was a great defensive set its on Galloway seven now on Clemson well its not two shots for OMeara the Tigers have a better chance if that ball actually hits the rim and bounces away a normal rebound does but omir just with great hands gets in there and grabs it first run from omir is good dont forget Tuesday night more ACC basketball Louisville and Pittsburgh at the Peterson Event Center Jeff capels team enjoying the weekend off after a big win in Chapel Hill NC State and Virginia nine oclock on accn in the ESPN app and omir only got one of the two izonia 66 percent freethrow shooter in ACC play now after Clemson can you take advantage inside a minute to go Clemson down four hutter Hemingway Tyson on the drive back for Hall 10 to shoot for the Tigers PJ rolling on omir put it out no whistle Tyson tried to follow were at Brownell I think really wanted a foul call there did not get it and now with 28 seconds left Tyson has to foul luga Poplar that will be the first on Tyson thats eight on Clemson and Poplar one and one down here to our right West once again PJ Hall isnt able to force his way past omir and with the shot clock running down hes got no choice but to launch this one up there you know Amir keeps his position I you know that theres nothing that I dont see anything there and then Tyson he just mistimed that yep so here is Poplar 84 and two for two eight in the half and the free throw good and that makes it a fivepoint game Poplar has had a heck of a game West yep and not only offensively but you have to say that his defensive effort is a big reason why we havent heard at all from Hunter Tyson in this hat yep very quiet second half for Tyson who had 11 in the first half unless its hard to score if you never shoot the ball and hes only attempted one shot in this half yep 14 in the game for Poplar you got to go quickly and you got to get a three hotter on the drive and a timeout for Brownell thats six for Chase hutter with 212 left its a fourpoint game 7369 Miami who was trying to win their fourth Road game in conference play this year they have split their last eight games theyre 175 and 84 but Weston at 102 though Clemsons got a little wiggle room because Virginia lost today too Dan and if youre the Clemson Tigers youre looking obviously that foursified second violation or to get a steal and if you dont then youve got to foul right away but youve got a problem in there because Isaiah Wong in conference play 86 percent from the freethrow line Jordan Miller 80 percent Nigel packed 90 percent Ruger Poplar 80 percent and they just put Harlan Beverly in the game hes 93 theres a quick look we show you the landscape on Clemson and Miami remember this is a single game in the ACC so whoever wins the game has the tie break if those two end up tied some way or another in the standings and these single games have proved to be really interesting so far west and so they put ball handlers in the game and they took omir out of the game that mirrors a 66 freethrow Shore the lowest percentage free throw shooter on the court right now is 78 percent for Miami trying to get it into pack they get it to Miller now back to Wong and theres the reach around fouled by Tyson and thats not the guy but you didnt have much Choice as Dan just outlined you have no time and so you talk about closing Isaiah long with 19 seconds left got a chance to push it to six Beverly was checking in for Nigel pack its a 11 for Isaiah Wong and its good and whoa West just never changes his facial expression Applause Music and the second one no good fivepoint game but 18 seconds to play gotta go Clemsons got to look for a three here early they try to get it to Tyson he makes the save nine seconds left he will drive and Lay It Up timeout Brad Brownell was 62 left its a threepoint game they were trying to find Tyson they were trying to find Hemingway and Miami knows what theyre trying to do and they just reacted very well tipping that ball in the air what did that take about three seconds yeah and Hunter Tyson ends up getting his first point to the second half which is 62 seconds left after an 11 Point first half and now Dylan Hunter is going to come in the game and Clemson is going to go for the quick foul however it will be their 10th the next foul will be 10 on Clemson so itll be two shots on every common foul from Miami but Wesson Miami put their freethrow Shooters back in the game Music we thought that this 30second meeting all the time between the two might be pretty good and Id say its delivered well West Miami it seems that they play nothing but close theyve had five games in conference play of five or less or overtime Clemsons had four well Wes they took control of this game at the end of the first half they were down 3531 they scored the last four points of the half and then they came out red hot from three in the second half built a 10point lead and the Tigers have never recovered and a foul quickly on Chase Hunter trying to get Nigel pack and thats Hunters first 10 on Clemson with 48 left and a threepoint game and essentially Packs gonna get two free throws here hes had a marvelous second half hes got 10 and a half and 16 in the game well in that Virginia Tech game thats the last five minutes of that game he scored 17 points and the first free throw is good and that makes it a two possession game and here comes Wiggins and Hemingway Godfrey and Dylan Hunter out and Jim learning is telling his guys no foul right Clemson doesnt have time for two possessions left Applause and the free throw is good for pack and Tyson the Miami put some backward pressure out there inbounds to Hemingway three two long three by Hemingway rings the bell 7674 with point nine left to go Alex Hemingway spots up from the tiger ball well now the referees will go and they will check and make sure the clock is right or some kind of Cuddy three from heavenway huh wow if youre Clemson here in a twopoint game then again we talk about one possession two possession youve almost got to commit the foul before the ball is in play right well West you want to steal it I mean I dont think you have if you commit the foul before the ball comes in play yes thats fine here lets look and see now remember its when the ball goes through the basket so maybe I dont know 11 Maybe and it doesnt have to go its not when it all goes all the way through the net its when it gets down past the uh the ring okay so they may attack a tenth of a second yeah yeah maybe theyre gonna go one even lets talk about your Logistics and game management theres your Logistics Clemson whod won three of their last four took an eightpoint loss at Boston College Tuesday night they got a week off when this one is theyll be in Chapel Hill next Saturday for Carolina West now lets lets talk about the clock here okay the clock starts as soon as somebody inbounds touches the ball so the ideal thing for the Clemson Tigers would be to force a fivesecond count so that way they would have a second if they did get the ball back now you might say well why dont Miami just take the ball and throw at the length of the Court well if they do and nobody touches it then no time will run off the clock and Clemson will get the ball out of bounds under their own basket Jim larenegger said if we cant get the ball in were calling timeout hes got one left and thats what hes going to use it for Isaiah Wong can run the in line and Tim clockertys telling him that here is Wong gets it in bounds and a quick foul with 7 and I believe Chase Hunter collided with Nigel pack so the foul on Hunter his second and two free throws for pack Clemson is out of timeouts so Wes what you have to do is hope that you get a missed free throw here at least one of the two right and then you have a chance you know all these teams day before the game they practice half court shot Nigel pack just came over and asked Jim larenegger do I missed the second one on purpose well and again that would make it harder for Clemson but I dont think you want to do that heres the first one and thats good yeah so if you make the second when the games over you dont want to miss the second one I understand I just wanted to share the conversation with you here I had to pack overthinking it a little bit there 2774 and he tried to think a throw it high off the back and it didnt but its a fourpoint game Hunter Tyson from threequarter court and the ball game is over Miami a terrific Road win for Jim lehren Angus team Dan well it really was a terrific win and again theyre off their offense carried him in the second half for Dan Potter Rick Bagby Kurt Sutton West Durham 7874 Miami a winner off to Chestnut Hill heres John Mita Burrell so we welcome you to ACC
