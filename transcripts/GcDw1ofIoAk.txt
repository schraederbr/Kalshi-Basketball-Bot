in the middle of a blackout here in uh the Peterson Event Center and uh so great crowd great afternoon thought you and I would fit right in were in our black CW polos here we go I just hope that the Virginia Tech people dont think were homers here for the CW well be in blackburg next Saturday they can uh give us an earful next week at Castle Im Im going to say this was your decision on the wardrobe today Evan so Im going to throw you under the bus appreciate that mikee off to a fantastic start 30 seconds in feder Rico quick dish and Hinson beats the buzzer really nice play what did I say about Henson playing below the rim inside he had a little running start that time but didnt rush it didnt feel any pressure with the shot clock thats traveling violation on Hunter Couture how about this start for pit well great stuff and uh theyll Run High screen roll and then roll him back in and not thats not really forer Ricos game but he makes a nice play out of it fed Rico averaging just under one assist per game so hes got his assist already and hes got his first bucket as well running the offense through him right now really good production its like a young Dean Blair out there yeah well been quite a bit thinner for sure but uh you know he hell set High screens and then hell roll theyll roll him inside PTO Rico reaching in on kid picks up the personal hes got a bucket an assist and a foul in the first 90 seconds now his biggest impact will be on the defensive end but hes been vital in the first two possessions offensively only plays about 21 minutes with him but gives them great production kid over feder Rico cant convert rebound for Carrington really good shot blockers has great length inside deep three Hinson got it that was between the first and the that might have been from the second T in pit out near the logo ridiculous range certainly a very different start for both teams compared to what we saw earlier in the week so a dunk and that three thats about his range folks hon deflex it out of bounds its an incomplete pass pit has won the opening two minutes with authority heres the look and uh that all right so youve seen his game there and uh now the thing and Jeff cable talked about it hes been consistent hes done that all year they just need the second and the third guy to show up today pookies were looking for a good look Couture cant Applause connect back to Hinson step back over Collins couple bounces off the iron which was unkind theyre going to have some different looks that Im sure on Hinson the smaller guys taller guys thats Shan padulla for you and this this is a very efficient offensive team theyre prob with wake four is probably the best shooting teams as far as percentage is concerned in the conference where pit will beat you with volume theyll beat you with Precision Austin to the corner for low comes up short rebound for padulla Applause padulla on the drive again lost his footing but there was a reason for it and the foul is going against Pittsburgh its on bub Carrington The Freshman from Baltimore mentioned Wake Forest how about the win for the deakes earlier today building upon their 33point win on Tuesday with a resume changing win at home against Duke yeah massive win uh for Wake Forest really puts them in back in solidly I think in the NCA tournament Applause conversation Austin thought about it selection Sunday 3 weeks from tomorrow amazing how fast things go by Carrington clears out the space and hes called for the offensive foul thats his second personal and very quickly ish legot pops off the pit bench well now a couple things leot has been terrific coming off the bench but Carrington has been an outstanding freshman all season long so thats a thats a big loss for them his productions been down hes hit a little bit of a freshman wall here late lately but uh thats a thats an early early exit for Himel potit first sub off Mike Youngs bench theyre theyre probably going to give Lyn kid some short stints out on the floor with the with the illness that hes Applause battling personal on MJ Collins and actually you know potit has been giving them some pretty good offense has four double figure scoring and four of the last seven yo Diaz gr into the lineup for feder Applause Rico Hedges the screen out of the corner contested three Collins might have got a piece of it Collins gives them some really good size in the back court as a Defender Padula carves out some space and hell get to the free throw line after the timeout Pooky start just one for five theyre down by five early in Pittsburgh next the action continues on CW Courtside Saturday welcome to the big time with Florida State wow flashes with Clemson and wooden Award nominee PJ Hall oh my Heavens is brought to you by by Ram trucks built to serve a touchdown for pit a safety for Virginia Tech and an early fivepoint lead for the Panthers Jeff CES team back home theyre 17 and9 Mike theyre eight and seven in the Music ACC they they have really changed their p uh perspective over the past month and really whats done it are the road winds and they may have the most impressive Road wins in the conference with wins at Duke and at Virginia and you if you look back at Virginia its after there was that breaking that long home winning streak and you know the win at Cameron speaks for itself uh and thats why their resume looks a lot different than Virginia Tech even though their conference record isnt dramatically different pois only have one road win compared to pits six and thats the thing thats lacking with Virginia Tech they dont have that signature Road win their one road win did come on the CW at NC State back in January thats a good sign for the Hokies Hinson goes down no call padulla the other way poked away from behind stolen by Diaz Graham Henson up high Austin missed the Applause D one thing that pit likes to do theyll throw the ball up to their bigs but just trying for style points that time youve got to finish that wasnt worth extra points if he made it uh that would be a negative you asked coach cable if that was worth reaching foul goes on Couture thats one you know come on fellas two onone I got I got my best scorer one of the best players in the conference on one end of it uh uh we need to finish that Music break whats Zach Austin thinking he went one for nine on Tuesday this is a dunk to start Saturday jayen Lowes a guy whos played pretty well lately and another Miss dunk for Austin he comes up short that time thats not something you see every day uh that one he had really no chance to finish that was an awkward attempt that was the last time you saw a guy miss two dunks in a minute outside of the slam dunk contest in Allstar Weekend this one was in a crowd and he yeah that was a that was a tough finish and might have been better served to come down with that one but neither team has made a field goal in nearly 3 minutes after an explosive start with a henssen dunk and Logo three padulla Up and Under with a left hand finish hes actually been doing most of his work off the dribble hes got all six for Virginia Tech six of their seven shots have come inside the ark they havent been looking to take any threes late or in the game Applause early it is I mean they you know theyve really pressed up on him and uh theyre driving him off the threepoint line and hes just kind of hes taking what the defense is giving him 6 nothing run for Virginia Tech hit has missed its last six field goal attempts pter havent scored now in over four minutes low step back unable to snap the drop but a good hustle rebound from Austin Le it for three no padulla pulls down another rebound Seans got four rebounds already Baron cleans It Up near midcourt both these teams attempt a ton of Threes Tyler nichel rejected that may not be a strong enough verb demolished engulfed well nichel he he doesnt get any elevation this time and usually this the guy coming in the second guy in can get a good look at a block but this was serious elevation by Austin stays with the hokes actually each of those guys should get half a block on that think so yeah tough shot Hunter Couture hes made that shot a lot throughout his career I mean this is this is a very very good you know and you talked about it in the destruction of Virginia Couture and padulla combined for only 14 points and they still won by 34 as Austin finally gets two see just a traditional layup he makes the layup I think you should just concentrate on that instead of the dunk sna a drive of about 5 minutes Baron for three no Austin skies for the rebound quickly to low pulla comes in and takes it away Baron all the Applause way what great conversion on turnover that time Baron just out sprinting everybody off the dribble the Hops and the lefthanded Applause Hammer does a dunk like that give you a skipping your step the rest of the game Mike heaz ground has es skipped in his step after knocking down the left wing three hes been quiet offensively in the last seven hes only averaging four points and need him to come alive and thats a good start for him the crowd Virginia Tech had taken out of him pulla cant answer his first three attempt of the game that was a tough try Pittsburghs high up there in terms of their percentage of Threes attempted knocked away itll stay the same Music way Pittsburgh ball and we come back but Virginia Tech has weathered the slow start thanks to Hunter Couture an impressive shot maker but heres a nice look for the big man Music Gman the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve got a good ball game here at the Peterson Event Center Pittsburgh leads by two and of course the second game of our double header the 85th alltime meeting in mens basketball between Florida State and Clemson Tom wormy and Brian Oliver are getting set at Little John Coliseum as we speak as you see Mike Young and the Hokies team snapshot won two of their last three an excellent shooting basketball team both from the line and from Beyond The Arc but Road winds have been missing from that resume the follow up and uh see free throws coming for pit but uh you know at this point Road home defending home court is an absolute must so the Tigers and they had a you know a very tough home loss against NC State and um you know thats why this game you know critical for pit to to then defend home court Hunter Couture did just pick up his second foul and hes going to the bench thats something to keep an eye on with 1136 to play in the first half both sides with a critical player and you know looking at the half court offense for pit with Carrington out of the game for a significant amount of time it has not run very well miss Applause both not a great thats one of the thats probably the weakest part of his game just 67 L kid back out there thats Nifty and thats going I think thats going to be the way theyre going to use him this game kind of short shifts like almost like hockey shifts get him the ball quickly see if they can get some offensive production out of him and then get him some rest on the bench low kicks it hon Applause nope six points five rebounds two assists and nine minutes for sha padulla theyve really they theyve taken control of the game theyve really kind of taken the crowd out of the game to this point after the 70 start absolutely padulla beautiful pass to kid its our fifth lead change and the hokes are back in front now youve got to go to penetration but he drew three guys and that left kid wide Applause open dula has played with great control so far through the first quarter of this game corner jumper is good Zach Austin answers the call you know what I mean really the offense has worked the best for pit when its gone through feder Rico I mean he made that kick out pass that little the high screen and then they run it through him and things happen Austin struggled from Beyond the arc on Tuesday so thats got to be a good feeling padulla hangs in the air looks like he was going for the old Tracy McGrady off the off defensive glast and then in transition leg it like a battering ram into the Music Applause lane well heres the look I mean you can see everybody converging on him now you know Fred Ricos going to go for the block but thats exactly what kid should do follow after him great kick out extra pass there and just the rotation not enough time to get out leg legot gets credit for the assist but it was really feder Rico that made the pass its a hockey assist yeah its a good hockey Town fou one against Jaden young who hit a couple threes late in the Virginia game on Monday night perhaps earning some more minutes in the process and that foul is going on Baron its his Applause first good recognition by low he thought he got the switch he had a big guy on him thought he could take him you know if anything Baron gave up the Baseline should have used that to his Advantage Jaylen low double figures in five straight games nine of his last 10 and the free throw is good or is Po from the new movie Kung Fu Panda four might say scoo no miss Kung Fu Panda four only in theaters March 8th well leg it said skou when he saw the left hand open up to go to the Baseline another reason why you should have cut that off low to the bench after making a pair Carrington back in the game hes been out since the 1641 Mark with two personal Applause fouls nichel blocked by Austin second block of the game for Applause him Carrington looks for his offense thats interesting because Jeff cable does not usually play guys with two fouls in the first half half in the first half thats a this is an interesting change in philosophy feder Rico feder Rico to the corner all the way on the Baseline and two points for ish legett hes come off the bench in the last you know hes come off the bench in the last nine games but if you look at his minutes they are almost identical to when he was starting lead pit with 15 points Off the Bench against wake on Tuesday padulla tough shot right now he is putting Virginia Tech on his back in this half six six points before that bucket now hes got eight points with five rebounds and three assists played every minute so far Le it to feder Rico Henson over Baron for Applause three not sure Baron could have contested that any better unless he blocked it no and you know and Hinson is hes going to make tough shots during the course of the game Panthers back up by six but I dont know that feder Rico is a guy you have to converge on in the paint first rebound for Hinson hes got eight points and one assist already working on the smaller padulla and a great whistle and padul is telling Bill Covington that he grabbed my arm and hes not going to win the argument first personal on Shan padulla Blake Hinson one of the great threepoint Shooters in college basketball Pit by six welcome back everybody its a 2216 lead for the pit Panthers here inside the Peterson Event Center and its time for us to take a look at whats happening around the ACC present presented by TMobile you it feels like a real significant day in the ACC just from a historical standpoint Jim beheim honored in Syracuse the 1974 National Championship team honored in Raleigh and then you got the top four teams in the league going head to head in Winston and Charlottesville respectively yeah big win for Wake against Duke there and uh Virginia and North Carolina close uh Miami what a a fall theyve experienced Evan from November and December when they were in top 10 nationally for a while had theyve had a ton of injuries and not a lot of depth but um this pit te and Syracuse has made a Resurgence lately they they played better over the last couple of weeks oh poti saves it under the basket sets up Hinson who cant make him pay but feder Rico creates another chance and then Collins pokes it away that was a bullet Dodge there by the hokes right now Shon Padula has half of their rebounds uh a good bit of their points their points and all of their assists no good for nickel rebound Austin currently the Hoke without a three theyre 0 for four now Beyond The Arc they have not gone without a three for an entire half since the New Years Eve game against Wake Forest po rebounds the Miss by Applause low padulla again doing it by himself theres no goal tend its Hokes ball what do you see Mike thats normally a call thats going to be a goalen in front of the rim like that and that was one that was right on The Edge like I said when its when its in front of the rim thats usually a goal tending call potit and the foul as feder Rico picks up his second and a chance for a threepoint play from Elijah potit and the one thing that he has that he is a wide body hes strong and he has got the strength to finish against these shot blockers inside for pit pit guys are athletic theyre long but theyre not real wide Elijah potit had his best game of last year against pit scored 15 points against the Panthers unable to complete the threepoint play and uh you know his today even more so with kid you know maybe laboring a little bit with an illness his his production is going to be critical Le it to the open man low bottoms that uh that threepoint line is really starting to loom large and this pit is not a high percentage team but five of 10 right now theyre being very efficient in the game theyre out scoring Virginia Tech Beyond The Arc 15 nothing but inside the hokes have had success with poti thats where padulla has done most of his work in this game early and potit Collins picked up the assist that time you know I and I think Jeff Cap was very happy to drive those guys off the line and make this make them a twopoint shooting team airball from Hinson padulla pass deflected by Diaz Applause Graham heres the look these guys are really good at driving into the lane and kicking out I mean thats a a lot of their offense theyve got spot up Shooters on the Baseline Jaylen Lows now made a three in six straight games nine of his last 20 Beyond The Applause Arc L of contact padulla just throws it up and scores and did not get the call and hes looking at the referee and you know on the road I mean you just you have to play through it if you get the call you get the call if not um you know you cant spend time arguing 10 points for padulla leg it to the Applause basket and thats the one thing thats Virginia Tech at the bottom of the league in shot blocking so you know the the rim the Lanes got a green light there MJ Collins rebounded by here mod he has Graham and that is definitely not his game hes in the 20s as far as threepoint Applause shooting R gmas hands inside hoks ball heres the look and again the the contact was beforehand yeah and thats just the you know thats just a straight leftand drive you got to cut that off for him make him go the opposite way you have an experienced officiating crew Bill Covington Jr Clarence Armstrong Jerry heer presiding over this one letting the teams play MJ Collins lays it in at the last minute when it looked like he was going to detonate thats where hes most effective getting into the lane using his size at 64 midrange shots and in the pain area despite being outscored 15 nothing Beyond The Arc Mike jinsky hokes are within three Applause hinston called for traveling fif Pittsburgh turnover and well get ourselves timeout MJ Collins off the nice pass from padulla hokey hanging around here in the road three presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years it has been the Shan padul show for the hokes really that they forced him off the threepoint line and hes taking what the defense is given 10 points very efficient and the rebounds there as well Blake Hinson that dunk early and then the threepoint line hes been a little quiet lately though Evan um but capable of a big Outburst at any time and I think all in all that Mike young is probably kind of happy with the pace of this game right now now there hasnt been a game this season where padul has had more than six rebounds and six assists got six rebounds four assists right now to go with his 10 points the triple double watch is officially on as L kid makes it 18 points in the paint out of Virginia Tech 26 and if you watch when kid comes in the game they immediately go to him as close to the basket they can try to get some production and he is so hes given him that answer from ish legot creates a little bit more of a cushion threepoint lead for the Panthers closing it on three minutes to play in the first half padulla draws the contact from low and this uh this game you know threepoint game right now this is with Couture with the two fouls and only the two points so so he really has not been a factor so far did not see Mike Young have popcorn before the game today Mike I no that was a little odd final thing that coach young said at the end of shoot around this morning he said quote lets take all of our juice and bring it over here tonight we talked about bringing the juice final words from Jeff cable at the end of pit shoo around talking about having a sense of urgency from the tip not talking about urgency bringing the urgency well done is always better than well Applause Music Music said they just caught the second on padulla C Couture and padulla each have two for Virginia Tech well the guy who just went out of the game too uh Tyler Nicholl is the guy who has not scored in the game and hes been hes given them some very good production this year especially the past couple weeks yep multiple threes and five straight games for nichel 56 Beyond The Arc that stretch hes 0 for three from the floor so far tonight hes on the bench right now pooki back court with two fouls padul and Couture both still out there kid verse Diaz gr Battle of seven Footers won by Kid technically Lyn listed at 610 but it looks like he matches up the 7 foot DS Grand pretty well would you say yeah and I tell you what in limited minutes and very short sance has been terrific eight points four of five shooting so so they have used him very effectively in this game legot picks up his second foul for Pittsburgh interesting no double team just kind of a half dig there off of the dribble but the kid turned away from it with his left hand so thats five different players in the game two for Virginia Tech and three for pick they have two fouls with over two minutes to play in the first half offensive foul on kid erase the Applause Music basket number one on kid you youll see the hook with the right hand he right there and uh really didnt need it he had all the time and space in the world right here just kind of clearly wipes away a as a big guy you know youre not going to get away with that move why well and yeah well thats thats the point and the thing is theres there are no other bodies around so the referee has a clear look at the whole play BL off the back rim leg it flies in for the rebound Henson pull up yes sir you know I think in a perfect world though thats what you want to make Hinson is a midrange jump shooter rather than have him all the way in for a threepoint possibility door behind the arc hant a double figures for the 24th time in 27 games this year he has been consistent MJ Collins from the free throw Applause line and a timeout taken by Mike young after the make has use it or lose it to give his team a breather before this defensive possession and well see if they make a sub of the buck 26 to play in the half coming up on the Subaru halftime report we will get a preview from Little John Coliseum as we get you set for Florida State and Clemson also plenty of first half thoughts from here at the Oakland Music Zoo its finally here the anticipated new season of the CWs number one show allam premieres on Monday April 1st from the sidelines to the streets they are leaving it all on the field Monday April 1st at 87 Central only on the CW minute 26 right now Virginia Tech needs to hang on both Couture and padulla on the bench and Mike young has to protect them with their two personal fouls you like that choice yes absolutely have to protect that going into the second half low down the allei high off the glass and a late whistle will send Jaylen low to the free throw line and we talk a lot about guys hitting the Freshman wall in their production diminishing that as the season goes on jayen low is a freshman from Texas in his first 16 games he averaged about five points per game hes averaging almost 13 points per game in his last 10 well and this guy too whos you know his minutes have fluctuated a little bit and hes averaging 24 minutes a game too theres a big difference between may not sound a lot to people when I say this but Carringtons averaging 33 minutes a game and low is averaging 24 minutes thats a 10minute Gap thats huge so thats not going to affect him as much Applause padulla and Couture both back Applause in Padulas got 11 points Coutures got just the two taking a little chance to I mean theyre out there on the offensive end but Corner three and the risk pays off for Mike young were tied now he just got to tell them to stay away from anybody with the basketball at this point Jeff Cs going to help him out yeah is interesting cuz Jeff cable could have you know just called something from the bench to to Really Force Couture and padulla to have to guard Instead This timeout will let Mike young sub defensive fresh players in and that was the first three of the game for Virginia Tech pull has had about as good of a half as you could expect for a guy leading the team at that spot well dive into the nations most shocking Mysteries you can catch all new episodes of The CW original true crime series crime Nation Tuesdays at 87 Central only on the CW yes 14 points six rebounds four assists for padulla just the one turnover and I tell you what and we I really didnt know havent been here for we were both here for shoot around I didnt know how much kid was going to be able to give them today and eight points in the first half in short St its been a big lift eight points in eight minutes for kid yep hoki should see it again but that foul is going to create two free throws for Pittsburgh bad foul number two on Baron so hes the third hokey with two so you pick you pick up your second foul you give him two free throws and you give him an extra possession at the end of the half the two for one certainly didnt look like pit was going to shoot in the next five six seconds to be able to get a two for one NBA Style so hints into the line who missed two earlier actually miss three earlier for that M its had a heck of a journey though all Miss Iowa State where he didnt play now to Pittsburgh where he has had new basketball life here comes the dynamic duo of padulla and Couture back into the game 389 seconds remaining in this first half its been a good one pits LED for most of this half but the hokes have made their last five shots from the field and they are hanging around shooting north of Applause 50 Couture the alltime leading threepoint shooter and hoky history draws contact on the perimeter and this will be two shots as the hokes are also in the double bonus beg your pardon this was a n team foul on pit so its a one and one for Couture 89 from the line this season confident stroke needs to make this one so they can get him out of the ball Applause game he wont miss it on purpose so we can stay in Music will Coach young would appreciate that too much just a joke folks the point certainly more important than the extra 219 seconds on the court Hunter has scored a lot of points over 1400 in his Virginia Tech Career now the shot clock is off we are tied for the third time weve had six lead changes in this riveting first 20 minutes and its a travel another chance and here come padulla and Couture again this has been a nightmare for the official stat keeper to track all these InNOut Subs well and I tell you its its been a bit of a nightmare for pit without Carrington on the floor I think youre going to see a bit of a different team with him running things out there in the second half thats a good point only played five minutes padulla with 3 seconds hes been the star of the half and he does not deliver the exclamation point but still a splendid first 20 minutes for sha padulla and Virginia Tech after falling behind seven nothing as Blake Hinson started hot in the second half kid on the dive the spin the pivot and the pass padulla takes it foul on feder Rico number three just a bailout foul too I guy like him get to you know Elevate bother the shot a little bit but uh dont put this guy on the line scad Chan padulla really channeling their inner dragon warrior and for more excitement zung Fu Panda four only in theaters March 8th and there is nothing better for a player to get in Rhythm coming into the second half then to get to the free throw line and knock down a couple of free throws havent even really warmed up yet and all of a sudden youve made a couple of Applause shots 3836 matches Virginia Tech largest lead of the day late whistle but its going to be a foul looking be on Couture he took a shot to the groin area and hes and he in some pain down Applause there they call it on padulla numberers three on Pula either way hes going to get its going to be his third Applause foul thats a tough call against Shan padulla and that was uh he theyre going to look at the monitor here he was he and it was a late kind of slap wave at the ball Hinson almost kind of came into him by accident I think what theyre going to do is theyre going to give this to I believe kid who Hinson kind of created the contact with and instead of number three on padulla hell remain with two and kid will also have two this kid has one at the moment heres the I mean normally the rule of thumb is when if the ball goes down um youve gotten mostly ball Couture is back on his feet looks to be okay that being said Evan I mean youve got to be smarter than that this early in the second half you know you got two fouls give up whatever happens on the play offensively rather than even getting the chance of having a foul call Applause are they going to keep it a common foul with padulla Music Applause wow they were looking not to see who the foul was on but to see if it was anything malicious the only they cant take the foul away or change it they can only elevate it and uh and thats a huge huge hit for Virginia Tech he has been everything for the Hokey so far today in terms of creating now its up to MJ Collins to run the offense maybe see if Tyler nichel can step up and hit some shots inside to kid hes been the secondary Target for the hokes offense and Diaz Graham blocks the shot Bill cumington taken out in the ensuing aftermath as jayen low with a fancy move to the basket and thats something that they werent getting in the first half out in the open court running finishing at The Rim defense leading to offense for Pittsburgh and a bad pass somehow gets to kid anyway kid against Diaz Graham cant score this time Applause either whos it on its number three on Hunter Couture Mike young is has just got his hand head in his hand and hes got his two best backcourt players with three Applause Music fouls Elijah potit into the game but not for Couture hes in for kid wow Hunter staying out there with three lots of basketball still to play see how Mike young manages this go right right at him Hinson nice dish and Austin touches it Applause inall wow much better at the traditional finish rather than the dunk and weve been you know but hes got uh hes had hes had a terrific game Austin seven assists and three blocks to go with the scoring Elijah potit inside he said seven assists hes got seven rebounds seven rebounds sorry three blocks yeah no seven assists would be a big story for Austin he averages about one assist per game Applause hson kind of bail tore out oh theres no question why you know why take a fade away jump shot on him with three personal fouls put your head down go to the basket Blakes now four for 12 from the field Collins nice pass PO with authority they had everybody on the left hand side out behind the arc so no defensive help Applause whatsoever low turnaround two you I took him a couple games and uh you I I think he just didnt like the concept of not starting for a while but then he saw that his minutes were just the same C comes up short Austin the rebound ahead to low bu Carrington still hasnt taken a shot yet in this game but low sees in control and the fouls on Baron and thats his third heres the look you see I mean just wide open love the bounce pass great Music finish three Virginia Tech starters with three fouls a piece Padula Couture and now Music Baron Harrington defended well Diaz Graham and Ro puted the left hand I when the most graceful thing in the world I gave him a perfect t for that one I know what youre talking about in the short term I theres again no shot blocking out there bar out there with the three personal fouls I mean why not just put your head down and attack the rim traveling violation Pittsburgh ball Timeout on the floor the sophomore from the Canary Islands just like he drew it up hit by two up next third with 1924 to go and then Couture picked up his third with 1819 to go and then Baron picked up his third with 16005 to go and all that being said when weve talked its a twopoint ball game and you you keep on waiting for Virginia Tech to crack and they havent at this point and with the three personal fouls you hang on you know when when does Mike young say all right we need to get guys back in there is it the 12 minute Mark well Coutures never left hes still out there and Tyler nichel with a foul on the floor Tyler is not in foul trouble that is his first I mean let me ask you this question I know its Mike Youngs decision to make but how do you man AG this situation with three critical players in this Applause predicable thats why he gets paid the big bus I I think that thats why pit is you know if if pit is is continuing to take jump shots youre bailing them out uh theyve got to theyve got to really change their mindset and be aggressive and start attacking to the rim see if legot follows suit fway jumper for two is leg got eight Applause points quick little sixo mini run over the last 90 seconds and on this end Nichol is the guy that they really need to get going offensively now Applause say out of contact on the perimeter they got Diaz grah with the reach on Music pout second team foul in the half on Pittsburgh Applause the 60 run is one thing but the fouls against Virginia Tech also make it feel like the momentum has shifted pois only down four but it feels like they could really use a bucket MJ Carrington the rebound bu Carrington Coast to Coast see you know even you talked about him and thats uh thats his first points of the game but doesnt it feel like a different pit team with him out on the floor Carrington came up a little limping after that bucket so they stopped the whistles after the quick Miss from nickel he he looked over the bench and he told Coach G said Im but point being said I mean this is what they were lacking in the first half and this is what he brings to the floor and he actually before he took off he kind of looked like he reached down and uh was grabbing at his leg but he is so explosive in the open court yeah that that happened that didnt happen after he landed something happened before he took Applause off and you hes sat a lot of time he was out for 15 to the 20 minutes in the first half leg it to the basket 10 nothing run for Pittsburgh yeah that thats mean thats there thats going to be there for probably for the rest of the game Mike young letting his team play Through It Rock padulla back into the game hes rejected by Austin Fourth block for the high point transfer Zack Austin you could feel this coming Mike the momentum had shifted this crowd behind the Panthers looking over at Mike young and they may be a controlled technical foul coming Austin on the offensive glass the foul is on nickel I Music believe no my goodness they gave it to Couture thats the fourth on Couture with 1334 to play can you believe it see again those how many both he and pulla the last fouls theyve gotten have been like you cant from a freshman maybe you would expect that type of foul but you you cant pick up that type of foul Ill say the third on fadoua I still dont think he deserves at all but you cant even be close to thinking that I mean you just dont even go there Austin misses a pair at the line this free throws helping the hoki cling to some hope Applause here been nearly a 4minute scoring drought for Virginia Tech MJ Collins cant Splash it in and baron just got caught for his fourth personal foul it has been a long time since theres been a seven minute stretch like this where one team has just seen one player after another get dinged in a big way and you know and and again if youre the Virginia Tech coaches and you have seen this team do what it did to Virginia the last game and now youre watching your team against pit in this game just a short while

basketball on the CW is brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years the pit Panthers have made their run 13 straight points for the home team and the zoo is bouncing Jeff C Panthers looking to make it eight wins in their last 10 games today theyve got out transition here in the second half yeah with Carrington coming into the ball game he is really quicking the pace end to end knocking down to three and you know you were talking about the Freshman hitting the wall and and hes one of the guys especially in the last three games his production has been off a little bit but for a freshman to come in and run a ball club and and play that many minutes it is it is really tough and uh for him maybe this is a game where they can uh if they away with some time left and maybe only 5 minutes in the first half was in the in the long run good for him padulla inadvertently tripped by Diaz Graham thats the third on Dio fou troubles the story right now for Virginia Tech padulla playing with three nichel could use a three and he just has not been able to find the range so far today Tylers over for five from the field over for three from Deep had a decent look too and uh you know its its been a positive move for him was not seeing much playing time down in North Carolina and was really blossomed at Virginia Tech come back home another fine day for Jaylen lows and double figures for the six straight game for the 10th time in his last 11 that hasnt the offense looked a lot a lot better in the second half with kingon out on the floor no question Jaden Young comes up short tipped out by potit but Henson is Applause there and that 50 shooting that Virginia Tech and then the first half they are now two of 12 in the second half and that that sting to look at for a hoke fan G Mo Diaz R Trace putos wow wow on the B on the bilingual 18 in a row for Applause Pittsburgh the zoo is loud poti able to quiet him down just to Tad thats the

action continues on CW Courtside Saturday welcome to the big time with Florida State wow clashes with Clemson and wooden Award nominee PJ Hall oh my Heavens CW Courtside Saturday Florida State Clemson coming up next Virginia Tech scored the last two points however Pittsburgh scored the previous 18 and its a 14point lead for the Panthers reminder that tomorrow is the season finale of CW womens Hoops Cavaliers head to Louisville looking for the upset against the powerful Cardinals Virginia and 20th ranked Louisville tomorrow at noon Eastern 900 am Pacific on the CW and on the mens side a look around the ACC presented by TMobile some gting basketball games today I dont know if 5444 is as riveting as 8379 or 88885 but lot of exciting action around the league Mike and uh actually for North Carolina fans that was a sweet of Victory cuz I believe they were 0 and eight um up in Virginia so theyll take that theyll take that W anytime and uh right now in Virginia Tech is looking at uh you know they were you were talking about playing on the double bu they they were trying to avoid having to play on Tuesday I think five of those teams are pretty well set at this point on the start of the day there was only two games in the standing separating uh fourth place and 10th place with two minutes to go in the season season hit tie for fifth the Hokies were in 10 Hinson fou by Applause potit Wake Forest won earlier today so theyre now 10 and six Syracuse is the one thats made the Resurgence they were they were kind of you know uddling along and they they they won a few games in a row and see right there amazing that nobody would have thought that Miami would be a team that was a lock to play on Tuesday ear in the season they were a top 10 team in the nation now theyre guaranteed bottom five in the league Clemson Florida State later tonight loser of that game will be 88 in the League Pittsburgh with a win will get to 9 and seven but I mean you look at like Virginia Tech their home record Rivals is equivalent to the best teams in the conference their road record is equivalent to what Louisvilles record is on the road Virginia Tech was the higher ranked team in the net and in the kenpom rankings coming into today now pit was a slight favorite due to being the home team the analytics gave pit a 58 chance of winning today and and really you know we we touched on it at the open that Blake Hinson has has been carrying this team on its back back offensively in the last few games hes had a relatively quiet afternoon so far Baron missed the layup gets it back blocked from behind on the second effort by feder Rico yeah its a two two points have been a little tougher to come by in the pain area almost would have felt a good night leg it would have baged that one yeah the the length of Pittsburgh showing up inside in the second half Couture needs it great block out by feder go on kid but you know this this a a much more balanced scoring game low 14 points Hinson 14 Leed with 10 Diaz Graham with eight Daron Nifty dribble puts it in all of Kens scoring has been in the second half so scored over 2000 points in high school had some really good games this year struggled lately but Club Carrington three for three here in the second half the steel for low Padula almost steals it back but doesnt and feder Rico kicks it a sloppy lackluster possession so pit settles it down everyone in the Oakland Zoo on their feet ready to cheer but leg it unable to score padulla trying to get it going in the second half and the fouls going on low drawn by Collins on the Applause drive number two on Music low 16 foul on P here in the second Applause half I think its fair to say Mike both these teams have potentially a bunch of winnable games on the schedule down the stretch Theres an opportunity for each of these teams to finish strong well and about for Tech we talk about Syracuse you know maybe a few weeks ago that was like all right that looks like a really winnable game I that all of a sudden thats gotten a lot tougher yeah then you got wake at home you know wake has not been great on the road theyre they suffer from the same thing as well Zack Austin has been a tough throw to today you know how bad was he feeling at those two early missed dunks on the alley oops and then that game has turned around oh Austin turns it around Austins feeling it gets his own rebound takes it to the basket and gets turned away by kid sometimes its not all a fairy tale playing to the zoo I think cure brings the pokies back within 15 just the second three of the day for Virginia Tech and 13 Applause tries offensive foul against Pittsburgh thats number four on feder Rico Zach Austin today is racking up the blocks inside fun to watch Saturday John ROM duson Johnson and the rest of the live Superstars head to the desert to see who will conquer the difficult course at Jetta live golf Jetta next Saturday 1230 pm Eastern 930 am Pacific only on the CW to reiterate The Hokey foul trouble Couture and baron both four Pulu with three and I misspoke before the break it was Carrington and not feder Rico that picked up his fourth on that last sequence an offensive foul on bub so hes got four as well and I I actually think that Virginia Tech and Mike done a really good job of massaging this that nobody has fouled out for them to this point padulla no daylight sets up Collins puts it in back to back freeze for reing tech C an 18o deficit down to 12 yep and uh when you can get Collins whos a 24 shooter from three and all of a sudden if he heats up from there thats huge he went three for three from three against Louisville was 0 for 11 before that yeah I was going to say thats offensive foul on hson Applause yeah just the you see the you see the left arm little duck of the shoulder its right out right in front of the official easy call to make against a smaller guy no need to do Applause that pulla 18 so far in the game Collins again nope and rebound for Pittsburgh a little too early for pit to go into their home run Trot right now Ill say he just wanted to bring up baseball and the notification that the Yankees won today huh 22 to 10 grapefruit league is underway leg it no I walked by PNC ballpark yesterday felt like Applause spring Tyler nichel open look potit on the offensive GL has it ripped away leg it throws it ahead for low gets his own Miss and then has it knocked away and stolen what is going on here Collins Up and Under how about this 10point game so an 80 run on their own right gets Virginia Tech right back in Applause it nine points for Collins padulla just picked up his seventh assist leg it three B and I will mention again that this run occurred with Mr Carrington on the bench for a pit his presence is so big for this ball Club yeah it its a really good point its important to reiterate it Couture wave it off its going anyway they got this Applause time you know its such a the screener just stay stationary I know you want to get your guy open and you want to you know but you cant move its such an obvious call to Applause make three fouls on potit closing it on 5 minutes to play game one of an ACC Hoops double header here on the CW Florida State Clemson to follow low Midland jumper is Nifty now if youre a guard why are you going to bite on that pump fake you have no shot of blocking that at all stay down maybe bother the shot for the most part reball just has not been there for Virginia Tech all game long and you know despite their Road struggles Mike theyve shot just about as good from three on the road as they have from home this year not today this a team Henson fouled shooting the three Coutures done thats the fifth on Hunter Couture and his day is Applause over and this is a team I talked about how good a shooting team that Virginia Tech is 37 in ACC play from behind the Applause ark three of 17 177 fans are ready to wave byebye to Hunter didy Music palum it was it was I you know I dont know if that was worth calling Tough call tough call Hunter having some fun with the fans while keeping his poker face at the same Applause time he tried to sit down right as Hinson was letting go of the free throw that is a guy whos played 145 college basketball games ACC tournament MVP years back these are these are numbers that well never see again and God forbid theres another theres another Co that comes through hope that that never ever happens again with you well you know the guys did deserve another year and Im glad that they got it but uh after the Hokey 80 run its an 80 run from pit to respond back to 18 this game was tied at the half and the foul trouble kind of one by one just took the wind out of the Hokey sails it really felt like like I said you know I thought it was a a terrific job of massaging it as long as you could but you know to get back and even make that 80 run was was Valiant in and of itself but just ran out of time ran out of fouls and ran out of body low just picked up his third P to the free throw line where hes five of six so far this a guy whos I mean hes two rebounds and three assists away from a triple Applause double second free throw Miss of the day six of eight by the way Blake Hinson hit all three of the free throws when he was maybe fouled shooting the three he made seven straight from the line after starting over for three clean block by pulla on low Applause there and Sean will earn his ninth and 10 free throws the hes earn the double bonus 410 to play padulla will be looking for his 20th and 21st points of the Applause day will be two Applause Music foran carington for we chatt it with Jeff cable earlier today he said I dont believe in burning the tape I think youll learn from every experience you go through but he did not watch the Wake Forest film on Tuesday night didnt watch it all day Wednesday Wednesday night he was home everyone in his family was asleep hes a glutton for punishment he grab some Bourbon and started watching yeah no it was you know there he was going to see he was going to watch it at some point in time hent good night so that was a that was a oneoff from the way his ball Club have been playing and then again that weight team they were awfully awfully good at Applause home a steel Jaylen low lays it Applause in I mean this really this is almost a mirror image of what Virginia Tech did to Virginia in their last game or what w corus did to p yeah we talked about the open about it being a mirror well Jeff cable said this day in AG in college basketball every week you get a new team this teams looking good and youre great your game does the talk creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Jaylen Lows had himself a nice day Mike Kaminsky no hes been terrific very efficient 18 points hes did the shooting six assist great from the free throw line and carington doing all of his work in the second half hindered by foul issues only 5 minutes in the first half but this a different team heav with him on the on the uh on the floor in the second half especially up and down the floor and now a 20o lead for Pittsburgh a game that was tied at halftime 4121 since halftime and the momentum SW when padulla picked up his third less than a minute into the second half and then Couture picked up his third less than two minutes into the second half it all kind of mushroomed from there for Virginia Tech a little time a little shout out to some friends back home Whitney and Rick capan who just welcomed the daughter Josie Rose into the world very cool member of
