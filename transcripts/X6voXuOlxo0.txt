hes had to deal with hes Managed IT and hes run the offense and run the team well the kesas wins the tip theyre going to let it fly all night long what a start for the golden Griffins didnt take long Debbie they wont be shy tonight no this is a team that likes to shoot the three as well they make nine threes a game and they will play with a lot of pace and Tempo on the offensive end now theres head coach Reggie Withers spoon and year number eight as head coach of kesas his team playing some confident basketball right now you saw what they can do on the offensive end what are going to be the keys tonight Debbie well their leading scorer SE eall is a really good scorer he has to recognize all the coverage hes going to get they got to play with pace and in order to do that they have to be on the glass Frank Mitchell as the best rebounder in the ma Trey dkin is one of the best decision makers at the top of the floor offensively Applause it was I andall that opened the scoring with that three straight off the tip its interesting a year ago I and doll just averaging four points per game now hes tripled his production become a consistent scorer nine straight games in double figures theyll need him to be huge again tonight hes 6 hes added some muscle to his frame and they like to run offense through him his leg it cant connect gets his own rebound trying to squeeze it into feder Rico leit keeps it alive shot clock under 15 and another open three that time leg cashes it home thats a confident shooter right there legs a transfer from Rhode Island and he brings double figure scoring in every game this season as well all the talk about Bob Carrington it for good reason certainly doesnt look like a freshman but legs been great great in that backourt rebuild as well the scramble off the offensive rebound and the hustle play by lean he gets rewarded with a corner triple hon couldnt quite keep it in play theres Jeff capable the reigning ACC coach of the year hes H having to be very happy with how his team performed in the backyard braw a convincing 80 to 63 win against West Virginia we talked about Blake Hinson in that game but it was a great team effort Debbie yes Jay one of the things he talked to us about was how well his bench played they scored 25 points to outscore West Virginias bench they took care of the ball as well and handled the West Virginia pressure especially in the second Applause half Carrington called for the shove off there watch Carrington trying to get into the paint see he extends that arm otherwise he does a great job of getting to the paint and he gets two feet in the paint when he wants to Jay off the bounce at 66 hes got an explosive First Step hit three turnovers in the opening two minutes up high kous letting it Fly Frank Mitchell rocks the rim there good execution early on by kishis which is a good sign for them coming on the road playing against a power five Hinson from the lowo he is red hot the hottest shooter in all of college basketball he is really fun to watch like he is seeking offense and you got to come with a long close out on him and make him put it on the floor the nations leading threepoint shooter just buried his 40th three of the season kenish is trying to answer short you know what Jay Hinson is shooting better from the threepoint line in the last three games than he has been from the free throw line thats why you got to make him dribble into his jumper make that time right to the rim he can do it all Blake Applause Hinson your transition defense is going to be tested against kishis because theyre going to push on makes and misses Carringtons going to try his luck from the logo cant connect see and this is where you got Hinson who makes backto back baskets a three and a drive get him another look run something for him thats where Carringtons got to take his game to the ne Next Level inside Mitchell muscles it up and Applause in Frank Mitchell is a 68 junor he leads the Mac in offensive rebounding at better than three a game hes got a wide frame and hell use it against the taller front line of Pittsburgh pull up pop Carrington catches in he just does not look like a freshman he loves to get to that right hand too Jay hes really solid with that pullup jump Applause shot Applause both teams in a really good offensive flow to start this game Pittsburghs made four of their last five and if you dont know now you know the hottest shooter in all of college basketball Blake Hinson hes already got 43s on the year youre great games its four dribbles total when you count all 30 all 40 of his main threes thats it Jay catch and shoot hes coming off action gets his feet set hes letting it fly so what does that mean for kesas and youre trying to defend this guy so watch right here when he catches and hes on the logo you got to come all the way out and contest and get in his space and make him put it on the deck you got to get in his vision a little bit better you cant just let him get a clean look and I think you got to be more physical with him coming off a screen action to bump him off his rhythm a little Applause bit five minutes into this game Pittsburgh a fivepoint lead Kisha has come out aggressive offensively their leading scorer endall passes it up here money Bryce oo the senior from Dallas this Kenisha team is not backing Applause down trying to get Hinson on a post up right Applause there Carrington directing traffic shot clock at five her mod Diaz Graham triggers and hits the sophomore from Spain at seven feet shows off the range hes one of the more improved players at pit he made only seven threes all of last year hes already made nine this season back door open I and doll runs right through it for an easy up and in Ill tell you what coach weather spoon has run some really good stuff right here early on his action has been at The Rim going to the basket theyve already had a dunk and they had a back Applause door eond doll is a 41 threepoint shooter he does a nice job of kicking to Gadson and letting him knock it down and then on the other end watch garmo a little pick and pop action catches and lines it up really nice job to find the threepoint line Applause Blake Hinson leading all scorers right now with six his confidence is contagious for this pit team and Jeff cable told us that in addition to the awesome threepoint shooting where he leads the nation and made threes he has really improved as a leader as a teammate and has found his voice this season you know some guys welcome that role of being the goto guy and he definitely has relished that hes prepared for it he went down 20 lbs in the off season to get himself ready to play extended minutes thats doing it not just with your words but with your actions as well I andall into traffic draws the foul he was Triple team there going Baseline and hell head to the line for two see M andall coming off a season High 24 points against Robert Applause Morris and next Saturday right here on ACCC Network its a college basketball quadruple header the games you must watch Vermont and Virginia Tech the catamounts theyve got a really good team under John Becker theyll be in blackburg at four eastern time and then North Eastern at Virginia four games all right here on acc Network I feel like the ACC is wide open going into this season right I mean I dont feel like theres a dominant team we thought Duke was going to be it they did win today but they were coming off a backtoback losses should be interesting is it Clemson Debbie it might be Clemson right now their stock is up and Ill tell you who elses stock is up Wake Forest Steve Forbes getting Fon Reed available I think Wake Forest is going to be in the running and either can win the league or determine who will win it look at Henson using that frame to get inside well there was a lot of contact seems like hes made a concerted effort tonight to go inside more not just camp out inside the arc kesas has made their last three one possession G game here at the peak thats illegal screen by Mitchell watch Mitchell right here oh I dont see much right there it looks like he just lost his balance little Zone over against Kus yeah golden Griffins goes Zone here wide open Jorge Diaz Graham cant make kishas pay step back three for the tie got it Trey dinkin ties this game at 17 Trey dinkin is a 47 threepoint shooter that is a beautiful step back in the corner brother to brother there Jorge to guo the Diaz Graham twins theyve stepped up now in their sophomore season rattled in and out it was halfway down for oo no good run the floor well his first game was against North Carolina a game that Jason actually played in Reggie Withers weather smooth was coaching basketball for a long time a great basketball mind and a tease for later in the game well tell you who his first college coach was at eie Community College its a Hall of Famer and we cant wait to tell that story Reggies team despite that airball playing really well on the road Midway through this first half only down by four Welly the pace is really picked up right here your transition defense is going to be tested HBOs been active in perfect position there to cash in PTO Rico its intercepted Trey dinkin hes been pushing the floor at point guard all night long for kesas the golden Griffins have come in confident now a chance to take the lead and they do I dont think TJ Porter had any sweat on him the last time he went down the floor this time he knocks it down he was wide open the first Applause try I like that middle ball screen action with Carrington right down the lane everything but the Finish from jayen Music Applause Music Applause low Jeff doing a good job getting a hand on it watch the ball movement right here he sets a screen and then the penetr inside and guo overh helps or or H overh helps and that leaves Porter wide open that tag is going to come from the weak side most times not from the strong side on that ball screen Applause action Pittsburgh gives it right Applause back Applause heres Porter again left open fails to make him Applause pay both of these teams running and gunning and transition bu Carrington knocks it down from Applause mention transition defense out a premium youre seeing that from both teams watch how quickly Pits going to push right here you got to run the floor hard and wide Carrington does a great job of get using the behind the dribble behind the back dribble to get his balance and get himself organized I like the Zone by whether you know Jay cuz they dont have the same kind of depth that pit has might be just a good Tempo change yeah I was about to ask you about Tempo who who does the fastpac tempo favor in this game well it it favors pit because of their length their talent and their depth but thats the way Kenisha plays and you dont want to change what you do take the air out of the ball here you dont have enough you dont want to play uh you dont want to Slug It Out in a quarter court with them for 40 minutes thats why you see Kisha pushing so hard and looking to score quickly contested three Gadson lefted short gets his own rebound keeps it alive into the lane dinkin draws the foul chance to tie it at the line look at this zone right here its a tandem 23 and you mat they match up with players in their area and see theyre doing a really good job of switching right there and keeping the Zone mantoman principles inside the zon you know sometimes coaches will go Zone and then switch to man underneath 10 on the shot clock but I dont think weve gotten anywhere close to 10 on the shot clock yet youre right something to watch tonight as this game continues tied at 24 as kishes comes in the number four team in the country in threepoint defense holding teams of just 24 from three well Pittsburghs got Blake Hinson and a lot of other guys that can knock it down from Deep right now shooting Applause 40 low floater Falls really good job getting in the Gap not over Applause penetrating good ball movement on this end of the floor as well for Kish and the passing has been on point leads to another three that is now six assists on nine made shots tonight for kesas and the golden Griffins are back in front Leed draws the foul back and forth we go Debbie watch Jaylen low right here get to the Elbow beautiful Lefty floater and then on the other side police drills the triple we got a good game in the first half played two seasons together at Erie Community College at Witherspoon was telling us he learned so much from John beine and still very much uses the stuff he learned all the way back then in practice every day with his golden Griffins we asked him what was in the secret sauce and he said really nothing taking care of the ball and playing mantoman defense and playing it well and if you can do those two things you can have success we know coach beine was very much about the fundamentals of the game and wither food shared a great story that the only reason beine got the job at Eerie Community College is because the coach before him a gentleman by the name of kerm Helmer was the bowling coach and the basketball coach and the athletic director went to Helmer and said you cant do both so we got to hire a new bowling coach and Helmer turned around and said no you need to hire a basketball coach cuz Im sticking with bowling and they landed John Applause beine what a great story he loved telling us that story too we had a really good conversation with him and his teams played well Pittsburgh with backto back baskets but still a one possession game Jeff C trying to turn it up a notch on the defensive end they go to trap the ball screen action but eall finishes at The Rim Pi going a little too quick there the turnovers have hit the Panthers tonight in this first half theres six theyre shooting the ball really well Debbie 60 but too many turnovers for Jeff Cables team in this first half you know theres a difference between playing fast and playing in in a hurry and theres a change of cadence when you after you push if you dont get anything Prim on the primary and there again theres another trap on the wing that results in a turnover but they in trying to push the ball up the floor go back to back turning it back over giving it back to kesas we said at the beginning of this game that Pittsburghs coming off their most complete performance of the Season Wednesday in the backyard brawl at West Virginia they had six turnovers in that entire game they already have six turnovers in the opening 13 minutes of this game well Blake Hensons been a little quiet here lets see if they can get him going trying to get him on a post up right there calling for it gets it on the drive puts it up and in Blake Hinson you cant bump him off his line he is just too strong that frame is so solid when you cant leave the Applause ball hon with 11 showing that hes not just a threepoint shooter tonight shot clock at five for kesas trying to answer how about the floater Trey dinkin The Perfect Touch its a great recognition of the switch kous just trailing by Music one we have a special guest today on ESPN college game day the Geo Deo look just get it apart when you tell everyone how easy it is to ensure whats important to them home car even RV come on theres an RV right there did he even see the talking points I gave him I dont believe so sir for all your insurance needs from home to car to RV its easy to Geo this I forgot the talking points Applause now back and forth we go at the peak these two teams going punch for punch in a couple of floaters here Debbie oh watch Hinson right here attack the Baseline side handle the contact with that frame and finish and then dinkin recognizing the switch we have had three ties five lead changes tonight Pittsburgh had made their last four before that Miss and Kish has made their last three both teams shooting better than 50 from the floor in this first half its been an outstanding offensive matchup Mitchell shooting over a double team thats no good leg keeps it in play and now heres jayen low transition ball has been the the key for pits offensive success Applause tonight shot CL under 10 Diaz Graham and weve got a wedgie in Pittsburgh yeah Diaz Graham has got to go up strong with that frame and finish and gadston is playing Hinson right now now face guarding with a no catch uh that is really hard for a a big guy to stick it in the rim like that hes supposed to be playing Above the Rim Jay not below the rim tomorrow right here on acc Network a womens basketball double header it tips off at noon with Duke in Florida Golf coast and then a rivalry game at two Kentucky and Louisville Duke coming off a loss in conferences play against Clemson Manda Butlers team with a big win at home diazah misses both from the line Pittsburgh hasnt really gotten many chances from the foul line tonight just two of four trapped in the corner d trouble somehow passes out of it and then its stolen away jayen low the steel and the score I think Jeff cable coming off the last two timeouts has really changed the tempo of the game on the defensive end because theyre looking to trap theyre being more aggressive theyre taking a few risks another Panthers headed to a third straight national semifinal what a scene at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse just right up the hill from where we are at the Peterson Event Center awesome moment and a great day for Pittsburgh Athletics Debby Antonelli Jay alter with you the mens basketball team in a dog fight here one possession game and now tied deep three Trey dinkin delivers the volleyball team at pit had a incredible comeback down 02 in sets and win three in a row to advance and uh lets see if Pittsburgh men they have been having to play from behind a little bit here tonight as well jeffris answers hes been a big boost off the bench William jeffris jayen low that was off the ball slow to get up thats just Jeffersons second triple of the season shooting a little with a lot of confidence right here once the ball goes inside thats a great time to get a kick to the top and then low looks like he gets tangled up a little bit runs into head coach Reggie Applause Witherspoon this has been a really fun back and forth first half another chance to tie it its good well Porter hasnt been known as a threepoint shooter and he hasnt had a lot of minutes so far this season but hes knocked down two here in the first half so the Scout was not to guard him lets see if they make an adjustment fifth tie of the night these two teams going back and forth jeffris cant connect transition three on it it way too much on it Hinson rips down the Applause rebound Hinson in attack mode right to the rim everything but the Finish good job matching up in transition by pit they run a little clear Applause out iall double teamed and draws the foul a chance to take the lead at the foul line and what a night it is for TJ Porter so far Deb now watch Porter right here Diaz Graham is sinking into the pain hes helping out on driving Lanes he didnt even come close to a close out and Porter has been wide open for both of his threepoint makes kesas has knocked down seven threes tonight shooting better than 50 from the floor we remind you every weekday ACC PM its starts 400 PM every day Taylor tanon bomb Mark Packer from the Charlotte Studio they will have plenty to talk about with college basketball in full swing and Debbie you were on acc PM yesterday werent you I was I got to spend some time with uh Mark Packer he was in the basement like always we talked to little womens Hoops last night big games on the ACC slate as we mentioned earlier Kentucky and Louisville in the nonconference thats always a great rivalry game thatll be a packed house in the Yum Center kesas with the lead seven made threes thats been the recipe numbers for pit feder Rico feder Rico been quiet and is Applause foul its not a bad foul when feder Rico is around the rim hes just a 39 free throw shooter you know last season he came out of nowhere to be one of the stars of that spectacular season Pittsburgh had played with energy and passion people fell in love with him Jeff Cel said and now theres expectations and that can somehow seal your joy seal the the surprise Factor if you will well you know what Jay hes a a rim Runner a lob catcher a putb and a drop off post player and if he does those things well and protects the rim and is a good screener and runs the floor he can help pit win in a lot of ways and a lot of that wont even be on the stat sheet well step aside for 30 seconds really good ball game here at Music Pittsburgh youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks B three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winningest programs in division one most of any conference its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC accomplished greatness not much to separate kesas and Pittsburgh in this first half weve had five ties five lead changes Pittsburghs largest lead is five kishs largest lead is three so it has been a tight game since tip off and kesas is not shy they have come into Pittsburgh with Applause confidence Swit one through switching one through four Applause Hinson showing some versatility in his game right I mean we know he can score he leads the ACC in scoring and if youre going to run him off the threepoint line which is the strategy to guard him right now since hes made more threes than anybody else in D1 basketball you got to take him off the threepoint line and make him make a decision with the ball off the bounce keep in mind hes 68 hes strong hes experienced and he is ready to rip and get to the rim and he can handle any kind of contact hon makes them both from the foul line Pittsburgh back in front I think pit has been patient I think Jeff cable has been Applause patient CH loock under 10 and what has been a highscoring first half seam eend looking for more and he gets it Pittsburgh with time under five left in the first half Hinson from the logo missed it hes got range from there could not connect heres Blake Hinson Carrington and now leit good ball movement on this opening possession Jeff lines up the three and drills it thats a great possession coming out of the locker room everyone gets a touch ball reverses sides of the floor a couple of times you get a great look thats Jeffersons second triple he was a big boost off the bench in the Backyard Brawl on Wednesday in the win against West Virginia made an impact here to start the second half and so will Mitchell for kishis only 11 minutes in the first half with those two fouls but hes aggressive around the rim and hes the best rebounder in their league Mitchell post up right now floats out behind in the arc 23 and go calling for the ball and gets it Mitchell spinning his way in for two hes tough now I mean hes got a big frame hes got a Wings span hes got great footwork on the inside he gets right into the chest of a shot Applause blocker heres Bob Carrington in attack mode right down the lane missed it Applause kadish is running the floor Frank Mitchell on a rack attack transition defense you got to stop the ball you throw it up at the rim and Diaz Graham doesnt finish it and it gives kesas a downhill opportunity in transition Hanson looking for the immediate answer misses it Mitchell rips down the rebound you can see the impact that Mitchells having early on in the second half aggressive around the Applause hoop hes been a double double machine this season for Kus going inside again its too easy Yori Fritz and Kus leads by Applause four Mitchell aggressive in the post up goes right into the front of the rim and buries Diaz Graham inside and then beats everyone down the floor ahead of the ball great flush at The Rim I love that how creative is Applause that just a little etch of sketch Jay you think of everything Debbie thats what I love working with you kenish is on a six nothing run to start the second half Pittsburgh has been held scoreless here Hinson trying to change that it just wont drop for the Panthers right now well Mitchell is putting a lot of pressure on both ends of the floor on Pittsburghs defense and his ability to run the floor and post up inside here he is with the ball dink step back three fading away cant Applause connect thats a smart play by Carrington he runs right up the back side of the the Poston transition Pittsburgh getting good looks they just cant Applause finish Pittsburghs missed six straight shots a lot of them from in close a scoring Dr thats now 3 minutes and 30 seconds carington trying to change it he cant do Applause it Carrington does a really good job reading that weak side and making that steal and watch jeffris right here off the back iron he tries to tap it to himself to keep it alive good conversion by kishis I money zll unafraid and this is the largest lead for either team tonight an8 nothing Kish run I dont think you can speed up iton doll he does a really good job of keeping the pit defender on his hip that allows him to have some separation for that midrange shot thats just a smart play four minutes without a basket for Pittsburgh its allowed Kish to go on an eight nothing run Carrington in attack mode Fades away and hits Pittsburgh needed it Bob Carrington Applause delivers great fake out Yori Fritz dialed in right now Jay Hinson left the ball he was right there in the middle of the lane and then he left to go out and cover a shooter I tell you what Gatson has done a really good job on Hinson he has really limited his opportunities hon staying with it draws the the foul good hustle play there from Blake hson right now kious in the driver seat on the road C mall he hasnt missed a shot tonight five for five and the Freshman Bob Carrington trying to will pit back but they have definitely run him off the threepoint line tonight and thats the way you got to guard him J I mean hes hes too good out there if you let him have Vision to the rim and let him catch and shoot I might see some full court pressure here by coach cable coming off these free throws just to change the Rhythm a little yeah theyre going to extend their pressure I like it looking to trap across mid court and kenish just does a good job of reversing the basketball and here you go you get a stop sometimes when you change the rhythm of the game defensively you can stimulate your team on the offensive end heres is legett and now Carrington shot clock at seven hon calling for it Carrington keeps it himself for a three cant connect offensive rebound Keeps The Possession alive thats a big board by Federico feder Rico rolling replace Applause action Kisha shooting 54 from the floor a fourpoint lead on the road the floater got it plus the foul see I doll putting on a Applause show I mean he still has it missed look at Gastons defense right here because of transition he ends up matched up by kington he moves his feet he closes contests and then eall right here with a floater and one opportunity see MLL six for six from the floor you talk about efficiency hes got 17 points on six field goal attempts jay make that 18 points hes perfect five for five from the foul line six for six from the field 18 points after a season High 24 points last time out carington great hesitation couldnt finish it though theres a foul on the ensuing rebounds itll stay pit basketball trailing by seven here Debbie pit has just made one of their last 12 what needs to change offensively for the Panthers well you know Ive seen coach cable a couple of times throw Blake Henson to the block to post him up but I think Blake has been impatient and waiting down there to you know take advantage of his matchup especially with eond doll guarding him thats one way to cool off the hot hand is to put some pressure on him on the def carington delivers a big time three a freshman stepping up here still learning improving but continues to take steps forward 12 points to his name on the night Zone Applause D theres that trap on the wing see Fed Rico feder Rico cant commit that foul right there youre late in the shot clock you got a great trap on the wing you got play the game on balance watch Hinson right here being defended and then Carrington comes off that little brush screen and then right here keep your Music Applause balance CH clock at five Kish has to hurry pesi ripped it away Jorge Diaz Graham turns Kish Applause over stay pitball underneath their own hoop the Panthers trailing by four this game has been tight throughout the urgent need for cancer research you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of donations go directly to cancer research that is my favorite part of the speech Jay because I do know his family I know his daughters uh Jamie and Nicole his two oldest daughters are friends of mine and it did save Jams life and that is exactly why we need money for research we got to if you can do something please y you said it best you said it best Debbie and I know you you know the Valvano family very well and whatever we can do at ESPN to to do our part watch the execution here by pit okay okay theyre coming off a baseline out of bounds Carrington calls for the ball screen he get the hard roll to the rim and feder Rico makes an easy pass this time and you go Swing Swing one more and its a wideopen triple for the lead too much on it Kisha led by as many as seven the lead is shrunk to one iall thats his first Miss of the night was a perfect six for six before that misfired go to the same set theyre running the same play cant leave him open thats why you know its coming you still cant stop it Blake Hinson the nations leader in threepoint makes adds another that hard Roll by feder Rico sets up that extra space for Henson thats why its so important to be a hard Rim roller and a rim Runner it can change the space on the floor Id go right back to the same set I know coach cable that doesnt over Coach it if its Applause working contested shot no good from Carrington for freshman that thats where hes going to grow Jay like hes going to get a feel for in a big moment in a game right thatll be part of the maturation process for Applause him cuz hes certainly capable of making every shot in every play now hes going to get a better feel for how to run the rhythm of the team and a late foul call Hinson cant believe it DJ Gaton was short on the threepoint attemp Jeff cable is lived good take another Applause look well did Henson get into his space uh down below when he came down because thats thats what we didnt see and thats what hes questioning and asking the ref right Applause now from this angle watch hinsons feet so theres no contact up top Jeff Capel was calling for a flop and you know the rules have changed this year Jay so theres no warning if there was a flop and the officials dont really like calling it it would be a technical foul well in a tie game thats a big call because TJ gadon gets three foul shots I dont think thats a foul Debbie no it has to do with the landing area it doesnt have to do with a shot up top gadon makes all three from the line so kenish is back in front back and forth we go pit having to earn this one after an 8063 win in the Backyard Brawl they are getting tested here at home by kesas really good cut that time by Carrington see hes been playing with the ball in his hands most of the time right all of his offense comes off the bounds his ability to get to the midrange hes going to learn to be a really good cutter like thats an excellent Scream by feder Rico orge Diaz Graham trying to spin his way in and it drops to make it a onepoint Applause game staying in that extended three4 court Applause pressure I and do who has 18 points to lead Kenisha number five and goal you have to think everything works through him down the stretch of this game its a turnover on that side the right side of the Zone You got 611 and 610 on the wing you got to run offense on the other side of the floor Le it for the lead count it plus the foul Isle Applause it well I love the change in defense by Jeff cable team because its given them some momentum on this end of the floor this is just great footwork by leg it to step through handle the contact and throw it off the glass couldnt complete the threepoint play but he does give Pittsburgh back the lead by Applause one Frank Mitchell hes got so much muscle fires kesas back in front hes tough and hes been a difference in this second Applause half great pass leged a three got Music it and a turnover leg get got 10 backto back baskets for the transfer from Rhode Island he scored scored in double figures in every single game this season and these two based give Pittsburgh a twopoint lead with under eight left has been a great coaching adjustment by Jeff cable by going to that three quter court pressure and falling back into that zone pits made their last three shots the last two belong to ish leged feder Rico feder Rico perfectly done inside and pit now leads by four so pitch situational offense has been very good theyre atto after timeout and you give feder Rico a catch at the front of the rim where he doesnt have to make any decision except for go and Applause score hendall 5 Seconds to shoot down the lane missed it after making his first six seam endall has missed his last two and what was a sevenpoint kous lead in just 6 minutes has turned in to a pit fourpoint Advantage leot lines up the three and buries it is leot delivers from deep I love the short roll in the middle third you get the ball to feder Rico in the middle of the lane where he has two options shoot it or pass it to the corner oh kious needed that the immediate answer cuts the lead down to four now Zone by kishis six minutes to play hit has made their last five shots on a 12 to5 run Blake Hinson flying to the rim for two nobodys stepping in to draw a charge on that straight line drive hinsons got Applause 20 seejay look at that side of the Zone over there on the left side youve got Diaz Graham and feder Rico thats a lot of length Carrington just comes off that pick and roll and leaves it at the front of the rim for feder Rico heres the short roll the kick to the corner leot does a great job of sliding and relocating into the vision of feder Rico timeout Applause Kus the golden Griffins have lost control of this game they led by seven at the 315 Mark in the the second half since then it has been all Pittsburgh Panthers now lead by six theyve made their last six Music shots I think its a good time out they couldnt get the ball in bounds it gives them a chance right here to get organized on a baseline out of bounds play lets see what defense Jeff capable will put his team in on this particular possession since about the 12 minute Mark they have been in some extended pressure falling back into a Zone look at Henson right there firing his guys up getting their focus back so you got to come with that long close out Fritz all the way out to the hashm Mark and he just goes on a straight line drive look at Mitchell gets out of the way because youre not going to draw charge there and youre not going to block that shot when hes got a head of steam coming at you straight line H hson the nations leading threepoint shooter has been a lot more than that for pit tonight hasnt been afraid to get it done on the drive eall in trouble Hinson getting it done defensively Blake Hinson why you lost the handle and its kishas ball yeah what a play by dinkin he gets the deflection off a Hinson that should have been two points for pit and anytime you put the ball behind your back or you spin in the middle of the floor you got to realize theres going to be help Hinson right here dkin gets a hand on it makes a great Applause play under five left in regulation its been a tight game throughout dkin pull up pop got Applause it hes been forced into the point guard position because teski has been out with a foot injury or ankle injury he played the backup point last year but hes done an excellent job this year taking care of the ball and managing the team and hitson sticks it from Deep you cannot make a mistake on Blake Henson no one has made more triples in Division one mens basketball at this point in the season than Blake Henson he is three for four from deep and look how quick the catch and shoot and he steps into it and Carrington puts it right in sticks it right in the pocket and even though youre there you got to get in his window he is so good outside the ark check this out on the season hes made 42 triples 38 of them are catch and shoot the previous three games he made 23s and only dribbled three times on the 42 M threes because we tracked it before the game hes d a a total of four times all season its going to be fun to keep up with that number as the year goes on yes it will right now the nations leading threepoint shooter 42 on the year which leads all of division one and hes made three or more threes in each of the last nine games four minutes to go shot clock down to five kesas in the danger zone needing a bucket dinkin from the logo misfires bounces around oo trying to keep it alive and Hinson digs it out for pit Blake Hinson doing it all for the Panthers Applause tonight thats an excellent defensive possession by pit because they forc that deep three and then the gritty play to get possession foul called 323 remaining Kish led by seven about 10 minutes ago in this game and Pittsburgh is roared back because of hustle plays like this I mean its winning time right and you mentioned Hensons got 23 but that play right there doesnt show up on the stat sheet and thats how you lead a team to Music Victory inside Federico Kick Out carington Lines up the three missed it Jeffers with another hustle play keeps it alive for pit and now three minutes left in this game and pit with all the momentum in the crowd behind him the hustle highlight reels looking good right now Jay up fto R hammers it Applause home and it took a while but the Oakland Zoo is in full voice willing the Panthers to the Finish Line dinkin silences them with a huge three to keep kesas in it its a two possession game with 230 to Applause play Trey dkin 42 outside the ark this season which is top in the Mac he gets right in the seam of that Music zone this is why you have a chance to win is because Jeffers is willing to make this hustle play right here and then leg it leaves it and feder Rico finishes it and you come down and dkin who shoots it better from three than from two right now gets right in the slot its why when you go in a gym Jay and you see those xs on the floor on thats that part of the Court thats where youre supposed to be and x marks the spot for dinkin how much fun has this game been its been tight throughout back and forth 15 lead changes in Pittsburgh trying to hold on to this sixpoint lead full core pressure coming from kishis Carrington slows things down clinging to a sixpoint lead Pittsburghs made eight of their last nine to take control of this game Hinson leads the way with 23 make it 25 plus the foul Blake hdson has taken over I love this by Jeff k well he says Im going to my guy right here and were going to finish this off this way ISO matchup he can take advantage of dinkin trying to hold his ground too strong two points and an and one opportunity for Music hon 26 points on the night for Blake kinson he might be the hottest player at all of college basketball right now Debbie he might be I mean he has been outstanding can you sustain it when we talked to Jeff capable the first thing he said to us yesterday was sustain sustain what were doing sustain the level get contributions from the bench whos coming away with the rebound jump ball is the call possession arrow with kishis a minute 34 remaining the golden Griffins time not on their side they have battled all night long Deb they led by seven with 13 minutes left in this Applause game well and then the stretch Jay where pit went has well right now pit has made nine of their last 10 I mean they have finished the game off by working through the middle third a lot of feder Rico in the short roll and a lot of Blake Hinson iena the leading scorer leaves it for gadon who misfires you got to believe the depth has a wear down effect on opponents I think were seeing that from kishis right now that Pits depth has played a factor bub Carrington playing the role of closer The Freshman an 11point lead the largest of the night Pittsburgh has played their best basketball when its mattered most Mitchell Slams on the answer but time not on kishs side just 55 seconds Music left well again Im going to go back to pit trailing by seven around the 12minute mark J coming out of that timeout coach cable switched up to three4 court put some pressure on stayed in that zone and its a big Zone when youve got 610 and 611 on the wings and look at that the clock stops while the balls in Play Its at least five or six seconds ran off so theyre going to have to adjust this theyre going to have to get the stopwatch Music Applause out I think theyre probably going to go with 5 Seconds boy Mitchell has been available at The Music Rim I think Jeff Cables going to be really proud of his second half effort of his team Jay that they responded to some adversity you know and you put a nonconference schedule together so that you could put your team in different situations he knew that Reggie Witherspoon would bring a well prepared balanced fast attack to his team and they brought the Music fight made a three right off the opening tip of this game kious has battled for its entirety but pit when this game was hanging in the balance when it was going back and forth 15 lead changes just punch for punch pit has made 11 of their last 12 shots since trailing 5447 the Panthers have outscored Kenisha 3317 risky pass but Carrington grabs it under 40 seconds now how fun is it going to be to watch Carrington continue to evolve at the point he just gets better and better and he has played the role of closer tonight this freshman isnt playing like an Applause 18yearold 16 points for Bob Carrington and what will go down as a winning effort and Pittsburgh has their largest lead of the night here in crunch time the score wont reflect what was an even game Debbie but Pittsburgh did what they needed to do when it mattered most they got challenged they faced some adversity they handled their execution offensively and you can see the friendship between the two head coaches thats a big win for pit cuz kishis is going to have an excellent season in the Mac a big Embrace between Witherspoon and cable those two won the gold medal together in 2010 for USA Basketball so much respect between those two men these two programs but its Pittsburgh who closes the game in Furious fashion they make 12 of their last 13 shots and The Vibes are good
