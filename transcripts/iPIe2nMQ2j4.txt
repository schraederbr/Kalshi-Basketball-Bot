Cal has got to pay attention to Elias Ralph Cal seven and one for the first time since Conso Martins last season The last time Cal was 81 which they can get to with a win today was the first season Conzo Martin was at Berkeley Well and he had some great home records And thats what you want Roxy is you want your team to play well at home and get a dominance going A little bit of a tweak in the starting lineup for Mark Mansion today as Dewan Campbell makes his first start of the season Chris Bell will come off the bench as Day Ames is tripped and will get to the line just 24 seconds into the ball game But Chris Bell who has started each of the first eight games for Cal coming off the bench today Mark Madson just wants to get a look at some different combinations Well its interesting because if if you know if you have a team that can do that the luxury of doing that and Cal does sometimes that can help you and you know theyve got some injuries some guys that have been coming back in the lineup but putting different guys in the lineup giving you them a chance thats not a bad thing for your team Fouls on Justin Rashlin of Pacific as Mark Madson has the Bears seven and one and Day Ames goes one for two for the line An 86 foul shooter and Cals got the first point now Some extended pressure Keels been good at this Roxy Theyve done a good job of getting back now and trying to set up that zone or manto man out of this press There is a floor to transfer Kais Kiscus for Lithuania for Pacific Shot clock down to seven for the Tigers Kiscus on the drive STUMBLES cheering GOT rid of it before he traveled but its a shot clock violation and UOP with a turnover on their first possession Yeah either way that was going to be a turnover uh and over and back almost and then the shot clock violation but good foul defense to start and a lot of it again coming from that fullourt press back to zone Dave Smart a really interesting story his second year as the head coach in Pacific Was an assistant at Texas Tech previously but a legendary coach up in Canada One of the most successful maybe the most successful Canadian college coach in the history of their country as Justin Pippen hits the pullup jumper cheering and Cal with their first field goal of the game cheering Heres Kabiscus backing it away Shot clock at 10 Pacific will play a little bit of a slower tempo more of a grind from the Tigers Down low Isaac Jack goes inside and with a left hand gets the first points for the Tigers Yeah again the shot clock exhausted but scoring just before it went off So again good Cal defense but good patience by the Tigers Heres Pippen Turn the corner inside for Lee Dort and Dort makes it home Well thats a a gift from Justin Pip and he found the big fella underneath Did a nice job of just being patient and finding the big guy for two Just over two minutes in cheering TJ Wayne Wright transfer from Long Beach State This is an older veteran group that Dave cheering Smart has with Pacific Wayne Right A deep three That one rattles out and Lee Dort secures it He had a careerhigh tying 11 rebounds in the win against Utah on Tuesday He had a terrific allaround game Also with three assists with those 11 rebounds and eight points John Camden 10 to shoot for Cal cheering Day Ames tried to penetrate defended by Roshan and the step back BY DAY AS HE BANKS it in Roxy banks open on Saturdays I dont care what to tell you That was straight off the glass Didnt call it but I dont think he cares He got the three Second three for Cal The Bears off to a really good start Cal as a team 38 on their threes applause Is Kabiscus cheering TJ Wright his third different school way right five to shoot forest way out cheering heres Kabliscus from deep thats short and the rebound chasing it in the corner and it goes out of bounds last touch by Cal will stay at this end it belongs to Pacific thats really good defense by Cal I mean the shots you know that theyre getting but its Ames thats just able to get shots and able to go back up again and you know well we get a bank shot in there but hes been really hard to guard Just oneonone Hes an impossible cover Youre going to have to bring somebody to him when he starts dribbling the basketball Too lethal So fresh 20 for the Tigers Kiscus off the bench in the game A senior from Ontario Canada Transfer from Manus Kabiscus way off cheering to the shot and then John Crals it for Cal Another good possession defensively for Cal Pippet in transition Too strong on the three First miss for the floor for Cal as theyre three for four from the field Here is Elias Ralph who played three cheering years of Canadian college basketball at the University of Victoria with the miss Knocked away Justin Rashlin with a hands Heres Roslin launching a three and John Candon the rebound for Cal cheering And the Bears will love to push Cal wants to play a little bit quicker and force some tempo if they can Theyve done a very good job of that this year Every opportunity they can they push it in transition Heres Day Ames Pippen left OPEN THREE Now that was caused because they went under the screen and gave a wide open And in addition to his offense much like somebody in his family he can defend and he enjoys doing that So hes been a real bright spot so far Cals made three threes already in this game UP who called a timeout Theyve missed their last five shots but Dave Smart has this team off to a really good start They have a strong net ranking as Pacific ranked right now number 81 in the first edition of the net rankings which is the formula used or at least one of them used by the NCA selection committee and just for comparison Cal is ranked 52 in the first installment of the net rank They played a good schedule as said they but you know what Cals really improved Roxy is their defense You you you notice the points theyre putting on the glass on the on the boards but theyve really stepped up defensively Shot clock down to five Justin Rashlin Here is Elias Ralph Two to shoot for the Tigers Ralph across the key Didnt get it off in time Second time The second shot clock violation in five plus minutes for Pacific to start the game Yeah And thats again a sign as as to the point we just said Their defense Cal has really stepped things up Theyve made it very difficult for their opponents this year to score and thats why their offense has gone up Chris Bell in the game for Cal as is Milos Elich as Elich the senior from Serbia the transfer from Lyola Maryland and Bell off the bench for the first time today Heres John Candon on a step back and its 142 Cal Well I was going to say hes been a little quiet but you know what When you got balance guys can be quiet He steps up and does exactly what he can do Scores for his team 10 straight for the Golden Bears Yeah theyre playing with a lot of confidence on the drive Drop off inside the reverse laying underneath and Isaac Jack cheering who is a 78 field goal shooter All basically because Ben thats where he shoots from right around the rim Its nice to have a guy like that Lee Dort the same shoots 69 for Cal So its nice to have some space eaters that can take up space and score on the block Jack last year at Dayton shot 82 basketball Day Ames flips it and the pass squeaks through to Chris Bell who backs his way of the key and a STEP BACK FROM BELL COUNT IT and one Chris Bell He shows you his versatility and how tough he is to guard I mean he goes up over the top you at 67 Not much you can do I mean theres just not many guys in the floor that can go up and challenge Chris Bell and he scored it and got absorbed the foul First on TJ Wright and Dave Smart trying to find a combination right now thatll jumpst start his team Well theyve got two dilemmas on their hands One is how can they score against this stingy Cal defense and two how can they stop Cal Cal is just playing on all cylinders with their balance Wouldnt go for Bell Pinled out And the rebound Isaac Jack for the Tigers cheering Elias Ralph cheering Ralph down the lane Ralph missing and the follow and the put back Isaac Jack has all six for the Tigers Well thats been one area If theres one area that Kell would like to shore up this year its the its securing defensive rebounds At times theyve been susceptible to the putbacks on the offensive glass Nolan Dorsy in the game now for Cal as Bell The pullup jumper and the rebound grabbed by Alexis Marmallejo the senior from the Dominican Republic A transfer from Lamar as TJ Rainwright to pull up jumper and theres Nolan Dorsy clearing it cheering for Cal Now both teams trying to push it in transition Pippen launching too strong with a three and the rebound falls to Alexis Marmaleos Transition three by Marmaleos rattles out and rebound Milos Elich for Cal That was a good look Back door for John Camden Nice pass but then Camden missing inside off the feed for Milos Hes disappointed himself rushing a little bit Was this great move shovels it and Elias Ralph missing the dunk and here comes Cal back the other way cheering Three on four Pippet penetrates John Cam in the trailer LETS FLY THREE cheering But you go underneath screens against John Camden he will make you pay the price He got buried the defender did and he just took what the defense gave and cheering knocked it down Cal is four for five from three and an answer and Pacific desperately needed that one Well they were about to go down big double digits and that shot narrows the gap But Cal playing with a lot of confidence You can see it just the way theyre playing They really feel sure about their abilities on the drive and then Justin Pippen lost it out of bounds and Cal with their first turnover Yeah hes saying he got a little help I love you Chris You saw his bio right there Most of you know he played and coached at Cal and now comes back to his alma mater to take over the reigns Exciting news Talked to his dad John yesterday who was a former coach as well Uh they couldnt be prouder of Taj and had a chance to know Taj when I coached here Fine young man can really work get things done Underneath the flip no good from KC Abecue And Beckways name might be familiar to you having played at both Oregon State and Washington prior to Pacific Cal with the ball up 10 TT Carr in the ball game The freshman from Mil Valley Chris Bell elbow jumper Speaking of De La and and Taj Lo you youre talking about Chris Bell also a Dell product and Josh having played for the great Bob Latasur Thats thats pretty good connection right there The Pacific team on a fourgame winning streak their longest since 2019 2020 And the runner short in the line with the offensive rebound pit for Pacific Here it is Clayton deep three short from Alexis Marleos and a foul is called Yeah good offensive rebound Titi trying to get his man contained but the box out was a little late Thats good hustle I mean you know you you know where your shots going If youre a shooter dont sit there and admire it Go after it And he did First on TT Carr 12point lead for Cal But Pacific the last time they won five in a row you got to go back to 2012 2013 And thats what theyre trying to do today But down 219 And theyve won each of the last four by double digits including coming off an 8065 win at Air Force Wednesday night when they outscored Air Force 4826 in the paint Beckway rattles out and the rebound towan Campbell for Calivic had just seven turnovers in the win against the Falcons and a perimeter foul called against the Tigers Well Coach Smart told us before the game Roxy that you know hes played some good teams and theyve had a good start but hes really was concerned about this Cal team He has a lot of respect for Cal and how theyre playing So this is a different level for them on the road He knows this is a tough tough matchup Pacific seven and two their best start since beginning 8 and1 back in 2013 2014 as Chris Bell another pullup jumper and he makes that look so easy he comes off the screen he curl cuts youre on his hip and he takes what the defense gives you just goes over the top you thats just an unstoppable shot lead for Cal the Tigers just one for their last eight from the field Three on the way In and out for Jaden Clayton The offensive rebound Isaac Jack The kick out Kais Kiscus Corner three on the way And thats too strong from Jaden Clayton Another offensive rebound for UOP And the runner goes for Alexis Marleos Well thats just scrainess You know when your shots arent falling and they havent been you got to go try to make something happen Great job on the offensive glass by the Tigers They already have seven offensive rebounds Thats a lot And the pass picked off Isaac Jack reading it Marmallejos in transition And the shot missed Left it short Challenged by Nolan Forson Alexis Marmallejo short on that three And a foul going for the rebound as Dewan Campbell got knocked down and its called against Pacific And its on Jayon Pit of the Tigers his first That was good rebounding position by the Cal Bears and Campbell He had his position down low and was able to draw the foul Team foul number four on UOP Well you mentioned the success that the Tigers have had but again theyre going up against Cal whos also had some success Cals been playing really good basketball Cal seven and one for the first time since 2016 2017 Conso Martins last season Dewan Campbell picks it up Will Chris Bell get credit for an assist I dont think so Good question though Hell try to sell it That he was as Lee Dort comes over it blocked the shot Its cheering out of bounds to the Tigers Kell again is just showing you their ability to balance the floor Score but again theyre Come on Give him an assist Ben Here we go Lets see what happens right there See he knew Dan Campbell was going to that spot Shooters never pass the ball Roxy Im sorry I have Ive Ive had too many Speaking from experience Yeah And and and and when I used to get a foul was called referee would say on the pass I said No hes never thrown it Its just that had to be on the shot Kais Kabliscus cheering Heres Kabliscus in the corner spots up couldnt get the three Justin Rosel the offensive glass Roslin attacks Has a shot blocked but a foul is called on Dewan Camp a long line of three men in their history of their program and hes hes fitting in cheering just very nicely Two shots for Justin Roslin cheering 77 who started his college career red shirted at Arizona State as a freshman Two years at Oregon State last year went to the NCA tournament with UC San Diego transferring to Pacific and the bloodlines run deep for Justin Roshlin His dad Charles played at UCLA in the mid to late 80s Yeah absolutely You know interesting now Rody Cals gone to a four guard lineup They put Chris Bell at four which really stretches their defense Dave Smart was talking about how this really bothers him have to play against the for shooter Here is Bell drives gathers and then from the awkward angle came up short Here comes Pacific back the other way He had a shot when he first caught it and I think was reluctant to let it go but he was open cheering Tigers are just one for their last 11 from the floor Now thats you can say theyre cold but I will tell you that Cals playing good defense Nice pass inside Isaac Jack trying to post move and Jack leveraging against Dort using the window Yeah I like that move You know get to the basket Hes got a high percentage for a reason but you got to get to the basket You know your teams not hitting shots so what are you going to do Get some foul fouls so you can draw and score in the paint He has eight of the Tigers 14 A perfect four for four from the floor Lee Dort down low Dort with the left hand Thats pretty But how good has he been and how effective has Lee Dort been Hes shooting again at a percentage Maybe not as good as Jack but he is shooting a one heck of a percent 69 and make it 70 now percent from the floor this year Thats incredible James Clayton Roslin on the baseline attacks and Justin Roslin with the throw down Yeah nobody at home Thats a baseline drive Cal had turned their back on the drive Didnt see it but that happened so quickly it was hard for Cal to adjust Heres Bell curling off the screen They double Lee Dorton deflected out Cal with six on the shot clock Well heres the drive Watch that quick baseline drive Everybody at home sticking to their man not reacting to the drive That was quick and that was authoritative Short clock here The Loft for Lee Dor off the inbound Short clock No problem Lee Dor on the alleyoop How that the jam cheering applause and the perfect feed John Camden B cheering That is an assist That was Now now we agree Ill agree with you on that one Big time assist So much for inside out defense That was Whoa that was tough cheering Five on the shot clock Isaac Jack in the lane cheering The kick Kais Kubliscus at the end of the shot clock hits a three for the Tigers Just made it That was late That was late Mark Madson saying Hey Im not sure if they got that one off Leading with the officials Theyre not going to challenge him Not on that Not with the lead Not with that one Too close Juan Campbell looking for a call on the pull up jumper on the rebound grabbed by Justin Rock Thought there was some contact Might have been the ball on the drive in the lane Ball stripped recovered by Jaden Clayton Kais Kabiscus Theres a kick and theyll put 20 up on the shot clock for the Tigers off the foot of John Cam How about the lob You know you got a short clock and you go over the top Thats a back cut Defense usually plays inside out Not on that play You got to play between your man and the ball Lee Dor said Okay youre not going to guard me Im going to drop it And theres another one Thats another one Three That That shot was good Mark Madson still bleeding his face The officials and a foul off the ball And its the first on John Camden Yeah Coach Matsons really uh animated on that sideline Hes not usually not that music uh aggressive Hes hes a competitor but hes really pretty much under control but hes really barking at the official for something Kabiscus and he traveled So you get the next call You keep keep that line of communication going You plant the seed Ro You plant the seed Pretty obvious call though Theyre doing a nice job I mean a really nice job on the guards for Pacific Theyre making it very difficult for them to see the floor Theyre taking away vision Cals defense really topnotch And Pacific has been efficient this year as a team shooting 48 Theyre one of the best defensive teams in the country And granted theyve played at a slower pace statistically so far but holding opponents to under 40 for the season and 65 points per game Their defense has been outstanding for Dave Smart Yep But theyre running into a little better team in in Cal now whos also playing some outstanding defense So you know you got to take your level up You said this is a good game for them Really important game but theyre getting challenged by Cal and Cals playing Day Ames had a good look and the rebound there is Kais Kiscus for Pacific Kabiscus played for Todd Golden in Florida won a national championship last year Elias Ralph cant get the roll And there is Jack underneath and a put back The strength of Isaac Jack for the bucket Well theyve had some success on second chance put backs Cals done a good job converging to the ball but then theyve left some offensive rebounds on the table and and Tigers have cleaned it up 11 offensive rebounds for UOP Yeah thats a big number Dort cross the key finds Dayday Ames and the rebound underneath There is Isaac Jack Thats seven rebounds now for Jack already Back door for Rashlin The reverse is clawed back to within six Well pretty move That was just nothing on the front side and on the back side Really nice finish for the Tigers 7 nothing run for Pacific Heres Day Ames and hes fouls He took a hard fall Its on Isaac Jack of the Tigers Couple of at Pavilion when we had 10000 plus for five spring years I mean what a homecourt advantage has been And he had the foresight the insight but then athletic director John Casser to put this building together And we had some memorable seasons and wins in this building But hes done so much else too down through the years to support Cal not just in basketball but academically business I mean the Hos family has been instrumental to the success of and affectionately around your program known as Jeans as a nickname given to Bob by Leon Good good call Rocks Good call And Bob would write me and still writes me today And he signs his emails Leon gave it to him and it stopped He said Hey theres jeans coach I said Its Bob Yeah jeans Bob said Forget it Id rather be jeans And and when you own Leviss you run Leviss Jeans is pretty good Day A and thats pretty good too Day Ames must have hurt us I mean hes just on fire Hes not slowing down He just Theres nothing about his game thats going backwards Every game hes stepping it up Have the Tigers made a charge Cals pushed it back to double figures here And Ames leads Cal with nine Heres Justin Roslin underneath and its well defended by John Camden Loose ball picked up by the Tigers Five to shoot Kais Kabliscus realizing that too late and a shot clock violation The third shot clock violation called against Pacific here in the first half Well how do you get three shot clock violations Good defense Thats how its done I mean Cal giving up no square inch on the floor making it so difficult to criteria for a playground foul So this is not a challenge This is an official initiated review for potential shot to the head Yeah Good piece of officiating you know for officials to do this and not wait for challenge They were there They were was right in front of the officials They saw the blood They saw the contact And again well just remind viewers its when the shot when the contact to the head takes place doesnt matter about intent They theyre theyre taught to call it I dont think this will get anything called Just me looking at that replay because it was a basketball play He was looking to go after the ball It wasnt a deliberate and it didnt appear to be intent from Justin Roshlin Thats why I dont think therell be anything handed out to going for that loose ball To your point he he swiped down and did hit the ball first Had he not hit the ball made a play in the ball Here we go AJ decide The previous play does not meet the criteria for a flagrant foul Shot clock violation Cow ball on the sideline And again I think it hit the ball first and it was a basketball play Yeah Yeah And and thats generally rule of thumb If you make a play on the ball youre okay Theres no play on the ball thats going to go against you Good to teach your players that too Always make a play on the ball Tough kid John Kemp Hes back in the game Hes Cut Man is has he healed him Hes good Go Barry Parsons Good job playing the role there of the fight doctor Freddie Pekco has absolutely did it for me for many years Not for Barry Bar Well for your players not for you Yeah not for me Well I was never in the training Justin Pimpin missing a three and the rebound grabbed by the Tigers Here comes Jaden Clayton for UOP Theyll really make this up on Pacific Theyre just getting further and further out on the floor Kais Kabliscus goes baseline high off the window with the spin for Kais Kabiscus Thats been the only way that the Civics been able to score pretty much at the rim is to use the backside reverse layups Theyre not getting anything on the front side Back door for Justin Pippen who drops it in Yeah how about the back door pass back door cut Great job against pressure Cals done a good job of that all year You dont fight pressure you back it Cal already with nine assists on 14 buckets Elias Ralph in the key Ball poked away by Milos Elich recovered by the Tigers Pacifics getting in the paint but theyre having difficulty going over the top of Elich goes to THE BACK AND A FOUL IS called and a reach in on Dayday Ames will put Elias Ralph at the line for UOP Yeah theres the backside drive and you can see theyre not getting anything on the front side Too many Cal defenders but great job And heres look at this back cut Head up Big guy does a great job Elish It just keeps his head up And thats picture book I mean guards dont do that as well as the Cal Some of Kells big guys They really have been taught well by the staff how to find guys back door Theyre big guys getting a lot of assists Two shots for Ralph His first point of the game comes 19 minutes 15 seconds into the game as Ralph the leading scorer for the Tigers averaging over 18 a game went for a careerhigh 31 in their win at Air Force on Wednesday Well hes got to step up and Im sure he will If youre Cal right now Roxy do you go for the the quick shot NBA two for one You know Id love to if I can if I get a good look Yeah Mark Madson plays it Theyre letting him come up Theyre going to go fast I think it looks like they will Pipen trying John Camden a launch and long on the three and the rebound weak side knocked out of bounds by the Tigers and it belongs to Cal over toward the corner I like that I not enough coaches probably do it I I dont know Uh I didnt do it a lot but I if I had a chance to do it over I would Dave Smart is challenging this and Pacific thinking it was last touch by Lee Dort and it should belong to the Tigers So this is a coachs challenge which is the new rule in college basketball this year And if he is successful then they will get another challenge You get one per game And you must have a timeout to be able to challenge a call Thats the biggest challenge You lose a timeout But here it is Theres the play I I dont know Thats not a lot of evidence against But now one thing is you saw Dort getting held A foul cannot be issued on a replay They cant change that No exactly You know my thinking on this just just thinking from a coaching standpoint you know you dont lose something too because you got your timeout out of it Youre talking to your team and unfortunately with this review it puts the officials in a bad spot because you clearly see a foul where Dort was hacked and grabbed yet that the challenge by Pacific on that a bounce call is successful They will retain a challenge and a timeout It will be Pacifics ball on the baseline 30 seconds on the shot clock Thats a winwin Rox They They get successful challenge for Dave Smart Pacific ball and a timeout And they get to keep the timeout Yeah And they get to use a challenge And they got to use a timeout They talk strategy on that play So this is really a big play Now Cal is going to try to put pressure on it Cal will get the ball back but theyre going to try to pressure here and see if they can put one more defensive stop But thats also where I think the rule is bad for the game in terms of the officials cannot go back and call a foul because the foul clearly happened yet that cant cheering be called on the play and an offensive foul Thats a clear push Jaden Clayton his second foul Yeah thats a good call by the official A lot of officials let that go before the half That was clearly an advantage disadvantaged play There it is You can see theres the play into the paint off hand Good job of selling it by Justin Pippen Go figure Hes seen that act before But thats a huge play You sell that And now Cal does get the last shot of the half Have a chance to push it back to double digits before halftime They got their best offensive lineup on the floor Pascal Pippen will milk the clock down and an offensive foul The push called on Pippen but Id like to see this one again and I think we will but here it is Yeah there it is Thats the push off I think he didnt anticipate his defender getting through the screen so easily but you know Justins got to use that screen Rox Hes got to come off closer He came off too too much space and and he usually doesnt do that Usually hes good Jaden Clayton drives Clayton in the lane Double clutches the tip and thatll take us to halftime 3627 Cal The Bears shoot 56 make five first half Get 13 13s a lot for a game but in a half theyll correct that if Mark Manson has anything to do with it Cal just three first half turnovers Day Ames leading Cal with nine points as the fall away jumper short from Kais Kabiscus and Cal with the rebound Isaac Jack 10 points for the Tigers to lead all scorers in the game Yeah really Pacific struggling to get that first shot look any kind of good looking first shot And Cals done a tremendous job defending Elias Ralph leading scorer for UOP on the year averaging over 18 a game Got two late free throws to end the half his only points Justin Pippen will get to the line Well thats what he does I mean hes so good at depth at absorbing contact He anticipates where the defense is going to be and he just gathers He draws the ball and gathers to go up in his active shooting Hes done that countless times this year Just a pro move veteran move First on Kais Kiscus Its Justin Pippen who is a 77 foul shooter And as a squad Cal 77 They have been an outstanding foul shooting team last year They made the most free throws per game in the ACC And theyre the top foul shooting team through the early stages of the season in the conference Well its one thing Cal went 22 of 24 from the line The win against Utah here on Tuesday Huge Its one thing to get to the line Its another make and convert your shots Cals done both But their best shooters are getting to the line Whether its Pippen whether its Ames whether its Bell and down on the ground is Elias Ralph And were going the other way it belongs to Cal Well thats important You know you mentioned something If your best shooters can get to the line thats an advantage I mean you you want the guys that are are sure from the line that uh will have the ball in their hands if they can knock down free throws that that screaming bodess well especially in late game situations Just a minute into the second half Here is Pippen curling off a screen Gets the fly by The drop off to Lee Dort on the weak side John Camden cleans it up Lee Dort getting attention Commanded two guys on him and Don Camman presence of mind to go to the backboard get an offensive rebound Big move Good start to the second half for California They balloon the lead to 13 Justin Roslin and hell head to the line as he was mugged underneath for Pacific Second on Dames Yeah there it is Look at this I mean little push off You know no harm no harm no foul only in front of the officials Its only a foul if it gets called Thats right Justin Roslin one for two at the line and two shots for Rashlin averaged seven points a game last year for UC San Diego where Eric Olens team was outstanding and they gave Michigan all the Wolverines could handle in that first round match up in the NCA tournament last year No they were good I had a chance to cover their team and this young man and I mean they beat Irvine at Irvine They had some big wins last year uh to go into that tournament Hes tough Ashlin hits both in the unorthodox matchup last year of Ani Ana Tate Jones who was just a nuisance for other teams to handle Here is Ames splitting the double team and Ames gets the roll Roxy I dont know how he makes something out of nothing I mean I didnt see any opening He somehow tucked his head got through two defenders cheering and then got it off off the glass with some English and spin Hes done that all year long Isaac Jack up and under And terrific footwork by Isaac Jack for the layin Yeah I like the young fella there He can put the ball up with either hand and hes so big and strong I mean its hard to guard him once he crosses over you Nice job Already a season high 12 for J cheering Started his college career at Buffalo couple of years at Dayton and now final year at Pacific as Cal and John Camden go back to work Well Camdens got a knack of going back door Anytime he feels pressure he goes back door and he relieves the pressure by attacking the basket and his teammates find him Even if Pacific their offense is picking up they need to get stops and thats the problem Cals executing and shooting 59 from the field Theyve been playing really good basketball for several games now Elias Ralph the turnaround and the offensive rebound There is Justin Rossland hustling into the key TJ Wayright three Yeah he can do that second chance opportunities again Yet another offensive rebound This has really been a you know the one area that Cal just really you know has to find a way to solve First points for Wayne Day Ames Justin Pippen moves in the long two And theres Pippen chasing DOWN HIS MISS BUMPED AND IT falls off Hell shoot two Yeah he just waited again Just the the the ability to draw a foul I mean but Justin Pivot doesnt waste any steps Hes really good He gets himself up in the air but theres Ames Just how does he get through guys I mean really good job by Day Just there he is Splits footwork and a finish Wow There there is theres Jack Just a clinic inside I mean the crossover the up and under never brings the ball down Why would you when youre that size You dont want to go from seven feet to six feet But Justin Pippen Roxy has done this for the Cal Bears Every time they get in trouble you you call it either Day Ames or Justin Pippen can create for their team First foul on Elias Ralph Its Justin Pippen now four for four from the line Starting back is combined for 23 The Golden Bears 46 So half their points cheering I like the Cal extending their defensive pressure and theyre not sitting on their lead Trying to turn the corner Jaden Clayton leans in and Lee Dort grabs the rebound and Cal pushing Pippet Dan Campbell and Dort on the weak side runs down the rebound John Camden corner three and Pippen trying to elevate but the rebound drive by TJ Wayne for the Tigers Elias Ralph cheering into the key Step back by Ralph and his first field goal of the game Now you can see why hes alone inside but he just hasnt been able to get off against the Calvary Theyve done a really good job defensively on him Justin Pippen Heres Dort down low Lee Dort using the left hand Missed everything And its Justin Roslin grabbing it for Pacific He had great position Just went over the top a little quickly Jaden Clayton Ralph in the corner and a good look and rattles out the rebound to Juan Campbell for Cal That was a set play to get him a look to help inside on the roll Just couldnt knock it down He struggles Justin Pippen into the key John Camden left open Not going to miss that very often and run down by Lee Dort Knocked out of bounds by the Tigers and its a Cal ball inside 15 minutes to go Golden Bears by 10 but Elias Ralph trying to get going Well he can do this Hes music able to get in the paint on you and hes able to get his own shot Hes tough He scored but Cal Bear is all over him tonight Cal up by 10 And theyre getting after the offensive glass Why are they having success Well Cal Cal not having success You know Cal does such a good job on the front end and what they do is they put they load up two or three guys to the ball whether its a drive or a post up On the dribble they dig down On the drive they converge So if you if you pull up on those plays or get a shot up theres really three or three two or three guys have advantages on the offensive glass music So its hard for the guards to crack down rotate down and cover the glass So uh you know its a good news bad news Good news that youre playing frontline defense Bad news you got to clean up the defensive glass Zone sometimes take care of that If you play a zone you keep your bigs in 10point lead for the Bears Lee Dort down low Five to shoot for Cal Here is John Camden from deep CAMDEN THREE YEAH you got to know your personnel I mean John Camden spotting up that hes not driving it He He shoots it from there and hes nothing but net Big Dallas matched their largest lead of the second half They led by as many as 14 in the first half and the six three for Cal in the game Deflected and stolen by Chris Bell applause Bell coming off the bench today for the first time And he steps through and has a shot blocked by Isaac Jack Back the other way Here come the Tigers TJ Wright three Nice find right now the recipient of a couple of passes on the spot up Good floor spacing by the Tigers He is a streaky shooter and hes cut the Cal lead to 10 Freshman TT Carr Carr for three And TT Carr with just his third main three of the season answers for the Golden Bears Yeah why not Hes feeling the Cal Bears have some shooters I mean theres very rare you going to see this team go cold Too many guys that can knock down threes And TT Carr spends a lot of time working on it Hes one of the first guys out on the floor We were here on Tuesday for the game against Utah and Utah got off the floor at about 1100 am and like 5 minutes later TT Carr was out there shooting jumpers Now to your point not only TT Carr but John Camden I asked John both these guys you know why do you spend so much time He said they just said Look I want to make sure were getting shots up And good shooters do that You know you dont think Steph Curry spends time getting shots up The great shooters are in the gym and they want to perfect their craft and they get shots up 10 on the shot clock for the Tigers Isaac Jack doubled steps through TJ Wayne Shot clock rolling down Offbalance floater using the window TJ Wayright Yeah hes shown you the ability to knock down the three but now you crowd him He goes by you and gets the shot up off the glass Great move by Wayne Eight for Wayne Wright all in the second half He is the second leading scorer for the Tigers and hes made the most threes for UOP as Chris Bell was looking for a call Yeah might have been a little contact on that play What do you say Play on Tigers can get it to single digits this trip cheering Justin Roslin down the lane Roslin then missed the shot at the rim Milos Elich outlets for Cal Chris Bell draws contact and will they say on the floor Well as you know coach Balbano Jim Balmano in my early career hes very helpful to me but uh just a fighter valiant effort in his fight against cancer Cal throwing it in out of bounds Then they have it go out of bounds and turn it over Milo Elich with the poor pass Cal up 11 but still going back the call before the timeout Look were operating under the older rules as TT Carr picks the pocket of Kais Kabiscus and TT Carr missed the layin Nolan Dorsy on the offensive glass John Camden way short of the three and Kubliscus has it poked away and secured by TJ Wayright for the Tigers But under the old rules that was the right call I dont believe the rule was officiated properly on Chris Bell right there who should have gotten two free throws Im not going to say it cuz I dont want to get a dead book Dave Libbyys not in the building Dont worry But youre right I I think that that interpretation is cheering now different Inside Isaac Jack Shot clock widening down Jack with a miss but gets the deflection Puts it back UP AND IN AND ISAAC JACK and one to the line Well you give him a second chance opportunity and theres and theres the second chance opportunities we just alluded to You know the shot goes up Cal doesnt secure it They dont grab it with two They tip it and the ball gets back in Jacks hands And when youre shooting almost 80 from the floor thats not the guy you want to get it back to in the position to score Good job by Jack Just kept keeps it alive Very emotional now And look what happens there They got a chance to cut this thing down further 53 for the line Rattles it in One off a careerh high for Jack He is 15 He had 16 points while playing as a freshman for Buffalo Thats a career best Yeah You just get the feeling if if Civic hit a few baskets Theyve missed they could be back in this game Cals been so good offensively Its been difficult for them to make their mark California by eight Milos Elix goes to work Flips it to Nolan Dorsy TT Carr short of the three And the rebound there is cheering Isaac Jack on the defensive glass Now hes got a double double 15 points 10 rebounds Well they can cut this thing further now Kais Kiscus up top Jaden Clayton three And here come the Tigers Timeout California And Pacific has cut it to five That great timeout by Mark Matson Hes not waiting for the next TV Timeout Big time basket by the Tigers They music pitch it outside Nothing but net The Tigers have closed this to big guns to bring them back out onto the floor That was a good timeout by Mark Madson Much needed Chris Bell GETS FREE THREE for Bell And how good has Cal been coming out of timeouts You see how important it is Thats a big basket by Cal to narrow this or to increase this lead That was getting to the danger point Eighth made three for Cal cheering Jaden Clayton finds TJ Wayne Wright spins out Was all the way down and popped out And here come the Golden Bears and Justin Pippen Juan Campbell down the lane Bumped Will get to the line But what a response coming out of the timeout by Mark Madson Yeah I think Mark Madson did a couple of things one he reminded his players about the offensive rebounding which Im sure he addressed at halftime but really more importantly lets get back to playing the way we play and moving the ball in transition defending getting a stop and pushing the ball Thats how they get numbers Thats how you get ahead of your man You get better position when youre pushing in transition Cals able to get to the free throw line And as you know they can knock down shots Theyve been very proficient from here Third on TJ Wayne Dwan Campbells first free throw attempts of the season Now keep in mind he didnt play in the first six games because of a groin injury Has now returned and played each of the last three Made his season debut in that big win over in San Francisco against UCLA And the Golden Bears still operating without Reedus Petritus missing his second consecutive Now thats a big loss We have not talked about that but he was maybe the MVP of that that UCLA game and he was outstanding in his last game as well So thats a big loss for the Bears TJ Wayne right left open three Well hes feeling it Hes letting the Cal student body behind us Let him know that hes in the house here and accountable Fivepoint California lead 9 minutes to play It was his largest 14 in the first half Wayight all 11 since halftime Day Ames Oh they missed Thor He had his hand inside Ames finds Chris Bell and hes tripped on his way down the lane And the foul is on Justin Rashlin his second Coach Martin wants a travel on Bell before that And they might add a point there But heres a Wayne Wright spot up in transition You cant lose him Hes been too good for the Tigers But Smart wanted to travel on that last play Didnt get it TJ Wayne making friends Oh not really What he said Chris Bell has a shot blocked Gets it back and forced a pass inside Stolen Jaden Clayton cheering Here is Wayne Right Hes had the hot hand for the Tigers in the second half cheering Clayton the pullup jumper and the rebound tipped out of bounds And last touch by Cal It belongs to the Tigers Ali Dors trying to get the bench to challenge it And Mark Manson has a big decision to make here They want they want to know if they can challenge it You got to react quickly Your people on the bench are obviously have to make a quick call Your video guys everybodys got to they got to be definitive You cant guess Mark Madson checked with his bench and its not getting challenged cheering as Wayne Wright gets it out near midcourt basket here will cut it to a onep possession game Huge possession cheering Jaden Clayton TJ Wayright had space on a step back Way right all the way around and out in the rebound Lee Dort He couldnt believe it Hes even laughing about it too He thought that was bottom Hit all parts of the rim and spun out I thought it went down under from here Jes the first to the bucket and the quick drive by Ames cheering Yeah Coach Smart cant believe that the Red Sea just parted down there that there was nobody between Day Ames and the rim I mean nobody 15 to shoot Sounds like the students dont appreciate TJ Wayne rightight I not sure I hear exactly what youre saying I have an idea though Oh I hear it Really cheering And Wayright crashes the key and will get to the line Well hell get hell get the last word Well head right to the line Ill explain to you what theyre saying during the timeout I guess not suitable for air Yeah Not on the air Ive heard that word around my house a few times I got kids 8 foul shooter The LA native will shoot two Hes got 11 since halftime And Wayne Wright who started his college career and played two years at Robert Morris last year averag 12 a game for Chris Aker at Long Beach State did a nice job And then transferred now to Pacific I like Cal Powell guys are freezing the shooter here Thats pretty good Thats good Thats good But obviously directed by the officials dont want to have wetness on the floor But student body here trying to get after Wayne if they can and keep him off that near 90 free throw percentage cheering 706 remaining and Wayright buries the first Nothing like a shooter when he shoots it whether its free throws or threes to hear that crowd get silent Thats thats a motivating cheering factor for a lot of shooters if you ask them And Wayne Wright nails both and has a look into the Cal Ste Well its just for the record just for the you know for the for the measure Like you know I hear you And now what he is Now sit down John Camden Yeah theres Ning Hes going to make something happen for the Bears Pull up jumper Aims off the mark and the rebound and its out of bounds and it belongs to Cal Last touch by Isaac Jack of the Tigers Yeah you know theres one thing I used to say When youre rebounding defensively you dont tip it with one You got to go with two Offensively you can tip it with one Thats okay Defensively never tip it Grab it Justin Pippen Shot clock for DJ Campbell Inside 10 Campbell turns the corner Campbell to the bucket and Campbell will get to the line Well hes strong and he knew he had a short block and thats been a good presence to take it in and draw the foul Youre not going to get a clean look from the perimeter So create and take it to the basket Veteran move Second on Elias Ralph Dwan Campbells 0 for two from the line Two points in the ball game making his first start of the season in place of Chris Bell And now Campbell is 0 for three from the line Well hes crushing in a low trajectory Ive seen DJ as you have Hes usually got more arch in the ball What happens when you havent played you know you got to get that that routine down you know just really not splitting the basket off right off left shouldnt be off not off right either Is it getting in your head after you miss a couple I think you think about a little bit cuz you havent been there in in a long time Practice a lot different than the game Here is Jaden Clayton down low to Isaac Jack whos leading Pacific in scoring double cheering Jack Hes trapped and a timeout with five on the shot clock as Jack had nowhere to go to avoid a 5sec on the country and so hes been able to do that and hes been able to put together a good squad Dominican Republic Lithuania Israel Canada all represented on this Pacific roster Five on the shot clock for the Tigers Here is Elias Ralph another Canadian a native of Alberta the runner by Ralph And that is a shot clock violation as the ball never hit the rim and was a late signal but the officials got it right as it was short from Ralph and its a shot clock violation Ralph did the right thing He attacked the basket but as Cals done most of this game they defended him well and they gave no look Theyre going to monitor and this is another initially initiated review by the officials Previous plays under review for timing So theyre checking the timing of that last sequence there when the shot clock expired Right now showing 603 to go and Cal with a fivepoint lead after the shot clock violation Now they got the shot off in time it appears Yeah they did So now but it didnt hit the rim it appears which means a shot clock violation Yeah its not the time Youre right Its And it should be maybe 605 or 04 They might put a second or two back on music definitely did not hit the rim and so maybe theyll put two seconds back on the clock and a cow ball Thats the fourth shot clock violation for Pacific today first half But the Golden Bears shot 56 from the floor Theyre only operating at 35 since halftime And now Cals got to put the ball in Pippens hands a little bit and Kanes hand Let them create Theyve been very good for their teams all year long And Dort fumbles it out of bounds They have a nice lead and that for Cal is a turnover Yeah And Dort just pounded Pip and just said Hey my bad Big time pass And it was only the sixth California giveaway of the game Now that was just Lee Dort taking his eyes off the prize He knew it Jaden Clayton on a step back left it short and the rebound tipped and Cal controls it Justin Pippen Cal dodged a bullet there They could have cut that to a one possession game Good defense Here is Bell on the drive Fall away from Chris Bell and a tough shot Yeah hes hit nothing but tough shots We call it a tough shot for him Hes made it look easy Big time finish big time release and much needed basket Fourth Golden Bear in double figures coming off the bench for the first time today Hes got 11 Jaden Clayton on the drive and a quick dart to the basket for Jaden Clayton Yeah nobody at home for Cal They got all the way to the rim Lee Dory sealed off Good recognition by Pacific to get to the basket Nice job Chris Bell shakes free Missed the three and the rebound Elias Ralph for the Tigers cheering Skip to Rashin and it falls off and missing the putback slam was Isaac Jack at the rim Well he had a chance to lay it off the glass or dunk it goes to dunk it Missed it Two point blank looks for Pacific Again Cal just dodged another one Those two baskets would have narrowed this game Almost even it up Day Ames Tough shot by AS and a good box out and ripped down by Isaac Jack for UOP cheering TJ Wayne rightight missed the three and the rebound John Camden for Cal cheering Hes trying to draw the foul Might have kicked out a little bit Referee said get up Lay on No ball inside Three and a half minutes to go Cal up five Justin Pippen and he thought he was fouled And it does finally get called It was late but the foul was called and Mark Matson frustrated The official right near the play didnt call it It was AJ Desai with the whistle on the baseline Bell in the paint When in doubt go to music Chris Bell He can get you too but if youre Clayton why not drive it Good things happen when you put your head down and attack Lean in to initiate the contact He really went straight up but the momentum uh was there where where the foul took place and there was contact on the leg to the body Pacific won the last meeting two years ago here between these two squads Cal leading the alltime series but that was UOPs first win over Cal since December of 1954 Yeah I remember the last 1954 game No I remember the last one And I certainly dont remember the first meeting I Roxy I might have been around but I dont remember those two Thank you very much But but I remember the last victory by Pacific in this building They shot it at a really high rate 13 for 26 from three in that game and thats what did it in You know Pacific not putting the marksmanship on the board this game Pippen two for three and the rebound Isaac Jack Cal by seven inside 320 Yeah still a lot of basketball to play here Justin Rashlin from deep And there is Lee Dor boxing out for Cal Really nice defensive positioning by Dor and the rebound No offensive rebound there Good job by Gordon Justin Pippen attacks and Pippen to the bucket And he can do that Thats a great job of meeting the pass taking it on the move and scoring it Big basket by Justin Pippen 16 for Pippen And Cal has pushed the lead to nine cheering applause Jaden Clayton finds Ralph in the corner Elias Ralph a three Well he can do that He just hasnt gotten it going this game but never too late Thats a big basket Now if youre Cal cheering you got to still stay maintain and try to get a good look 42 threepoint shooter Elias Ralph Here is John Camden 10 to shoot Ames fouled by Justin Roshlin his third And thats a one and one for California with the Golden Bears in the bonus Yeah you can see Pippen he catches it on the move Thats a great great example of what you do Catch it on the move and take it But theres the shooter and he hasnt had many looks but he knocked that one down obviously for Pacific here Elias Ralph they need him to score Hes been a big scoreer 31 in his last outing One and one for Day Ames 25 tying a season high in the win against Utah on Tuesday They missed the front end but the back tap by John Camden and applause Cal gets the ball right back Veteran move by Camden We talked about offensive rebounds You can go up with one hand He did and he tapped it out Thats thats textbook Shot clock at five Ames find shot Camden with space Rattles out Was all the way down and popped out That might have been the dagger as it is now Pacific with a chance 90 seconds Two possession game Jaden Clayton gets inside and Clayton fouled and one And the Tigers have a chance to cut it to three Yeah thats just what you dont need You dont want to give up a threepoint play a foul and a basket or a three But watch what Pacific does Look at the hesitation the crossover the spin and the really good job giving Justin Pippen a little taste of his home medicine Thats something Justin Pippen does so well But Clayton gets him up in the air waits draws contact finishes second on Justin Pippen Jaden Clayton is an 88 foul shooter The senior from Ontario rattles out and its John Kim The rebound for Cal Oh thats a big miss And a technical a double technicals been called cheering TJ Wayne of Cal or rather Pacific and Day Ames of Cal have been called for the double Ts for Jaw Fourth foul on Ames and its also the fourth on TJ Wayright The technical does count as a personal No free throws will be shot and its a cow ball Have coach SM just says Hey we dont need that now enough We we weve had that Its a no harm there because its a double but lets play And if youre Pacific you need to get a stop Your games on the line You need one stop no offensive rebound and no foul Here is Ames for Pippen Still 10 of the time John Cam had it stripped stolen by Jane Clayton Ahead for Justin Roslin and its KNOCKED AWAY BY PIPPEN OUT OF BOUNDS and a Pacific ball with 526 Huge play by Justin Pippen That looked like a sure two points His hustle there just to go for the ball and get it loose maybe are thinking about challenging I think it was pretty clear off Pippen But Roxy thats a great hustle play He also has been somebody thats been giving his team a lift Ball comes in to TJ Wayne guarded by Ames as both Ames and Wayne playing with four fouls Jaden Clayton penetrates Clayton and he lost it And thats a travel and Clayton claiming the ball was hit by a Cal Player A turnover on Pacific 38 12 to go And that was never touched by anybody else Now good call by the official Timeout Cal Well again Im a little bit surprising And I thought somehow maybe theyd get the ball to fly as Ralph but but theyve had success into the double bonus Thatll be an automatic two shots instead of the one and one I think you got about a seven or 8 second differential here of trying to get a steal but you dont you know you dont Theres a trap and Ames called for a travel and Cal gives it right back I thought he might have been out of bounds Yeah they nowhere to go down there Lets take a look at it Theres a wheel move and yeah his foot was on the line And the other thing Ames and Cal were lucky They could have called him for a hook right here which would have been his fifth foul Yeah they didnt need to dribble it They could have kept the ball alive They could have called a timeout if you get you get double team cheering Here is TJ Wayne right Jaden Clayton Fourpoint Cal lead Clayton down the lane Clayton scoops it up and in and its down to two Timeout Pacific DJ Mark Manson picked this play up from his conversation with Tosh Lup yesterday Listen this is good I mean this is good stuff I I like it because now you create space for yourself There will be somebody wide open on this play coming back to the ball and Chris Bell the inbounder can run or Justin Pippen There you go There you go Ames here is Dewan Campbell Bears get it across and Pacific needs a foul and they do The second on Isaac Jack and two free throws for John Camden 95 from the line Very surprised they didnt foul D They didnt foul Campbell Roxy the ball came in You you think you you know you might have talked about that Who you and and you know Coach Smarts talking to his guys say hey we got we should have fouled He I think it was directed to foul Campbell His guys didnt react Thats too bad That would have been the the right move Well and Camden misses You put the jinx on him I didnt have anything to do with this How did I put the jinx I was just You were just taking the fast Staying fast Well they you know right here you if youre Cal Roxy if you miss this shot you do not want to pick up an offensive over the back foul Cal is 9 for 18 from the line Yeah But now Cals got to make a decision here Theres the shot Its a threepoint game Yeah you you dont need to foul now If it gets under 10 you might think about fouling and not giving up a three cheering Heres Elias Ralph Well challenged by John Camden and its pulled down by Dewan Campbell and Pacific fouls with 88 That was terrific individual defense by John Camden Yeah he Elias felt he needed to make a play for his team but his teammates just you know given him a little encouragement saying Hey listen We didnt maybe need the three We could have driven it scored it got the two and fouled But lets look at it again I mean thats just really good job of Camden staying solid challenging up not making contact Nice job by John Candid Made up for the missed free throw there And he knew he couldnt give Ralph space but now you got Campbell back to line He struggled here 0 for four from the line for Dwan Campbell That one makes it a twopossession game Oh that was in between Yeah that was in between the rim not left not right and it had more arch Campbell to score I think I think uh his amnesia went away Keep in mind the Tigers No timeouts Rattles out and the rebound grabbed by the Tigers Here comes Jaden Clayton cheering Clayton drives Clayton hangs Hes pinned to the board by Lee Dor Ames is fouled with 910 of a second and hell shoot free throws and that will do it And Cal got a scare Pacific gave him all they could handle down the stretch of this game applause But the Golden Bears had enough to hold off the feisty Pacific Tigers and Cal now 910 of a second away for their fifth straight win Well Lee Dor was there at the rim He said Look youre not going to go over the top of me And blocked it But even if he commits the foul its a twoshot foul and not a three shot foul So either way but Gal had to work for this one Uh they earned it Roxy They didnt Nothing was given to them and they they did some awfully good things today But give Pacific credit They battled their butts off They came in here and they went down to the wire with Cal
