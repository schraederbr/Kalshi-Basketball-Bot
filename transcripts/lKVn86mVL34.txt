not having qud Del har is hes one of their keegs not just because of the point per game but I also think his leadership lets see how Boston College handles the loss of him not being in the lineup hey check out the starters for Boston College with Kelly in there hes going to run the point so it moves Jaden Zachary number three scorer for BC off ball to the two this one goes out of bounds off of Quinton post so a turnover to start on the first possession well you can see the strategy early on for Boston College they want to establish the point paint and for Central Connecticut when we spoke to coach Pat sers he said look we need to keep Boston College outside the paint there are the starters for Pat Sellers and heres their top scorer Alan Jean Rose goes to work and with the right hand he scores hes the Fairfield transfer at 15 a game thats a great start for Central Connecticut right there just the isolation play put him down low on the Block and he just elevated a that time over a lead B DC coming off the overtime loss here against NC State Saturday 8478 a game in which they did not shoot it well at the free throw line and uncharacteristically so Prince a league Bay on a follow away that doesnt go we get a foul away from the ball and goes against St mlon well there is Pat sellers who played at Central Connecticut was a captain hes also East Coast Conference defensive player of the year hes an assistant there and now in his third year back at his own yeah really just a a great human being played against his older brother as well to ro sellers uh when he was at Yukon and again just a great family and hes doing a great job early on with this Central Connecticut program hes got his team at three and four they started one and four but coming off backto back wins this is an offensive foul on Allen Jean rose drawn by Chaz Kelly yeah thats great team defense that time by Boston College Chaz Kelly again nice little back door cut but the helps side defense is there and thats something uh we saw them work on and shoot around this afternoon again he knew this Central Connecticut team wants to attack the paint uh Earl Grant and staff talked about the outside defense needs to be there thats a good sign early on for Boston College and we asked her Grant what do you want to see from Chaz Kelly he said take care of my ball and be sound defensively that was sound defense from Chaz Kelly right there the sophomore from Houston Zachary around the screen up to the wing for mton coming out maybe his best game of the season against NC State and theyre going to need that again Clinton post draws so much attention we talked about the numbers hes putting up Central Connecticuts going to double him try to make it difficult to get the ball in the paint Boston College is going to have to hit some perimeter jumpers at sell said make them be us outside the arc Zachary the swipe and Kelly couldnt save it in the quarter ER Grant of course in his third season talked to him about that game Saturday you were here for it he told us we lost but we felt like we did enough to win yeah it was a great game back and forth both teams really played at a high level uh offensively uh and defensively the issue in that game though for Boston College missed free throws they missed a lot of free throws in that game tough finish at The Rim by Jaden Brown the junior big from Applause Providence heres po just off the elbow set the screen for Kelly post gets so many shots from right there from three but Drew back iron that time and the rebound to J Rogers Rogers long two swirls out thats sers wants to play with some Tempo today offensively tells his team if its in Rhythm if its there for you go get it and transition post off the pick and a roll with Zachary textbook pick and roll that time Jaden Zachary to Quinton post and the help is not there for Central Connecticut I think thats the area Earl Grant again they want to attack uh the paint dont settle for jumpers against this Gam try to see if you can get paint touches first points for post Amos off Target run down by Kelly and the Eagles run a league Bay being hounded by Amos St BC you cant run it any better right here again little sidescreen action come off that time Jaden Zachary and then thats a beautiful finish by Quinton post post second in the ACC and scoring only behind Clemsons PJ Hall its off to a great start for an undefeated Tigers team Zachary moves it to a wide open alak Bay and a rebound pulled down by Rogers thats a great block out that time by Central Connecticut on Quinton post blocked by mton on jeene Music Applause Music Rose H looking for a dribble hand off with Kelly and and then nobody home as Elite base started to cut and its already a third Eagles turnover well this is great transition d right here by mton again breaking up would looked like it was going to be a deuce on the other end again Earl Grant talked about it taking care of the ball as you take a look jaaz Kelly coming out of the game and hes a talented offensive player the one thing from that point guard position he wants him to continue to grow with turnovers so he goes to the bench and Donald hand Junior comes in 13 in white along with Mason mson 45 for BC Jordan Jones on a step back spun out after he muscled with Zachary Jordan Jones talented player D2 transfer 23 in the grve for Central Connecticut oh look at the drop step from post simple basketball mik they didnt run offense there they just said look youre going to play man were going to isolate post that time on the Block and I think the key with that is they had excellent spacing well Central Connecticuts going to have to make a decision uh probably going to have to double up that time if youre going to go single coverage with Quinton post Brown banging with post it rolled off kept alive and tapped out of bounds by BC Quinton post has a couple of buckets this loud for the big fella sevenfooter from Amsterdam post and the Eagles up a bucket early Im so glad we did this Im so glad we did this Im so glad we did this life Is For Living lets partner for all of it Im so glad we did this Edward Jones The Magic

Boston College up by three on Central Connecticut with the Eagles looking to respond in nonconference play again without claudell Harris out with an ankle injury suffered Saturday against the Wolfpack Jones nearly lost the handle and now on the Baseline Rogers threw it down at the feet of Abdul Momo and a foul committed by him and Mike its huge for Boston College I called this game back and forth uh contest between NC State and Boston College and right here call it a lower leg injury and look hes their lead second leading score but I think the leadership and then his ability to knock down threes and beat you off the bounce huge in this one right here against a team like Central Connecticut that wants to keep you outside the paint Boston col is going to have to hit some jumpers yeah if we want to get super technical Earl Grant called it an EG but really its its a little above the ankle its not a high ankle so lets just go with lower leg how does that sound I I dont have a MD or any type of medical degree so I leave that to people that are a lot smarter than me so Ill just go with lower leg yep and a guy who could score now Madson gets some more run and he sticks a three and thats an encouraging sign for the senior guard Off the Bench and its a great out of bounds underneath that time a little screen to screener action great footwork coming off and when we spoke with Earl Grant he said look hes the guy they have to get going theyre going to need his perimeter shooting Central Connecticut has missed its last five shots until that tough one from Jordan Jones starting to come to life he had 18 in the win Saturday against Holy Cross I mean wow a degree of difficulty off the charts thats not bad defense by Boston College thats just a big time finish leag B wow look at those strides to the cup but he missed it and then Zachary picks it and we should have a reset to 30 I believe there but only reset the 20 on shot Cline and Coach Sellers and staff Rave about Joness tenacity right there thats an aggressive move again take the hit great body control I was on the rim the whole time and thats a tough finish over a sevenfooter from division 2 Coker in South Carolina and from Florence the same Hometown as his head Coach Pat sellers so Pat sellers called his best friend his old high school point guard Larry Johnson and said do you know this Jones kid and of course like any good friend Larry Johnson did I mean I love hearing stories like that a guy that starts off at the G2 level and you know just continues to grind it out and I always tell young players you never know who is watching you in the gym and there he is in attack mode again answering matsons bucket couple of quick Hoops for Jordan Jones at 8 and 1 half a Applause game Austin College is going to have to do a better job keeping Jones out of the paint mson hits another and how about the instant offense from Mason Matson Off the Bench without Harris and hes going to get open looks well theyre doubling Quinton post before he even has the ball so again somebody is going to have open Music looks Devon swatman a Boston native playing here in Chestnut Hill this is the jumper I mean you said it right away that was priority number one for Central Connecticut defensively limit posts and avoid those pink touches from BC offensively po can step out and he hits that as well a 43 for the Eagles and Central Connecticut needs a Applause timeout Mike that is what makes Quinton post a matchup nightmare a sevenfooter that can scream step out on the threepoint line right now though Music Applause

Bay and gets the roll chance in three for Allan Jean rose up to 18 and 10 Ive been impressed with his game hes in that athletic Wing hes got a quick a first step and thats a couple times now weve seen him get isolated up on the wing and make one quick move get to the rack and finish thats got to be pleasing for Coach sers again its been a tough afternoon tough night but this young man at the line has been impressive for Central Connecticut sers was familiar with Alan jeene Rose because they were together at Fairfield at the same time they saw Alan Jean rose on the last day of his recruiting period and they offered him when Alan Jean Rose did not have any offers for great opportunities at that time and now in year five playing collegiately developed into a very good player Pat sers was reminiscing with us he said Ellen genene Rose was a little puppy then tell him now hes probably only a couple of years younger than me and you know thats the beauty of coaching though these uh coaches put so much time and energy into these young men and for them to get a chance to see them kind of develop mature and then not only as uh players on the court but young men off the court as well too and really both these coaches talk about uh thats really the joy in coaching obviously yes you want them to develop as players and help you win games uh but its also off the court seeing these young men develop as well sers an assistant at Fairfield before getting the head job now in year three at his Alma moer now J Rose is calling for it against the walk on aaya this is Brody limr out of the corner Brody limr only played 22 minutes all year the sophomore from blenbury Connecticut thats excellent catch and shoot that time by em for a really good high school program in Connecticut as well too but certainly em tipped it out stays with BC more of a high guy myself crowd has been begging for a Baya to get a chance to shoot and the walkon checks out so you hear booze here at County forum come on give my guys some run the fans right here in the student section behind us want to see the guy get some run and certainly this is a great time though for him obviously does everything that the regular players do with the exception of getting an opportunity to play so anytime a chance his coaches can get them WalkOns in the game uh they like to reward them with some burn theyll be back I think we got two and a half to Applause go Music Jones with a great first half for the Blue Devils crosses up Kelly a foul that speech dont give up dont ever give up has created what were here today A Legacy that infects so many people battling cancer and thats what Jimmys done save Liv lives and theyll go on generation after generation thats a great legacy to have its vwe at ESPN when we partner

what it looks like finish out nonconference action and then right back to it after the new year with wake and then at Georgia attch hes already got a couple of good wins in a row Jones again after a couple of turnovers from the BC Applause bench Jackson swirls one out bench was ready to erupt would have been his first points in his Collegiate debut final half minute Freeland good from three and that should do it here at cotti Forum DC had a whale of a first half one of the best halves they played this season the offense was blowing and they get the job done in the end against Central Connecticut state well all around performance I think the threepoint shooting story in this game for Boston College uh really it was a phenomenal display by them I think the ball movement the balance on offense uh and then defensively they really made it difficult for Central Connecticut to get anything going on the offensive side Earl Grant and DC with an
