the Tigers on Saturday at Little John Clemson has lost five of their seven ACC games by a total of eight points PJ Hall who turned 22 today and Tara gari get us going and PJ Hall just went over and back and PJ knew it as soon as he did it he knew he was throwing the basketball into the back court and he can only smile about that one youre talking about a veteran but Im sure this is probably the first time PJs ever caught the tip and Clark saying what are you doing here big fella what the heck yeah Nate George the Freshman from Toronto and Dongo another rookie whos had a terrific first season for Damon statamire with gari Miles Kelly also on the floor in KY Reeves who takes the bounce pass here they crash the glass and shefflin the rebound and you can get used to saying that in shepher with the rebound he is a monster on the Glass Tiger lineup with Chase Hunter Jack Clark Ian sheelin PJ Hall and a young man that I think bam may know named Joseph Gerard III hes waiting in the corner Clark a three and one and dner the jackets WD was it the first time ever in pregame that a player came over and dapped up his former coach as an analyst on the sideline as we see Miles Kelly knocked down to three ball it it was we did set a precedent there this crew has done few things weve done that for sure knocked out of bounds itll stay with Clemson Ive had him for four years hes going to say hello now his mothers sitting right behind me and she said a l too three nothing jackets in front a look at Damon stms lineup sheflin for the three and good Ian sheflin whos from Grayson Georgia knocks down his 14th three of the year one of the most improved players in the league I think he just does a lot of everything and when he makes a three thats a bonus heres George offering up a three Nate George who hit big freeze to get it to overtime and to Win It Cory in the first meeting but thats the confidence you have when you know you had success against a team in a prior match up you have that confidence coming in to take that shot early Chase Hunter answers and were starting out with a lot of Threes here like these two teams are pretty good defensively and theyre just wide open threes but threes were the story of their first match up team made for Georgia Tech on the road while Clemson only went three of 21 in that game here is Kelly who had 36 and a loss at Louisville working on Hunter Reeves will drive leave it for indongo missed everything Gerard the rebound Tigers want to run hes PA from the logo wait a second now we know hes got it no question about it in every basket for the Clemson Tigers thus far has been a threepoint field goal so they made three and if they didnt make the three and 50 minutes in the last one Kelly from the other end of the logo he can really shoot it as well each schools got three threes Kellys got two of Techs Applause three shefflin on gari oh nice move back inside Ian sheelin with five and coach said hes one of the most improved players in the ACC in my opinion he is the most improved player in the ACC and I expect to see him win that award when the seasons over terrific year for the 68 junr step back three thats Miles Kelly airball it Chase Hunter will let it go out of bounds well PJ Hall and Ian sheflin their team lost that first meeting 9390 in double overtime but it wasnt for what they did Cory absolutely not a combined f 51 points in that game and 32 rebounds they were spectacular and 17 of those rebounds were offensive rebounds for those who got shefin foul line jumper knocks it down hes got seven here early his last two games he was just three of 11 from the floor averaging three and a half points and sheins been on the money here so far coach when youve got a guy that improves that much during the season do you start running things for him to try to get him looks you know they run things for every theyre pretty pretty well versed offense theyre not going to any one or two theyll go to Hall a little bit but theyll move the ball around theyll take the shot thats there Gerard wants in on the game and is officially now in the game 77th three of the year for the second best threepoint shooter in the ACC and Joseph Gerard the third Joe Gerard coming here was a smart move he found the right spot sometimes in the transfer portal you do tigers havent cooled yet RJ Godfrey coming to the table Gerard trying to keep the momentum going here for Clemson heres Hall again over and Dango rings the bell and Dango hasnt come out yet hes going to have to time out now ask for its a 10 nothing run Clemson has but one two Cory well it must be hot L for the time baby because they are on fire Miles Kelly getting the job done for Georgia Tech however he has not been the answer for the threes that have been flying from the Tigers to start this Music game shooting well I I would say this because Im here however Ive seening enough games where this has not happen so I cant take credit for it but the shooting has been phenomenal from both teams to start but you look back at the first match up between these two climpson three of 21 five of six already in 4 and 12 minutes played to start this game Georgia Tech got a great shooting night first time out off to a good start here but thats their only points is from ran AR I mean this is some shooting right here I mean that comson Ive watched them a lot over the years theyre not known to shoot it like this and Georgia Texas just got to play him they got to get up on letting him shoot Clemson allowed those 15 threes thats the most theyve allowed all year long by the way and remember damus admire told us earlier today weve got to make some threes against them I dont think he was expecting to see them come out and shoot it this way on his home court Tigers were nine of 24 on Saturday at home at Little John against NC State and theres Clark with a steal Sturman will give Chase and Clark will flush it home with the right hand that was so easy picking coach he was able to steal that with the wrong hand he didnt even have to have the right hand extended in the passing Lane that pretty much just threw that too Jack Clark and I think Jack Clark is starting to round into form hes missed a lot of time and he can be a key player for them boy Clarks missed a lot of the last two years yes hes season in Raleigh and certainly a nine 10 game stretch here for Brownell and Dongo off the offensive glass cant finish one thing for Georgia Tech they cant try to get it all back at once we know the threes have been going in but you cant try to make up for all of it on one possession DJ Hall will fall away on indongo thats eight for Hall hes gotten better every year than hes been in the league hes a prospect hes got a shot to play at the next level and this is also the healthiest season hes had during his tenure at Clemson hes battled a bunch of injuries over the four years and Coach Brownell said that hes been hurt the last two weeks that had not too many people knew about so hes healthy tigers have turned it up on the defensive end they just forced to turn over here and you see the Clark Ste it doesnt get any easier than that and Jack Clark as coach mentioned hes getting healthy so he turns it into the dunk with PJ Hall having himself an evening thus far knock down two threes and then goes to the fadeaway and he is one of the toughest covers in the league one of only two players nationally averaging over 19 points per game a block and a half an assist and a half and over a nine rebound Georgia Techs gotten into the bench Ibrahim oako a freshman from Guinea is onto the floor heres another bounce to Hall double team quickly there with gaspari and taon Claude now theyll skip it back to him heres Gerard from the left thats the first Miss of the tiger Knight but coach thats the one thing you cant have with a team thats going this well offensively you cant give him Second Chance opportunities no youre youre going to have trouble if you do Clemson turned away at the offensive end Tech is gone almost four minutes without a point meanwhile the Tigers have been on a burner George a launch spins off and Sako runs down the rebound Haan Claude who played well the other day has played 20 or more minutes in four of the last seven off stms bench and theres the jump shot and that is Tara gari from Willington new Zealand with his first basket of the game and a great decision by gapar getting into the painted area not shooting the three and thats the thing for Clemson are they going to fall in love with the threepointer right now Brad Brownell not necessarily happy about that last shot lead a dozen for brown Ls team Damon stms godson is the Georgia Tech guard Kyle Sturdivant and theres going to be a foul on Godfrey RJ Godfrey draws his first itll be the first of the ball game on the Tigers and thatll allow shefflin to return and we get to see Chanty Wiggins for the first time tonight for Clemson another Local Atlanta product from Grayson you know one thing about making the outside shots I used to like that when guys made threes to start the game because now they fall in love with it as you said Corin they dont get inside and Clemsons very good inside so they need to mix it back up a little bit start of it looking for Claude eight to shoot George kapari this is taon Claud he missed everything and itll be a push on Ibrahim aako sakos first first on Georgia Tech lets go back to our visit with Damon stmy earlier today when he said we got to weather the first 10 minutes or so of this ball game well its been a storm hes weathering a storm here Cory its an offensive storm its a little bit of a defensive Resurgence by the Tigers too the worst thing that happened for Damon stmy and his staff is the fact that Clemson lost at home last time out because now Brad Brown now has their attention that they have to pay attention to detail every possession matters especially coming on the road in an area where these team this team has beaten a number of good teams heres Wiggins they got blocked away and recovered gari hell try and beat Wiggins to the basket with a right hand and draw the foul Tara gari is a 69 sophomore who started his career at UMass and he is long coach look at the wingspan look at the block shot I mean thats not an average play kapari does a great job getting out contesting that shot and then has the ability to put it on the bounce and get to the free throw line on the other end of the floor coach theres a lot of NBA Scouts in the building today and Im sure they started writing down on their notepad on that play yeah hes uh athletic you know there was close to a Goen and they talked about it but they watched they they were kind of walked away from it it was close yeah I saw Bill cumington talking to you about that going back you know its funny how how much better your relationships have grown with these officials now that youre over with this side I love yeah thats exactly the word I was hoping you would use kapari hit both hes got four Off the Bench he had started the last three games coming into tonight make it four now with the nod fortoire and back to a 10point deficit well zone defense here to see how that works you shefin kick for Beetle Josh Beatles three spins out they crash the glass look at shefin could not beat George to the Applause recovery kapari Sako heres the rookie George whos I tell you what he is second in the league and assist as a freshman theres gapar a three out of the corner thats his 44th attempt of the Year from distance Hunter going to spot nope back rim miss one and done are the tigers here I think thats what five in a row misses they start with five out six I mean thats what happens George on the drive forced it up and it goes Cory the youngsters got a knack now he absolutely does had 20 points against Clemson in that overtime win on the road so he comes into this game and as a freshman point guard you know who you had success against you cant wait to see those teams the next time out and Wiggins turned it over thatll get us to a break tell you what Clemson ran off to an early Advantage RJ Godfrey and the Tigers felt good about it Damon STM hoping to hang on eightpoint game in Atlanta committee for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 17th through the 25th as a CC Unity week and both Georgia Tech and Clemson tonight demonstrating their commitment to seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences do not divide Us but make us stronger back with Cory Alexander coach Jim beheim West Durham eightpoint lead for Clemson the Tigers started seven for eight theyre two of their last eight five of six from three and missed their last five coach yeah you know that early shooting is sometimes its good and sometimes it leads you into Tak too many threes so theyve got to stabilize themselves The Zone hurt them a little bit but now theyve got Joe Gerard back in and they got their starters back in Miles Kelly is returned for Georgia Tech Sturman George Kelly Claude on the floor here along with Ibrahim asako and the Tigers have gone four minutes and theres a offensive foul and its going to be against taon claw so7 GR transfer from goldboro North Carolina Coach after you had the LW offensively right now are you looking to get the basketball inside the PJ Hall is that thats the route here 100 theyre going to try to get him the ball and we got another foul at this end and its on sheflin same deal first on Ian sheflin local product young man from Grayson who weve talked about in terms of his Improvement in ninth grade he was headed to football guys he was a quarterback back in the ninth grade tough guy I can see that yeah he lost 35 lbs along the way ahead of last year and tell you what hes turned into a really good basketball player he absolutely has and one of the things that hes an underrated scorer has the ability to shoot the three we saw him do that earlier in this game but his rebounding prowess is off the chart number one in the ACC in conference play an offensive rebounding theres stur ofan a little hesi in the lane and the bucket Cory first points for Kyle Sturman aing eight and a half and hes been a steadying force Off the Bench you know when you got a freshman starting its such a pleasure a luxury to have a backup that is a upper classman that can come in and show you the right way things are supposed to go especially when your godfather is the head coach sixpoint lead sheflin bangs home a three hes now got 10 here in the first half thats his eighth double figure game against the conference what a different player he is with that shot I mean it changes their whole offensive attack they needed a bucket and he makes a three that didnt happen last year yep lead back to nine now bounce pass Sako the catch Clark bothered it Hall with the recovery Clemson really still hadnt gone inside to drive the ball yet have they heres sheelin squaring up on Sako double team coming from George got some help heres Music Gerard nows a bounce pass for Music sheff up strong off the front rim Sako the rebound but that was what Brad Brown now wanted he wanted to see his team get the basketball inside to Ian shefin and sheelin has had success on the offensive end thats one of the reasons why they want to get the basketball in his hands you see him trying to post up hard but as PJ Hall has the block you give him that much space hes already shown he can knock it down only taking 13 threes coming into this in ACC play however its knocked down two already to start this game Dylan Hunters come on to the floor sophomore from here in Atlanta younger brother of Chase Clark at it bothered by George now heres an entry for Hall we have to be fearful of double teaming The Way Clemson shot it PJ left it short claw the Applause rebound lead is nine for the Tigers and Dango back for start of it heres inongo with seven to shoot he threw it away fifth turnover on Georgia Tech quick reminder to you next Wednesday night following Louisville and Duke at Cameron a special presentation the debut of Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited an extensive conversation for the first time since their careers started over 40 years ago its next Wednesday night 900 on acc Network streaming live on the ESPN you got something to do with that you involved in that I was uh humbled to be asked yes honored to be asked to be part of it had a great time with Coach Kay and Roy Gerard at the foul lines got five you know the ironic part of that whats that is that Duke is playing Louisville prior to that right which is coach Ks first ever final four Dallas where they lost to the Cardinals in the national championship game that was 86 correct yep reunion arena in Dallas never nervous never nervous purose one of the best freshman seasons of all time from Savannah Georgia actually maybe the second best freshman season of all time behind a guy that later play for Coach G kaasi Reeves his 44th triple of the year he did play for Coach K but he also played for Coach vay during that freshman year Im going Carmelo Anthony oh yeah MVP yeah heres Clark out front Godfrey a three nope RJ Godfrey is just two for six now from threepoint territory this year lead back to eight for Clemson George trying to beat Hunter on the drive oh what a tough shot I really like the young man from Toronto Cory absolutely and you can see that hes just going to get better and better of course when youre playing for an NBA Rookie of the Year head coach being a rookie at this level should be a little easier and its gotten easier for Nate George as The Seasons gone along Dylan Hunter left of the lane Hunter whos averaged two points in his last four on the board coach Dylan Hunter of course one of the five players on this Clemson roster from the Atlanta area do you see guys often times really trying to press a little more when theyre playing in front of their friends and family yeah I think that happens I think sometimes Pearl Washington was great he wanted to be in New York and he lit it up but some guys when they get home its a little tough Kelly missing the three Gerard off the reflection Clemson again looking to run spot up three at the front spins out he wanted that Applause one six minutes to go in this first half George is running the offense for stmy here and doing a terrific job clawed in traffic had it blocked theyll roll hit the in line and a foul has been called as we go to the timeout cson by eight in Atlanta Clemson with an eightpoint lead we welcome you back to Atlanta tonight here at Mish Pavilion great to be with Cory Alexander and of course coach beam were tucked right here by the Clemson more on that later all right lets go to the projections well its time Joe lonardi has four ACC teams in his field today however who Jimmy bracket thats what we talking about baby lets talk some Jimmy bracket time of all were up from three to four which is a good sign and I mean those four teams I mean are rock solid and I think wake is really rock solid and Pittsburgh when you look at Pittsburgh six Road wins including Duke and Virginia so I dont really think theres going to be a problem with the ACC I know theres disrespect in Im not worried about and Im going by what I see forget the net forget these other things that are out there the net we know can be gained you can game it not just by margin of Victory but beating somebody badly and getting efficiencies but when you look at these six teams they look like NCAA teams and I think the ACC can get somebody else in the mix as well by the way the foul on clawed as we went to break his second so he has come off the floor Sako back out there with George Kelly Reeves and of course indongo and heres Gerard into traffic bounces back for Hunter with eight to shoot sheflin another three from the front sure you beta Ian sheins got 13 of Clemsons 33 in the first half Cory he is a confident young man right now we talked about guys who are playing back at home had opportunity to meet his father in the restroom lets not talk about that however talk to to why bring it up Tim shein earlier today and he is excited about this clemon team and he agrees with Jimmy brackets that this is the NCAA tournament team George on the drive rebounds Sako Hall nope shuffling clears it away that kid does everything for his team he really improved Wiggins johy picks up on the dribble now to his former high school teammate at Grayson entry pass nicely done for Godfrey working around in Dongo and it rolled off the front rim for RJ Godfrey and then George attack l it over the in line stays with the Tigers in sheflin having himself an evening thus far in front of friends and family stepping up knocking down another three ball and then you know just a low point to the crowd let everyone know hey Im here for all of Music this tigers by 11 heres Hunter wrap around from Godfrey shef with the right hand nope bounces Music away just ahead of four to go in this first half you see Georgia Tech almost three minutes without a point Reeves a shot fake just above the foul line grazed by Gerard on the Fly by itll be the first on Joseph fourth on the Tigers couple of free throws coming from Mon and Georges kaasi Reeves geia Tech is a team by the way shooting almost 71 conference play Joe flew by him but Im not sure he hit him it looked like he did but Im not sure he really did its right here in front of us but Im not going to start you dont have you dont have to fight for calls for Joe anymore no no no Im not dont forget Sunday a womens basketball triple header for you on acc Network how about Boston College hosting Notre Dame at noon and then to blackburg Courtney banghard VIs its the hokes and Corys cousin Kenny Brooks presented by food line thats at 2 and then at 530 well finish up with Duke hosting NC State all Sunday on acc Network and college game Day visiting blackburg this Sunday to be able to cover that North Carolina at Virginia Tech game but I like the way you introduced Kenny Corys cousin Kenny Brooks I I like that Im going to start calling him that here is Hunter stepping in and the jump shot good for Chase Hunter thats five for Hunter and its an 11point lead again for the Tigers yeah Joe jard they stayed right with him and never moved to come to CH sign thats what a guy like Joe Gerard does for your Shooters and Dango against hunter or against uh Wiggins and hell draw the foul on cha Wiggins second on Wiggins thats five on Clemson well get free throws for the Freshman Bay and Dongo when we continue Abdul Jabar but that is great history from Jack Clark to be able to tell us about his grandfather but you can see the pride that he has you know still being able to have a chance to talk about that and I saw Lou Al Cinder play in high school thats how old I am oh wow power Memorial right did you sure you didnt recruit him did you close close though right close close no coach coach coach was coach was watching then he was you werent even in high school yet I was yeah I was in college were you yeah played in The Holiday Festival L played in there an off day yeah and he was pretty impressive yeah you think pretty impressive by the way we were talking about this today heres indongo at the line how difficult is the ACC all freshman team vote going to be Cory Alexander I think thats the toughest one because you think about there are two great candidates on Georg abely we mentioned you know Nate George is is second in the league in assist behind Reese beakman right but look at Marcus Burton look at Jared McCain theyre theyre Bob Carrington Caron there a lot of perimeter players in the league there are eight guys that I think could be all first team rookie team how about Jack Clark tossing in another three I think I think he can be a big difference maker for them down the stretch as you said he hasnt played much in two years he starts to get his rhythm these last four games hes going to really help this team where his health has meant the world to Brad Brownell in terms of the way hes been able to play the last half dozen ball games on the floor to start heres a bounce pass to indongo good match up here with Hall skip for Reeves and a three and sheflin the rebound is shefin going to have a double double in the first half I got to look what what is his rebound number uh not as many as you think okay hes only hes only got three rebounds now so and thats the part that youre used to seeing him already have close to 10 in the first half PJ out front Yep theyre back go their back thats 11 for Hall thats 13 for shefflin its 24 of Clemsons 41 look Georgia Tech hasnt scored in the last 5 minutes of this game allowing Clemson to build their biggest lead thus far after they made it a 23 15 game offensive foul on indongo here and this is a when he sweeps the arm here he picks up his first fourth on George attack Dak Clark trying to get the basketball inside however when youre playing off him has the ability to knock down the three ball and PJ Hall coach you mentioned hes an NBA player this young man not not only can score on the post but hes got range as well hes really improved really improved his offensive game look at the threepoint number nine of 17 for the Tigers here in the first half back door cut Hunter the shot fake fallway got blocked Gerard long with the three he doesnt miss the opening its very often stur feels like a big 90 seconds here cor for the home team coach being that were right here beside the Clemson bench that Brad Brownell give you permission to yell at Joe Gerard when he came off the floor anything only if he gets beat bad defensively okay three ball bounds away off the hand of gari so with about 70 seconds to go in this first half tigers have played awfully well in building what is a 15point lead that got blocked by Kelly on the jump shot by Hunter WD how about Brad Brownell coming in the shoot around today and looking at me and you like forget you guys wheres Coach B I want to talk to the I want to talk to coach I want to talk to the Hall of Famer shuffling kept that alive Cory for Hunter coaches do stick together you know come on no question about that its like referees they stick together but they have to cuz nobody else likes them heres Hunter on the drive and were going to get a foul I believe before the block is what Jamie lucky is saying and the foul is on gari it will be his first thats five on Georgia Tech well see if they free throws here for Chase Hunter hard decision by Hunter to attack the paint though get downhill theyve shot a lot of Threes in this first half getting to the free throw line can get them back to El sixth best free throw shooter in the ACC is Chase Music Hunter and the first of the two is good dont forget weve got ACC Jim gymnastics for you right here on acc Network in the ESPN app Sunday afternoon and old Fitzgerald Fieldhouse coach gymnastics I had a few bad nights in there well number 24 NC State visits pit gymnastics its on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app WD I did tell you earlier who used to be a gymnast in his younger year PJ Hall that would be first team all ACC candidate EJ Hall the hall americ the All American can kick his foot way above his head its a unbelievable sight for a god 69 yep heres indongo with shefflin defending sails one for Sturman with eight to shoot hell launch and hit Kyle sturt 29th three of the Year gives him five in the first half Clemson will call the US it to lose it timeout with 125 to go Brad Brownell draws something up for the last possession of the half when we continue from Atlanta Music when you have a history of greatness the real challenge situation they going to the locker room you just you try to get a stop here is you know theyre very fortunate to hit that three down here right you get down 16 it doesnt youre youre in trouble Clemsons a really good defensive team they dont give away big leads very easily so they theyre just trying to get a stop here and go in 14 down and if youre Brad Brownell you want another three on the Fire you just want you want a good shot you want a good shot right here hell probably go inside I think but hutter wrapped it around theres Hall The Catch and blocked indongo wow what a Play What a play by indongo and here goes gari at the horn he still lost the game so Georgia Tech who had five in a row to end the half cut it down to a 12point lead has the ball to start the second half and nobody on the floor with more than one foul for Damon stmy and no one over here can see anything because Brad Brownell is in our way and again of course he has the right to be there sure but a difficult view from our angle here is Nathan George driving shefflin with three dumps it downstairs gari threw it away and heres Gerard off the turnover bounce pass tough pass nice catch Jack Clark and he lost it couldnt hang on to it really tough pass he got it to him though and he had a chance to get it Brad Brownell thought Georgia Tech touched it last Jamie lucky said no sir it belongs to the team in white four turnover on Clemson JY lucky has been reing for 50 years hes not looking at Brad you would know cuz you coached for 47 of right there with I was right there with him we have a foul thank goodness called on PJ Hall off the ball and itll be his first its the first on Clemson in the second half one of the great things about being positioned right here is we actually get to talk to Brad Brownell during the game when he turns around whether hes happy or sure displeased about really cares what we think but youre kind no no no no not that he cares what we think we just get a chance to talk to him well when when his teams making threes hes talkative they miss that happens hes not talking heres indongo fall away and Hall nope saved in the corner gari from Miles Kelly whos stuck with it and Miles Kellys been quiet Brad Brownell trying to get his team organized defensively heres a three ball from gari long rebound handled by Hunter I believe Clemson is going to allow gari to be the guy if if theyre going to get beat by threes they dont want it to be Miles Kelly or Nathan George they want it to be gari shooting that fafar 8 of 43 from behind the line coming in Chase Hunter on a bounce to sheff thats too thats too and missed the layup Georgia Tech fortunate to dodge that bullet you cant allow Ian St to have post position that close to the basket heres indongo in a mismatch against Chase Hunter takes him Baseline missed the layup Hall the rebound heres hunter in the air fed shefin 15 now for Ian sheflin the coach thats another one of those plays Jo that because he ran to the corner you got to think about where the threepoint shooter is and made it an easy drop off for Chase Hunter inside goes Kelly he couldnt finish gari has it right back for indongo and Hunter blocked that 10 to shoot for Georgia attch this is kaasi Reeves and a long three is short two easy opportunities for and Dongo under the basket thats what Damon star talked to us about the inconsistencies of these young players got to recog you got to go stronger than that otherwise point guards in the ACC block your shot heres Gerard all the way around with the little scoop seven for Joseph on his third field goal next year Dango will finish those plays hes just youre going against veterans and hes just not quite ready but hell finish those plays next year tigers have run four in a row on the board here to go up 16 Cory as we go to the break here turning defense into offense Chase Hunter coming up with the block from behind and Dango and on the other end of the floor Joe Gerard coming up with the easy bucket bimps which turns into a bucket on the other end as mom Brandy Lewis is taking it in and enjoying watching not just her son Chase but also Dylan Hunter yeah both her boys performing for the Clemson Tigers and West heres the question shes a Georgia girl yes she is who does she hate worse Clemson or Georgia Tech why are you doing this its got to be Georgia Tech at this point with two sons playing for Clemson shes not hating Clemson tell you that indongo working inside and scores tough shot by IND dangos first field goal of the Night by the way but coach when when youre one of the dogs in Georgia you hate Clemson I know I know it had to be tough for Randy to send both of her boys to play basketball at Clemson but once theyre there theyre thats her school now till they leave heres Gerard Tigers lead by 14 Joe tough shot hell draw the foul on Nathan George Joes gotten a little better at getting he hasnt done a lot this year but he can get there and draw the foul and thats when he becomes really dangerous offensively when he can get to the foul line and he created the contact on that one thats what Nathan George is and theyre asking Damon star and his staff out asking Bill cumington to review that because Joe Gerard who created this contact you see he jumps into George but thats legal however when you see the elbow connect with the face thats why damire and this crowd want that to be reviewed thats close so the foul on George and then going straight up was it looks to me like hes going straight up and theres a little minimal well step aside in Atlanta its a 14point game under review hey all right so Jamie lucky is going to go to the table here and now come over and Applause give everything is going to stand it sounds like so Gerard will be at the line to shoot two free throws here Cory that is perfect Im glad that was this was called The Way It Was Jamie lucky talked about it you first off you see the hand in the back but he starts in the cylinder and as Joe Gerard goes up you see George enter into his cylinder although Gerard is making a basketball play so I love this call by the officials and Coach Ill be honest I thought they were going to come back and call this a flagrant one Im glad that they did not I think they got it right I hate to say that but I think they got 100 right took him a little while to do it but I think its the right call I I agree Harley that is the right call because thats a basketball play and thats thats the conversation we had with Brad Brownell of course were in close proximity and he says but its a basketball play and we said yes it is a basketball play but often times we see basketball plays still call as flavr one fouls first one by Gerard is good Damon STM well what Damon doesnt like is the fact that there was contact from Gerards elbow to Georges face and so by the letter of the law normally that is called a flager one foul which is why I thought they were going to call it and as a coach you just get mad and madder when the guy makes the two free throws too it just makes you mad yeah but that guys 90 plus he isnt missing thats automatic hes not missing and Dongo now against Jack Clark Clemsons push the lead to 16 and and Dongo goes to the deck shefin is going to be called for the foul Ian shefflin rolled over the top of Bayon Dongo itll be his second and number two of the half on the tig Clemson plays here tonight at 178 7 seven in the ACC they are eighth right now but they have a net of 28 the nonconference was very good to the Clemson TIG most importantly they beat good teams and on the road are neutral sights and thats always going to be big and Dongo forces up too strong recovered inside Claude and George would tend to shoot because the ball didnt hit the rim on the indongo offer working on Gerard Fall Away George is short Clark the Applause rebound heres Clark back for Hall see the difference as to how The Bigs for Georgia Tech are up now sheflin and the double team Cory scores but you see how theyre guarding PJ Hall at the threepoint line now in shefin theyre not getting those easy looks like they got before but that opens up things on the interior for Clemson now the chef is three three off his career high of 20 hes got 17 Tigers whove got their largest lead of the night sturdivan and it will bounce in over Hall Kyle Stans got Applause seven the thing thats dangerous was Clemson when they make threes and now they can get inside theyre a difficult team to beat here is shefflin Jim the talk of the the early season was how good they were defensively and how good they were shooting it Hall was trying to get a timeout called did he get it called he did as he rolled over to his stomach to collect the pass well finish that thought in a moment we step aside in Atlanta Clemson by Music 16 here at Papa John we know our Stu for heres where they are defensively 337 and D1 out of 351 and just kind of where they are steals per game they dont strike you as lock down now they held teams down early in the year that number gave way in conference play where they come in today their ninth in field goal defense 12th and threepoint field goal defense so how have they been M able to maintain the season with the backup a little bit on that end well lets start with the fact that Brad Brownell is a defense first coach however this this addition of the Clemson Tigers are very good offensively their defensive person is not the same as what hes had in the past but they get it done on the offensive end of the floor and often times when youre that good offensively you lapse a little bit on the defensive in Hunter spins in the lane its too strong stur at the rebound RJ Godfrey by the way checked in for shefin during the timeout Clemsons much better offensively right now defensively they have some issues theyre not as good as some Clemson teams George kicks it away for stur its three and Clarks going to run that down and off a deflection of Claude saved it to Hall heres Gerard little spot up to missed Applause Music everything stur it the other way and thats too strong Godfrey the rebound but thats an area where Clemson is really good defensive rebounding yeah when they do get stops they normally take advantage of them by not giving back those Second Chance opportunities RJ Godfrey on the floor now with Clark Hall Gerard and theres a three ball from Clark that bounds away its going to get him an exit I think I dont think coach Brunell like that three Jack Clark 3 yeah maybe not what he was looking for Wiggins up off the bench along with Dylan Hunter but one of the things when we talked about cls defense Jack Clark is in the starting lineup now because hes a better defenser a defensive player when you consider the fact that they started the majority of the Seasons with Wiggins at the small forward position and youre talking about a 610 guy its difficult for a 61 three man UNL not named Carmelo Anthony to be able to defend at this level by the way RJ Godfrey whose dad was an alltime great football player Georgia Cowboys he also did play in Dallas I dont know how a guy from Washington can be for Dallas anyway Im from Virginia Im not from washhington 10g 10 miles from the stadium 10 miles from the stadium dang third foul on Clemson free throw by Miles Kelly good hes 72 on the year has seven tonight and Clark and Chase Hunter will leave as Dylan Hunter and Chanty Wiggins come in and here is Miles Kelly if he knocks this down hell be at a thousand in his career 66 Jr from Stone Mountain whos 16th best scorer in conference play and thatll do it 1000 points for Miles Kelly and WD he started off the game like he was going to have a th000 points and before the media timeout he knocked down two threes early but Clemson done a great job with Miles Kelly as of late keeping him quiet here on his own floor 48 player in the 109e history of Georgia Tech to score a th000 points as Miles Kelly coach trivia question for you yes do you know who was a basketball coach here at Georgia Tech back in the 19 11 12 season I was around them but I wasnt that old yet come on please G whiz WD you want to tell him John Heisman John Heisman I knew it was a trick question how big is that har a takea Away by Godfrey the lead 16 again for Georgia Tech Gerard against Sturman kick out for Hall reentry on the bounce for Godfrey up strong and fouled by Sako ibrahimo second and the second on Georgia Applause Tech so thatll send RJ Godfrey to the line from Swani Georgia his dad Randall by the way 11 years in the NFL out of Georgia at linebacker terrific player in the early 90s especially with the Cowboys first of two is good dont forget next Wednesday night following Duke and Louisville Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited debuts on acc Network one hour visit with two of college basketballs alltime great coaches that that was an hour visit was back to the hour and 28 down to an hour thats more time than they spent together in the previous 36 years oh I mean Im sure its going to be enlightening so they didnt invite me either no no next time well include you no thats no no no dont lets leave them out coach me and you well go hang out well have a talk uh yeah I Ill just ask a couple questions cuz you can cover an hour and a half just telling stories on your own you dont need anybody there to moderate that Godfrey missed the second chance at the second free throw by the way so the lead is 17 tell you what weve acquired some beheim stories in our little Journeys around the ACC this year some some that the coach told us and some that others have told us well you guys are boring I have to talk a lot just to keep it going keep the activity up stur of at three and shefflin had it and a foul to be called Bill Covington gets Ian shefflin for his third itll be the fourth on the Tigers we take a break in Music Atlanta so how was your day Liz Cory were here with one of the great luminaries in all of college basketball as you know yeah well last night we had a dinner at a restaurant here in Atlanta we in a previous experience at the same restaurant coach beheim was I mean how do you how do you say this the guy thought you were Bernie Sanders Bernie beheim in 2024 I am wi it first of all you dont even know how to tell the story Im sitting there with my son and a couple other people and this guy comes over says hey great great year where youre doing an unbelievable job and Im kind of feeling good right you know hes you know I dont think we were that good either but anyway then he goes well good luck Bernie walks away and my son still laughs about it that was like 10 it was eight years ago or something and of course buddy told the story to to Joe Gerard right who had to make sure he let us know that story earlier today but I I can tell you right now Bernie beheim and 2024 I am with it you get my vote I think Im a lot better looking by the way to to the point Joe Gerard says so I heard you went to the restaurant where coach was thought to be Bernie Sanders yes thats exactly where we went amazing three ball stur of it shot clock winding down and knocked away Hunter on a heck of a play Chase Hunter and now the feed back gaps dunk is blocked and a foul is called Tim clockery gets PJ hall for his second but look at the Clemson defending the rim first off the play by Chase Hunter was flat out amazing what would have been a easy put back Chase Hunter coming out of nowhere and then look at what happens after you see once again another rejection at The Rim by PJ Hall Im not sure how PJ Hall got the foul on that play gari will have a couple of free throws here I think early nine points I think Georgia Tech had n three threes in the first two minutes theyve scored 27 points since then so Clemson defense has really picked it up jackets are two of 15 from the floor here in the second half Cory coach just mentioned the defense from Clemson has been much better rad Brown now making adjustments at halftime tightening things up but also when you look at the Personnel for Clemson getting Jack Clark into that starting lineup I think has been a huge bonus for us WD I asked you earlier this is game five in a row that he started yep but when you think about what he does for them on the defense I think thats all the help that they needed Hunter slashes for Wiggins heres Hall out front its long it hit the top of the glass its still alive Wiggins the rebound Clemson with a new 20 chony will roll into the lane and Score first baset of the night for the sophomore from Grayson and I think Wiggins was really good early in the year and he struggled a little bit his games falling off a little bit Yeah average just 28 in his last five after only hitting a third of his shots from the floor in those five games but coach how much of that is due to the familiarity of the league once you start playing ACC games that becomes a part of it a little bit a little bit but he was really pretty good early he had some big games and Reeves is fouled and I think Wiggins will be ticketed with his third that is six now on Clemson in this half cls got six George tech only two Coach Brown all hes great hes all coaches dont stop fouling but but I love the fact that he ran down to the bench and told the team entire team stop fouling as if any of those guys were in the game and did that you youve done that in the past 100 re free throw good hes now got six in the game dont forget tomorrow night 1000 Eastern following a double header of the womens game well bring you nothing but net Kelsey Riggs with Hall of Famer Muffet McGraw Ivory l Kelly gramlick will be there Chronicle of the night preview the weekend ahead right here on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app both free throws for Reeves hes got seven in the ball game now and four of four at the Applause Music Applause line Murphy you see on the floor wearing number four is an air force transfer theres a three Godfrey had a crack at it Claude touched it last it will stay with the Tigers Georgia Tech now in the two3 zone but one of the things we know and Coach beheim can definitely attest to that you have to understand where youre block out and where your rebounding assignments are going to be when youre playing in that zone everyone has to find someone especially with as good as Clemson is on the offensive glass yeah and sometimes you can block out you just got to go try to get it Hunter a standing three got it Chase Hunter second three of the night hes in double figures now with 10 theyre a hard team to play zone you got four or five guys that can shoot threes Joe Gerard isnt even in the game but I think D coach St just trying to get calm down a little bit theyre gapar theyre wearing down yeah no Applause question WD how about Damon STM walking over in the first thing he had to say was he was so happy to see coach ban yeah and then of course he brought up what he said may have been his best pass ever and hes had a lot of great ones but he may be his best pass ever at Syracuse yeah against the orange what it surprised me I know he didnt pass that much and I know you never passed so for him to mention a pass was shocking to me I mean he was a great scorer great great scorer tell you what he played on some terrific Arizona teams he was part of the reason why they were so terrific y inside heres Hall T to shoot double team help Murphy and indongo on PJ Hall see if Reeves commits to it heres Hall inside how about the little soft fallway thats short theyll crash the glass it got deflected around gari the rebound off the deflection and a reach will be called on Godfrey long before the Shot Two Shots no its on two its on Dylan Hunter beg your pardon his first that is seven on Clemson so its 1 and one with 915 to play and the jackets will go to the free throw line where in League Play they are 11 709 on the year taar has got eight he had 10 and nine rebounds on Saturday against Syracuse he was that one rebound away from them having three guys with a double double is that correct yeah and and the point I guess getting to here is Damon Soder knows hes got a young team JY so incremental steps at times are just as valuable as the bigger steps in your in his building I think oh yeah I mean hes working toward the future hes trying to develop his system his culture and that hes got too many young players to be consistent and Im surprised that they could beat Duke in North Carolina look at this slip pass Hall Godfrey went up strong lost at one to shoot thatll be a shot clock violation on the Tigers I thought the most interesting thing that Damon stmy talked about which was a lot of very interesting things throughout this this morning we talked to him he said this first year for him he wants to study the opposing coaches he wants to understand the systems that they run their nuances their characteristics he feels like that will make him a better coach in year two and moving into the future and of course Damon had tremendous success at Pacific and now trying to bring that success to the ACC you see the Georgia Tech field goal droughts almost 7 minutes and whoa thatll end Applause there gapar fortunate not to get a technical foul on that one however he had a little extra Hang Time on the rim but we talk about Georgia teexs L but this lead has maintained really 16 points Clemson really hasnt been able to extend that lead anymore they havent been able to score much themselves their defens has kind of helped them in you know kept it in there here goes Chase Hunter kicks for Wiggins four to shoot Hunter standing three got it six in the half 13 in the ball game for Chase Hunter Chase Hunter had opportunity to line the seams up on this one coach yeah Chase Hunters coming home and hes having a nice game and that you like to see that when they do come home hes a really good solid player and hes playing well at Music home Sonic Blockbuster for you and Mr OBrien on uh on Saturday at 4 at jpj huh yeah Virginia off of a struggle on Monday dropping to 11 and5 so if theyre going to make up any ground theyre going to have to do it on a home floor where North Carolina has not won in 10 Seasons you go back so Armando Bott never won in his home State against the University of Virginia wow theyre a different team at home they just absolutely say that about a lot of schools this year cant you coach yes you can but then you can also talk about the teams that are different on the road like the pit Panthers how I mean excuse yesterdays performance pit has been better on the road than they have been at home heres Miles Kelly bouncing back for indongo nicely drawn play in by indongo second field goal tell you what this is my first time having an opportunity to see Bay and Dongo live yeah I like what this young man is going to be really good for Damon stmy he is a 69 215 lb freshman from imoro in Western sagon heres the Zone again we saw it briefly in the first half from Georgia Tech Clark shoots over it and scores eight for Jack Clark his second three of the night and Clemson now closing in on a season High need one to reach their season high that they had in game one against winth lead is 20 and pulled away on the deflection heres Hunter Face Hunter left all alone Carter Murphy the transfer from Air Force out there defensively heres sheflin for another one and gapar the rebound nobody home for the Tigers underneath there there goes Murphy and he roll in Carter Murphy just his ninth field goal of the Year played four scoreless minutes on Saturday against Syracuse Dam STM looking for anything on the offensive end Carter Murphy giving him a bucket driving to the rim has the ability to shoot it as well from Beyond the threepoint Arc so Damon trying to find someone from the perimeter that can give him something offensively Hunter for Gerard Nice Shot fake three over traffic good Joseph knocks down another one seven and a half a dozen on the night coach you know we used to tell them when they would jump like that on the pump fake Fly Birdie can I go for that hes a master at that pum F 21point lead for Clemson and there is a foul I think thats going to be on Clark itll be the first on Jack eighth on Clemson free throws coming up here Chase Hunter dropping dimes red the needle to the corner of course Fly Birdie for Joe Gerard knocked down the three ball and Brandy loves it a former Hooper herself WD yep played for the great Andy Landers at Georgia heres indongo at the line hes two for two 541 to play by to the line for a couple and the first one good Dongo with seven in the game hes had 12 double figure contests against the ACC including the 21 on Duke in the first conference game you ever saw had a double double that day against the Blue Devils set the bar pretty high huh W hes had five double doubles this year again we said in the first half I the all rookie team is going to be a chore you got to pick five of a list of what Jim eight yeah theres probably eight or nine that youre going to have to talk about a lot of guards a lot of perimeter Applause guys well wait a couple weeks before we start breaking down first team values yeah a lot of important games coming up down the stretch that are going to determine who gets those first team spots as well as who gets those first four Buys in the ACC tournament all Clark on a kick out Hall here is shefflin into the lane with the right hand and Ian shefin now with 19 in the game one off his career high just ahead of 5 minutes to go just too much experience too many solid players and Georgia Techs going to run theyre running out of gas a little bit they fought pretty hard early but theyre just a little overmatched here with Clemson and Dongo boy Clark doing a good job preventing him from wiring the Baseline and Reeves ran into trouble underneath the basket Gerard all the way through tried to dump it to sheflin he got knocked away and last touched by Georgia Tech Joes one of those scorers that should shoot cuz when he tries to pass sometimes its not a a good idea but coach doesnt he lead Clemson and hes a hes a good passer but everyone like that play he has his play go ahead and make your play theyll get the rebound if he misses leads them insist in all games chase Hunter is their leader in conference play oh okay yeah Jos had a really good year hes been really solid for them in all areas yep seemed to be a really good fit for what Clemson needed great great fit sometimes the transfer portal is great helps the player helps the team Hunter step back three oh boy Chase Hunter now has got a ninepoint half and theyre all threes Cory he is feeling good about things being back home in Atlanta and it has shown up significantly here putting on a show in front of mom 24 points lead and thatll be a hand check on the Tigers against Ian sheflin thatll be his fourth by my count with 412 to play that is nine now on Brown Ls Club so one and one coming up here and the sad thing about this is you if he leaves his guys in and they keep this margin right in their efficiency which they will theyll gain four or five extra spots in the net cuz its thats what the net is Argin and efficiencies you put everybody in and you let Georgia Tech get 10 12 point run yeah you lose a lot and thats thats just not I dont think well one thing for certain we know Jimmy brackus does not descri subscribed much to the net not and neither do Clemson fans because the original year the first year of the net rankings Clemson finished in the top 35 but did not get an at llarge buy it was Clemson and NC State who both were I believe 31 and 33 or 32 and 34 respectively yep and and I was one of the main people you know crying from why does this not matter when these two teams who have been great ACC teams dont get an opportunity to get into the NCAA tournament yeah its going to be I think the get over well you have to realize too if your league is putting teams in based on the net and you dont win any games in the tournament yeah theres something wrong there yeah here is Gerard the Tigers it does beg the question if the basketball committee will look at other values this year and Gerard knocks down is that a two or a three theyre going to look at that on the return here on the next dead ball it stands as a two right now for Gerard I think the committee looks at a lot of things its they dont look just at them that I think its used Too Much by the prognosticators but I think they look at Road WIS they look at your nonconference schedule right they the committee looks at that stuff come up P get it back door of course gone are the days of the RPI remember those those were fun werent they well we like that better yeah I I I was much more of a fan of the RPI than I am the net well we also used to count on last 10 last 15 games too heres Hunter on the drive all the way through and won gari commits the foul Hunters having a terrific half hes got 11 in the half gari commits his second itll be the third on the jackets I text Brandy and asked her if she was going to be here driving the ball making defensive play blocking shots on SE 610 guys and of course shiins back home also big night shooting the ball and does all the other things that he does every game dve on the floor rebound get get loose balls well those are our Star Stories for players that have been crushing it tonight and its brought to you by Crush how about that 37 from sheflin and Chase Hunter tonight so Grayson Rams and Westlake in the house tonight here Cory yeah Westlake showing up big time and Grayson of course and you got two guys from Grayson correct yep two from West uh two from Westlake and two from Westlake both the hunter brothers from Westlake so you got double dip on both sides great high school basketball and again when you start thinking about the Atlanta area it is a hot bed of talent just because RJ Godfrey went to South grette lets dont leave him out oh no he got five for cl you got five for Georgia Tech Chase Hunter by the way missed the chance at the threepoint play GE attack the ball trailing 26 now under three to go BOS Lia has coming the game along with Gerard Godfrey Chase Hunter and Chanty Wiggins DJ Hall going to end up with a score the second half and 11 points maybe tonight over there on Coach Brown Ls bench Ian sheflin also has come out of the lineup here in the final 222 Sturdivant tees one up and hits Kyle Sturdivant nows got seven and a half a dozen in the ball game stament LED Georgia Tech in scoring in there went over Syracuse with 17 last time out what a luxury it is for Dam admire to have him coming off the bench when youve got a freshman point guard having that veteran to help show them the way absolutely helps dont forget womens basketball on Sunday triple header we get you going at High Noon from Chestnut Hill number 19 Notre Dame visits Boston College and then number eight Virginia Tech and North Carolina presented by food line from the castle in blackburg and then we will wrap it up at 530 from Cameron with NC State and Duke all Sunday all ACC network streaming live on the ESPN app Carol Lawson and the Duke blev was very difficult to go into Cameron indor and beat them in there Virginia Tech actually lost one of their two ACC losses at Duke and now another opportunity for the Blue Devils to get a huge win over a top 10 North Carolina State wolf pack how about in the Big 10 Illinois up the whole game up eight and lose the lose right at the end we dont pen State we dont pay any attention to this coach I just like to follow this we know you watch all basketball I just like to see all this other stuff like being here with a Encyclopedia of the game its amazing just old thats all no no stop that here is Beetle little Runner with the left hand for Josh Beetle out of Columbia his first basket I will say this it looks like the three Road teams are going to post wins tonight in the ACC Duke and Duke winning at Miami Notre Dame winning at Louisville and of course Clemson here up 25 with 100 seconds to go and Claude will be fouled by Lia and the only reason I bring that up guys is that home teams were 68 44 when we started play tonight winning 61 now thatll be 68 and 48 and you look at the scores tonight and you guys have both referred to the last 3 weeks of the regular season there is some meat left on the bone in this league Cory there absolutely is and when you look at the schedule for the Clemson Tigers going down the stretch this was a mustwin for them you think about their last regular season game they have to play against the Wake Forest Demon Deacons who of course are going to need that win on their home floor because you see their net rankings where they jumped up 14 spots after that huge win over pit the pit Panthers yesterday beaks made a move on a team that had had success on the road heres BOS Lis not played since the Louisville game missing a three and Clemson up 24 now with a minute and change to go Tigers looking for their fifth win in the last seven games against Georgia Tech heres Godfrey inside with a right hand score RJ Godfreys second field goal hes got five All In in the second half and Brad Brownell and his staff up loving the execution by their guys getting exactly what they want at the end of the shot clock on that possession encouraging performance tonight for Clemson Jim this is a big performance the win was important but the win like this is really helpful foul on lighter tigers by the way host Florida State on Saturday Cory a team they beat by 11 about a month ago and then next Tuesday night pit who they played in their first ACC game in early December comes to Little John and as you stated earlier both of you remarked about it Jeff cable team is a very good road team very very good road team and also one of the teams that Jimmy bucket said has a chance of getting into the NCAA tournament absolutely when you have six Road wins and you beat Duke and Virginia on the road you have a chance they have to finish but there and still a lot of basketball to be played but theyre in the mix and and Wake Forest is going to be in this tournament theyre a tournament team you watch them play you can tell that and you know Clemson I think Dukes coming on you know we know North Carolinas going to be good in the tournament were going to have some hard tough teams to go to the NCAA tournament yep final final half minute here and its going to make DC very interesting at ACC tournament time when youve got so many teams playing for so much going down the stretch yep 100 be all the way through feeds who missed the layup and with 18 seconds left Georgia Tech whos going to be at Miami on Saturday theres a three from Murphy and Lia tried to keep it alive and did enough for Dylan Hunter to get it and dribble it out Brad Brownell is going to go to 21 and n as the Tigers head coach against George attch and his team a 24point victory here tonight
