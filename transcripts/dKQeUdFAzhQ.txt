14 years now its his 14th season after coming from Washington State but he has built a model program here at Virginia both these coaches are at the upper echelon of this Music profession Houston comes out wearing the road red Virginia wearing the home white our officials Ron Grover Pat Driscoll Brent Hampton we are getting set to tip it up here in Charlottesville and the Cougars have won the tip now this is an excellent defensive back cour for Virginia with Ree pman and Kei Clark both are outstanding Applause Defenders Jamal shed hes the vocal leader on the floor Marcus Sasser hes the guy whos going to get you buckets jerus Walker he can make that jumper hes the McDonalds AllAmerican the highly outed fivestar recruit and and on the first possession John Houston winds up settling for a shot from jarus Walker they werent able to really penetrate against the Virginia Defense and thats what Virginias going to try to do Houston more aggressive theyll trap some ball screens they double in the post as does Virginia but this is an aggressive trapping and doubling team yeah these two teams played last year Houston won that game but this is a different team for Houston they lost four starters that ball Stripped Away itll stay with Virginia Virginia they return five starter this is a veteran team for the Cavaliers and in the game at the fertita center by by 20 and Im not sure that the game was that close but Virginia was a much better team later in the season an NCAA tournament quality team that just dragged a bad nonconference record with them into the committee room K Clark with a shot fake peats the buzzer first bucket for the Cavaliers T Clark over his last three games has been excellent hes averaged over 17 points and 10 free throws per game over the last three games and hes off to a good start knocking down his first one Johan Roberts trying to go one onone in the post picks up his dribble a tough shot over the backboard this crowd here they love to see good D well Kaden Shedrick is a really good shot blocker and leading Virginia Steels just held this ground and was chucking Jawan Roberts to try to keep him from getting an angle and just Walling up so we know both teams can play defense but Virginia this is actually their highest scoring team Tony Bennett has ever had they are averaging with 72 points per game theyve got guys who can fill it up well their 19 team was a much better scoring team but this one is off to a much better start early in part because of the Improvement of re Speakman and Ben vanderplas who has come in from Ohio that can provide them some additional scoring to help them spread the floor good shot fake and you know k Clark hes not going to shoot over you he uses that shot fake to get the defender Jamal Shed off balance one dribble and hes into a wide openen three as a result Kei Clark came back for his fifth year the graduate student at at Woodland Hills California he has been so good in his career first all time in school history in terms of minutes played fourth in terms of assists and hes got the first five points for Virginia he came into Tony Bennetts office and said Id like to come back if youll have me and I dont think Tony took very long to say I think Ill have you p no back court violation that ball was tipped by Virginia Mark trying to get downhill pull up jumper no good good box out by Kaden shedric on Jaan Roberts whos an excellent offensive rebounder heres pakman has it taken away by Sasser Houston once to push the pace and transition Sasser pull up three Off the Mark no good but look at that transition d by Houston well Houston just doesnt get back they get back with the intent of disrupting and stealing the ball and both Marcus Sasser and Jamal shed are very aggressive on the defensive end in the post they go again with Roberts spinning with the left hand no good Houston still looking for their first bucket and then Roberts commits the foul on the rebound Houston to start this game 0 for five from the floor well Houston has not had a clean look maybe Marcus Sasser in transition after that steal but Jaden Gardner doing a nice job staying in front and Roberts wants to get back to that left hand and right shoulder he is a lefthanded player and Virginia knows that in The Scouting Applause Report Virginia give you some different looks on the offensive end they can go with ball screens in their flow offense great pass Sedwick throwing it down off the assist from Ki Clark too much attention to the ball run in the middle of the floor that eliminates weak side help and an easy bucket for Virginia Virginia last played last Tuesday in a win over James Madison it gave it time for Reese beakman to heal his tweaked hamstring and he looks good early on Jamal shed ice cold start for the Cougars everythings a jump shot for Houston thus Applause far pick and roll this is Jaden Garner working Baseline he is fouled and we earn a trip to the free throw line well the Houston coaches have seen a lot of Jaden Gardner when he was at East Carolina he averag close to 16 points a game nine rebounds against Houston in five games and Gardner has a great shot fake and you can talk in The Scouting Report all you want to about stay down on that fake its just difficult to do Jaden Gard you said the trans from ECU this is his second year in the system for Virginia it seems like it takes guys at least a year to get accustomed to playing defense under Tony Bennett and Jaden G looking to make the jump this year I thought Virginia played good defense last year its just the the the Wahoos had a tough time scoring and thats changed this year ree beakman is a much more capable scorer Arman Franklins hitting shots at a higher rate theyre a much better offensive team than they were a year ago whos going to provide the off defense for Houston if they play five on five for 40 minutes points are going to come at a premium Mark getting inside Roberts free and theres the layup to go for Houston and all set up by just minimal penetration by Tron Mark you have to get into the teeth of the defense and force help in order to get anything around the lane this is a Houston team that was ranked number one in the country until they lost against Alabama they blew a 15point lead in that game Ki Clark another three Applause Music short well Virginia when they set a ball screen in the middle of the floor you have to be attentive to getting back you cant stay with the ball too long thats what jarus Walker did easy bucket for Kaden Music shedric ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by the Sonic steak butter bacon cheeseburger for a limited time only at Sonic you look at some of the Legends who have suited up for Virginia and Houston some of the biggest names in college basketball and all those Hall of Fame players played in the preshot clock era so the best way to stop them was just hold the ball and a lot of teams did take a look at the best D1 win percentage since that 201718 season Houston and Virginia they are right up there with the best in the country and all those teams went to the final four one championships championship game I think theres a correlation between being really good in the regular season and having postseason success big big struggle early on for Houston is finding the scoring Touch 1 for seven to start this game from the floor this is a a really good defense with their Gap protection they make it really difficult to find openings because of their help side Jamal shed the tough take to the bucket and that may be John what it takes in this game is trying to run offense but then having to make individual plays at times at the end of a clock Kelvin Simpson he got on Marcus Sasser after that loss to Alabama two for 11 from the floor and he said it wasnt so much that you miss shots it was the shot selection Arman Franklin his three is in and out so on the offensive end Coach Samson wants the Cougars to figure out what the defense has given them and then get your teammates involved theres the extra pass to Sasser wide open but he missed the three and a fight on the floor fouls going against jvier Francis well Houston racking up some fouls early and Virginia has had an advantage all season long from the free throw line its a team that doesnt get called for a lot of fouls and so they wind up having an advantage toward the end of the game with getting into the one and one earlier speak and in low possession games and low scoring games thats a big deal checking into the first time for Virginia Ben vanderplas hes the Ohio transfer he has over 1600 career points along with Isaac mcne The Freshman from West Virginia he is the Sharpshooter for the Cavaliers vanderplas his first three misses everything vanderplas can play inside or out and he can guard multiple positions he hes a really good passer too so hes been a really nice addition to this program Sasser gets downhill Up and Under what a finish by Francis and the foul Javier Francis is shooting close to 70 from the field in large measure because he gets most of his shots around the basket but great penetration by Marcus Sasser that draws help if you have to help up its going to be a drop off or a l Applause so bman comes back into the game will give Armon Franklin a breather and Houston right now after getting blanked early on on a 7 nothing run well its not hard to figure out one ree beakman comes back on the floor to make Virginia better defensively guarding the ball but you settle for jump shots its a lot tougher to rebound those but getting the ball into the paint Houston wants to touch the paint as often as possible to draw help so they can play out of it heres the Sharpshooter mcneel and he Nails his first three hes a good looking Player 11 of his 12 field goals are threes hes only had one twopoint field goal on the season so you have to chase him off the threepoint Applause line Houston trying to work inside mcney comes away with the steal but he was stepping out of bounds itll stay here with Houston all right Jas so I had Virginias games in Vegas the big wins over B and Illinois the thing that stood out for me was this team is super athletic I think a lot more athletic Than People realize for this year yeah they theyve got good athletes I mean this is a good basketball team but I think the biggest difference is they are they are much more proficient scoring and you know when you cant score which which was a difficulty last year this is not a great shooting Virginia team it puts a ton of pressure on your defense to get stop after stop Sasser had it stripped going up still put it up beatman with a rebound and all five Virginia players on the defensive glass and what a great defensive play to knock that away from Sasser when he was going up Sasser 0 for three to start this game beakman hell let it fly and he rips down the net for three well you can see the work that ree pman has done on that shot he was capable of making that shot last year but now he is reliable as a perimeter shooter Virginia shooting 50 from downtown to start this game a 15 to7 Applause lead good pump fake Sasser cant find the bucket but Roberts on the offensive glass puts it back in well Jaan Roberts is coming off a big rebounding game in his last one had five offensive rebounds against Alabama a couple games ago of his nine rebounds also had five blocks against the Crimson Tide hes just relentless on the offensive glass PA Clark with the penetration finds anderl crowds getting excited they are in every bucket here to start this game in Charlottesville beakman pounded by Sasser picking up his dribble two on the shot clock got to get it up and a shot clock violation fourth turnover of the game for Virginia theyve got a sixpoint lead Under 12 minutes to play here in this first half continuous Gap presence with which you means you see bodies rather than wood and they do a great job using essentially the ball as a magnet to put them in the right helps side defense excellent block out there by Jaden Gardner great rotations youre always going to be in a gap if they throw across Court theres a skip pass on airtime everybodys moving so theyre there on the catch Tony Tony Bennett from his father Dick Bennett his uncle jack Bennett great defensive coaches and this is yet another excellent Virginia defensive team that makes it really difficult for you to get easy shots everythings contested Roberts has been the bright spot early on for Houston hes been trying to find that soft spot close to the ring well Virginia or excuse me Houstons done a much better job of trying to attack inside attack the paint then attack out of the middle of the Applause floor Houston try to save it tipped away shed trying to hustle it down but Franklin coring it inside gner with his turnaround tipped up and thats what Houston prized themselves they hit the glass hard a Relentless rebounding team thats part of their DNA they work on it every day they have a drill Calvin Samson calls the bubble drill they put Lids on the basket and play so every shot literally is a Miss shot Applause for Houston 10 of their 11 points have come in the paint have not been able to find that outside touch yet Franklin rising up off the mark and its saved by Houston so if youre the Cougars whats the secret to solving this packline D you have to be patient and youve got to cut really hard and move the ball I mean the ball moves faster than the defense can not always against Virginia but John its not a normal game youre going to have to get used to uncomfortable situations and youre not going to youre not going to be able to get a rhythm against Virginia its just a rhythm disrupting team its a slower pace and if youre expecting to get shots the way you normally do its just not going to happen see all the disruption in the back court now its 8 seconds on the shot clock when sass will Applause inbound Houstons got to get something going two on the shot clock Sasser he didnt even see it shot clock violation and Kelvin Samson bent over at the waist that his most experienced player probably didnt even look up at the shot clock before the ball was Applause inbounded we played 10 minutes here in this first half Virginia with a fourpoint lead in this top five Showdown Music Applause Applause one of the things you have to watch against Virginia is when they penetrate theyll rotate somebody behind the ball thats tough to deal with B Bloss misses the three rebound goes to Houston Virginia has missed their last four field goals havent scored in over three minutes and mcne doing a nice job guarding Jaan Roberts on the post got switched back off now on Sharp Mark doesnt use the screen G with his strong hand to the left Sasser from three got it thats a good sign for Houston well it was all created off the penetration the penetration draws help you leave Marcus Sasser all alone he gets a step in three but Mark made that with the penetration down the middle of the floor you attack in the middle third its awfully difficult for help to recover back out Tron Mark just going right down the lane line he had a pass to his left but also a pass to his right because of the great spacing by Houston this is a really good individual play by Tran Applause Mark see that clock on the right side of your screen Virginia no points in over four minutes now Applause started this game up 9 nothing Houston has come back trailing by one McNeely from downtown Off the Mark Virginia is not an offensive rebounding team theyd rather get back they only send two guys to the offensive glass theres good pass Roberts slamming at home and Houston their first lead of the day an Tony Bennett cant be happy with that because there was no pressure on jarus Walker as he made that pass he was just able to look right over the defense and deliver that to Jaan Roberts you have to put pressure on the ball take away that Vision usually Virginia very good at that Roberts leads the way hes got eight points for Applause Houston Clark splits the D someones open Franklin with the penetration cant get the Lefty land to go but the rebound and the offensive put back is there for Gardner really nice job by on Franklin of driving that close out caught it ready to shoot and then drove right in the middle and broke down the Houston defense Houstons got to start coming off these ball screens and go right into the Hedge Defender the help Defender and try to draw a foul Walkers three is short pulling it down as Franklin Houston just one for six from Applause downtown com comes the post to poost double They Call it Monster they found the open look with Kei Clark and shedric couldnt save it we got a good one here in Charlottesville a onepoint game in this top five Music matchup Virginia doing a good job on the offensive glass their two big guys rebound no pressure on the ball and a quick pass down low for an easy score we got a close one in Music Charlottesville youre helping her study for a geog thats the big three in transition to keep that flaw open for Drew timy to go to work inside Seth Alabamas very comfortable playing from behind doing a better jop taking care of the ball in the second half and Brandon Miller when he gets it going watch out threepoint game John all right Kevin and the guys appreciate it take a look at AP top 10 Purdue number one team in the country Virginia also undefeated Houston at number five after their loss to Alabama couple games ago Im not sure yukons not the best team in the country Jordan Hawkins is a spectacular shooter Andre Jackson one of the best quote unquote role players in the country Yukon has it all and Marcus Sasser 23es in this ball game as Houston retakes the lead well Houston very good out of timeouts Kelvin Samson and his team work on their atto game and they they tried to get theyre trying to get Marcus Sasser untracked to where hes more aggressive Reggie Cheney just checked into the game for the first time from Houston and Cheney gets dunked On by shedric well just too easy the ball went right down the gut with a little lob pass Kaden shedric man what a jump from last year shed getting all the way to the rim that is blocked but they call a B 10 on shedric right now the Freshman Ryan Dunn for Virginia in the ball game as you see shed give a little hesitation move and Cedric had to take it right over the rim and knock it away but with Ryan Dunn in the game hes going to guard Marcus Sasser and hes got tremendous length and athleticism a moving screen called on Applause shedric First and biger Cavaliers Music reping so Marcus Sasser tough start he was 0 for four to start this game but ever since hes knocked down his last two threes and Jay it seems like theyve been in in rhythm in the offense hes had wide open looks well theyve done a couple of things to free him up and thats where he needed to go right into Vander CL almost was able to pick up a foul good Kick Mark get to That Elbow short on the jumper skying high for the rebound is that freshman Ryan Dunn he is a big time athlete and thats one of the things that Virginia has been missing is that super athletic Forman defensively and at some point in his career Ryan Dunn is going to be that for Virginia Clark gets all the way to the rim bump and one no they call a travel first no bucket Applause a great little hesitation move I guess Ron Gruber had the walk before the foul was called so just overruled it so this Virginia team who averages under 10 turnovers per game thats ready their fifth turnover here in this first half good look inside for chainy wasnt ready for it Mark penetrating with the left gets all the way to the rim boy what a beautiful drive by tront Mark hes made some really good drives in this game drives to draw the defense and that one hes Lefty so you let him get to that left hand hes a good player he does everything well hes not great at any one thing but does everything well Houston now 14 points in the paint as they take a fourpoint lead under five to play in this first half Vander PL just lost it shed on the breakout speed burst hes got Sasser on the wing for three knock down what beautiful transition offense jarus Walker knocks the ball away from vanderplas and then Jamal shed it used to be youd take it all the way to the basket and it would be a bad play to kick it out now its the smart play to know exactly where Marcus Sasser was Walker knocks it away shed immediately knew where Sasser was sets up for the three Houston starting to roll die hards choose die hard and they get it at Advance Auto Parts coming up tonight right here on ESPN 2 in the app number six Tennessee takes on number nine Arizona that goes down at 1030 Eastern what a night cap I mean this has been an outstanding day of college basketball if you love college hoops just relax and watch ball all day long seems like every teams got a number next to it in Arizona youre not going to find big guys that run the floor better than Umar balow and especially aulus telis I mean hes like a rocket getting down the floor and that puts such a a responsibility on opposing big guys to run the floor kind of wears them out throughout the course of a game yeah that Arizona team they are fun to watch they can fly Virginia looking to end this 70 run by Houston vanderplas is three in and out vanderplas is a good shooter he transferred in from Ohio he had 17 against Virginia in the NCAA tournament Assembly Hall his dad was a teammate of Tony Bennett at Wisconsin Green B Bay play playing for Dick Bennett Tonys dad Sasser forced to pick up his dribble good d by beakman seven on the shot clock for the Cougars Mark dips his shoulder but he traveled with it Applause Houston with their largest lead of the game up by seven under four minutes to play this is a good Music one did you our game summer here in Charlottesville Virginia got off to a hot start was a N9 nothing but then Houston their offense woke up Marcus Sasser has knocked down his last three threes from the field and Houstons open up a sevenpoint lead yeah part of the Guard analysis is re re Speakman is compromised with that hamstring G he Clark that strong shot fake yeah you have to stay down on that Virginia only four points in their last nine minutes now Virginia has to do a better job at taking care of the ball theyve turned it over six times and in a low possession game six is a lot in the first half theres still time to go Mark trying to get to his left McNeely stays right in front of him shed with some space offensive glass good job by Ben vanderplas to stay in front of Jamal shed turned it over and they call Jamal shed for the carry third turnover the game for Houston Applause under three minutes to play here in this first half Clark two red shirts meet him Baseline tra the ball and they say off the foot of Walker theyll stay here with Virginia 13 on the shot clock well jarus Walker did a really nice job of coming over from the weak side and what turned into weak side help became a trap and they just backed Ki Clark all the way to the sideline substitution Franklin and that was all the way to the side I mean k Clark was by the lane line and wound up out by the sideline that one was an aggressive Trap by Houston its so hard to keep Ki Clark in front of you hes so Shifty with the Applause ball theres that elevator play Arman Frank one going through two two screeners they close the door down and hes got an open Applause shot and just like that the lead is back to four and the Virginia crowd back in Applause it Walker trying to go oneonone the McDonalds allamerican gets the floater to go well Houston doing a really good job of spreading the floor and thats giving the Cougars an opportunity to at times go oneonone in isolation and theyve got a number of players that can make individual plays they dont want to make a habit out of it but often times in this kind of game against the Virginia Defense that may be the best offense Clark Curlin off the screen rebound goes to Gardner his midrange goes hes got a great midrange game such a nice touch from a difficult area to score that little short corner is not an easy shot this sellout crowd rising to their feet in Charlottesville Walker thats a deep two and he shows the touch the fivestar recruit coming out of high school theyre shown you why they love this kid he shoots the best percentage from three of any of the Houston players shoots 37 as a 68 freshman Applause what a good match up between Jamal shed whos just a bulldog and Ki Clark Franklin curling avoids the block and lays it in under a minute to play in this first half when Virginia gets into their they call it sides its a mover blocker offense so screening pairs on each side of the floor very difficult to guard Applause Sasser hit his last three threes from straight Applause on now Virginia can take this all the way down a 1 second difference give or take shot clock to game clock they can take it down to the end and give themselves a chance for an offensive rebound but not give Houston a chance to take it the other way K Clark scored the first five points for Virginia shot clocks at five beakman trying to get busy no looker to Franklin rising up did he beat the buzzer no he didnt shot clock violation clock violation seventh turnover of the half for Virginia the will be reset we expected this Virginia is not a knockout punch team so its not like theyre going to have huge scoring advantages in any given game but we knew that this is going to be a nailbiter and it looks like were headed that way here in Music Charlottesville if you thought one napkin for the quarter pound tomorrow on ABC the women take center stage at 3 pm Eastern Tennessee Vs taking on number two Stanford Cardinal womens basketball on ABC cant wait for that one got a shout out the Virginia Womens Basketball team what a turnaround from last year they starting the season 11 and0 they go to Duke on Wednesday for a big ACC matchup well thats Stanford team Tara Vander has another great team Haley Jones the best player but Cameron Brink is really good thats a fun team to watch so they added more time its important for Houston not to throw it out of bounds here even if Virginia gets a finger on Music it and shed wont even get the shot off to beat the buzzer so after trailing nine to nothing Houston comes all the way back takes a 30 to 26 lead at the half this is what we expected out of this top five match up lets send it to the studio Kevin Seth FS take it away guys and John and he Elite match up here 20 minutes down on defense against a really good Houston team last year for Virginia when they trailed at the half they were 0 for 17 so far this season when they Trail at the half they are at perfect 4 and 0 this team can come from behind after trailing down by four we start the second Applause Music half immediately they go into to sheding nice pass to Gardner finishing it strong or a lot of contact but Gardner a ble to take that little pass from Kaden shedric they just screened shedric down in the low post and Gardner just looped down and Dove down behind him that was a really nice play to start the second half for Virginia Gardner just loves playing against Houston Walker coming back on the other end a blocking foul and one jerus Walker has been so strong in this Applause game nice dive down and just caught the contact never took his eyes off the rim down the other side that double team Tron Marks got to be in the middle of the lane to try to take that away from gner that dive down from the top a nice answer for Houston after giving up an easy Basket in the first possession so jerus Walker completes the threepoint play and this is a kid as soon as he stepped on campus he went to work I was told he dropped 1 body fat put on 8 lbs of just pure muscle this kid is trying to go to work here and when they enter the American Conference play hes a no ego player he Blends in you know hes got a big Time reputation and very talented the Kelvin Samson talked about jarus Walker and how generous he is with his teammates of the nil money he makes he makes sure the WalkOns get paid before he takes a penny yeah I love that none of my teammates would have done that you might want to think about that John throwing a little throwing a little cash at your your analyst Im pretty sure you probably make a little more than I do Sasser shot clock winding down its at two the runner short good defense by Virginia everybody stayed home good job by Shedrick to run the floor Virginia getting back and theyre going to say thats off Virginia Jamal shed was back there contesting it and the crowd thought it went off a shed lets take a look oh look like shedric hit it watch shris right hand here yeah shedric hit it thats a great call this veteran crew Ron gr Pat Driscoll Brent Hampton they talked about it got the call correct Houston with a fivepoint Applause lead Mark with his strong hand two bodies on him puts up a force and then coming over is Jaan Roberts giving the foul but good weak side help Virginias got to stay in gaps in this game and make Houston prove it over the top you dont mind so much you dont want to give up a straight line drive but when shedric comes over that might might have been a drop off to Jaan Roberts to get him the bucket but it certainly opened up the offensive glass its just that Mark couldnt get it up on the glass Gardner calling for it finds a seam down low and puts another one in hes in double figures now hes got 10 one of the rare times when Houston doesnt have any pressure on the ball because the ball was so high out top thats a long pass to go right down the gut in five games in Gardners career against Houston averaging almost 15 points nine rebounds per game got to remember he played at ECU in the American against Houston shed comes to that jump stop pull up jumper in control knocks it down he is so tough one of the best assist guys with a low turnover rate he averages close to Six assists per game and hes from Little mayor Texas took them to the state tournament a couple of times when thats not been the norm and at times he had to guard a fiveman out on the floor hes one of the biggest players on his team beakman throwing it up and on the rebound theyre going to call a foul on Houstons Walker shed comes to a twoot jump stop and against against Virginia youve got to come to a jump stop playoff two feet but no pressure on the ball and Ki Clark can just take you apart because of the overhelmed Applause Music Applause Music when Gardner takes that shot it takes away an offensive rebounder for Virginia and Virginia doesnt get many second shots generally but theyve had hardly any in this game walker will step out and take the three and rattle it in holding up that follow through the big man The Freshman 68 he can shoot he now has 10 and coming into this environment thats a big game for jarus Walker I thought he might throw it into the corner to tront mark but hes so confident right now crosscourt pass to K Clark short rebound to Roberts Clark s that hot start is 0 for six from the floor and just like that back the other end Sasser finishes boy what a great Outlet pass and Sasser with that left hand just taking on the transition defense and Virginia does not give up transition Vasquez that was a huge bucket in this game Jan Roberts one of the best rebounders in the country especially on the offensive end Bill Walton would be happy with that Music outlet oh thats my piece of the shakaroni thats the biggest one we make Sonic you are looking at the Rotunda on the campus of University of Virginia one of the most pretty beautiful campus you will see in the entire country it is gorgeous I think thats the lawn is that the lawn there where its such an honor for a a fourth year or a fifth year perhaps to to live on the lawn I am not a Virginia expert but I was told it it was the Rotunda well that the the buildings the Rotunda but but I think they call it the lawn correct and uh if I remember right I think Ralph Samson lived on the lawn good play out of the the double team and thats a shot that Jaden Gardner usually hits largest lead of the game for Houston right now up by 10 Gardner shows on the Hedge his man Walker goes by contact no call Walker on the floor trying to keep it alive its out of bounds off Houston when Jaan Roberts is there to grab an offensive rebound when shedric comes over from the weak side to block a shot thats going to open up the offensive glass especially if theres not a rotation down but looks like Walkers still on the floor so we will step aside as the Houston medical staff will attend to Walker well be back after this well its great to see freshman sensation jarus Walker get up and walk it off after taking a fall we went to break injuries were stored last year losing Marcus Sasser and Tron Mark Jay lets take a look at the end of that play yeah Arman Franklin just Falls right on him and bumps that knee certainly couldnt have been comfortable for jarus Walker but glad to see he got up and walked it off Kelvin Samson who should be in the Hall of Fame last year maybe one of his best coaching jobs ever when you lose your two star guards he completely transformed this team into going into the post he gets them back this year and thats why everyone is so excited about what Houston could do well Houstons lost four starters for a few years in a row now thats been the norm for the Cougars but theyve done a great job developing players and its not always evident during the course of the season but these players are going to practice every day and getting better and they can step in when theres a need and the following year when you lose significant players off a team that went to the final four and went to an elite eight the next year that says a lot about their Player Music Development Ander PL entry pass to shedric lot of contact foul is called on Jan Rob Roberts yeah Roberts just got caught behind shedric and a good pass in from vanderplas so for Roberts thats his third personal just the penetration and then just an easy pass in when youre that far behind you want to try to get three quarter front and you certainly dont want to give up deep post position to Kaden shedric ter shedric the red shirt junor from Raleigh North Carolina early on this season he has been a lot more aggressive offensively especially calling for the ball establishing position inside hes shooting close to 70 on the season average in just under 10 points and five rebounds a game but his real value is as a Defender hes a good shot blocker and again he averages over two blocks a game in lower possession gains he also leads the team in steal so hes active on the defensive end as a big guy and Virginia does a great job of hedging screens you give a ball screen put a big guy in a ball screen and watch here they ghosted it so it didnt get all the way to the screen they find the open man Tron Mark he knocks down the three ball well thats good offense instead of setting the screen they just ghosted it so they ran up the screen and then ran right out of it and then Jamal shed able to get that penetration the help and then a wide open three from the corner by Tron Mark thats good offense by Houston This Ti is the largest deficit for Virginia this season that ball is out of bounds and they call a foul on beakman so Reggie cheny just ghost that and shed able to get in the middle of Lane Drew three Defenders again a little bit of overh help by Virginia you know not all those white shirts had to Rally to the ball you got to stay with Shooters you give up a tough two thats one thing give up an open three thats another shed gets on the floor to keep the possession alive for Houston Virginia trailed by 11 at against Michigan they would come back to win that game pull up jumper no good offensive glass tipped around Houston still has another opportunity Mark caught in the air Sasser from Applause deep and its Houston being aggressive but they travel with it well Houston having to manufacture some things but their activity level is good and thats why they have this 11point lead theyre Kell Samson assistant to his father Kelvin Samson kellans an excellent assistant coach thats a really good staff that Kelvin Samson has with quanis white Hollis price played for him at Applause Oklahoma if youre Virginia how do you get back in the offensive flow movement you know theres theres just not a lot of movement for Virginia right now a lot of dribbling not a lot of passing good fake mcne The Freshman knocks down his second three the West Virginia High School Player of the Year Isaac mcne can really shoot it reminds you little Shawn mcneel played at West Virginia now at Ohio State except he might shoot it better Houstons lead is at eight what a matchup with ree beakman on Marcus Sasser Sasser has to try to beat the buzzer his three is no good Cheney keeps it alive buts so hard to get a block out Reggie Cheney nobody blocked him out he had a wide open path right down the lane and now all of a sudden Virginias got to play 30 more seconds of Defense Mark wants the clear out going against McNeely no good but Cedrics going to be called for the foul as he came over to help defensively well thats a really good move by Tron mark under control got the defender off the floor able to get to that left hand couldnt kiss it off the glass but just an under contr control move down the lane got the bump a little Up and Under move and then shedric hit him and as he was trying to come Applause down Mark misses the first for Kaden shedric that is his third personal foul and hell take a seat as Jaden Gardner comes back in on the road is where you really have to knock down for free throws and Tron Mark who shoots close to 80 on the Applause Applause Music Applause Music season now theyre back to their sides offense thats going to give him a little bit better Applause movement when you get an open shot John you got to knock it down sounds simple but its so hard to get open shots for both teams but especially hard against Houston and when you get an open look you have to knock it down because there arent going to be many offensive rebounds available under 12 minutes of play in the second half Kei Clark trying to poke it away Houston still with it Cheney running the floor throwing it down down well give Jamal shed a ton of credit he got the ball knocked away but kept it alive and Houstons just Relentless in their pursuit of the ball if they cant grab it theyre going to keep it alive and give a teammate a chance to grab it Reggie Cheney providing huge minutes off the bench hes a guy who knows his role as a senior a good fade screen by Vander Plass and the reaching foul called against shed heres foul on the one Jamal as a second keeping the ball alive and Reggie Cheney the beneficiary the selfless senior coming in off the bench for help middle ball screen by Jawan Roberts when he rolls hard to the basket hes going to pick up some help a nice pass fake for Marcus Sasser and that opens up jerus Walker on the left wing and here the ghost screen from Reggie Cheney and the penetration draws three Defenders and the kick out to Tron Mark who was ready to shoot it and if you had any criticism for the defense of Virginia and their defense is excellent maybe guarding the ball and keeping the initial penetration out of the lane but also there have been times where I think Virginia has overh helped in this game and you certainly want to help you just dont want to overh help and create additional openings for for Houston Houstons taken advantage of those openings Houston Houston excuse me up by 11 as approach 11 minutes to play in the second half Banner Bloss rejected by Cheney what a recovery By Reggie Cheney off balance due to the shot fake still made the recovery and went up got that block with the left hand sass forc to pick up his dribble Emanuel sharp The Freshman no good Emanuel sharp is a pure scorer hes one of those guys that with time to develop hes going to be an outstanding player Gardner pick and roll thats usually his spot John he likes that short Corner area his midrange game is Applause excellent really the the Rhythm disruption that Virginia usually puts on other people other teams Houston has disrupted all the Rhythm for Applause Virginia you wonder how much a part of that re Speakman with that hamstring is because he doesnt look like himself called an offensive foul legal screen by Emanuel Applause sharp Reese beakman the official word on him with that hamstring is something theyre just going to manage week to week because a hamstring is one of those nagging injuries that you just need rest for it to go away so you continue to play it might be with him for a little bit this season well the amount of time it would take to to heal it completely would take take up the season and as long as hes not going to do further damage he and his medical team feel like he can play but hes clearly not Music Applause 100 Franklin driving Baseline Cheney strips it away and too active there they call it on Reggie Cheney a ton of contact on the initial action and then Cheney got him with the second round of it just a terrific drive by Franklin hard to believe there wasnt enough contact for a foul Music there Franklin the Senor out of Indianapolis Indiana Nails the first free throw coming into this game Arman Franklin had scored 88 points but 47 of those 88 came in two games you had 26 against Baylor at 21 I think in their first game but Franklin spent some time in Houston this summer working with John Lucas Music the great John Lucas that played at Maryland was also ACC champion in tennis including being all ACC in basketball the number one overall pick in the NBA draft I think it was Applause 76 Kei Clark a little too tight defensively they call him for the reaching well that was a smart play by Marcus Sasser Ki Clark had that right hand out and almost hard Andes he went it he went right into watch his right hand he just goes right into it to draw that Applause Music foul now Houston obviously wasnt happy with that loss to Alabama you never want to lose to anyone but that might have helped this team wake up and realize they needed to come together Sasser taking tough shots T of shots like that they had a 15point lead that evaporated against Alabama well Alabama went small in the second half on Houston they were able to drive it get into the lane and collapse the defense they kicked it out to open shooters that small lineup was really effective and Houston didnt do a good job guarding the ball which they normally do theyre normally able to guard the ball effectively and thats thats really got the first the first facet of any defense can you guard the ball and stay out of help the best the best teams stay out of help its not that they help they stay out of it the Kei Clark Ki Clark with a strong drive he scored the first five points of the game for Virginia but has been quiet sense and he makes the first Virginias next game is on acc Network on Tuesday theyll take on number 25 Miami coverage begins at 830 Eastern number two Virginia number 25 Miami Miami got a win today I think they beat St Francis but the Hurricanes can score especially Isaiah Wong hes having a terrific year that last foul called against shed that was his third for Applause Houston Cheney go on oneonone kick out shed three ball got it well Kelvin Samson deciding he wanted to go into Cheney against vanderplas and Cheney got around him and that was a really nice pass to the opposite side of the floor how about these minutes by Reggie Cheney Off the Bench the assist there for the big man Ki Clark driving hard and its Cheney with the block it looked like Marcus Sasser was there from behind as well there was a bump by Cheney as Clark was going up but no call and Cheneys been working so hard he was tugging at his jersey said coach I need a breather yeah Cheney bumped him really hard there I think Sasser is able to knock that away with his left hand that was an awful lot of contact on an Airborne Applause shooter park has a switch now Roberts on him Banner Bloss from the Applause wing Virginia has had some open looks tonight have not been able to hit him Applause down low cross screen screen for the screener action nothing there for Sharp Walker find sharp from the wing too strong strong rebound by G and theres Sasser trying to strip it away but hes out of bounds Sasser saying how did I wind out up out of bounds I got pushed Timeout on the floor Houston trying to plead their case completing an awesome day of college hoops here on ESPN I mean its defense versus offense Tennessee third in the country right now holding opponents to under 52 a game in Arizona man they just get up and down and they can score yeah maybe the best offense in the country going against one of the best defenses in the country Rick Barnes in that Tennessee program they can really guard and John Ive been notified by a bunch of my Virginia graduate friends that its referred to as the grounds its not campus its the grounds I stand corrected no its not you Stan its me and uh you I always thought BRS was in a copy discussion but we will aede to the wishes of the Wahoo fans you know what Wahoo is whats that its a fish that can drink more than its weight okay Roberts has no trouble there with the Lefty hook and a great answer by Jaan Roberts getting to that left hand the right shoulder when you play against Virginia whenever the the Wahoos make a run youve got to answer it its tough to score against this team Clark hat daylight decides to give it up to mcne thats why you have to stay down in that shot if he wants to take it just take it over an outstretched arm mcne from way downtown shedric trying to tip it alive and Houston will slow things down up by 10 as we approach 6 and 1 half to Applause play Houston trying to play a little bit higher on the floor raise up this Virginia Defense heres the double team and its beeping with the steel looking to push Applause it beakman with daylight rising up shedric on the offensive glass whenever Virginia brings a double team they keep the ball out from coming out balls side and that means you have to look opposite and REE beakman was just waiting there like a defensive back intercepting a pass kyen shed in double figures hes got 10 for Virginia the lead is cut to eight shot clock winding down at three Sasser pull up jump or tough shot rolling off Virginia gets the stop offensively Jay what do you want to see well theyve got to get a score here thats a good place to go Gardner got his man in the air and will draw the foul after getting a stop Virginias offense always seems to look so much better thirdd but really this game for Virginia as much as getting a score its about getting stops on the other end jarus Walker just gives an angle to the basket to Jaden Gardner and hes going to get you off the floor so far I think Virginias perfect from the foul line and they score about a quarter of their points from the free throw line and thats about the number theyve had today so Houstons got to keep Virginia off the foul line Houstons been really difficult to score against he cant foul him and give him easy points Gardner misses the first free throw the day for Virginia 11 of 12 from the line as a Music team good ball movement to start just some windshield wiper around the front Houston spreading him out offensively Walker pull up midrange in and out keeping alive thats Tron Mark resetting the possession oh what a play by tront Mark he came from all the way on the left side of the floor just to keep that ball Applause alive shed pick and roll with Cheney extra pass to Walker on the wing another three for the Freshman Welly thats a big time play By Reggie Cheney on the short roll through a help Defender to stop him from getting to the basket just kicks it out to jarus Walker and Walker has been money in this game didnt rush Applause it Clark cut off Gardner cutting and hell be fouled going up by Cheney well you you cant understate how big of a basket that was now watch this short Roll By Reggie Cheney catches it doesnt walk with it but Drew three Defenders and then kicked it out to jerus Walker and thats a lot of ground for Jaden Gardner to have to recover to get back to him that was a great play By Reggie Music Cheney Gardner putting together quite a ball game for Virginia hes a team High 12 points right now four or five from the free throw line he was leading this team in scoring until the last three games when Ki Clark averaged about 17 and2 over his last three Clark at 18 against Florida State and James Madison he puts 16 up against Michigan in the last three and Clark picks his pocket pumps the fist the grad suit and trying to get the crowd back in it well he was sitting on that rightand dribble by Jamal shed just went behind his back took it away that was a first transition basket of the game for Virginia this is the out as John Paul Jones Arena has been all day eighth turnover from Houston as Virginia turning it up defensively boy K Clark just so aware watch this inside hand change he knew the ball was going to be shown in that right hand and just sat on that hand change to take it away and get the easy bucket on the other end he brought this building alive the fifth year he State South Dakota State John and J all right Kevin appreciate the updates McNeely misses the three coming out of the break and thats the second elevator play that was run about the free throw line and McNeely was wide open for that shot hes not going to get a better one shed goes all the way finishes over the shot blocker well that was a big sequence for Houston getting a stop even though mcney had a great look and then scoring on the other end to give Houston a little bit more Breathing Room in a game where its been difficult for either team to breathe throughout peakman find shedric the twoand slam a re pman got into the middle of the lane and a little bit of overhelmed Applause up by six Virginia only has four team fouls so they can be aggressive Walker finds Mark spapa boy another great pass by jarus Walker and Tran Mark has not hesitated when hes had a good look hes gone straight up with it just when Virginia makes a run Houston answers back up by nine and miscommunicate shedric cant handle the pass well it was a tough pass to catch but even if shedric caught it what was he going to do with it there and a terrific job after just getting out of that ball screen and slipping out of it thats a terrific pass by jarus Walker to look opposite but Virginias got to continue to drive the ball were getting into a late game situation but Houstons got him in the double bonus so every time there was a common foul Virginias shooting two free throws its not that Houstons intentionally trying to bur clock here they just dont want to be in too much of a hurry Walker tough turn out whoa thats how did he hit that one thats one of those where Kelvin Samson says hey great shot son just dont take it again well hes having a great game under difficult circumstances 15 points for jarus Walker McNeely driving spinning it up with his left and finishing plus the fou and thats a great Drive I think Virginia has to continue to do that drive the ball put Houston in a position to foul and its a bonus that he got this to go with the potential for a threepoint play but every time you you drive it you give them the chance to foul what a great individual play and thats tough turning over that left shoulder for a righthander to shoot that kind of turnaround McNeely converts the threepoint play 12 the play lead is cut to eight when mcney touches the rim do they count it as a Miss he is pure that foul you can go for the ball without fear of fouling because thats just a 15 foul to Virginia with full court pressure Applause if youre Virginia what point you have to start thinking about fing not yet its still a little bit too Applause earlyman gives up if youre going to do it do it right away but I think you want to go for Steals and especially now in the inbounds go for a steal if you foul fine if thats your strategy to foul thats the 15 foul on EA I think thats a 16 heard a fifth its a Music sixth they were at four before that Clark foul and thats the the next foul so that puts him at six so on the next foul its one and one for Applause Houston K Clark was charged with a B back second versal foul NBA now has 16 fouls so they corrected it is indeed 16 fouls now on Virginia next foul against Virginia will send Houston the line for one to Applause one Sasser inbounds and hell be fouled immediately by beakman Marcus Sasser an excellent free throw shooter shooting 86 on the season late in the game against Alabama Houston did not shoot free throws well but it was largely a function of who got fouled it was smart of Houston to get the ball into the hands of an excellent free throw shooter in their leading score Marcus Sasser Houston from the line today three for four for Sasser this will be his first trip at the charity straight and for Houston right now with an eightpoint lead that could turn into 10 if both these are made and theyre not you dont want to foul and you dont want to give up an open three so no threes no fouls Beakmans running the point for Virginia bander PLO rising Applause up and Kei Clark will give up the foul looked like he Clark fouled after jarus Walker giving up the ball but I think he fouled jarus Walker third on the CL a Virginia all in the day shooting five of 21 from downtown under 24 and Virginias had open looks it was not for lack of some open shots but V Houston is really difficult to play against and Walker on the season shooting just under 60 from the foul line and these are some big free throws on the road to try to extend this lead to 10 with under a minute to go in regulation Applause and Walker does make the first tomorrow on ABC at 3 Eastern womens basketball Tennessee balls taking on number two Stanford Cardinal should be a good match up on ABC 300 pm Eastern what jerus Walker Jon has had a spectacular game to come into this environment playing against a team that really disrupts Rhythm I mean this is the best game that hes played all season long and hes had some good ones and this is the toughest environment Houston has played all season long they went on the Road at Oregon but really coming here a soldout arena in an ACC environment a tough place to play Houston has handled the pressure I agree and and this is a really difficult place to play in large measure because Virginia is such a good team You Know Places get get credit for being tough places to play theyre usually tough because the teams really good I mean I joked about that they say oh its really difficult to win an Allen field house at Kansas I said well its difficult to win there cuz they make you play Kansas you know you come to John Paul Jones Arena its tough to win cuz they make you play against Virginia but for a freshman like jarus Walker to come into this game and this environment and play this well hes a really good passer hes got great passing Applause instincts 10point game under a minute to play and you know Kelvin Samson and his staff were talking about no threes no fouls it stays solid here beakman stripped going up and theyre going to call the foul Reggie Cheney was right there he just reached in and Kelvin Samson asking for a walk but CH Reggie Cheney just brought that right arm down instead of just staying staying big make him score a tough two over Applause you just a tiny little tick across the arm but more than enough for a foul and that gives Virginia the chance to shoot a couple free throws score with no time going off the clock and then being set up to press so for Cheney that was his fourth as Roberts will come back in for him and Deke man makes the Applause first right now for Houston its all about possession getting the ball inbounds cleanly and being prepared to get fouled Sasser knows hes going to get fouled holds on to it and the senior Will C walked to the line its always nice for a score at the end of the game to get fouled knowing you can put a couple extra points on the board after suffering that tough loss to Alabama whatd you learn about Houston today well theyre a resilient team youre not going to go no teams going to go through the season unbeaten and you know that was a game where maybe maybe there was something in the minds of Houston they lost in a in a onepoint game at Alabama last year in Tuscaloosa that maybe they thought hey you know just Revenge theyre just automatic going to win but they had opportunities to win that game didnt take advantage of them you give great credit to Alabama cuz theyre legit like Alabama is legit but to bounce back in their their last two games you know especially here I mean this is a program win I think for if theyre able to hang on for Houston to come into this this building and get a win against the number two team in the country youve got another final four caliber team for Houston Sasser now 13 points on the game for Houston Franklin has some space and he knocks down the three so Virginia not done yet but as long as Houston continues to bang down free throws you know that thats one thing that Kelvin Sams is talking you cant you cant leave a threepoint shooter open you give up a two thats one thing cant give up a three got caught ball watching there but as long as Houston bangs their free throws down theres just not enough time so Tron Mark goes to the line he will shoot two Tron Marks another guy whos bounce back he did not have his best game against Alabama fouled out in it and he has been much more focused and had a much better performance in this game and this you cant understand this is a difficult game to play in its like being in a dentist office for two Music Applause hours Clark looking for a quick bucket find shedric and they give him the Easy Pass to the Lane shedric with 14 points now Houston inbounds and Mark is fouled Music immediately Houston has so many good ball handlers in the back court with shed Sasser and Mark and all of them can make free throws you just are smart about getting the ball in to getting trouble call a timeout back to the line twoot and theres a great article in the athletic this week talking about just where Houston has come from Kelvin Samson when he took over this program back in 2014 I mean they had to practice at times in the recre center like with other students Houstons practicing their locker room had rats cats running around other people had their passcode to the locker room so their stuff would get stolen from where this program has come now people see a top five number next to their name and we just kind of expect that from Houston well Plus the cats in the locker room just werent Tough Enough if there were that many rats running around the KE I was talking to Kelvin sson today you asked him hey have you ever been here to Virginia before he said well Ive come here to scout but I was here to play baseball you he was a catcher in baseball and he said I hit a double off the wall and then got picked off a second so thats that was his memory of Virginia this is going to be a much better memory of the University of Virginia for Kelvin number five Houston comes to Virginia and gives the Cavaliers their first loss of the season for Houston a big road win Houston will move to 11 and one on the season Virginia Falls to 81 with a 6961 win for my partner Jay Billet
