Coast Conference Reno jumping center with Cam Corin and its Pittsburgh with a basketball first here is low the sophomore from Missouri City Texas and good to see ishma leet back into the starting lineup for pit missed a game with an ankle sprain lots of options on the offensive end for Pittsburgh this year one of them is Cam Corin the Florida state transfer averaging 11 points and six rebounds a game and cam Corin becoming much more of an offensive threat for Jeff Cable in this pit team a guy theyre going to have to rely on for interior buckets right now great shot fate Ryan agarwall penetrates little Runner left it short out of bounds was Pittsburghs Zack Austin so Stanford will have it on the Baseline are they going to say that that was a to me its a change of possession that should go back to 30 well theyre going to theyre going to set the reset the shot lock right now to 20 saying it was an offensive rebound but I dont agree with that well again did he have firm control of the basketball possession before he stepped on the line clearly the officials said no so shot clock now down to 15 this is jayen Blakes the Duke grad transfer played for the Blue Devils the last three years as we talk about that match up at the point guard is maxo gets his first bucket of the game its Jay Len and Jay Lyn see make sure that everybody understands of course in the pit starting five you see jayen low running to show for the Panthers and again good to see Leed back into the starting lineup which only makes the pit bench that much stronger Brandon Cummings got the start Wednesday when this team rallied from 16 down to beat C and thats a young man that pit is waiting to see get going from outside G is knocking down the three that much more dangerous when hes able to stretch the floor especially with Cam corn on the inside yeah G Diaz Graham only 24 hes a much better shooter than that hes really the only pit player not shooting the basketball well and thats something we saw Jeff cable actually got on the floor and demonstrated earlier today how he wanted his post players to defend Rayo he told them take the bump take the bump do not fall down dont take try to get a charge but you see Reno with that left arm pushing off getting an offensive foul in the first turnover for the card first foul for the senior from Paris France 71245 lbs in the midst of an AllAmerican season Austin who is a terrific shooter misses badly on his first Applause attempt good defense by legot to get a hand on that pass Stanford keeps the USC transfer with a long to Isaiah osiah sers makes it 54 sers playing very confident basketball averaging over 14 points per game really a big three for the Cardinal when they go out on the floor between of course Reno as well as sers and jayen blanks sers is a Bay Area kid grew up in Hayward about a 45minute drive from the Stanford campus over the San Mato Bridge Corin back outside low the extra pass leged with two on the shot clock missed it long rebound Cory what has cam Corin bought to brought to this Pittsburgh team from Florida State this year star with offensive rebounding hes already shown that off but hes a guy not much a back to basket score but he is a face up guy was a freshman of the week a couple SE years ago at Florida State and it showed tremendous promise but now getting used to a much greater role averaging close to 30 minutes per game for Jeff Cap leget has his first two points in the night he and low both average 175 per game sixth in the ACC short close out and thats not a mistake you would see from ish Le often raino was 0 for five last time out against Clemson but of course he has the ability to shoot them from Beyond The Arc hand down on that possession he raised up easy the other thing about rno is Corin tries to save it itll be Pittsburgh basketball rno is 71 and his release is so high a close out may not do anything to him but as a guard and you see the switch when you out here look at leg his hands are down you got to get In Crowd his space force a sevenfooter to have to drive the basketball around you because you know hes a elite shooter from Beyond The Arc the 2024 Pack 12 most improved player and hes taken yet another jump forward as a senior this year here defending long who rattles it out Stanford with the basketball off the agar wall Music rebound calls for the Applause screen R gets doubled up crosscourt pass theres Corin on the defensive glass and he draws the foul that will go against Aiden camman of the Cardinal good start to the Ball Game here at the Pete All Tied its seven early his father also an accomplished head coach no excuses figure it out he has figured it out here at pit they absolutely have backto back 20 win Seasons NCAA tournament two seasons ago got Rob should have been in a tournament last year however looking to reach it once again this year and for Jeff cable he also will make sure to give his staff a tremendous amount of credit he has not done this alone a consistent staff with him of course a very experienced staff all of his assistant coaches with head coaching experience and shout out to my little brother Jason capable whos not with the team today under the weather but I know hes watching at home and this was actually his Scout so he passed it on to Milan Brown once he wasnt going to be able to be here today A lot of head coaching experience on that bench for Jeff cable his brother Jason was the head coach at App State Milan who you mentioned at Mount St Marys in Holy Cross and then the great Tim oou former head coach at Fairfield University and he has kept the staff together and that pays dividends it absolutely does and again a loyal staff a great group to have together and youve seen this program grow by Leaps and Bounds since theyve been and credit to the pit administrators for giving him the opportunity to get it going Reno gets the role after 4 years they could have said okay thats enough but they stuck with him and look where they are now absolutely that would have been a mistake and you see that this place has been revitalized the zoo is back Jumping and of this is this is a crowd without students right the students arent even in session right now but you still the the popularity of pit basketball is back in this community I know by the way the Steelers are hosting the Bengals at 800 tonight over on ESPN and ABC and so there are a lot of folks who didnt make the trip down here to the Pete will be watching that but still great energy in the building as weve become accustomed to in the last couple of years for Coach capable out of bounds back to Pittsburgh with Stanford on top nine to seven 49y old Jeff capable thei he has the zoo reinvigorated and when the students are on break as they they are now they make those tickets in the Oakland Zoo available for the general public and so weve got good representation over there got to be a bucket in this item if youre from this area recognizing how important the zoo has been to this program Brandon Cummings into the game off the bench for Pittsburgh number three in white Corin lost the handle Stanford with it Jaylen Blakes attacking right there but recognizing hes going to have the big gu followed him but you see the skill of rno the pump fake and then the ability to handle the basketball get into the painted area a little push shot in the paint and now you see Stanford getting back into a Zone defensively always the best place to attack the zone is in the middle camp porn unable to get it to go Ray no is four for four nine points well on his way to what would be a nation best 12 double double and he has a personal 70 run to put Stanford up by four block shot by Diaz Graham out of bounds itll be Stanford basketball coach cable doesnt think so you see Jeff still can move a little bit Yeah well you mentioned it earlier Cory we saw him during shoot around get very involved again today showing what his Defenders should be ready to deal with with Jaylen Blakes and looked like he still got a pretty good handle yeah oh he definitely got got the handle now the feet dont move as fast as they did back in the day as we see the foul on comings hes looking over saying that there was a leg kick that forc him to make contact on that possession but and one thing for certain you know the hands are still quick smart play Here by sers to get that right leg out get the contact and here is sers uh who went to south southern California Academy but he is a NorCal kid again from Hayward who has come home to play his final two years of college basketball spent two years with the Trojans in Southern California but he has made a big leag gotten a bigger opportunity for minutes and after scoring five a game last year hes up to over 14 per game this year and hes a young man that could that average could go up as the season goes along as you mentioned starting to find his way his role for this team and also when you have to be relied upon that pressure adds often times more production like it got the shot off and got the roll I thought sellers was going to block the shot from behind sell should get a point for that one if if Lega gets one sell should get one as well he got to handle that basketball so the pit senior from Prince Georges County Maryland snaps the Stanford run Cardinal with it on top by four FY final you say p count Im just saying thats what we call I miss you I miss you I know its been its been too long my man off the bounce sers starting to heat up yeah hasnt been too long for sers putting points on the board though two at the line on the last possession and now going to the corner for the three ball theyre going to count there a two sellers took it away and this is Blakes game right here hes been a welcome addition to this Stanford ball Club theyd had no idea that he would be able to give them this type of offensive production coming in they knew what he could do defensively but offensively hes been better than advertised well based on what he was coming out of Blair Academy in New Jersey he was the number 89 recruit three years ago just never got the opportunity to flourish offensively as weve seen this year at Stanford during his three years of due and we talked to him about that he gave a very educated political answer where he talked about well you know I did what I the best I could do in my role but I know underneath the competitor that he is as we see cam corn with the back to the bucket basket there but jayen Blakes Im sure hed say Hey listen I could have done this at Duke had I got those minutes into the paint Blakes gives to Renault finds the cutter sellers tried to put it up on the reverse gets it back out to Blakes Corin saves Pittsburgh with it down by seven pit has won 14 games in a row here its their long longest at the Pat in 11 years such a smart play by jayen low there putting the defender behind him and then using the separation to be able to get the layup on the glass foring the defender to have to lay off otherwise hed be shooting a free throw with the an you see his balanced numbers there only cam Jones at Marquette the other guy in the country averaging 17 points six assists four and a half rebounds per game R now off to a great start five for five from the field already he has been a automatic bucket when hes got the basketball in his hand is he the ACC player of the year he absolutely is right now for the early season you have to you think about a guy leading the league in scoring and rebounding and doing in a very efficient manner Lakes dribbled it off his own leg Pittsburgh comes up with it so not Cooper flag at do uh right now Im Im going with REO Cooper flag is clear away the The Freshman of the Year Rookie of the Year no question about that but cps not leading the league in scoring and rebounding again Ray no averaging nearly 21 points 12 rebounds a game both tops in the league the scoring is 10th in the country layup by camon The redard Freshman from endover Mass has his first two and one thing we need to mention Pittsburgh is averaging over 90 points per game in their last three home games they are shooting the basketball extremely well on this floor only 13 points in in the first 10 minutes of this game so G give Stanford a tremendous amount of credit for following the game plan The Scouting Report defensively and slowing down these Panthers which has been hard to positive things happen for the Cardinal and you see showing off that touch from about 16 ft has that ability and can also stretch it from well beyond the threepoint Arc but where he does the majority of his damage is on the Block once he catches the basketball in the post area hes able to make things happen and even showing off his Nifty ball handling ability and the soft touch around the rim here this evening well hes been putting up this season numbers at Stanford in points and rebounds not seen on the farm since the great Adam Keefe back in the early 90s and I can time under Randy Bennett at St St Marys to be able to cut his teeth on the defensive end of the floor and weve seen him we know that he will throw different defenses out there that of course pit is prepared for the 131 that youll see throughout this day but also mantoman principles allow them to be successful he was a division three B basketball star at Hamilton College in Upstate New York back in the late 80s early 90s he didnt want to take credit for it today mhm but for one season he shot 51 from Beyond the threepoint line man that that is Elite of elite 51 anytime you shoot 50 from three lets start with the fact that there are very few people that can ever say theyve done that in a career but coach Smith absolutely showing his humility did not want to take any part of the credit for the team success nope he said his better teammates on that number one ranked team 30 years ago were drawing all the defensive attention he had open shots Jaylen low for the Panthers with the basketball shot clock down to five in a tough spot and the pass is going to go out of bounds back to Stanford fourth turnover committed by pit but give araa a tremendous amount of credit for staying down on that possession did not go for the pump fakes didnt go for any of the movement of jayen low in the painted area and you look as he stays down often times Defenders will bite on that first pump fake allowing low such a smart point guard to get him in the air and draw a foul Aral stays on the ground was the turnover Blakes has had a breakout season since transferring as a graduate from duke chisaka Off the Bench the Harvard transfer misses his first shot attempt Pittsburgh basketball now its one thing to do well in the portal but its a completely different scenario to do well in the portal at Stanford because the academic requirements involved to be able to be a part of the Cardinal program are different than where youre going to find in many other places so give Kyle Smith and his staff a tremendous amount of credit for the guys they were able to bring in this year it is obviously a world class institution K Corin with the garbage points picked it up and laid it in one thing thats different about Stanford this year is that Kyle Smith and his staff have been allowed to bring in undergraduate transfers first time thats occurred in 15 years but they also have to be you cant bring in a guy thats already completed three years of Eligibility you have to be a sophomore or younger to be able to make that transfer to come in Stanford with academic requirements theyre not allowing people with have already played three years to be able to come in so Darren San transferred in from UC Irvine hes been very deep on the bench but chismar transferred in from Harvard Im guessing academically he was probably okay I think hes okay and then oah sers out of USC transferring back home to Northern California so those are the three undergraduate transfers by Kyle Smith and his staff coming in to help fortify the Cardinal who are nine and four on the year theres the former Harvard Crimson missing from three but I would also assume that their GPA have to be relatively high at the previous University to be able to make that transfer fifth turnover committed by pit here come the Cardinal this is to AGA wall hard foul given by Austin good job by aara to bring energy Off the Bench for Coach Smith and off of those Pittsburgh turnovers Stanford so far has cashed him into seven points and coincidentally thats the lead right now 2215 Applause Music water womens basketball double header we have for you tomorrow afternoon on ESPN of the app is Hannah Hidalgo and number three Notre Dame take on number 17 North Carolina at one Eastern and then number 15 Tennessee host Oklahoma the ninth rank team in the country in Knoxville should be a great day of Hoops on ESPN and Cory a ask you what is most impressive for you for the great Hannah hadalo the 56 guard at Notre Dame that she scores 26 a game that she has 64 rebounds a game or her 41 steals per game the most impressive part is the way that she has formed the best backcourt in the country with Olivia the two of them together have been spectacular and so bah Hado who got to do it all herself last year bringing in another Elite player off of injury and the way that theyve combined in that back court to be so special get a chance to see she and the Irish tomorrow 100 Eastern Time against Carolina on ESPN a good job defensively by the Panthers up a three off of Austin now a little bit of moment momentum in the Panthers favor taken away by the offensive foul and you can see ish leet who missed the last game against Cal hes not at 100 hes trying to fight through it for his team however he doesnt have the ability to blow by like he has in the past great job defensively by Blake in the 80s and 90s you can absolutely See Shawn Penn playing Kyle Smith in a movie about his life well Kyle Smith the Pack 12 coach of the year last year led the Cardinal to 25 wins and the NCAA Music tournament aara down the lane and he is fouled Zack Austin didnt believe it but number 55 in white gets the call he wears the number 55 to honor the memory of his mom Cynthia Austin died in 2017 at the age of 55 her son picks up the foul there and Zach going for the block shot doesnt get it picks up the foul there but two blocks away from 200 in his career which puts him in Elite company oh my gosh I mean hes going to become along with Shane Bader the only people with 1200 career points 600 rebounds 175 threepoint shots and 200 blocks came into the game two blocks shy of that which then makes me think in his size and his a ability at 67 210 could he possibly find his way into the league as a three and D type of guy he absolutely could I mean again most likely would have to take the long route Im not sure hell be a draft pick but depending upon his love for the game and how long hes willing to give it an opportunity and a chance as we see ishma leot getting to the bucket absorbing the contact and the n one opportunity getting to the line nice manipulation of the screen and roll action there by legot getting into the painted area and I love the design to bring out against the Zone The Defender out of the middle to set a screen no one available right there in the middle of the painted area against the Zone allowing Lega to get to a sweet spot Cory I would say the ankle looks much better he injured it during the break in practice missed their last game and did have a a wrap of brace on it uh during shoot around earlier today but no brace right now and playing free and loose well Im sure he didnt want to tape for shoot round so had to put that brace on he didnt want to allow Jeff capable to see him without a brace on it last years Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC playing a starring role this year good ball movement to find Aiden camon inside but he had it knocked away yo Diaz Grand back into the game for Pittsburgh his twin brother fires away Jorge is now 10 for 18 from three on the year and Jorge is talking about it on the way back and he checked in already hot Jorge Diaz Graham catching one the kick out no hesitation allowing it to fly was four for four in a game early this year off to a great start here today Music dougy fresh we talked about how pit would guard Ray know they would send different looks at him but you see the rotation to be able to get back and come up with the block shot which turns into a great offensive opportunity for the Panthers but they do not want to allow maxen r no to see the same look over and over again Jeff cable wants to keep him on his heels and keep him off balance got off to a great start making his first five field goal attempts thats more than enough to have in the double team yeah hes got 11 Stanford opened up an 18 to9 lead but Pittsburghs come all the way back while the Cardinal is gone cold Ryan agarwall still looking for his first bucket of the day then the foul is called its going to go against camon good fight inside by leged who gets up smiling with a high five from his teammate Jorge Diaz Grant but camon wanted that to be a tied up jump ball possession and thats what he was looking for as you see the shot go up first off ish lean is an elite rebounding guard but right here this is where camon one of the tied up but that was a great job of officiating right there by Teddy Balaton camon never at one point had both hands on the basketball to force that Arrow possession second foul on the 610 red shirt freshman leg continues to heat up well the second time weve seen him go to that same action to get into the painted area get to the midrange and the short shot but its his ball handling ability of manipulating the screen and roll action that allows him to be successful Pittsburgh has erased the ninepoint deficit led by legats scoring five to shoot Reno says clear out Im going to go to work on guo Diaz Graham and he is still perfect on the night and Diaz Graham has to understand as the shot clock is going down re Reno was simply just getting guys out of his area trying to lull him to sleep to get that three off got to recognize where the shot clock is at that time Crowder hes taken as many as 10 threepoint shots in a game this year he makes him in a good clip lean showing off again the midrange game and he has found the sweet spot right now against this Zone that Stanford has played multiple possessions hes found his way to be able to get to where he wants to go and turn it into points well he was nearly a th point scor in his three years at Rhode Island before transferring last year to pit really blossoming as a score here this year Stanfords going to need agar wall to start making shots out there that was a great Bo box out by cam corn allowing the fastest guy in the league to get out in transition unable to get a bucket right there but jayen low covering a lot of ground as we see Max REO really just waving guys out of the area as a shot clocks going down you know whats going going to happen but on the other end of the floor ishma leer for the third to Fourth straight time getting to the painted area and getting a bucket in the midrange low flashes out wide open three in and Applause Music out under four minutes to go first half oiah sers back in the game feeds inside to Blakes Works along the Baseline and he is fouled by cam Corin and thatll take us to break 352 on the clock all tied at Music 28 passer so knows the league very well a very smart hire by coach Kyle Smith coming into the ACC back home on the farm former Stanford Cardinal himself former head coach at the division one level a tremendous asset for Kyle Smith in his transition held ball to the Chagrin of the folks here at the Peterson Event Center with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman welcome back everybody tied at 28 well take another look here you see now again both hands on the basketball so agrawal does a good job of tying that one up and getting The Possession back I got you I got we see a Zone defensively by the Panthers Applause pit with a takeaway Le it forces the fifth Stanford turnover of the night which twin was going to take that ball well you want Jorge taking it even though Geo has been good as he lines one up unable to knock it down Jorge can get hot in a hurry against VMI was four of four from Beyond The Arc we saw him step into the game here this evening and knocked down his first three so I believe that pass was to Jorge well well they have as most twins do a connection that those of us who are not twins we just cant understand and it translates on the basketball field were not twins you know who is twins Maxim r no and his teammate Jaylen Blakes they call each other twins because do you know Cory I do not know they were born on the exact same day wow guess who else was born on the exact same day uh poor and gear jayen low getting to his spot great footwork able to finish on the turnaround jumper spent some time with Jaylen this summer at the CP3 Camp of course watched him growing up playing for the Houston Hoops back in the day coached by his dad Marlin whos not here whos having to watch what yeah had to go back and Coach his younger child the middle middle child today so I believe he got a big win mom was telling us earlier the score was like 99 to 36 so she said that Mara could have actually stayed but hey mom is here though mom is here jila is in the stands like it Nifty pass received by guo Diaz Grant there it is to his twin brother there it is Im trying to tell you thats the one you want shooting to three great f from guo to Jorge whos able to knock down the corner three ball to push the lead to four for the Panther now guo number 25 is the older and the taller twin and apparently he carries himself as such as the older Applause brother good burst by sers hanging in the air for two you can see sers confidence growing and again as a as a transfer when you come into a new scenario youre not necessarily sure what the coach expects from you but you can see his role growing under coach Kyle Smith and that confidence is growing alongside and that snapped a 7 nothing Pittsburgh run Le uses the screen into the lane even though he knew a 7 foot one shot blocker was between him and the rim it didnt matter but he had a teammate cut to the basket which allowed the shot blocker to have to retreat and gave him enough space to be able to get his shot off I want to say thats probably the fifth Basket in the paint so far for ishma lean well hes got a total of 13 points r no who he shot over leads all scores with 14 here tonight with under a minute to go in the half Pittsburgh the number 13 team in the country by net that is R nos first Miss of the night but you see how jayen low crowded him he didnt allow him to be comfortable in his face low behind the back taken away by Reno Applause sers about a 3se second difference between the two clocks Jeff Cap going to get the timeout to talk it over make sure his team gets the last shot of the half or at least a quality look to end the half as the Panthers have stormed back to take a fivepoint lead here on their home floor Music Applause we got get hey the pit Panthers have turned the Peterson Event Center back into a true home court advantage theyve won 14 in a row their longest streak in years and the twin brothers GMO and Jorge Diaz Graham hooking up repeatedly here in the first half and then of course ishma Lega getting to the midrange and you see as cam corn goes to the basket that forces Reno to retreat allowing Leed to have easy pickings right in the lane so lets see coming out of that timeout watch what coach cable Drew up for the Panthers but you still have the 131 zone now from Stanford so they switched it up also to change the look for the Panthers coming out of the timeout 5 seconds on the shot clock low puts it up and in little shrug of the shoulders and Stanford doesnt get the ball in quickly Blakes heaves it and that is the end of the first half but one thing that Stanford its a small mistake but it cost him a quality look they allowed the basketball to the clock will not stop once the ball goes through the rim off the shot of Jaylen low they allowed about 3 seconds to run off the clock which would have given them an opportunity to get a much better shot at the end of the half Maxim Reno who leads the league in scoring and rebounding has 14 points helped open up a ninepoint lead but is legot and the Panthers of storm back we send it back to the studio to Kevin Connors Im Im going to go as far as I say its pretty good theyre going to win a lot of games best start in eight years for pit 112 overall 20 in League Play they won 14 in a row here at the Pete and their net ranking illustrates that they are number 13 in the country and unlike last year where they didnt make that much hey in the nonconference they did very well in the nonconference against good opponents this year they really did if you excuse the hiccup against Mississippi State in the ACC SEC challenge that a big hiccup that was a huge hiccup but outside of that they have been special lost to Wisconson But A ranked Wisconsin team so youre talking about a panther Squad is one of the very few teams that have a chance of making to the NCAA tournament with an atlarge bid if they dont win the ACC tournament and you look at the wins already for them West Virginia LSU and at Ohio State a big deal winning that game on the road in overtime Stanford comes in 9 and4 overall one one in League Play and again this is the second game of their Eastern Time Zone swing they lost Wednesday at Clemson 8561 in a game that got away from them Kyle Smith and his team came up here to Pittsburgh right after the game and has spent the last two and a half three days here in the steel city had a couple of practices each of the last two days here in this building including a shoot around today I should say as well as a shoot around the way there goes legot again that ankle is no problem tonight but if you go back to something that Jeff capable told us in pregame they want to make sure that Rayo has to defend they want to try to find ways to go at him and you see his his guys is the screener of course often times youll see that switch or in the zone he has a responsibility of trying to keep Leed out the paint and hasnt been able to do so kicked basketball reset the shot clock from 14 to 20 so as you watch on the offensive end of the floor camc corn coming out to get Leed having to switch off forgive me to give Reno having to switch off on the Le thats a mismatch in legs favor when he has the basketball in his hands attacking the seven footer off the bounds R now has the second Defender come sellers pass to nobody Austin able to lay it over the rim for two love the vet move by Austin right there lowered the shoulder to get agawa out of the way and then to go up and get the easy layup and now the Panthers starting to score points off of their defense it was a 10 to four advantage for Stanford the points off turnovers in the first half pit changing things here in the second Music Applause half oh double dribble thought he got away with it for a second you watch Austin off the turnover first hes fastest to the ball but watch him lower the shoulder and not push off if he pushes off his offensive foul but hes allowed to lower that shoulder to create a little separation and then knocks agal out of the way and gets the easy finish yeah Austins every bit of 67 210 lbs a senior from Winston Salem North Carolina that was a confident play by GMO going off the bounce catching it as the defender rotates to him and I love the way all the Panthers waited for each other at half court to gather up you can see the chemistry is flowing in the right direction for the Music Panthers G Mo 7t tall Jorge 611 they are a terrific onew combo for pit theyre absolutely terrific especially when theyre knocking down shots from Beyond the perimeter not the traditional 7 foot guys that play with their back to the basket they have the ability to stretch the floor also play off the bounce but when def C was getting production from both of these twins watch out this pit team can be dangerous the ninth set of Brothers in Pittsburgh basketball program history and they have helped an 110 pit run spanning the two halves they scored the first six points of the second half to open up their largest lead of the night so when you say n set of Brothers do they have to play together that I dont know I dont know if they were all teammates would that make Nelly and Brandon Cummings the 10th set of Brothers that very well could be thats a great point well have to ask Matt the Sid for Pittsburgh about that okay we havent seen much of brand incomings we know his older brother Nelly who played one year here at pit a couple of years ago in the building Blakes gave up the foul and down hard went GMO Diaz Bram hes back up in okay smart foul by Jaylen Blakes however getting back now allowing the momentum to increase with what would have been a dunk I was looking for forward to seeing what G Mo was going to do on this one not going to let that happen yeah but makes a play on the basketball though I mean nothing dirty about that at all heres Jaylen low keeps the dribble calls his own number and I think maybe the defender got a piece of that I believe so I dont think jaylens going to miss one that badly and he definitely reacted as though he would say yes that was a showing it on the this huge Jumbo Tron here at the Peterson Event Center he definitely got a piece thats a block shot by cellers and then the second foul of the night against Maxim Reno what does Stanford need to go to do to get Reno back involved offensively they need his scoring they need his scoring but theyre going to need someone else to make a play because the Panthers are going to load up on R now and force someone else to have to beat them of course we talk about Reno is unable to get that one to go but we talk about Sellers and Blakes both averaging over 14 points per game Blakes over 15 a game and so hes been held in check from an offensive standpoint F committed by Aiden camon red Shar freshman out of Brewster Academy and so ishma legan out of PG County Maryland there you go at the free throw line out of St Johns College High School heres next Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header Clemson hosts Florida State at little John to start us off at two Eastern and then North Carolina and NC State square off at Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech takes on Cal should be another great day of Hoops on the ACC Network Carolina coming off a big win today in South Bend the late fourpoint play by Elliot gdau a threepoint bucket and he was fouled and made the gamewinning free throw as the Tar Heels Come Away with a win but the return of Marcus Burton was a big deal for of course getting him back from noted aim that is huge he had 23 points in just 23 minutes off the bench Rookie of the Year a season ago foul against Corin as Reno will go to the free throw line thats the one thing Jeff capable doesnt want to see he told his team earlier in shoot around today live with the results of Reno if you make him take a tough shot and the left hand jump hook outside the paint thats a considered a tough shot but you dont want to foul him put him at the free throw line because of course the elite score as such you let him see the basketball go through as we see G for the first time in this game didnt play in the first half but now an opportunity off of Coach Kyle Smiths bench to get involved in the action first point in quite a while for maxim R know the accs leading scorer and leading rebounder with a pair of free throws hes got 16 on the night and Benny giler number five in Black defending low out on the floor for the first time as you said CA but I said I said giler I was wrong I couldnt read handwriting on that one I said Geller yeah yeah but its actually Giller thats all right its not but thats all right boy guo Diaz grah along with his brother it up here tonight at the peak yeah theyre having themselves a time here shooting the basketball extremely well this is the Panther team that youre used to seeing here at home on the home floor where they have been just fantastic on the offensive end and now the defense has rat it up the match catch and shoot three by Evan Stinson it goes out of bounds and that takes us to our next media timeout the Panthers scoring 9 16 per game shooting 532 and 40 from three in their last three games at home they look like theyre headed that direction here Music Applause tonight for the game Cory 59 including four out of five to start the second half and they got off to such a slow start only scored 13 points in the first 10 minutes of this game but weve seen them pour on pour it on offensively that was one the concerns of Kyle Smith is how good this team is on the offensive floor especially here on their home court Pitts also controlled the paint out scoring the Cardinal 228 is Pittsburgh big picture this year they better as an offensive team or a defensive team Cory they are much better as a offensive team again the numbers that theyre putting up this year we did not see that from them last year Jeff capable said that theyre still a good defensive team but their offense has taken it to the next level in the lot of that has to do with Jaylen Lows development and his growth as a point guard the way he pushes the pace and gets everyone involved but we could have seen this earlier in his career had not been for really almost like a freak injury to jayen low he was slotted to be the starting point guard last season but dealt with an injury over the summer and got back into it slowly and but as you look at his numbers his first 14 games coming off the bench only 49 points per game but then 19 games is a starter once I believe ish Lega got hurt last year he went into the starting lineup and never came out and of course was a great freshman for this group yeah now leading the ACC as a sophomore and assist per game while also scoring 172 points per as you see his numbers there Le it hes been so good this year and especially here at the Pete hes found a home here in year number two in Oakland Applause hes up to 19 points now as you say Oakland you might have to uh the neighborhood well I know its the neighborhood however weve got a lot of Northern California people watching this game with Stanford of course being in power out there so you got to break that down thats a great Point not talking about the East Bay talking about the neighborhood that the University of Pittsburgh sits here in Pittsburgh and then thats why they call the student section the Oakland Zoo has nothing to do with Oakland California or Oakland Michigan neighborhood here in the Steel City Cardinal Basketball Stanford looking for its second win of the conference season there you see the Tshirt the Oakland Zoo you also see the points in the paint ADV vanage Pittsburgh and a lot of it has to do with ishmail lean 17 points for him and has not made a threepoint field goal I believe all seven of his field goals are in the painted area hes been at Attack Mode getting downhill following The Scouting Report of Coach capable to make sure they attack REO when hes on the defensive end of the floor Benny geler at the point he started the first six games of the year for Stanford now coming off the bench for Kyle Smith heres the starting point guard Corner three missed by Stinson one and done for Stanford here come the Panthers low keeps the dribble lobs for Corin who got tangled up and couldnt go retrieve it geler was given up a lot of size and just held on for dear life yeah giler who started the first six games of the season this year actually had a game where he made six threes for the Cardinal hasnt been getting as much playing time as they went with a bigger lineup to put jayen Blakes at the point guard position but Gil is still a very valuable member of this team Lo says you cant guard me and goes by aara and the foul is called that was really the issue he played early last season but he just didnt have that burst didnt have that first step that you were expecting to see from him and that weve watched from him of course for so long as Jeff capable was recruiting him playing in the Houston Hoops organization playing for his dad Marlin and out of Fort Bend Marshall and it just makes you wonder what could have been with the Panthers if not for that freak injury that if he was what he was in the first half of the Season what he was was in the second half they wouldnt have been even a bubble team well I can tell you as mom jamala looks on I I can tell you who it absolutely worked out for and that would be one Bob Carrington yes who hit the scene with a triple double in his debut only the second ACC player to ever do so the first was Dennis Scott and he never looked back what a terrific oneandone season with pit there the former backourt mates and yes Jaylen got himself his own triple double early this season against VMI back on November 18th and has had two more double digit assist games since then three in total on the season coming into this one 31 assists in his last three games so averaging but 1033 I know youre a Syracuse guy you dont really do the math its not much of your thing but uh Im already on to the next thing all right so there have been six triple doubles in the history of pit basketball we know two of them can you name any of the other four six triple doubles in hit Music basketball nah Im not even going to try I got no clue you sure Im Im Im sure all right break it down for me Keith star twice darell Porter and Ricardo Greer along with bub I would have known Ricardo Greer I didnt know that one I didnt know the other one youre forgiven youre an ACC guy you werent around for the Big East days and the pre Big East days cuz the man you said you hadnt heard of Keith star was back in the 70s long before the Big East you were you were uh you was grown up in the 70s I was just born in the 70s what year were you born about five years before you no sry after you GMO Diaz Graham now a double digits and pit running away with it and youve got to love the production youve gotten from guo Diaz Graham throughout this game hasnt had many double figure games on the season but has one here actually had a double double here at home against West Virginia after taking stitches so maybe you got to punch him in the eye every now and then to get him going or just allow him to run free to the rim get the put back dunk Im sure this gets him going as well but you said earlier you alluded to it they need more than six points a game out of him they really do they need more than six points they need more than six rebounds out of him as he anchors the defense on the interior and youre going to need him to be more aggressive on both ends of the floor for this pit team to see the success that the ACC is expecting of them this year that triple by aara the first Stanford field goal of the second half came nearly seven minutes in Applause geler well G mod Diaz Graham wont get credit for that rebound that was a great find just kante unable to be able to handle it AAR had it knocked out of bounds and its Pittsburgh basketball now interesting to see that again thats a play of course is a point guard the last possession where Jaylen low drops Aon to Papa con k cant handle the basketball who gets that turnover because should be Papa if its a good pass okay its going to be interesting to see I need to make sure to check the box to see ah Papa has one turnover there you go so he got that one cuz Zen low already has four and again thats getting high for him coming into this in the two ACC games 10 assists to seven turnovers which is well below his normal rate akara blocks the Music Applause shot with a burst Anthony Batson draws the foul and hell be at the free throw line in the college football playoffs semifinal thats an amazing stat makes you look back and say is the buy worth it the rest of course definitely did not pan out because of the rust of course this is steelt toown and Im guessing weve lost a viewer or two in the last few minutes because across town the Steelers are playing the Cincinnati Bengals right now over on ESPN and ABC big AFC North match up so Im guessing that there were bunch of folks who uh either went to that game or stayed home to watch that entire game rather than coming here to defeat to watch pit basketball Ive got a lot of friends that are Steelers fans as we see great defense on Jorge Diaz Graham out Beyond The Arc trying to dribble the basketball as the shot clock goes down nice move by leet to get the shot off and he has not been able to miss in this game doing a great job once he got going attacking the basket has not slowed down yet just go get a bucket he is now well perfect inside the threepoint line he is nine for nine pretty effective there yeah and that from a guy who on his home floor thats a great block we talk that should count for the two wow that Austin needed right there you got to let this one fly Zach Austin says give me that gets the stair down and now well shoot a pair of free throws now this we are going to see on Sports Center tonight my friend this is a top 10 play on the defensive end by Zack Austin going up in no taunting just just a little nuds like what are you thinking trying to challenge me at The Rim right now give me that I love it that is that may be number one tonight I have absolutely tuned in watching sports center to see how far up the ladder Zack Austin able to make it on Sports in the top 10 Jeff Cable says Zack Austin is the best athlete he has had in a pit uniform over seven years thats saying a lot cuz theyve had some players here and some guys that can climb the ladder but Zack Austin who has been inserted into the starting lineup after the injury to Dun and of course making coach capable look even more like a genius for doing so you see him at the top of the ACC and block shot leaders from a wing player and so that is his first block of the night the next one will give him 200 career blocks to go along with 175 made threes 600 rebounds and 1200 points that one block should have counted for two Maxim Reno the offensive rebound geler and the ball grabbed by Brandon Cummings thats one of the guys that we didnt even mention we didnt talk about Damen Dunn who was double figure score for this Panthers team for the first five games of the Season injured in the Ohio State game 2 minutes in they get him back in healthy look out I mean this Panther team has a chance to not just be good but possibly win the ACC they could be that good this year itll go the other way to Stanford after the Miss shot by low just about Midway through this second half yeah Damen Dunn averaging 11 points per game he spent four years at Temple last year at Houston he wasnt healthy last year but he has uh been a big Force win healthy this year for the Panthers hes actually averaging 13 points a game only down to 111 because he got hurt 2 minutes into the game against Ohio State see I had two of those games in my career oh you keep track of those points oh yeah yeah well it hurt my average of course you got two games where you score zero there he is you get a chance to see Daman you put him right back into the starting lineup when hes healthy oh no oh no not from what Zach Austins been able to do but you also look at how the team is playing during the stretch when hes available hes actually getting back on the floor starting to do some working out was in the warmups for the team today for the first time hes not ready to play yet but had surgery on that thumb and theyre expecting to have him back within the next few weeks to add to the depth to come off the bench at least immediately I mean you know from in the in early parts of his return then I think you make a determination of whether youre a better team with him on the floor to start or if its Zach Austin staying out there in the starting lineup so a big game coming up Tuesday at Cameron indor on ESPN they will measure themselves against clearly the team to beat in the FCC and you have to remember a season ago Duke came into this building and shot lights out against the Panthers and blowing them out on the home floor less than 10 days later pit went to camon door and beat the Blue Devils on their home floor of course which nothing makes coach cable even happier than getting a win at his alamada two on the shot clock no trouble for shisa mpar the junr from Bronxville New York back to the Panthers SP m is Leed in the midst of his fifth 20point game this season throws it away geler blocked by Applause leet itll be Stanford basketball underneath and legot who had the turnover getting back defensively blocking the shot by giler but immediately having the conversation with Cam Corin about why the turnover happened legot goes in at the point guard position with low on the bench Batson missed the shot an offensive foul says Teddy Valentine a trip against the shooter Anthony Batson Applause Jr Z TV still getting it done 10 final fours 11 final fours I mean you know best of the best hes one of the best in the business you consider Teddy Valentine the ability to stay in shape not far from home grew up in West Virginia so this is more like a home game for TV Teddy although hes a South kinian now yes hold that he he much prefer he flew south for the winter and stay no Applause doubt a rare Miss for guo Diaz Graham he knew that was off he started chasing it as soon as it left his hand now you told me youre not supposed to chase your own shot no but again not when you think its going in oh now you put that caveat on well I mean again I mean he knew he missed that one bad thats why thats why he was no he dont follow the shot go get it they taught you that in the 60s when you were born and it led to winning basketball Music Cory car fighting hard for position corins going to be called for the foul okay we all know the game they play on TNT weather guy Charles Barkley who he play for who he play for you and I have not played our favorite version of that in a couple of years but I want to play it tonight okay who you play with for Cory Alexander we have done that often though but we havent done it lately and with the new teams in the league I think its worth revisiting who did you play for or play with during your days in the NBA out of these two school so from between 1995 or 1985 how old are you no 95 to 05 from Stanford and from Pittsburgh who were your NBA teammates well Pittsburgh easy my man flew at AKA Charles Smith won the best to play for the Panthers so thats easy um Stanford whenever you think of Stanford you got to think about who were the Smart Guys on you werent hang your team oh man Im trying to think and Im going to be mad when you say this cuz Im sure h who did I play with from Stanford I give you a minute to think about it yeah start giving you clue thats going to take thats going to take some time is is is the Cardinal try to fight back into this one now down 15 after made free throws and trying to find a way to build some momentum here a little over8 minutes remaining Corin strong and theres a reverse hes making sure hes getting out of the sports center top 10 yeah if you can double the plays up I absolutely believe he will be at number one today Zack Austin with his second highlight this one on the offensive end second huge smile as well he knew he had a good one there foul against GMO Diaz Graham well Zach Austin highlight so nice we got to show him twice we showed the block twice I hope we have two different views of the reverse putback by Austin an absolutely great shout out to the camera crew to our production crew for making it come through with our Sport Center top 10 Music nominee back to our trivia question who he play with Cory played in the NBA for the Spurs the nuggets the magic the Bobcats from 95 to 05 and you got correct the one former Panther you teamed up with in the league Charles Smith during your days with the Spurs but you didnt get I did get it the former Cardinal not while we were on air I didnt get it while we were on a took a while it took a while but I did get it and you didnt tell me but all I really need to do was look up because of course the answer to the question is brevan Knight the older brother of Brandon Knight whose jersey hangs right beside Charles Smiths so I should have just looked up for the answer you should have but it it took me a little longer but you didnt tell me I got it correct that was right I was going to give you a clue if you didnt come up with it Corin putting together a nice game for Pittsburgh but uh brevan really was a Lynch pin for the Stanford program helping Coach Montgomery get it going talking with their radio announcers earlier today John plot said that he was the guy that changed everything for Stanford basketball he said brevan Knight was the reason why they were able to get the Lopez twins the way reason they were able to get Josh chers other guys coming in that end up being NBA players and able to be able to boost that the program in the right direction under coach Mike Montgomery back in the day and you played with him with the old Charlotte Bobcats with the with the inaugural year of the Bobcats in Charlotte where my assistant coach was won Jeff capable the second oh how about that how about that how about that the father of the head coach of the pit Panthers of course this basketball world is a very small world of course we Miss coach Cape every day Mama Cape I know is home watching her baby boy who does so much for the ALS Foundation where we lost coach capable to ALS of course it was his father who gave Jeff III his first coaching job even though apparently from what Jeff was saying today he wasnt even sure his dad knew what was going on in terms of all the responsibility Jeff III took on with Old Dominion and kind of morphed into being on the coaching mhm then went on soon after to be a third assistant oh the nice pass from ishma leet as G Mo Diaz Graham gets out in transition I tell you what the Panthers have provided a number of highlights throughout this game they may have their own section of sports center top 10 tonight aara with the answer three at the other end aaro has been a strong has had strong performance here in the second half hes given coach Smith quality minutes hes been in and out of the starting lineup but giving him great production here hes really been the only guy get anything going offensively for the Cardinal here in the second half as you can see 14 points meanwhile Ray no has 21 eighth time this year hes gone over 20 for Stanford Jaylen low with the three ball as coach calls timeout and its looking like its going to be the ninth time this year that the Panthers go over 80 in a game and we have to remember the first 10 minutes of this game they only scored 13 points they got off to a very slow start but they have gotten it going here the Nifty drop off from ishma Lega to Gamo Diaz Graham getting out in transition the finish another entry into the sports center top 10 nominees tonight well pit has been a second half team so far this year putting together a big second half here tonight to pull away they didnt have to Rally in the second half but they were down nine in the first half they did have to Rally early in this move on they once they got the offense going it got going in spectacular fashion and this is the guy that they were able to get going behind ishma Leed provided the scoring punch in the first half getting into the pain in Area 13 first half points for him and now everyone has gotten involved on the offensive end here in the second half pitch seven of 18 from Beyond the threepoint Arc but shooting over 50 throughout the entire game and we were talking about Jeff cable III and his his father one of the things he got from his dad and I mentioned earlier tonight no excuses figure it out and thats exactly what hes been able to do here at Pittsburgh I tell you what youre talking about Jeff C the second a gentleman that changed so many lives not just his two sons but was a father to so many especially in the game of basketball you go back to the great Daryl Armstrong who played for him at fville State and again so many different people who looked to him as a mentor including me so of course Coach K wanted the best to ever do it Austin was foul and Jeff II I just love the looks on the two sons faces heres the best part about this Jason maybe was like 12 in this picture Jeff Jeff would come on his visit to the University of Virginia of course I was his primary recruiter by the way was Jeff on his tiptoes there oh he hes definitely yeah well Jason wasnt full grown at that point that thats what it was but we would try to Jeff would be on his on his visit or unofficial visit coming in of course his father you know Jeff II was great friends with Dennis wolf one of our assistant coaches so they would come up all the time and Jason would want to go out with us so I can take Jeff out but Jason is like 12 12 years old 13 years old he wants to go but hes so tall that everybody thinks that you know hes our age but so when I said that hes probably like 13 years old in that pitcher he was taller than Jeff I think at that age there it is thats block number 200 for Zach Austin for his career at High Point University in the last two years at pit now 200 career block shots got a foul on the dunk attemp that will send Jaylen Blakes to the line when you know a number coming into the game of course its going to be a highlight whenever you get it his first block was much more spectacular but this one puts him in history 200 blocks and you ran down the numbers before very elite company that hes in from the Milestones that he achieved during his college career move over Duke great Shane Bader you now have company in the exclusive 1200 Point 600 rebound 175 threes and now 200 block shot club and with that number 55 will take a seat and get a nice round of applause here at the pce and guess where his next game is oh at Cameron how about that at Cameron under 5 minutes to go and the Panthers on the verge of extending their home court winning streak to 15 in a row the Maestro continues to do everything right jayen low all the way to the basket for a 21point lead and he really has taken Comm man of this team from a leadership role at the point guard position of course share those responsibility from with lottery pick B Carrington a season ago now he is the guy at the point and you can see the way that this team gravitates towards him but when you consider the fact that youve got Damen Dunn returning at some point soon what Cummings has been able to do during his freshman year this pit team could very well have the best back court in the ACC Jaylen Thompson off the Stanford bench with his first three hsel delich into the game for Pittsburgh for the first time number 52 shot clock at two that did graze the iron for Papa amadu K But Here Come the Cardinal the other way if he had made that shot from falling down and catching it on his seat standing up and shooting it that would have been a sports in a top 10 nominee as well so youve got what four now Ive got three three and that would have been the fourth Stinson draws the contact and the foul against delich the Panthers have been celebrating ever since the 10minute Mark of this game I love the cohesiveness the chemistry that this Panther team has the unquestioned best team in the AC between Clemson and pit who would you put two and three right now oh I would put them tied for a second oh thats a cop out no its not because as coach Greenberg just said R Brownell is one of the most disrespected coach coaches in the country he has been great throughout his tenure at Clemson gets probably done more with less than any coach that youll see but what Jeff capable has been able to do over the last three seasons and the way that Pittsburgh has changed things on the offensive end the floor makes them special now we know theyre always going to compete on the defensive end but right now the way theyre scoring and getting after it according to the the net top 50 pit would be two and Clemson would actually be four four in that scenario with SMU at 32 but we of course we know that that doesnt means anything because its kept my Panthers out of the NCA tournament delit with with his first points of the night yeah the net is just one of the tools used to determine the field of 68 and Im trying to figure out why its just one when you consider that its the ncaas measuring stick so why dont they use that to help that I dont have an answer for delich off the turnover his teammate flared to the corner yeah he was expecting a three on two to the rim actually Diaz grah ran to the corner waiting for the three ball Jaylen Blakes who has had a quiet night scoring the basketball here tonight makes it 7661 245 to go Cummings tough shot and Brandon Cummings is shown that he can score the basketball name Brandon is spelled the same way as Brandon Knight as we mentioned whose jersey hangs in the rapor we were told that the spelling of Brandon Is name has something to do with Brandon Cummings however his mom named Brandy so it made it very simple to be able to use that yeah Im guessing its more mom you think its more mom got to be mom named him okay so uh her name is b r n d her sons name her younger sons name is b r a n d i n usually Brandon is with an o or an e under two minutes to go Pap amadu K earns a trip to the free throw line theres Dad checking out the action here of course has to be a huge Panther fan being that hes not had two sons playing here for the P we see Nelly who had opportunity to call a game here on acc Network extra when his little brother went for 30 had a 30 ball so got a great opportunity to see those two together in a postgame interview where Brandon got to go over and sit with his brother talk it up about his career high during his freshman year that was back on December 11th after the Eastern Kentucky game with little brother went for 30 earned ACC rookie of the week its the third most points ever by a pit freshman so this young man has a world of potential was a starter the last game out against Cal had 15 points in that game with ishma Legas sideline with the ankle injury and hes just the latest Panther to be lighting it up I mean those last three games including that start he was 10 15 from three but thats why we talk about the ability for this team to have the best back court in the ACC when you consider both their starting backb members average combined 35 points per game with Lega and low but then when you bring in Cummings and you get Damen done back in the mix you know I I will I would absolutely have to say it would be pit and North Carolina right at the top of the list Marlon Barnes Jr Richard freshman for pit into the game called for traveling and so its Stanford basketball speaking of back court how about Jeff K Curtis aens right behind them those two guys would be a bad back court together great pit pan who has been on the radio call as an analyst for many many years pride of Buffalo New York Curtis a and the Cummings boys played aaou ball for him here in the city of Pittsburgh and played here in this building while they were growing up about 45 minutes away from here in Midland Pennsylvania like you said this sport of basketball not all that big get a chance to see kurur always Sharp Dressed Man over on the sidelines yep he comes to games like that though I mean hes shooter around everything hes dressed up you know Im Im very rag tag yeah youre a little more casual you havent tucked in your shirt since the pandemic they can only see from the from the chest up Ill tell you what Jeff cable has himself another team thats going to be tough to deal with whether at the Pete or on the road for this ACC season on the verge of their 15th straight wi it home its been more than a decade since theyve done that and it feels like hes getting things back to the Jamie Dixon year yeah and dating back to last season youre talking about now this will be the eighth straight ACC win so regular season of course they lost in the ACC tournament but when you consider the regular season won their last five a season to go now off to a three and0 start here in a minute and 16 seconds the you love to see the starters getting an opportunity to watch some of the reserves and even some of the walk ons Etc get opportunity to play but a big test coming up for the Panthers on the road on Tuesday night Pap amadu con who weve not seen a lot of tonight brings a physicality to the team good hes healthy this year and he was huge in the win against Ohio State back on November 29th a careerhigh 12 points and 17 minutes off the bench against the Buckey before he filed out and again a game that went to overtime and the Panthers end up winning by one in overtime so everyones contribution was necessary in that one especially when you lose Damien Dunn two minutes into that game everybodys contributed tonight for the Panthers on the verge of their 12th win of the season and the ninth straight game over 80 points here on this floor for the Panthers who got their offense going in the latter 30 of this game Off the Bench shooting it is Cameron Grant the red shirt freshman from Lakewood Ohio whose father Chris Grant is a longtime NBA executive and Scout former GM of the Cleveland Cavaliers and just as soon as were done here well get you to Cal Clemson Brandon Cummings Banks it home Cummings is Crafty you can see that right now just going off the wrong leg but recognizing the angle and going glass to be able to get a bucket in the Music paint and so Batson will have two free throws freshman from Scott sdale Arizona who originally committed to rice and then wound up flipping to Stanford one of the many newcomers for Kyle Smith who has jelled well this year with a 9 and4 record currently and another young man coming from one great academic institution to another once again you transferring to Stanford you better be coming from an elite level academic school and you had to have done very well to get there speaking of done very well these Pittsburgh Panthers have done very well in front of their home crowd here tonight to get up to a three and0 start in ACC play huge test in Durham Jeff cable going back home to Cameron Indoor Stadium coming up on Tuesday night on ESPN got to have a shot clock violation and did you notice Brandon Cummings got rid of the basketball before the horn oh you dont want that turnover got it thats got to be a team turnover not the individual crafty half a second will take off and that is the longest homecourt winning streak since 2012 here at pit and Jeff cable has something special happening with this pit
