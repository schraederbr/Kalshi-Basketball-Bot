tonight NORAD omir back in the lineup for Miami after an ankle kept him out of Saturdays loss in Syracuse omir looked good this afternoon it shoot around didnt seem to have any ill effects and so they are so happy to have him back in white here tonight oh youre absolutely happy to have one of the best players in the ACC back into the fold Miami missed him significantly and their lost at Syracuse on Saturday who told you they wearing green tonight hey you did and look at that from the beginning omir stepping out knocking down the three ball its different when youve got a guard a guy that has the range playing the five position just his ninth made three this season theres Burton and kesn the two locals in the back court for Notre Dame Booth Davis and ji round out the starting five for Micah Shrewsberry Club first time theyve had the students since December theyre just off a break in the stands and the first time in the Michael Shrewsberry era as we see my young fella Booth knocking down to the three Applause ball well he has started the last eight games Carri Boo has the first three for the Irish as you see the Hurricanes starting five and in talking with Jim Lara earlier today they are finally getting much closer to healthy they went 19 straight practices from the middle of December until Monday without having all of their starters omir back in the lineup now with five quick points but in terms of continuity Cory how do you work on things when youre missing one and two and three players every single day you cant thats the reason why the hurricanes have lost four out of their last five games they have had no continuity and thats really what hampered coach l a couple seasons ago when they struggled an ACC play was the injuries but hopefully as they get back healthy they can start to pick up that momentum we saw from this team as they marked to the final four a season too and now thats not to say each of these players is fully healthy but there is what has happened in recent weeks losing four of those five the only Victory coming in blackburg 7571 over the hokes Jr kesn he has delivered now in his third year playing for his hometown school and this is a different Notre Dame team in this building they shoot the basketball much better on their home floor and you can see how comfortable they are against a Miami team that is struggled defensively all season long Nigel pack off the bounce hit the front rim Burton has it poked Away by Matthew Cleveland Here Comes kesan going end to end laying it in we talk about freshman guards when you we got to mention Burton at the top of the list along with Bob Carrington but keishan George he has been spectacular this year for Miami its really interesting sometimes in recruiting Cory as you know you have to get a little bit lucky and that is what coach Larona has done with his staff with Kean George they never saw him in person before signing him play basketball they had gotten a tip from our own Jonathan javone from ESPN saying hey theres a kid here playing high school ball in France you need to check out they repeatedly tried to convince him to come to the States but the professional team he was playing for didnt want him to because well Miami was a competitor for his Services finally got him to come over 13 months ago and they really were the only ones involved LSU tried to get in the mix couple other schools but at that time cor he was 65 when he showed up on campus he was 68 yeah and he has just grown not only physically but also in his game as of late many MBA Personnel very interested in George because of his ability to play the point guard position at 68 Tay Davis the sophomore from Indianapolis has his first two 87 Notre Dame and when this when you look at this Miami Lineup and you look at the George is actually the tallest player on the floor in their starting lineup and hes primarily their ball handler wer popper off the bounce told us this afternoon hes back to about 85 with that ankle no he told you he was 85 he told me he was 80 about 15 minutes ago so Im going to go with 825 on wer right now but we know hes not 100 but still nice on the pull up jumper fou inside as they got the ball to Kevin ji and ji heads to the bench after a time out our first Dame 6249 transition defense was an issue that night for the Fighting Irish something theyre hoping to shore up tonight well and you think about this game the fighting hours actually held Miami who averages over 80 points per game to 62 and a win so the defense did their job however the offense could not show up on the road Michael Shrewsberry happy with the way his team has gotten started off here shooting the basketball however Miami is still holding a onepoint lead well Cory you alluded to it when we went on the air that this is really a contrast in Styles a Miami team that is predicated on great offense against a Notre Dame team that has established itself under first your head coach Mike Shrewsberry as a good defensive team and this is a game where both coaches need to see progression from their teams coach larena as they start to get healthy needs to see his Miami team be better defensively he knows they can score but they cant win if they cant stop their opponent on the other side Michel sh is very happy to be home where his team is a much better offensive team than he sees from them on the road which of those two things is more correctable honestly I believe its more correctable for Coach Lara and his teams defense Jim Lena has been a great defensive coach his entire career his Personnel right now is not geared toward being great Defenders however his scheming can be and I think as they continue to buy in they can become a better defensive team especially for a veteran group that they had well at this end Miami is averaging over 82 points per game second behind Carolina in the ACC Matthew Cleveland from the foul line gets the Music bounce and he was really good in that game back in early December with 14 points four Steels in the win over Notre Dame this is the first time the Irish have played a team a second time this season and you mentioned Matthew Cleveland hes really been the constant this season for Miami import transferring in from the Rival Florida State hes been the one guy thats been available and productive each and every time out Burton with a shot clock down gets rid of it who has to put it up didnt hit the iron so its a shot clock violation you see the entire Miami bench and staff up applauding their team from a great job defensively you look at Kean George doing a great job moving his feet thats 68 guarding Burton who give him a generous 6 foot well they list 511 oh okay you know what I love the honesty 511 166 for a young man who whose High School is 8 miles from here grew up Roo for the Irish and said it was a dream come true when he got that scholarship offer quick start for omir hes got seven to lead all scores and the Irish have been successful with guys who are really from the area a lot Demetrius Jackson you talk about Blake Wesley Jr keski so theyve got a number of guys who have grown up playing in the area and fans of the Irish who have signed up and Burton actually signed with the previous coaching regime with Mike Bray and you know how that goes youve got when youre the new coach you got to come in and rerecruit everybody on the roster but it was really an easy sell for michah Shrewsberry because his son braad who weve seen come off the bench is tight with Marcus and they were texting throughout the entire hiring process and again Marcus Burton had his sight set on wearing the usually blue and gold of Notre Dame tonight wearing the green but he wanted to come here and play for Notre Dame and I love the decision one because hes been able to play for his dream school but its been beneficial for Burton as well youre talking about 163 points per game and he continues to become a even better point guard as the season has gone along desan George no J the rebound here comes the coachs son Braden Shrewsberry Applause long rebound picked up by George defense gets back and then weve got omir hitting the deck he and Burton collided no that wasnt a cide roer was actually pointing to Burton to pick up over here so Burton picks him up and Chucks him as he comes down now mind you theres a significant size differential between these two guys that was simply omir not expecting to be hit that was a normal play in the 90s you just stand somebody up it that was a collision though no it wasnt of course it was a collision is when two guys collided to each other that was Burton laying the blow on that one did you so if I if after the game I take my car and RAM your car if youre not moving thats not a collision well you talking about cars two completely different things youre talking car its a collision no its not a collision a collision is when two things run into each other well yeah they dont have to both be moving well but it normally happens when thats the case no its a collision a single car accident if if you go and thats one person responsible thats you one person is responsible for this its Burton boom he lays the boom right there on nor Chad omir showing that Hey listen I might be smaller in stature but Im super tough this is not a collision yes it is no I wasnt talking about responsibil expecting that I so what I wasnt talking about responsib ility it was a collision you know good thing youre you youre good at what you do and you went to new house in Syracuse for this because Im sure your vocabulary is not your strength were going to look up Collision lets do it after the official review one non basketball accessive unnecessary so its going to be upgraded to a flagrant one simply because the cont attack was deemed unnecessary thank you to our great official Kip kiss are coming over and letting us know identifying our group today Ron grber Bert Smith and Kip kisser great group on the call today all right Collision an instance of one moving object or person striking violently against another no mention that both have to be moving okay one moving object what was the moving object the man at the free throw line right right the other was not right it doesnt say both need to be moving you know what dont desp my vocabulary Im going to let this go because we got a great start to a game we will pick this up later however Miami with those free throws from omir able to stretch it out to a 14point a fourpoint lead and omir actually did not play at Syracuse so that graphic we had up there isnt correct his last game was a 1515 rebound performance but that was not at Syracuse that was a game that he missed wga popler with the jump shot the Junior from North Philadelphia has four points 1323 remaining here in the first half Logan Imes has come off the bench for Notre Dame Davis with a shot clock down to five gives it up roer attacks nice pump fake by rer attacking Baseline seeing Cleveland coming over the the pump bake gets him in the air and gets the easy to after starting in the Syracuse game the freshman Michael noo back coming off the bench with omir returning to the lineup off the turnover Davis missed the layup out of bounds and itll stay at this end now if coming into this season someone want to have told you that you were going to do a Miami coach by Jim Lena and a notame game coach by Michael shuberry and you are going to see the 14th and 15th worst teams in the ACC of handling the basketball meaning they had the highest turnover amount would you have expected that certainly not from Miami you know with the Freshman point guard Marcus Burton turnovers have been a problem this year so I guess thats not terribly surprising but in terms of Miami absolutely well when you think about Burton hes actually had a positive assisted turnover ratio in ACC play but hes the only one outside of Matt Zona and IM who have a positive assisted turnover ratio for the entire Fighting Irish team so were always going to blame it on the Freshman point guard I take up for them because I was one of those at one point but its been pretty much everyone for the fighting hours that have not handled the basketball well this season well I uh talked to the coaching staff about his usage rate and its a lot they have put on the young mans shoulders and hes of course going to say give me more I want more minutes I want more opportunities and theyre hoping that he learns from it it seems like he has as you pointed out Cory that as the season has gone on its been less of an issue and a turnover turning into a three for Davis on the other night backto back turnovers for wer popper on the offensive End by the way that was just the fourth made three of the season for Tay Davis but he shot it confidently 1814 Miami with a fourpoint lead Under 12 to go here in the first Music half matona Applause Nowa sets the Music screen shb has it poked Away by popler out of bounds and itll stay at this end with 46 on the shot clock as we head to break well one thing Miami can do to avoid turnover get the basketball in the hands of Nigel pack and just let him know go get a bucket we need one because he is is more than Music capable true story when Big Blue Nation rolls in its time to dial up the hws number six Kentucky Total Domination by Kentucky takes on Arkansas wow what a play experienced number six Kentucky Arkansas Saturday at 6 on ESPN looking forward to that one this weekend we are at Notre day Miami Miami in town 1814 KES on top with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman shot clock down under three as Shrewsberry puts it out and the follow Slam by Tay Davis and Tay Davis I believe got away with one that looked like it was still above the cylinder Shrewsberry may have been wanting that extra point on that one and by the way during that break they took a point away because Tay Daviss Corner jump shot was a two not a three a couple of minutes ago how about n shadow came in having made just eight threepointers All Season hes got two in the first N9 minutes and 11 points for him already in this one after missing the game on Saturday at Syracuse he has had a positive impact getting back into the lineup Burton puts it out and in first three points for the Freshman out of nearby pen High School impressive young player played for my guys of course the irvan family out of the M irvan fire oh North Shadow mirs got to take that one hes already hot Doug you fresh turn down a three I dont understand Turn Down for Music Applause What Here Comes Burton off the turn Applause over this is the pace Miami would prefer up and down as opposed to Notre Dame trying to make it a half court gain Music Nigel Pat boy he has range for days during shooter around today he stood by the p on the floor in first cell Pavilion the first p and made six consecutive threepoint shots not far from where he launched this one Nigel pack is not a good shooter he is an elite shooter you see the crossover bringing it right to left and then still the ability to get on balance squared up and knock it down from well beyond NBA 3 threepoint range a season too here ersel Pavilion had 21 points five of eight from three for Nigel Pat so hes very comfortable shooting I wont just say in this building but anywhere well this is the homecoming for the young man out of Lawrence Central High School in Indianapolis couple hours from here he says hes got about a dozen friends and family members whove made the drive up and he was so good in his game here last year on the road foul drawn by Marcus Burton who will head to the line to shoot two and yes they are wearing green this is Irish wear green night a green out where with the students back in the building for the first time since their winter break they encouraged everybody to wear green and so Burton now will go to the line Mr your basketball in the state of Indiana last year which really really means something Cory and surpassed our guy lonso Ellis for the highest scoring debut to start a notame career as a freshman Bond been for 27 in his first game in 88 bman for 29 to start the season off this year so thats Elite level scoring from The Young fell shout out though to our guy fans watching his Alma moer tonight Burton with a pair of free throws tell pwns to come get Digger hes been over here bothering us all day big night for Digger hes going to get a microphone at halftime because they are recognizing the 50year anniversary of the big upset over UCLA to stop the record winning streak at 88 in a row it was almost to the day 50 years ago in this building and Digger came over and went play bypl with you earlier as to how he out coached John Wood throughout that game I asked him whats the One Singular thing you remember and he gave you 30 playby playay for the last four minutes of the Applause game pack the Defenders left him to shoot and thats a mistake soft touch for an Nigel pack and we see benley Joseph whos now coming off the bench Jim Lara making the change to hit a bigger starting lineup and putting George in the starting lineup alongside pack but benley Joseph provides the defensive spark for the canes once he steps into the game Davis puts it on the deck goes to the right hand missed it Here Comes Miami four on two Cleveland running the break and hes out of bounds the ball landed in his lap while he was sitting on the Music Baseline well have the womens basketball matchup of the night tomorrow at 8 Eastern 5 Pacific on ESPN and the app the only undefeated team in the nation number one South Carolina takes on Angel Reese and number n LSU at the marovic center in Baton Rouge the college game day crew tips off our coverage at 7 Eastern I am locked in my little sis Andrea going to be on the college game day set my big sis da Staley on the sidelines its going to be rocking in Bat r k KES that is misses from three 8 minutes remaining in the first half Miami trying to build on its fivepoint lead George from the corner offensive rebound however after grabbing it Christian Watson landed out of bounds and so itll be Notre Dame basketball when we come back the Hurricanes up five on the fighting 1000 career rebounds but Cory hes not so much known for his threepoint shooting that we have seen tonight yeah hes shown off his shooting touch and this is a young man that can do a lot of things he can put the basketball on the floor attack the basket we know hes an elite rebounder but hes also capable of starting to break and when Miami was playing their best a season ago on their way to the final four nor shadir would may have been their best player even though Isaiah Wong was the AC Player of the Year and Jordan Miller was playing great basketball this may have been their most valuable player of season too and hes going to have to be that this year if they want to continue to improve averaging 172 points thats seventh in the ACC and number two in rebounding behind only Armando vott of North Carolina Cleveland with a rebound dribbles up Cleveland a little gimpy coming away favoring something right now got to keep an eye on that you can see on the bottom of your screen now Bert Jones the or Bert Smith rather the official stopping play as Cleveland goes down saw Cleveland rebound the basketball break away from the crowd and immediately gave the basketball up yeah I didnt see anything that seemed out of ordinary yeah youll see him grab the rebound and he Sprints out which he often does trying to push the break but then immediately just throws the ball ahead to kesan George and you see him walk away from that gimpy as he limps off the floor now not sure what it was but again were talking about a Miami team that is just now trying to get healthy and Matthew Cleveland whos been the one constant this year I was afraid when you said that you were jinxing him and I think Oh No Such Thing from me rolls reversed you absolutely would have thrown me out of the B absolutely you know me so well Marcus Burton shot clock again down to 10 Shrewsberry has been shooting well last couple of weeks cant get a shot off now its up to Burton to create no problem for number three in green he is absolutely capable upgrading and show his ability to be able to get his shots off over much bigger Defenders still not deterred by Watson in front of him well when you talk about great freshman years in Notre Dame program history Adrien Dantley Troy Murphy David rivers of course our guy fans Burton is in the midst of putting his name in that same category and you cannot forget Chris Thomas who was Elite as a freshman for the Fighting Irish but Burton continues to improve impr as the season goes along you see the Improvement in his assisted turnover ratio but he has been a knockdown scorer since the beginning pack uses the screen from omir cant get the roll kzn with the rebound thats how he got himself into the starting lineup this year rebounding so well Off the Bench to begin the year he was open in the corner Irish didnt see him nice kick out now Shrewsberry gives it to him for the corner three they eventually got it there just couldnt get theot shot to fall but a number of good looks and its been a good offensive first half for Notre Dame thus far 24 points them still 6 minutes remaining and theyve been able to knock down that threes omir one on one and he throws it down I think hes okay wow whatever the lower leg issue was I believe hes feeling better about things thats the first time Ive seen that from North shadir in the two years that weve had him in the ACC 13 points now going for the steal and here comes another Throwdown for number Applause 15 well nor Chad oir led the Miami Hurricanes to the final four a season to go hes watched his team lose four out of their last five games and he is intent on doing something about that and he has done just that on the last two plays back to back take a look at this and think about sports center tonight it should make its way out of the top 10 it absolutely should and weve seen a lot from North chadow yet this is the first time I believe weve seen this going to the basket mono imano and just manhandling a Defender putting them in the rim wow second in the conference at 62 field goal shooting by Lin Kidd and you can see why when he shoots it that efficiently hes off to a quick start here tonight with 15 points to lead all scores kesn over omir great response out of the timeout and a nice cut by kesn to be able to find the open spot instead of waiting out beyond the threepoint line cutting to the Bas getting the easy layup yeah before that Cory the Irish had missed nine of its last 10 shots coming out of the timeout they get a good look not as good as that one third straight dunk for n Chad omir and a beautiful find from George off the screen and roll action never the ball never touches his left hand immed ly dropping the dime with all in the right 440 to go first half Irish with the basketball down by six Burton lines it up thats just too much space barries another one hes got 11 points you cannot give him that much space especially here in this building he is confident at Applause home only 30 on the year for Burton but you think hes a much better shooter than that he absolutely is and he shoots 44 here in this building George got a hand on it kesn comes up with it pull up Im getting in my bag right now douge fresh there it is I told you thats okay heat check you can miss that one thats all right Im sure Michael sh has no problem with that you know who the only ACC player is this year who has taken more shots from the floor than Marcus Burton the guy who will be the ACC player of the year if we had to CED up today that would be RJ Davis whos the accs leading score coming into the year did you think Burton would have that kind of volume traveling violation well well talk more about Mr Burton when we come back Irish down three to The KES but nor Chad oir has had three consecutive dunks the beautiful find from Kean George but on the other end Marcus Burton is ready to duel knocks down another three for the Irish have much more on the breaking news regarding the future of Jim Harbaugh plus well chat with North Carolina Superstar Armando bot dug quick into the point coming up when you join us at the Music half thank you guys Im Im Im a little disappointed I didnt hear from my guy coach Greenberg he had nothing to say maybe hes getting some D before halftime no hes not cuz Josh passs there and Josh eats very healthy so Seth doesnt eat the same Ive been in studio with those guys we dont they dont eat dont get to eat the same when Josh is there hes a a very healthy guy yeah I dont have a good answer for you qu Im a little disappointed in coach Greenberg ask looking forward to hearing from him during those breakings well good to see Matthew Cleveland back on the floor for Miami well see if hes able to play as he has there he gets a chance for the rebound but he goes out of bounds he still does not to me see right hes got a little bit of a liy still yes he does and he wasnt the intended to on the bench when he went to sit down so apparently whatever was ailing him is nothing that is going to be able to do further damage to hes back out on the floor well thankfully the ca Jinx was only temporary oh dont put that on me there he is getting another rebound he says rebounding is the easiest thing for and again hes saying please take me out of the game he just cant get up the court it is Music weird yeah when he came out of the timeout I was looking at him and and watching him talk to the officials and I said hes not okay I dont know why hes going back out there at this moment but whatever it is you see him get a rebound and hes hes not pushing the basketball but just trying to give up and down the floor immediately looks over to the bench and says get someone in for Applause Music me Burton with the Applause takeaway under 3 minutes and the half Applause with room to operate going to the left hand J missed it but Notre Dame keeps Applause Music Applause it six to shoot Roper from long range good box out by George Applause Bensley Joseph thought about it had it poked away from behind by Burton whos got the basketball absorb the contact no call play continues kanes with the advantage five on four pack tries to shovel it to omir taken away by Notre Dame this has been the Achilles heel of both of these teams throughout this season turnovers now eight turnovers for the hurricanes in this first half kans up three chance to tie for Notre Dame not off of the turnover though benley Joseph right to the rim and the natural South ball leaves it in and a smart play by Bley Joseph not trying to overpass with that possession just getting to the rim going over top of a smaller Burton to be able to get the two for the ks back in 30 seconds Music coming up at 930 Eastern 630 Pacific over on ESPN Victor wanyama and the Spurs host SGA and OKC SGA MVP uh at this point I would say no Im going to go with the guy that drops Music 70 a couple of nights ago Joel embiid in my opinion is the MVP hes been the best player in the NBA this year no more evidence than that in the 7 Point performance in a win on Monday night SGA definitely first team like he was a season ago though saw Cleveland treating himself something on that right Applause Music Applause th B looked like pack got a piece of it yeah pack did a great job and the one of the reasons why like playing against himself right there Nigel pack Marcus B very similar in their ability to attack off the bals omir thought about poising another three instead he drives to the bucket count it and one and comparison to returning down the threepoint look he goes and attempts to get the three the hard way gadir able to play off the bouns his ability to handle the basketball especially through traffic take the contact and finish opportunity for threepoint play at the free throw line well he is on Pace certainly for a new career high which came at his last stop at Arkansas State 35 points as a sophomore against Louisiana Monroe that is 20 as omir takes a seat and omir asked out after making the free throw he looked at the bench and asked for them to get him out of the game maybe just fatigue we have to we did mention the fact that he did not play last time out and anytime you have an injury of course youre not practicing you can lose some condition ninth time hes reached 20 this season his season high was 27 George to the corner wide open benley Joseph for three nice drive and kick by George on that one a great look for Joseph just unable to knock it down Braden Shrewsberry with the ball last four games hes been averaging over 14 per but he has yet to score tonight for Notre Dame and hes gotten good looks in this one just unable to knock him down but he does the majority of his damage from Beyond the threepoint Arc 0 for three 0 for two from Beyond that Arc driving dish Burton beautifully set up but hes called for the offensive foul and those are the plays that benley Joseph makes for the hurricane stepping in taking that charge and getting possession back with 154 remaining allowing his Miami Hurricanes to get the last possession and having picked up his second foul Burton will be protected by his coach he comes out of the game shocked to see nor Shadow not coming back into the game with his final offensive possession for Coach l 10 Music seconds foul given by IES as you see only six combined team fouls now seven after that one given the fifth against Notre Music Dame presume they give another one here absolutely if you can you just make sure you dont do it in the act of shooting but if you can do it on the floor you absolutely want to do so pack drives is not fouled instead he is denied by Applause Music Booth Terry Booth blocking shots like his daddy used to do father Calvin congrat big how on this the gor of the world champion Denver Nuggets I saw Calvin the other day and his son with a big defensive possession on the last play of the half nor Chad oir the big story in the first half returning to the lineup for the KES with 20 now lets go to Kevin Conor Seth Greenberg and Josh passner with the ESPN 2 halftime Music report who has averaged a double double in each of the past three seasons back from a ankle injury that cost him the Syracuse game and nor Chan omir no worse for where brilliant in that first half 20 points several highlight re slam dunks efficient and he is leading the canes on the road here tonight meanwhile The Freshman point guard Marcus Burton has gone for 11 high volume usage and he has delivered once again through the first 20 minutes of this ball game in South Bend Indiana and welcome back everybody with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman what did you think of the first 20 well I thought it was a good offensive profession I mean first half for noted name to start however they got into a lull late in that first half but Miami was able to continue to get it going 20 points from NORAD omir whenever you get that type of production youre going to be in good shape heading into the halftime locker room ninth time this year omir has gone for 20 points in a game and he did it in the first 20 minutes meanwhile Matthew Cleveland his status is questionable for the second half something with his hip there you see the uh numbers Irish cooled off dramatically over the last 10 minutes of that first half points in the paint dominated by Miami and omir just the difference including those two threepointers got a couple of steals and there you see Cleveland trying to loosen up that hip hes going to try if he can to play again probably not beneficial however if he is going to try to not be out there to start sitting down of course someone who deals with hip issues as benley Josephs does the job early defensively with the deflection sitting down isnt going to help him to keep that hip loose yeah the official word from Miami right hip hes going to warm up and well see not ruled out yet that was as of just a few minutes ago as they were coming out of the locker room Jr kesn strong to the bucket and kesn more than just a shooter had the reputation of being a shooter of course a local young man playing here for the homeown fighting Iris nadir picks up in the second half where he left off in the first and this noted a team has hung their hat on their defense all season long second to Virginia the ACC for scoring defense but Miamis been able to get whatever theyve wanted on the offensive into the floor well he continues to outpace his teammates collectively they have 17 points omir by himself has 22 whenever you start out knocking down a three as Amir did on his first possession things are going to go well for you when you get especially if you got the easy looks around the rim and you see nor had air 9 of 11 a very efficient scoring game for him thus far Kean George knew he was short on that shot tried to track it down in the corner but could not how did you know he knew because well the shooter always knows first and he immediately sprinted toward the basket absolutely he followed his shot which back in the day when Digger Phelps was coaching you had to do now its a sign of you know a lack of confidence you dont follow your shot anymore really no didnt you realize that he knew he was missing that shot of course that means that he wasnt confident that it was going in you recognize immediately when its left your fingertips if youve left it that short so why not try and go get it no no no no if you if you follow your shot that means youre not confident as a shooter anym see that that shows your old school mentality absolutely i have been on the bench dont you watch dont you watch great Shooters like the greatest shooter of all time Steph Curry Let It Go and turn and run back down the floor yeah thats confident absolutely Nigel pack does that I love the fact though that the presid freshman from Switzerland recognized well I missed that one badly Id like to keep possession and go get it okay well you you keep doing that another another Applause turnover Shrewsbury gets the defender in the air banks it home that was a patient play by Shrewsberry in transition recognizing wuga poppler was coming over to try to block it gets him in the air and then has the Poise to be able to finish it well I asked his dad earlier today is bre Shrewsberry has been more productive the last few weeks is the game slowing down for your son I get the sense on that play there was evidence that his dad Micah said yes indeed it is slowing down it absolutely was and off of the turnover Burton throws it ahead and Shrewsberry who sees Bley Joseph coming in to block the shot the pump fake and is able to finish it off and Shrewsberry shot the basketball extremely well 50 over the last four games not including this one hasnt been able to get a going from three yet those were his first two points on the ball game just over two minutes gone here in the second heres wga Applause Poler omir has it poked away and to end the Irish get two more from Julian rooper and this is the defensive Irish we were expecting to see doing a great job keeping the Hurricanes out of the paint Joseph couldnt quiet the crowd Here Comes Notre Applause Music Applause Music Dame hton thought about it back to shrewbury for Applause Music Applause three the coachs kid delivers great Patience by Burton setting up his backcourt freshman mate in Shrewsberry who steps up and knocks down a huge three in front of his Music dad the Fighting Irish have opened this second half with a 92 run Cory using some defense as we expect from them to get back in this thing they absolutely have turning defense into offense Burton coming up with the steel the kick ahead to Shrewsberry the pump fake the layup but when you see a shooter make a layup it often tends to good things on the other end of the floor RO with the steel gets out wants to dump that cant take off enough around pack to dunk it but still has the finish and we talked about shry after seeing the the layup go through steps up knocks down a big Applause three popper packed Joseph around the perimeter for Miami George runs the Baseline omir inside other Dames defense definitely energized to start this half popper intercepted puts it up got the rim but well short and Notre Dame with a chance to take the lead and we came into this game talking about could Notre Dames def defense slow down this great Miami offensive team in the turnover the offensive foul Michael Shrewsberry going up and talking to Bert Smith immediately however Bert Smith was not the guy that made that Music call this is number three on Marcus Burton Burton trying and thats thats an offensive F youve got to give the defender an opportunity to get around the screen theres no longer a time where you can go to take a body to a man you have to be stationary allow the defender to get around that was a lesser Collision oh no here we go with the Collision it was another turnover for the Hurricanes who are up to 11 in this game thus far and have not gotten off to a great start in this second half handling the basketball a 92 Run for the Fighting Irish kesn cut off back out to Roper give it back to kesn four minutes in Music shury with pack on him Burton for the Applause Music

start this second half its a onepoint Music game with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman and coming into this game we mentioned that both Miami and Notre Dame had got a little sideways lately each having lost four of their last five but the reality is theyve been in most of the ball games and its kind of what we expected tonight Cory Notre Dame getting itself right back in the game to start the second half well and you mentioned in the first half how the game was really being played at a Miami Pace they were getting up and down the floor getting some easy looks in transition however in this second half noted a has changed things defensively doing a great job of keeping the Hurricanes out of the paint and just like that they found themselves right back in this game and now an opportunity to take a lead here with 1532 remaining in the second half 92 run for Coach shrew shwb is Irish they have led for only about a minute of this game they LED 109 n and never more than a onepoint lead but a chance to retake the lead once again with a basketball sideline out of bounds into Music Applause Burton Davis tries to turn the corner kesn Music crosscourt after glancing up at the shot clock kesn puts it on the deck spins away from George hangs in the air missed it there to clean it up and give his team the lead is Tay Applause Davis Applause Burton uses the Davis screen Catch and Release round and out for Braden Shrewsberry but a good look for Shrewsberry aw of great action offensively from the fighting IRS pack a wild shot and he was Music fouled smart play by najo pack not settling for the jump shot putting the pressure on the officials to make a call attacking the basket trying to get to the rim and of course njel pack as you mentioned playing with is the closest of a homecoming game for him a number of family and friends in the stands to come check out his performance now Im assuming and I probably shouldnt do that thats M she does have a a pack Jersey on and I know she couldnt be a fan but when you got a custom black 24 Nigro pack Jersey Im assuming thats M could be an ant could be could be a cousin could be a friend were just going to say thats family Cory Alexander is the one assuming yeah that is me but were going to just assume that that is family and my apologies for not taking my normal route into the stands doing my research pregame as I normally would youve been busy lately well I was actually here on time you werent today we were we dont need to tell the whole world about that Burton left alone from our angle you could see immediately it was off to the left yeah we got a great angle right here from our vantage point on the sidelines pack omir another dunk and throughout this game weve had a great vantage point of NORAD omir dominating that time off of a nice find from Nigel Pat who was able to crack the paint the U Back In Front 4240 ims has it poked Music away Applause five on the timer Burton has it poked away good defense by George and then Imes knocks it away whos going to come up with it held ball coach Shrewsberry is fired up on the Notre Dame sideline but how about the fact that kesan George do on the floor after a steal that he picked up on one side of half court but then he was also in the scrum when it all came to in great job defensively by George as you see him getting on the floor but doesnt give up on the play as a freshman continues to keep playing and hustles around to tie the basketball up even though the Hurricanes dont get possession give the Freshman a lot of credit he is actually growing not only physically but as a player right before our eyes well you know his mom Sophies father Dion who was a standout player back in his day at St Francis Pennsylvania proud of what they are seeing their son do tonight Irish tie it back up at Applause 42 Joseph back to George omir Goes Up Above everybody else with nearly a 7ot wingspan but I tell you this one thing we found out and Im sure many people knew before this is the first time Ive had an opportunity to see the fighting IRS play Live Marcus Burton is not scared to mix it up weve seen him in what you like to refer to as collisions I would I would say a little bit of a scrum with the biggest guy on the floor in nadir a number of times throughout this game and Burton does not back down from anyone only 511 166 Pat again finds omir with those Ms that he has able to make that catch while sealing the defender and earning a trip to the line first number five college basketball games highlight our ESPN schedule Saturday it all starts with Ds three number four Houston hosting Kansas State at noon Eastern then third ranked North Carolina takes on Florida State and Clemson squares off against number 12 Duke at 4 Eastern Time 10 hours of college hoops that you can also watch on the ESPN app from anywhere great time of year you still got a little bit of football going on even though football seasons over for me thats a reference to the Cowboys you too right arent you a Bills fan not really but if I had to rude I was certainly pulling for the B uh the bills no question okay I am now at this point in my two favorite quarterbacks by the way I mean even though Im a Cowboys fan I would not put Dak Prescott in that conversation uhhuh my two favorite quarterbacks Lamar and of course Patrick Mahomes going squaring off in the AFC Championship game thats a big deal George throw it up to the rim and its another dunk for number 15 omir now with 28 points a season High speaking of a big deal North chadow has been absolutely that this entire game but give Kean George a lot of credit too for not being selfish and looking out for his teammate on that one getting the easiest too rer gets it back from eyes nice twoman game on that left wing big bucket big response from roer whos one of the very few guys with experience that and Michael Shrewsberry can lean on the transfer from Northwestern he brings some toughness averaged over 20 minutes per game behind chase a and boo buoy last year at Applause Northwestern omir puts his head down offensive foul theres some of that toughness Julian roer the second draws the Char and he gets a body bump from his head coach Michael shrew whos waitings college basketball should be fun weve got a good one here at Notre Dame the fighting Irish used an 112 run to start the second half and get right back in this thing with Miami holding on to a onepoint lead and corette continues to be the north Shadow Mir show he is out scored his teammates 8 to1 in the second half much in the same vein as he did in the first half we still have not seen Matthew Cleveland out with a hip injury and at this point I would think we shouldnt expect him to come back hes got his warmup on sitting on the Miami bench so the canes need somebody else to step up they absolutely do need someone else to step up you also have to mention the fact that North Shadow didnt play on Saturday and coming into this game there was questions as to whether or not he would be available tonight so where would Miami be right now has nor shadir been unable to play but fortunately for Jim Lara and his staff he has been that and not only as he played hes played extremely well now this is one of only two teams in the conference with four players averaging better than 14 points per game along with weight so they have other options but now weve got another guy down as Davis is down and went down Midway through that play Tay Davis trying to walk it off on his way back to the bench Burton will come back in and noted a really playing four on five on that possession which allowed for Nigel pack to be able to to knock down a wide open three as you see Davis coming in stepping on that give me Bley Joseph was able to knock down that wide open three playing four and five on the offensive Applause Music Applause Music end five to shoot Burton spins to the Baseline game and back at the other end he pays it off tied at 49 15 points from The Freshman from nearby Mishawaka Applause Indiana coer blocks the shot Here Comes Notre Dame get the ball to Burt its Burton time right now hes resting in the corner we want him with the basketball its his time kesn so the other local kid does it out of St Joseph High School here in South B hes got the Irish up by three Music George Burton tried to split the double team omir comes away with Applause it Bensley Joseph two quick buckets for the key reserved last year in the final fouram for Miami hes certainly capable he absolutely is and benley Joseph has started the majority of this season now coming off the bench but without Matthew Cleveland started this second half and has been extremely productive for the Kings and its been a quiet night for wga popper averaging over 15 per game hes got four Burton off the Applause bounce Kean George off the hesitation was fouled out front that goes against Julian roer and that is second and the sixth against Notre Dame here in the second half only two team fouls called against the canes so far this Music half Christian Watson takes a seat on the Miami bench Nigel pack has returned and Marcus Burton getting a little a little bit of a rest I can tell you he has been absolutely impressive throughout this one and another unforced turnover Nigel pack dribbling the ball off of his Applause foot right in front of the Miami bench as nor Chad oir will take a break and he looks over at the bench wondering why hes coming out of the game 14th Miami turnover Jim Lena trying to get omir just a little bit of a break before the mediate timeout the next dead ball will be a mediate timeout try to get him a couple of seconds and Miamis able to get a stop on the defensive Music Applause end wga popper 43 a huge shot for the canes who take the lead once again at 5452 one of the leading by percentage threepoint Shooters in the ACC wer popular thats his first three of the after of the evening correct yes only Isaac mcne for Virginia has a better percentage these days in the ACC that was our 10th lead change most of them in the last 5 Applause minutes Miami will have it when we come back nyine hamir WAP popper with a big three for the king he absolutely stepped up at a big time and a shot that his team needed to gained the lead 5452 the canes on the road with a twopoint lead he points on 11 of 13 shooting but the number honestly that tells the story in this game is the fact that both these teams have 14 turnovers were talking about the last two in the ACC and neither team has done a great job handling the basketball Marcus Berton The Fabulous freshman has eight turnovers in this game of his own Music Miami with a basketball George and pack in the back court popler omir and Joseph up front and again the cans playing the second half without Matthew Cleveland who suffered a hip injury in the first half omir fouled on the way Music up kesn on Burton Shrewsberry and Davis out there for Notre Dame the fighting Irish 7 11 overall 2 and five in conference play Miami 3 and4 the ACC 12 six overall omir back from missing the Syracuse game now with 29 Points when you talk about the Fighting Irish big win over Virginia vinia on this year floor at home and theyre a different team in this building held Virginia to 44 points in that game for the first time that the Irish have beating Virginia here in a very long time one of their two ACC wins the other at Georgia Tech the Notre Dame defense has held every one of its ACC opponents under its season average this year big bucket for Logan eyes and you you can see Michael shwy has a lot of confidence in his entire roster at this juncture of the game youve got eyes on the floor who not only gets a bucket on one end but does a great job defensively coming up with a steal and this is a reserve coming in playing minutes here at a crucial juncture of this game well like Carrie Boo and Braden Shrewsberry Logan Imes originally committed to Penn State out of zionville Indiana and all three of them followed mikah Shrewsberry here to South Bend when he took the Fighting Irish job off the hands of poppler Notre Dame will keep it shot clock at 20 theres the first year head coach former division three player at Han College in Indiana back in the mid late 90s Michael Shrewsberry spending some time with the Boston Celtics staff and a lot of what he does is NBA related has a lot of NBA Concepts in his coaching and hes a brad Stevens guy worked for him at Butler as Music well kzn beats the buzzer came up with the front rim though I got to give Kean George a lot of credit for the way hes defended throughout this game has his numbers wont stand out but hes done a great job individually on the defensive end inside of six minutes to play in regulation Joseph gets a message from omir on that dri dribble handoff and now resets the screen Joseph long rebound its eyes Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause again shot clock at five Imes in trouble George ripped it away no change of possession kesn beat the threepoint buzzer but its Miami basketball right now if youre naal pack you want to move everyone out of the way and get into the painted area create a shot for yourself for your teammates great job by Davis staying down George trying to back down eyes whistle before the shot and the foul called against the Freshman from zionville his Music second every Thursday we will have a womens basketball double header for you over on acc Network and the ESPN app tomorrow at 6 Eastern number 23 Florida state is in Durham to take on Duke then at 8 DEA Kelly and number 20 North Carolina host Miami in Chapel Hill Applause into that Notre Dame student section George gets the roll on the first this is where Miami could absolutely have an advantage in this game is getting to the free throw line especially down the stretch a much better free throw shooting team than their opponent and the Fighting Irish who have struggled over the last five games at the line Miami led by eight at halftime up four at the moment Burton fouled on his Drive in the Music basket just the sixth foul of the game and the fourth here in the second half called against Miami and so Burton will inbound underneath his own basket I got Music Applause you kesn dumps it off for Davis maybe took his eye off the ball goes off his fingertips and out of bounds and another unforced turnover and these two teams really have canceled each other out both 15 plus turnovers in this game Applause all by himself Kean George we talk about leading freshman kesan George leads all freshman in threepoint field goal percentage shooting over 40 hasnt had success throughout this game but knocks down a big one right in front of his coach to extend the lead to seven for Miami nor Chad oir is 11 of 13 from the floor including five slam dunks and here is all five of them and the first one he absolutely dropped the hammer the first time Ive seen that from North cadir however these plays weve seen a lot of from the fourth year senior at the University of Miami and this is a Miami career high 30 points he actually went for 36 earlier in his career when he was at Arkansas State well hes the first hurricane to go for 30 in a game since Isaiah Wong put 36 on Cornell December of last year last season that Music is oh thats nice back out to Shrewsberry for the wide open look soaring for the rebound Davis but omir denies Pat came away from the pack with the ball tried to get the outlet up ahead but weve got a foul on the floor and if thats burn thats going to be four on him and thats one of those plays the execution was so great from Michael Shrewsberry team coming out of the timeout that is Burton thats going to pick up his fourth foul but you almost root for that shot to go in because the team executed so well on the atto so the 81 foul shooter passed makes the first and will get the bonus and its been a scoring low now for the Fighting Irish over the last few minutes as they try to stay with the hurricane but Miamis been able to get to the free throw line and take advantage of their opportunities there pack the second cane to get to double figures hes got 10 omir of course leads the way with Music 30 in the blink of an eye Miamis got its largest lead of the night thanks to a to two run this kind of washes away the 112 Notre Dame run to begin this second half kesn Music no George finally secures the basketball and dribbles it out Jim leega has to be happy with the defense hes seen from his team over really over this last 5 minute stretch theyve been able to clamp down on the Fighting Irish after especially when theyre able to set their defense on the sideline Roop for the last of touch so Miami keeps no change of possession so 12 on the shot clock under three on the game clock too often for the hurricanes with the 15 turnovers they put their defense in a bad spot but when theyve been able to set their defense theyve actually done a great job on the Irish and again doing it here in the second half without Matthew Cleveland out with a hip injury wraparound pass and theres dunk number six for no Chad omir and thats how many assists is that for Nigel pack because weve seen him do that a number of times it only says five in the game but it seems like he stayed in the paint dropping the basketball off to air for those dunks Burton for three we got the same vantage point that one looked good it did everything went in and back out for Burton but a good look for him and a good offensive possession just unable to come away with points for the fighting AR he is now three of nine from Beyond The Arc Applause Tonight George is fouled back near midcourt by rooper on the reach Music end well have the womens basketball matchup of the night tomorrow at 8 Eastern 5 Pacific on ESPN and the app the only undefeated D1 team of the nation number one South Carolina will take on number nine LSU at the marovich center the college game day crew in Baton Rouge tip off our coverage at 7 eastern time I watched the first match up between those two teams a season ago where LSU visited South Carolina and Angel re of course was playing great basketball coming in and she had a good game but South Carolina just dominated that game going to be interesting to see what its like when the game CS go to LSU and with that environment will be like in Bat R kesn tripped from behind lost his shoe Bensley Joseph cant believe he was called for the foul Bley Joseph does it great job getting back with the back tap however he does step on kzns foot forcing his shoe to come off I think thats worthy of a foul the Irish with the basketball they LED 5251 since that time a 172 now 17 to5 run does Notre Dame have one last Applause push pressure handled nicely popper brings it out Joseph 4 three that might do it thats one of the ones you got to make because thats a quick shot when your team does not need a shot you can kill some time but Lesley Joseph steps up and makes a big bucket Davis leans in and popler over the Music back well W popper has not quite been himself tonight he told me this afternoon hes 85 told you 80 as we take another look at this big three by Joseph early in the shot clock and wapa does the right thing he pulls it out hes a even higher percentage threepoint shooter he recognizes its not the time to take that shot but Bley Joseph stepped up knocking down a huge shot to provide some separation a 12point lead now for the Music Hurricanes Tay Davis the seatan hall transfer with the free throw its a young Notre name team you think about all the Freshman that they play and then Tay Davis is a sophomore coming over rer is a junior they dont play a lot of experience but you have to truly appreciate the fight that this team has put up throughout this game with a much more veteran Miami team and talking to Notre Dame assistant Kyle getter earlier today associate head coach by the way associate one of your former UVA guys yes yes and and again when you refer to Kyle getter please refer him as associate head coach associate head coach there is okay he is a kg very positive about what they are building and what they have signed for next year and not diving deep into the portal for a quick fix theyre looking to build it the oldfashioned way and I think when you win a couple games at home the big win over Virginia you go on the road and you beat you know Georgia Tech if you can string together a few wins then things dont seem to be as Grim when youre doing it with all these young players because the thing is about freshman they become sophomores and theyre even better when theyre sophomores and then if you keep them all together and out of the portal allowed them to become upper class but now youre really working with something as you continue to recruit and bring in some young Pieces kesn good looking stroke just over a minute to go the Fighting Irish back within Applause Music nine if Burton fouls he fouls out Kean George for three I believe that could be the dagger its the same spot we saw benley Joseph knock one down and extends the lead to 12 once again every time Notre Dame makes that push Miami has had the answer yeah he is an effortless shooter and has now made at least 1 three in 15 straight Miami games and as you alluded to Cory he puts up a lot of threes and makes a lot he had five that he made at Wake Forest four each against Stone Hill and Clemson hes a good shooter and not afraid to put it up no he absolutely is not afraid to put it up and Ive been most impressed with kesan Georges defensive effort tonight again Miami not known for their defense but they stepped up when their team needed the most tonight how about this nor Chad omir becomes the first Kane with 30 points and 10 rebounds ever in an ACC game wow 33 to lead all scores and an impressive push back in the second half without Matthew clevand to beat Notre Dame 7361 great win for Jim LGA and the Miami Hurricanes coming on the road up against a young but Scrappy Notre name team who has pulled out big wins on this floor and AC Play Already however the canes too much with him here tonight so the canes improved to 44 in ACC play 13 and six overall led by n Chad s double double 33 points our final score once again Miami 73 Notre Dame 61 coming up next we have more Hoops with Iowa State host in Kate but first lets get to the studio Kevin Connor Seth Greenberg and Josh pner
