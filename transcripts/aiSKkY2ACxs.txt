guy kind of a junkyard dog in the post gains Wyatt Gamel Thorne Kendall Benet the starting five for the Braves Al you flush nice look nice fine tie game well alorn state is definitely game ready its their third game this week an insane schedule for the Braves as Hunter tees it up and berries a long three really like the back court of Chase Hunter and Joe Gerard the third theyve really meshed well together early even though they are new Music Applause jg3 in ACC play from last season 5 to2 early deep three the response count Music it alorn state will push the ball up the floor theyre not afraid to run and play five out basketball both teams on fire early after Thanksgiving Clark responds with a three of his own its 8 to five early from Little John the Clemson team who was picked fifth in the ACC preseason Poll finished third last season Brad ronells group missed the NCA tournament a surprising decision by the committee after an excellent year Kendall misses the Music Applause jumper heres hall now to Gerard Hall left it short offensive rebound to the Tigers Gerard the floater and a fivepoint Advantage timeout taken early by Landon Music busy Clemson hot start at home right after Thanksgiving well veteran player and rad ronell talked about it yesterday with us and just said hes hes adjusting to the new system hes adjusting a playe with Chase Hunter they move without the ball a little bit more at Clemson Syracuse offense was a little more isolation based pick and roll base but hes fitted well so Music far very long triple off the mark from from 12 Thorne and that leads to a JG 33 13 to5 and right back to another timeout from the Braves the kick kick out to Gerard and what the reason Landon busy is upset is his defense coming into this game the game plan was dont leave Gerard on ballside penetration let the help come from the inside not the outside because the man guarding Gerard cannot help on that dribble penetration but he can prevent Gerard from getting an open three which they did not not alorn state in the midst of a just insane road trip look at how many games this week they havent seen home in 3500 miles coach this has got to be tough on the Braves especially playing these teams well big paychecks but no rest thats basically the the thing and but you know Landon buss not afraid he never has been as a coach hes been very successful at alorn State he feels like this will prepare him well for his conference the Braves lost 8269 against Texas Arlington before hitting the road to Clemson spent Thanksgiving in Clemson before getting ready for this game they wont play for two weeks after this one tonight nice looking Applause stroke that was Gaines Wyatt cuts the deficit to six get into the Gap hes good at dribble penetrating Applause Music Reb Chaplan no Hall had it Stripped Away good defensive stop there for alorn Music State Gerard too strong rebound clear by Gamel good quick first step to find a little opening on the Baseline for Gerard alorn State 15 wins in the swack regular season last year 14 of them the year prior both times they lost in the swack tournament to Texas Southern looking for an NCA tournament birth for the first time since 2002 as that jumper cuts the lead to four Music how about that play from Kendall well good couple early timeouts by Landon busy got the message across to his team they seem right at the ship and settle down into this game PJ Hall gets into the scoring act his first points of the evening the ACC preseason first team PJ Hall if you give him that much space its like playing two on two in the driveway hes too big too long too good you give that much space toy last SE lead by hustling it up and in Kendall out a couple of bright moments preseason First Team all swack member they have high hopes for him in that conference this year Well Jeremiah Kendall is a good player 67 hes long hes athletic you see his Mobility around the LI around the rim 17 against the horn frogs earlier this week how about that pass you said it Hall can do it all on the find to shefflin well the door closed on him underneath the basket on that Baseline had nowhere to go but just the great presence of mind to find his front Court mate shefflin 17713 Tigers fourpoint lead early knocking off Boise State 8568 and their last matchup on November 19th blew out the Broncos there in the second half as the runner makes it a twopoint Music game thats what alorn state wants to do they want to play fast they space the floor really move the ball quickly around the perimeter good ball movement led to an open three attempt from Clark Hall was pushed underneath thatll take us to our first media timeout tigers by two at home early than you every night of great battles and uh its just I just love these conference battles whether its the ACC SEC or the Big 12 be they just theyre all fantastic are because early you talk about 5 to 10 years ago teams did not play anybody early and all you have to do is take a look at Clemsons schedule early and know that Brad brell said wait a minute were going to load up and find out who we are and at the end of the year either were going to win these games or lose these games but were going to prove to the NCA committee this time that were not afraid of anybody they werent afraid of every anybody last year but sometimes you schedule people early you dont know if theyre going to be good but you just look at their schedule coming up you got at Alabama then they start the league play at Pittsburgh then they have South Carolina then TCU and at Memphis so its uh not an easy Road for Brad Applause Brownell that Bama game Tuesday November 28th at 9 30 as both free throws are missed how about the canes going to rup thatll be interesting as well for Jim Lena Squad early in the year no theyre very good you know they proved that already this season and obviously last year going to the final four that program is playing with a lot of confidence right now acting like they belong and they do little Zone from alorn State put back at them not going to fall like RJ gr Godfrey into the game now for the Tigers Roger Jones 62 Jr from Albany Georgia controls the rock step back three two Long offensive rebound but its going the other way well Landon bus is going to change defense as he has to I mean thats obviously the schedules been brutal early but the thing is they theyre given up almost 885 points a game so hes got to try to work change the defense is keep Clemson off balance you see the little push Music off not much there not a lot of size for this alorn State team one of the smallest teams in the country according to Ken pom nice ball movement and a three Chase Hunter now Chase Hunter really adjusted to the new role a year ago playing point guard and now you can see how comfortably is off the ball on the ball and Clemson does a good job of spacing the court sharing it and reversing the reversing the Music basketball Clemson by five Drive kick three not going to fall foul on alorn state as Godfrey went up to grab it Godfrey the six8 sophomore from Swani Music Georgia its been a lot of shoving around inside and but when you dont have size you have to find another way to get it Music done Brad Brownell has pointed out the depth being a reason for optimism guys like Godfrey who just lost the ball out of bounds for a turnover Alex hamwe Chanty Wiggins guys at last year they felt like they were young coach and said the depth there was a fallof once we got to our bench were hoping this season were going to be able to give you more sustained numbers and effort well I think Brad was very happy with the effort of the Freshman last year but theyre freshman and you you play in the ACC playing at the highest level uh youre going to have your ups and downs and they had to rely on those guys with injuries last year so they gained a lot of invaluable experience but I think now theyre theyre seasoned veterans even though theyre only sophomores a guy like Godfrey has already improved his numbers from three points per game last year to nine points per game so far here on on the new campaign they still defend it Clemson one of the best defensive teams in the country forcing a late heave and a shot clock violation tigers by five at the Under 12 Native and kind of a guy coach thats gone under the radar but done a terrific job at Alcorn State five games in eight days for the Braves all on the road they do get two weeks off after this one they wont play again till December 10th inside knocked out of bounds godfre was trying to post up the smaller Defender and hell stay with Clemson well the the travel is the obviously the hard part but then the next issue is the lack of practice when you have so many games in a short period of time you dont really have any time to improve on maybe your weaknesses and thats been an issue did a nice job there didnt they preventing the inbound timeout taken by Clemson well step aside well be back with the inbound Music Applause play what last year 23 wins 14 of them in the ACC somehow didnt get in the a in the NCAA tournament that out of conference schedule not one of the strongest in the country last year they said that theyve tried to improve that and uh coach brell said it to him I he said weve got to have more emphasis on some of these nonconference games there is a sense of urgency but they have moved on well from a basketball perspective I will tell you he is highly respected not only as a as an X Ando coach but as a program Builder does things the right way his players are always very rarely you see his players have a problem getting trouble so rad ranell is Clemsons very lucky to have him OD down Wiggins on The Fast Break extends the lead to seven a late loss last year to Louisville really killed the Tigers coupled in with losses to Loa Chicago in nonconference play tough one to South Carolina as well theyve added jg3 they added Jack Clark he lose hunter Tyson to the NBA its an older Tigers team theyve got depth theyve got talent maybe the evolution of Chase Hunter makes all the difference in an ACC thats much improved as well this year as Hall count it and one well I think Brad feels comfortable with his rotations and and you know a lot will be found out here in the next couple weeks when the schedule steps up a notch but heres what makes Hall so good and so tough and they do a nice job of spacing the floor hes got room to roam and operate down low and then they find him on ball reversal he does a great job of sealing off and carving out space and then finishing with the good Music Music footwork hall now with five tigers by 10 and coach last season 14 ACC wins maybe didnt hold the same amount of weight but the conference this year seems to have taken another step forward they have some great out of conference wins so far when you look down the list oh theres no doubt about it you mentioned Miami uh I think Virginia is going to be good obviously North Carolina and Duke I North Carolina even though they lost to Villanova I think theyre going to obviously be there uh much improved from last year they just had a lot of tough things happen to them with injurywise during this season but uh Duke is back to being Duke again thats for sure you know well see what Florida state is I think they seem to be better and uh I dont expect them to be down like they were last year well have to see if the ACC is as deep as it was a couple of years ago first ones knocked down tomorrow 1100 am eastern the ACC huddle crew will get you set for another afternoon of football at 630 get a complete wrap up of those games as they prep you for the prime time match up on accn at 8 Eastern then after the game theyll have a full postgame show to wrap up the night all of it right here on accn and the ESPN Music out Kendall splits the free Music throws ninepoint Advantage Clemson was on a 70 run then alorn back in that aggressive Zone leads to a turnover now transition opportunity for the Music Applause Music Applause Braves Thorne good contest somehow found it banked in high degree of difficulty up top for Thorne coach how do you want to see the Tigers attack the Zone well theyre doing a good job theyre going high low three out two in and they just moving the ball and theyre going through the middle of the floor thats what you have to do shrink the defense and kick it back out that way that time Hemingway out his feet set one of the best threepoint Shooters in school history 43 of his makes he is a attempted 18 shots this season now 19 with 18 of them coming from Beyond The Arc hes in there to do one thing and one thing only well hes good against that zone but you have to shrink the defense first and thats what Clemson did look like they force the turnover might have got a touch as theyre awarding it to alorn St its good defense by Clemson but sometimes offense by accident makes it happen and Thorne did just that but you see the Zone do a good job of moving the interior pieces the the two inside guys in and out and now they kick it in and they go back out to the perimeter to a wide open hem Music andway technical was given to Landon busy Applause and so the Tigers get two free Applause Music throws missed them both wow hemond white a good free throw shooter yeah Landon bus he said come on you got to be kidding me the ball was going out of bounds there was no one within 15 ft of Music it officiating through Lee Castle Clarence Armstrong and Adam floor here tonight sometimes you can get a te when you least expect it didnt cost him there that short jumper wont fall for H nice rebounds by Alex sovic the Junior from bellarus sovic got a big body throws it around on the Music inside now Hall fouled on the rebound attempts thatll go against Kendall sovic got his body around on the offensive end but time he just banged into Hall theyre going to crowd Hall whenever he catches the ball on either end Music Kendall nice work go to the line foul on Chaffin first when we return so far Clemson in control you got to give Paul a break bring the caterers in but you know a lot of those great wives they they like to be in charge on Thanksgiving and look like a good time they know how to eat in Clemson South Carolina thats for sure I asked Brian Brownell what was going to be on his plate and he said Im doing turkey and ham I got to have both a sweet potato Im all about the casseres said we make a pineapple casserole but he did say I miss being at my moms house cuz I want that cheese eat pean pie well they didnt eat too much they look like they a little hop in their step today doing a good job attacking the Baseline of this Zone and spacing the court very active burning the Slumber right off up Music 10 fouled down low Kendall guilty of it itll go against Godfrey it is an alorn State team coach that does get to the line at a high clip theyve done that well and theyve protected the Music basketball Music already a nice evening for Kendall the senior from the Bronx started his career at Prairie View AM and what a week 13 ACC Network football lineup weve got for tomarrow starts a noon Eastern with pit versus Duke and then VT takes on UVA capping the day another rivalry Carolina 22nd ranked NC State 800 Eastern all three games also available on the ESPN app so you can watch it anywhere I have to admit I veered off a little hoops today to watch a little Miami Boston College in the ACC and Miami finished up pretty strong and think they ever really recovered though from the the kneel down debacle at Georgia Tech no they did not they did get their seventh win though against the Eagles today how about the job Jeff Halley has done though with the Eagles too with Thomas castalanos at quarterback and these Clemson Tigers will have their eyes peeled on the game against the South Carolina Gamecocks rivalry weaken give dbos swinny a lot of credit those grid iron tigers have gotten better as the season has gone along that shots pure from Beyond The Ark Dylan Hunter younger brother of Chase buries it good job by Dylan Hunter you know theyre you can see how well well schooled they are against that zone when the ball goes into the middle both Wings dive down to the corner where its really hard for the forwards or the guards to slide down and contest oh long two that goes down for Music thorn well most players like to play more than practice and alour States had a lot of games this week and they look like theyre feisty out there theyre going to be tough in their league and theyre but theyre not as tough as this guy he is just a load inside too hard to handle with one mans its out this what Im talking about they do a good job of going inside they shrink the defense and theyre so well schooled you see Hunter slide down to that open area on the Baseline then they space the court and they go a little high low from the top of the key into Music Hall Music the conference full of really good big men isnt it coach and uh PJ hall right amongst the top its interesting though you watch the big men around the conference and all around the country and the game has changed so much in the last 10 years the big men all can step out theyre good passers and make threes its not only just a postup game anymore youve got to be versatile as a big man just like PJ Hall Bank Shot Gamel through some contact as well of course Saints not afraid that time Gamel just put his head down and theyre confident when they get into that lane even against bigger the size that they dont have in the middle but they do have a lot of quickness and Music toughness Bonus Ball now here for Clemson theyll be at the line that was the eighth team foul on alorn State Music always coaching Brad Brownell even with one of the accs best PJ Hall actually got a couple of votes for ACC player of the year high expectations well they do a very nice job of putting him in great spots where hes got a lot of space Not only on the inside but on the wing on the short corner and at the top of the key where he can operate to off the Music bouns Clemson is slowly pulled ahead now by double digits oh Shooters touch is good for Beyond The Music Arc gamels got the last five for the Braves as sheflin continues a strong first half for Clemson oh hes really tough and you know Brad brell just really talked highly about him yesterday spoke highly about him in in regard that he just does all the little dirty things that you need somebody to do in the paint called him a junkyard dog 16 points seven rebounds for shefflin in the season opener against winth hes got six points here tonight great ball movement Gerard midrange J nope Hall offensive stick back not going to go well they call it basket interference on shefflin they Music do Brad Brownell thought it was off the front of the rim and Shufflin made a good little tip its the great second Music effort sure what they saw on that one looked like it was off the side of the rim so bradson look see the video doesnt Music lie Clemson plus seven on the boards shooting 50 from the Music floor Mass Hawkins on the drive great defense by Hall and shefflin tigers look to run the big men crossing the timeline great feed what a Music rejection Al corn state has been feisty on both ends and theyre not afraid theyre lacking size but not heart or or elevation at The Music Rim Clemson starting next week against Bama well we know the schedule for them but you know the accs good you look from top to bottom its a much deeper conference than it was a year ago we mentioned Miamis better Virginia Techs going to have a good season pits been they finished strong last year they will North Carolinas on a bounce back here you got some other X factors NC State you dont know looks like BCs improved as well out of Doubt Miami winning the Baja mar with the win over Kansas state Florida State knocking off Colorado maybe coach ham hes got a much improved Squad was a top 20 Buffalos team in the sunshine showdown in Daytona Beach for the nlls four points in a row for alorn state has cut the deficit to six in the latter stages of the first half Ive been very impressed with their energy and their toughness their ability to change defense their Zone has been really aggressive and theyve done a good theyve done a good job rebounding out of it despite their lack of size the Braves have mixed in different defenses Clemson has looks pretty good so far Gerard from downtown and one now no doubt even even when the balls on the weak side of the floor youve got to not extend over and get ball watching you better know where Gerard is and be able to get to him in one step on the catch and there you see on the catch Mass just too far he rushed out he panicked and his close out was out of control and he fouled Music him Gerard one of the prolific threepoint Shooters not just at cuse where he was was third all time in program history came into the day 11th in threes in ACC history matter of fact that last one just passed buddy beheim for 10th all time and jg3 could conceivably get as high as number two before his career is done only JJ reck he was pretty good remember him Coach uh might be unreachable with 457 career threes did he play I thought he was just an announcer I didnt know that JJ played oh man channeling his inner JJ reic from Beyond The Ark there way down to thats JJ range that one was to backto back Gerard the response and a 10point Advantage for Clems another timeout taken well Landon busy called the two early timeouts when they left Gerard open early in the game and times you have to keep re keep reminding your team even running back in transition you just cant run back and with your head down youve got to identify even if hes not your man or its not on your side of the Zone someones got to be near him and Brad Brown now is hot as well because hes not happy giving up 35 points in the first half definitely a defensiveminded coach who prides himself on that side of the ball but Gerard has 13 points has made three triples and Gerard coming into the year over 1700 points in his career just the second ACC player since 1992 1993 with over 1700 career points over 300 threes made and 450 assists ESPNs Jay will Jay Williams just the other one he played ball too coach not just a commentator well those guys were great players they certainly were and are great commentators and joj Rods really done a nice job tonight of playing good solid mantoman defense he been improving that in his time at Clemson coach brell said look he was in a two3 zone for much of his career at cuse hes still developing habits on how to play manto man he can score and he can pass with the best of them that three wont fault nice hero step driving swooping other side of the basket there for gains Wyatt gains Wyatt just not to be deterred and it just a quick push and transition alorn state whoever gets it gets it and goes too strong PJ Hall a load to deal with inside well theyre trying to deny him down low but hes just doing a great job of reverse pivoting and just backing his Man Down carving out space gets big has the super soft hands and then the great footwork when that bucket PJ hall now in double figures for 16 consecutive games dating back to last Music year shot CL clock off Clemson can hold for the final attempt of the half jg3 the top Hunter swooping in from the Baseline hell go to the line well thats where having a guy like Joe Gerard is so valuable because Chase Hunter usually plays the point but at the end of the clock then they space the court a little bit put hunter in the corner little twoman game at the top between Hall and Gerard and then if you overh help Gerard did a nice job of finding hunter in the Music corner first free throw rolls off heres your lineup for the ACC SEC men and womens basketball challenge first on the mens side Tuesday night Mississippi State Georgia Tech 7 Eastern 6 Central then on Wednesday finishing the night for the mens Georgia faces FSU at 915 also on Wednesday for the women its UF Georgia Tech at 5 and Vandy and number 10 NC State at 715 catch all the action on acc Network and the es Music Pi 22 seconds left half court heave misses Music everything well they have to get back and get their defense set I think Alor States had a good job with just kind of rushing up the floor and attacking before Clemson has made them play five against five against a set defense alorn state had 115 points per possession in that first half good start for the Tigers defense they played much better in the second half against the Broncos of Boise State the drive is it a blocking foul it is count it and and one for Chase Hunter Chase Hunter does such a good job of of knifing his way through the defense either hand body control takes the hit it still finishes in traffic with the foul under the senior out of Atlanta really evolved as a point guard last year for Brad Brownell 26 double figure scoring games the game winner right at the end at Florida State evolved into a True Guard theyre challenging him on the defensive side of things to try and pick up the other teams point guard but as he gets a steal here you get the feeling the Tigers theyre going to take a step forward and might be up to Hunter they got him in the book though that three makes it a 17point Advantage well Brad brell was not happy at the end of the first half just because of his teams inability to get some stops in the half court alorn state had some more than usual easy opportunity against a stingy Clemson defense but theyre not going to go away theyve got a lot of Pride this team you know coach Busy has got them fired up to play tonight and even with the hard schedule that theyve had all week again allore not going to play until December 10th they have two different stretches this season where they dont play for over two weeks and Gerard midrange jumper Music short gains Wyatt The Freshman Thorne yes nine for Thorne the lead down to 12 for the Tigers Clemson got caught ball watching a little bit as the ball swung to that wing and Thorne just kind of stepped into that or open area at the top good ball movement a dribble a three short o board Hall a nice second half to start hes got five lead back to 14 alln States guards have to do a better job of digging in they cant just leave their bigs in there alone to rebound against Hall they have to rebound by committee Clemson plus 10 on the boards are in this one tonight how about Hall you seen it now from all three levels he is truly fascinating now you cant let him catch the ball that easily and if theyre theyre going to throw it into him that easily they must double down in the post jum ball itll go the other way for clemon PJ Hall 16 points now tonight six rebounds four assists Hall had 27 in Asheville against UAB his career high is 28 did it a couple of times last year Music Applause the inbound coming for shin coach what kind of opportunities does it present everyone else when you have a player like PJ Hall that is so versatile as a big man well first of all youve got to have a coach that puts him in into know a system that takes advantage of what he does best and thats what Brad Brownell does and the thing about Clemson is theyre always going to be solid because they dont turn it over Brad is a really good fundamental offensive coach and you can see they move him around they dont its not easy to guard him because he you dont know where hes going to be theyll post them up in the middle of the paint theyll post him up on the box theyll put them out in the short Corner theyll put them out to the wing and theyve got a lot of movement and kind of misdirection around them so thats what the challenge is is that youve got to have moving parts to defend PJ Music Hall Clemson red Haw shooting from Beyond The Arc and again tonight as that shot misses theyre nine of 17 came in top 20 in the country in threepoint percentage as a team well over 40 as a squad got Shooters everywhere we got PJ Hall as well makes life easy not that time though well its hard to double him because hes got such good size and hes a very willing and able passer so if if you overextend hell make you pay by kicking it back out to Gerard or Music Hunter Clemson up 16 in control at Little John second Music half again tonight well are versatility sometimes is an overworked or over said little word but its a big word for BJ hall because because of the fact he does it all in a lot of different ways he can score inside outside hes a willing and abled passer tough Defender good rebounder experience but above all hes just a winner he plays to win he just has that look on his face from the opening tip he got 172 Point performances in his career hes nearing that number again tonight and when its your night shots like that fall hes got 19 another Music three Clemson starting to pull away long distance attemp not going to fall 19point Advantage for the Music Tigers well theyre getting into the Rhythm right now and it starts with their defense and you know they can get out and run a little bit and kind of get into their flow thats when fems is dangerous sovic Music Applause 12footer Clon by 17 the Tigers return to third most points per game in college basketball from a season ago only TCU and Arkansas bring back more points that have played at the college level experience versatility depth this Brad Brown L team is poised to build off of 23 wins a year ago that was a heat check for Hall a couple empty possessions though Brad brunells not not happy he wants a little bit more consistency first you had the onehand pass from Gerard and then the kind of a quick shot by Music Hall tell you what deedin Thorne has impressed this evening for the Braves well he has hes a good catch and shoot guy and alorn States running some nice stuff in the half courtt a little dribble hand off clemon didnt get out contest on the perimeter got five threes now tonight did hit nine against UT Arlington in their last contest Rayes expected to contend again for the swack theyve won the last two regular seasons theyve turned into nit appearances as Texas Southern has hoisted the league tournament Music crown Music Applause Music the other way little screen on the Baseline RJ Godfrey was trying to set that Baseline Runner screen for Joe Gerard and he he slid into an area he did not have legal position down low you watch they trying to run a little step here comes jard on the Baseline theyre going to try to screen his man and then Godfrey just moves its a movie screen thats a good call rle Music Godfrey RJs father 11e NFL vet who played for the Cowboys for the commanders Titan Seahawks Chargers no doubt proud of his son RJ who has made a big leap from his freshman to sophomore a year Music well its hard enough to get todays players to set screen so I dont think Brad Brunell was upset that RJ was trying to set his screen and moved into his Music Applause Music man there he is left block nice post move well thats how you reward some moves trying to set a screen even though he committed a foul you you run a little ISO down low and really nice footwork by Godfrey 12 points against winr to start the year for Godfrey defensively has a knack for for blocking shots o nice midrange step back Music jumper Jaylen Music Hawkins now the Zone from alorn theyre really aggressive in an he they dont just sit back theyre get their hands up theyre active theyre looking for deflections and theyre right there on the catch you wouldnt know that theyve played four games in their last six days coach trying to get back in this one down Music 14 Joshua the 510 senior outon NOLA who has had himself quite a weak 21 points on Wednesday against UT Arlington and 20 against TCU right before that the night before on Tuesday they fought got to give the Braves a lot of Music crediton six of 12 now from the free throw line Music 50 shot well though from the floor 50 in both of those areas as well good defensive stand yeah good job by Hall and sheflin of just presenting resistance at The Rim leads to an open three but the put back there by Hunter the elevation by Hunter in traffic out of his area 12 for Hunter to go along with five assists friendly touch and the shooters bounce for jalite gains Music Applause Wyatt on a reverse layup no Hall Hamond way he can stroke it too strong good recovery by alorn state then the run out on the feed jahi Benet going to the Music line the junor from nice in France rattles the first one home want to remind you tomorrow 1100 am Eastern the ACC huddle crew gets you set for another afternoon of college football 630 get a complete wrap up of those games as we prep you for Prime Time match up on acc Network at 8 then after the game a full postgame show to wrap up the night all of it right here on accn and the ESPN F Championship season coming up a little bowl season best time of year for college football got ACC Championship game in Charlotte not this weekend but next Florida State Louisville that got a little more interesting with the injury to Jordan Travis and how about the job coach braah has done in his first season its the head man of the Cardinals Hall hes got a 20 piece now now if you dont have the size against him hes almost unguardable and alorn States doing a pretty good job of just forcing him off his sweet spot but hes just too big too long too Music talented 21 and eight for PJ four assists as well third team ACC member last year after averaging 15 points per game sheflin throwing it down Chef hes a hard man to guard as well because he doesnt look for the ball they dont look for him but he just finds ways to get open and then delivers hes got eight and nine rebounds double double watch for shefflin oh reaching on the drive by gains Wyatt me and sheflin is a guy who just does a good job of moving without the ball the Little Ghost screen on ball reversal and alorn state gets caught ball watching shaplin really started to come along last season for the Tigers big games against Notre Dame against NC State to end the year especially in the ACs G tournament was strong defensively against Duke and that upset at Little John here for the Tigers he play so hard and hes strong hes tough and and smart chlin out of Loganville Music Applause Georgia one for two at the line for gains Wyatt 16point Advantage for the Tigers at home here shot Alin Hall from the logo Gerard Hall had it rejected great defense and close out from Benet might have been a little rush from PJ Hall starting to feel it a little bit though wanted that little fade away from the corner Music they had big things planned for Hall how about that turn around oh couldnt get it to crawl over the rim but PJ going back to the line for two was actually pretty good defense but Hall so crafty and so long and strong on the Baseline hes hard to close out I mean they look like alorn State hadam closed out but he found a way to twist and turn and get that reverse angle to the rim Music samaro on the football side we got a loaded slate starts at noon Eastern with pit and Duke and then Virginia Tech against Virginia then Capp in the day UNC verse number 22 NC stated at eight all three games also available on the ESPN app heels and pack again Dave Doran a wonderful coach job has gotten NC stayed back into the top Music Applause 25 PJ Hall closing in nearing his career high of 28 Clemson by 18 banet wins the battle on the putb how about banet the last couple of moments oh hes been terrific he just hes so long and athletic around the rim but also defensively hes doing a good pretty good job as good as you can get against Hall with it for his lack of size Hall fouls on that interior Music feed on gains Music Wyatt theyve had some great players Ed Clemson some great bigs you think about Trevor Booker you think about guys like Hunter Tyson a wing Music player PJ hall right up there isnt he he is right up there theres no doubt about it you know the thing about him is that hes its been as you saw the talent as a youngster but he every year he developed another little small piece to his game and he never but he never forgot who he was I mean sometimes bigs they start to think about the NBA and then they want to step out and they want to show they can handle the ball or shoot it on the perimeter and he can do that and he has done that but he still has not forgotten that he understands that Im a power player first and then I can add on to my game later no doubt coach guys like Blossom game Dante Grandam KJ McDaniels there have been some really good ones Hall going to be mentioned with those guys yeah as Clemson fans theyll tell you if Dante Grantham never goes down back in 2017 we making a final four what a team they had with Maris Reed Gabe Devo sweet 16 team that year for Brad Brown out thing about Clemson they are very very unselfish they do a good job of attacking with their head up understanding where their teammates are and again right there looking for the open man on the back Music side the 23rd assist of the night for Clemson and banet theyll call him for basket interference itll take us to a break tigers by 20 theyre cruising in the second Music half being the best takes hard work thats why that Benet actually did not commit offensive goal tending thats a good call by the officials and Benet with the Attack under R thats clearly outside the cylinder tremendous second effort and as you mentioned earlier hes hes done a lot of good things tonight for Landon busy hes got his career high now with 10 points to go along with seven rebounds the Frenchman 67 215 lbs hes going to be a problem in the swack this Music season Music well they get better you know you you want go through this period of time and you know the thing that you want to make sure when youre going on the road like this and youre taking some Ls is that you keep your team spirit up and you dont get off the main goal which is to get better and try to improve from these games and learn from these Road games and then time you get to conference youre ready youre ready to go on the Road and win in your own League where its obviously a different level than youve been playing against still some opportunities to get better at VCU at marylands Great defensive possession there for the Music Braves Music The Feisty group used to winning there he is Music Benet seems very relaxed on that possession Bells trying to find the energy on defense this team right now is good offensively but defensively not as fundamental as Brad wants him to be hall now of 27 you know thats where the depth can help as well I mean in these type of games try to get your younger players into the game get them playing with a little bit more fire defensively the fire that you might need but Alor States not easy to guard because theyre so fast sometimes a smaller smaller team is hard to defend because theyve got so many undersized guys that are quick and play out on the perimeter theres just another example right there where they just drive and kick and they got caught ball watching again Benet has eight of the last 10 for all corn Music State and one Hunter slash into the hoop well Chase Hunter can do a lot of different things off the bounce and with this improved offensive team as far as balance hes going to get more of these type opportunities where the floor just opens up and there you can see too late on the defensive end no position around a basket and not outside the arc either Hunter quietly has 15 points and seven assists open the year with 10 assists and had that done double double with 10 points as well against winr you get the feeling Clemson might go not just as PJ Hall goes but the way that Hunter can control Tempo and Pace against some of the accs bests well Clemson has a lot of options and they can give you a lot of different looks on the offensive end it starts with Hall inside outside Wing pick and roll pick and pop uh putting the ball on the floor and then Hunter running the team you know being an efficient point guard ball handler distributor Defender at the top and then Gerard you know the experience the experience of those two invaluable especially when they get to the ACC because these guys have been through it many many Music Music nights run sets for guys like PJ Hall but its nice to have guys like Chase Hunter and Joe Gerard late in the shot clock here he Music is nice moves from Music Music Hunter Gerard now three of eight but a third possession coming for Clemson thats SP PJ Halls a smoke so smart they didnt score but clock was winding down he knew to come out and set a ball screen or Flash up to the high post to kind of relieve some pressure and then they get the offensive rebound and do score 113 of the night for Clemson Hunter has Music 18 Music one of the best outside shooting teams in the country the Tigers have been hot again here this evening against the Music Braves lines one up now that time for Music Clark sweet midrange Music Applause Music stroke Gerard from a nice pass he has been icy tonight three of nine for Gerard one of the best Shooters in the country good defense though by Clemson they went ball side then weak side then they skipped it the terrific Concepts against the Music zone They moov the ball well theyre patient Joe just going through a little bit of a cold stretch in this second half and too aggressive over the Music Applause top Clemson plus 10 here in the second half out scoring alorn 3626 on their way to win number five on the year gets tougher for the Tigers though starting with a road trip to Tuscaloosa next week oh another nice shot they got to give all corn State a lot of credit you know they played hard tonight obviously dont match up talent wise but they came in here they didnt just mail it in thats for sure they gave they made cleansing play to win this game theres a new career high for PJ Hall 29 Music Points the foul called theyre going to count the basket it will be a blocking foul on Applause Hall its been PJ Halls night Clemson in cruise control Lets Do It come on guys get me plays so hard in these type games obviously every game is important but we all know you know playing the game a day after Thanksgiving everybodys thinking about the holiday no students are around youre the only ones on campus and youre playing a team thats one and six you know sometimes its hard to get yourself your team to play hard for 40 minutes but right out of the gate tonight PJ Hall imposed his will saying Im not letting anything negative happen because we know all know upsets can to happen in college basketball but BJ Hall would not let that Music happen not tonight at least as Godfrey well go to the line for one more we think this Clemson team can be pretty good I think well find out how they Stack Up nationally you got that game at Alabama you got nonconference game still against TCU and a a much improved Memphis Music team Alabama got beat tonight Ohio State knocked them off so I think just theres a not dissimilar to a year ago where theres just 15 to 20 teams that could emerge during the season theres a lot of teams that look alike Music sovic cant hit the first here lineup for the ACC SEC mens and womens basketball challenge first on the mens side Tuesday Mississippi State Georgia Tech at 7 then on Wednesday finishing the night for the mens Georgia and Florida State at 915 also on Wednesday for the women its Florida Georgia Tech and Vandy and 10th ranked NC Music State H andway battled injuries last year limited minutes again tonight cant finish on that Music drive Gamel going to the line for two Music more Brad Rell talked about you the fine line of developing your bench but also understanding that you put guys in and if all a sudden you lose some momentum then You got to go back with the normal guys and know how do you develop a bench but I think hes done a good job of balancing that so far this season and they five games and now I think hes going to have to use these guys in these upcoming tests and I think theyre probably more ready than they would have been if he hadnt just hes you given them a lot of minutes some of these sophomores Dylan Hunter You Know Jack Clark coming off the bench hem andway coming off the bench Godfrey I mean these kid these guys are all going to have to help them moving Music forward we asked him straight up this week whats been the message to the team as you approach the new year you get left out of the tournament with 23 wins 14 ACC wins and he said look yeah you know it scarred us it hurt us a little bit but we have so many new pieces this year that we cant make that our monra we cant let that be the reason why we play and so while it stung us and we disagreed with the decision were ready to turn the corner and maybe this is the year that Clemson gets back to the NCAA tournament once you get there who knows Music theres a foul going the other way but clear right coach when you get to the big dance a big man and a good point guard can take you a long way it can and you know Clemson could be one of those teams that could be sneaky in March for sure they they early Got The Look of a team thats one of those teams that youve seen in the past gets snubbed or get close to the turnament or loseing the first round and the next year they return a lot of guys they add some pieces and then theyre theyre ready to go and I think thats Clemson this year cool to see the Tigers reaching into their depth saw Daniel nasif a former undergrad manager promoted this season gets into the game Beetle gives Clemson the 90 Music Mark Matt Kelly in there as Applause well that three misses you la we were kidding with Brad Brownell about the tough conf nonconference schedule and were saying whos some someones not in charge of that or watching that very CL closely but truth be told he is watching that and he understands I think he looks forward to that challenge to see what he has you dont want to get to January not really know what you have and I think he knows hes got a good basketball team and he wants to challenge them to be ready for these early season games so they in fact are ready for the Music ACC without a dog coach last season in January Clemson was top of the leader board in the ACC standings heading into the month of February what a STK contrast between that moment and missing the tournament all together but again they have the pieces to be dangerous Brad Brownell said we can be better than we were last year PJ Hall one of the best players in the country definitely in the conference to get a guy like Gerard he could be the difference down the stretch too and more depth makes all the Applause difference Applause final few seconds theyre going to take off the clock Clemson moving to 5 and0 a dominant second half and thankful no doubt here on this holiday weekend
