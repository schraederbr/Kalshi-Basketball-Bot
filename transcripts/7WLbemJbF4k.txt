December ACC basketball PJ Hall to jump Center for Clemson feder Rico feder Rico in the circle for pit and the Tigers control the tap Clon came out early trying to get the ball inside to PJ Hall kick out and a three from Wiggins is Round And Out tip in is through for Ian shefflin starting five four pit carrying 10 The Sensational freshman legot the transfer from Rhode Island Henson was second Team all League a season ago then its Austin and feder Rico down low threes off the mark from Henson thats the shot you want to start with there hunter gets the nod at the point for Clemson Gerard the Saku transfer and Wiggins shefflin and hall for this taller Clemson team as Hall missfires Applause Music Carrington trying to get downhill and he turns it Music over Hunter no Hall on the follow and Clemsons jumped out to a 40 lead Clemson doing a great job returning defense and the offense there freshman coming down had a little bit of turnover issue here lately first time he tries to get aggressive causes another one and they have to do a better job they cant have turnovers leading into points Clemson coming off that huge win at Alabama on Tuesday it was just their second ever Road contest win over a nonconference top 25 team as Hall commits a foul for Clemson I think this Clemson team is as good as any team in the country I believe I think they have experience they have really good players I think when its all said and done theyll be among the top teams in this conference what do you think about the Tigers depth this season well well see the depth as the season wears on because the sophmores sophomores got to take a jump here we see one of the start sophomores in the starting lineup in Chanty Wiggins and whos usually on the uh on the bench but starting night because Jack Clarks out Hall has a quick four for the Tigers they jumped out to a six to nothing lead here in the first couple of minutes well one thing you notice is you can tell coach capable was concerned about the physicality of FR defense not so much there feder Rico feder Rico led the team with 39 dunks a season ago Pits on the Music Applause board Panthers off and running and an easy one for Zack Austin as he throws it down great job there turning up the defense himself these are two defensive teams the coaches are familiar with one another so there wont be much surprise this will be a physically hard for matchup the only thing the biggest difference in is the experience in the back court the guard play with Clemson fourth year guys fifth year for Gerard and the young back court for fitb ring fire threes an air ball collected by a tiger shein Falling Away has it blocked by Applause Austin Austin spinning and a whistle and a blocking foul they will count the basket great job there pushing the ball about pit getting in the paint not settling he hasitate threepoint line got in his spent I dont know why they didnt count that as an n one doing it on both ends M Zack Austin is a three and D guy that time does a great job going Coast to Coast turning defense and the Music offense rewarded on the other end with another cter foul I thought it should have been in and one form him so they call it on the floor pit Will inbound from underneath their own basket you mentioned Zack Austin 3 and D hes the only player in the NCAA from a season go that had 63s and 60 blocked shots the transfer from High Point and hes done it backto back years he has he struggled a little bit from behind the park here Applause early buckets hes not struggling with his 25th ACC May three on the year its tops in the conference Clemson scored the first six the last seven belong to Applause Music Applause pit and a foul in the open floor called on Clemson one thing we want to take a look at and see here is just seeing but Carrington get to the rim you know put pressure on the rim and this is Henson again you cannot leave him open just as such a deadly shooter knocking down shot from behind the threepoint line got Carrington pierces the lane lobs it federo on the second effort puts it through had to double clutch gets it down great drop great drop off there by Bob Carrington ACC assist lead assist leader at his size he can get to the paint Elevate over smaller guards and shoot or pass Wiggins the 611 post player stepping out and swishing in his third three of the Year gotten off to a slow start from behind the ark but again hes capable of knocking down that shot his versatility on this end of the floor as you can see his ability to switch and guard the ball you want to play for bra Brad brell you got to defend Music him a foul on Clemson it will send us to our first media timeout its a good one so far were kned up at at VCU Brad Brownell was the head coach then at UNCC Wilmington a loaded conference the CAA when these two guys were at the helm of their respective programs they played against each other they coached against each other I should say six times in the ACC but nine times when they were at Wilmington in VCU so these guys are very familiar with each other and have a tremendous amount of respect for one another three CAA tournament championships between the two of them Applause tied at nine almost 5 minutes into this first half three is short Henson offensive rebound pit tries to funnel it and its out of bounds to Clemson I know pick comes away with empty possession there but they got to be pleased theyre getting to the offensive glass theyre one of the better rebounding teams in the country so rebounding misses is a big part of their offense how much of an impact will the tempo today have on this outcome well as the season wears on you tend to shorten up your bench and I dont think itll matter for either team right now theyre capable of playing either way I think most team most teams will try to get to at least eight guys well see early in the year team you know as the benches get minutes crank up youll see Team start shortening up their roster in the bench a little Applause bit William jeffris is checked in for pit he commits the foul Dylan Hunter has entered for Clemson underneath Lefty hook Will Roll in for BOS Lia the transfer from UNC Greensboro great job there getting low position and I thought Diaz Graham was able to show and get back in time just didnt couldnt Al shot pit has their first lead after the three from Carrington Carrington needs to play well today just from a confidence standpoint hes played well early then he struggled the last three opponents have all been power five perform and hes just struggled a little bit with his shot so to see him knocked down a three there is Big Wiggins with the rebuttal his second three in this first first half he had two all season coming in from Beyond The Ark Im trying to show Coach brell I want to keep this starting spot loose ball and a tie Music up just moving the ball around in the perimeter its coming off that ball screen with him with carington you got to get out theres shooting almost 40 from three and just a great deep position there helped too much off and you reading the scou point coming into this game you look at him hes only two for seven you look at those percentages youre probably telling you guys hey we want to get there late on Closeouts and Wiggins comes out and bangs two threes now youre going to have to readjust that scouting report he has a good looking stroke chony Wiggins the sophomore whos been pressed into the starting lineup today turning the corner carington driveing kick three off the heel from low and Wiggins with the rebound for Clemson great find here by Carrington coming off finding jayen low got a good look there picking pop extra pass Gerard shot clock in the single Applause digits Gerard double comes Diaz Graham with The Rock and another jump and itll stay on this end with just two to shoot for Clemson Wiggins with the mistake there was telling him he had to switch he didnt want he didnt want him to come back and set the screen again and see Gerard coming out hes pointing trying to clear it out Wiggins looking for the hat trick Off the Mark and the rebound Applause Carrington good look there coming out of the Baseline out of bounds Clemson with numbers push past Hunter hero step and a block erased by jeffris itll stay with Clemson yeah those are the turnovers there that you got to be mindful of if youre buob Carrington its unforced turnovers no pressure just careless with the basketball these are the turnovers that lead to his lack of confidence there put country in Applause transition coach is going to come out and talk to the Freshman a little bit kind of calm him down remind him just to make the easy play coming into this one just 13 turnovers for the Freshman he has two already for Applause Music Pit Austin with the Applause steel Henson Dashs Baseline absorbing contact Diaz Graham underneath and another jump ball Zach Austin been extremely active hands here early in the first half with his second steal pushing the ball in transition hes we talked about it hes a three and D guy hes doing his part on the defensive in red shirt Jr wears number 55 to honor his mother Cynthia who passed away in 2017 at the age of 55 Austin was honorable mention all big South last season at High Point averaged 14 points and six rebounds he stayed home from what you s him stayed home and last year at High Point right up the road from his hometown timer at seven low on the handle the runner pops out and Pa with the Music rebound Godfrey gets downhill blocked at The Rim Austin bothers another Applause shot leg it turn around money thats pretty great job by Leed there getting in the paint playing off two feet being balance shooting the midrange jump shot Junior guard averaging 15 and eight rebounds which is amazing for a guard getting in there mixing it up with the bigs showing you he can do it on the offensive end as well all five pit starters have now scored and a Clemson turnover itll go back to the Music Panthers Austin just showing you hes a three and D guy coming in there telling him get this out of here got a tight game TI of here tied at 14 at our second media timeout and both coaches Rand off talk talked about the importance of hitting the glass coming into this game well its part of their identity for Pittsburgh I mean they were coming into this game theyre fourth in the ntaa and rebounding and if youre going to compete against them every team now emphasizes the glass and both teams we have nine offensive rebounds here early in this game so its its its a point of empasis of both teams lets see he can execute continue to execute it better Zach Austins been the man of the hour for pit what do you like about his game today hes super aggressive right now doing it on both ends of the floor I mean hes known for three and D guy but that time takes advantage of his size as a small forward at 67 coming out of timeout poing up point guard for Clemson its a great move just a great play call for Jeff down low plus one for RJ Godfrey all muscle at 68 230 lbs Godfrey showing you that physical size of his coming in and hinston tries to get around and he seals them off and takes it and finishes before feder Rico can come over and help its great job there theyre getting production we talked about young guys RJ gfre is one of those guys those sophomores that is looking to take a step looking to be you know we can lean on later in the season right now you get your minutes early you got to prove it to your coach so you can play late where have you seen the most growth from Godfrey on the young year well so just confidence and its just you know overall hes nearly averaging n and five on the year you know hes knowing what he is hes not forcing threes right now hes doing a really good job posing up inside and more importantly hes a versatile Defender so when youre young and you compete on the defensive end of the floor goes a long way he altered the shot on the other end hul a quick trigger off the back rim and the rebound to Applause pit low The Freshman on the handle Runner with the left short Paul claims the miss pull up Hunter no and its claimed by lean lot of pressure on the back for the pit and we know we talked about so much about L bu Carrington and what he means but jayen low here has a tremendous amount of pressure responsibility to settle his team down and run this team because of his ability to move to play with and without the ball theres not a lot of that with the pit team and has a lot on his shoulder but great F there and attempt to throw the log foul at The Rim itll put Federico Federico at the line here are those freshman guards for the Panthers that you noted low and Carrington low rated higher Carrington you were telling me this week coach cable and even Carringtons dad were talking during the nonconference we knew he was good but we didnt think hed be this good right away I dont think anybody I joke with Jeff when I said if everyone knew he was going to be this good youd have been fighting Blue Bloods to get him and I think he found the right coach that fits him perfectly but he is an extremely talented young man and I know his dad well his dads here just funing watch him grow and no one knew he was going to beat his scope I mean he just was you knew he had the talent of potential to be really good but this good this early in your first game with triple double he just kicked the door open and said Im Music here tied at 16 after missed free throws from Federal Rico Gerard yet to get loose pit has bottled him up Corner three Hunters an air ball and a foul and itll stay on this end yeah I think Gerard is just making the right play right now he knows hes on a really talented team he doesnt have to force anything where I think at you know Syracuse in years past he had to be really aggressive now he can just let the game come with him because he has really good players around there top returning scorer in the conference from a season ago underneath Hall with a reverse layup and pit loses the big Clemson up by two its always a good idea to get the ball inside the PJ Hall whenever you can he knows the more he gets the big man involved the more to ease things up for him go carington blocked by the glass Clemson has no numbers sheflin a power dribble and he finishes down low what you see there is just a difference in experience carington gets deep jumps in the air doesnt unsure of what he wants to do takes the ili shot on the other end Chase hunter gets deep finds his teammate and they finish it just a difference in experience that little bum cartino figure out at some point here early in his career but Clemsons on a 60 run until that move in basket from fed Rico he does a really good job of just hanging in dunker spot relying on penetration they wont give it to him a score inside but he hangs around the paint knowing his job is to defend and rebound and finish the bunnies off when when assisted to from his teammates comes out to help on Gerard the throw back and the three from Hall is down thats what makes this team so dangerous right now Pauls ability now hes healthy hes knocking down that threepoint shot at a high clip and you dont want to switch your guard on him so that time fed Rico feder Rico had to help and try to get back if hes knocking down for three hes not going to get back to him offensive rebound Federico back out to Carrington three Clemson Tigers over six 11 have hit threes on the season theyve got three threes from two of them today absorbing contact the banker will fall for Applause Hinson great job by hon there getting into the mid post and absorbing the contact and finishing strong Hunter blocked from behind trouble pass out of bounds to the Applause Music Applause Panthers PJ Hall just show you wow hes hes playing as well as anyone catches it low inside there showing you he as difficult of the inside outside player as there is in the ACC hows it going here early up three versus pit the urgent need for cancer research this is gamechanging research that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research please just over seven left in this first Music half Clemson by three pit with the Music ball legit pulls up shefflin clears for Music Applause Clemson Gerards first attempt rattles in we knew it wouldnt be long before Joe Gerard got going there he just been patient letting the game come to him in such a gr started out adjusting I thought a bit to what Clemson was asking of him and playing without the Brad a little bit but you knew hes just such an elite shooter you knew he eventually start knocking down shots largest lead of The Game Belongs to Clemson all the way in for the easy one Dylan Hunter and Clemson leads by eight another one of those sophomores we talked about getting playing time that thats adding to the depth of this Clemson roster coach Bell talked about hes forced his way in the lineup and forcing him to playing whats working for Clemson during this run I think theyre doing it on a defensive end everything that gets is Applause contested tough fallway Falls for lean great job by lean there great spit pass catches it drivve to close out stop shoots the midrange jump shot Clemsons made five of their last six on this end put a little bit of defensive adjustment there they switched now theyre doubling the post deep in the shot clock Gerard has to hoist Austin has the rebound for pit lead pass feder Rico Leed bumping with Beetle flips it up no whistle and a miss and theres that Clemson physicality yeah you got to try to stay on your feet there cuz when you fall down you you you put your team in a cross matchups there pitch struggling to get matched up here Wiggins bit fortunate enough there to come away I always say this as a guard when you drive you got to you cant hit the deck you got to try to stay on your feet stay balanced pit did a great job there playing four on five defense pit winding the rebounding battle but shooting just 38 on this end and they turn it over for the fourth time its another one of those plays there above carington getting deep and undecided in what he wants to do in pass or shoot just needs to learn to play off two Music feet Timeout on the floor Clemson leads it 28 to 22 with four and change left in the first a Clemson by six with Randolph chis Im James wrestling Clemson has a team 4 for2 from downtown in this first half Joe Gerard entering today 314 career threes seventh among active D1 players he already has one today and this is a different Clemson team from what maybe tiger fans have been accustomed to they really shoot it well from downtown they got four guys shooting over 40 and when you got a guy like PJ Hall inside hes going to draw coverage so continue to expect them to knock down threes but take a bunch of Threes whether they makeing them or not theyve gotten off to a great start here early in the season they were 11 of 21 over 50 from downtown in that win at Alabama on Tuesday shefflin midrange and Henson clears for pit sheins kind of The X Factor for Clemson when he gets aggressive and he gets to SC then theres Five Guys on the court that you just have to guard at all times and usually hes the unselfish guy looking to make plays for others caring 10 gets the friendly bounce shoot his touch there by the Freshman so comfortable hisid shot there yeah hes just so comfortable getting to his midrange and thats where he is most comfortable at midrange shot getting to that right hand and shooting that midrange shot coach cable told us 90 of his attempts are jump shots yeah hes comfortable with him most teams dont most guys dont like that but he understands it midrange is where hes most comfortable and for his size I think thats an adjustment that hell get more comfortable getting in the paint and and realize that hell draw more help and and hes a willing passer but hell be able to find his teammates better if he gets in the paint a little deeper at times crimsons missed their last five shots a scoring drown up over three minutes pit climbing back Hinson Corner three wont go and shefflin with the Applause rebound almost a mistake there by Wiggins helping Off The Corner Drive and fortunate from him you definitely dont want to help off Henson Gerard quick trigger and its down I think he saw us talk about him on that threepoint shooting list and decid he wants to climb that list he has someone in his sights there two for three today thats career number 316 from Beyond The Music Applause Ark low in some trouble Hinson quick trigger two strong and Wiggins with his fourth Music rebound Wiggins catch and shoot shefflin another rebound for the Tigers Gerard from the top and he hits the dot three threes for Joseph Gerard in this first Music half Timeout on the floor all right at Jersey Mike alongside Randolph children Im James wesling and Randolph Joe Gerard is heating up yeah he started with a little slow didnt shoot the ball wasnt as aggressive and thats change K quickly and you got to get to him from behind the arc hes just get to pick and choose Lo his moments there coming off the ball screen they late to switch that time offensive rebound he finds him outside the threepoint line he knocks it down again and scary sight for this team hes a big addition one of the reasons Ive had Clemson so highly ranked and thought of in the ACC this year and actually throughout the country theyre a really good defensive team and now they got so much versatility within this offense and a big part of that is Joe Gerard preseason picked fifth in the conference poll theyve built a 10point lead their largest thats coming off ACC win season a year ago yeah Id be shocked if they finish Below in top fifth I I think theyll finish a lot higher thats just my thought of this team with the additions of he and the guy Jack Clark whos not playing tonight but hes another guy willing Defender capable shooter not many teams offer a 16 17 game score at the efficiency of Joe jard pit needs a bucket lean he delivers Leed is so critical for this team because of his experience he realizes hey we settled for some jump shots we shot a couple times behind the three we need to put our feet in the paint put pressure on the rim and that time gets to his midrange and knocks it down Paul battling goes with the left rolls across the rim out of bounds and its back to pit good thing for pit on the defensive end they have size and length theyre going to have bodies to throw at PJ Hall I mean he has some size but they got multiple sevenfooters with the Diaz Graham Twins and feder Rico feder Rico that they can rotate thats 15 fouls when youre playing a guy like PJ Hall you might need all of them Carrington off the bounce his three barely scrapes the Music rim Gerard gets the whistle plus one so good you cant speed him up so dangerous he gives a little head fake behind the threepoint line there he sned down three threes already you got to go for it just stops bodies you pump fakes gets even experienced guy like leged off his ground and a chance at another threepoint play the hard wi has a game high 11 points cans the free throw 82 Marksman has given Clemson an 11point lead with 45 seconds left in this first half thats what you see the difference right now just the experience in the back court of both Music teams missed three from the top from Diaz Graham Gerard three around and out offensive rebound and a foul out near midcourt Applause Sunday its a womens basketball double header here on acc Network first at noon Florida Gul Coast versus Duke followed by Kentucky against number 22 Louisville you can catch all the action also on the ESPN app Bal was on Hinson his Applause first Clemson gets the hold for the last shot here expect some type of play through PJ hall or some ball screen action with Gerard Gerard has scored the last nine points deep in the timer of three short from Hunter Clemson fighting and Godfrey was out of bounds pit will have it with just under two seconds left before the half half time couldnt come at a better time for pit whos struggling right now from the field and get a chance to get in and regroup get back in this game pit averages 855 points per game on the year theyve been held to 26 thus far and Carrington wont get a shot off thatll send us to the break Clemson by 11 its 37 to 26 freshman group that is now sophomores and this will be a tough team no matter who they play Applause sheflin long pass and its stolen by carington the first half numbers pit shot just 38 Leed third three of the game for pit they had started just two for 10 leers come out really aggressive and he was aggressive to start the game early hes experienced enough and theyll need his his experience to get back into this game and got a couple of midrange shots and knock down his first three there just Carrington anticipating that weak side and pushing it up and giving it to his backourt teammate jab Joe Gerard and gets Applause ranging its a big match up here with leged and Joe Gerard two experienced guys and leged loves the defensive matchup he takes the best perimeter player on the other team deep in the shot clock Chase Hunter has to fire Austin had a big first half for the Applause Panthers Carrington underneath Henson was quiet just five for Henson on T of six shooting gets on track early in the second with that one just does a great job just getting to his Spot Shot fakes drives gets to his spots just elevat just such a quick release just needs a little space to get off get that shot off second pit Steel in the first 90 seconds of this second half Harington Roars in scooper with the left no wanted the foul Paul out to Wiggins for a three rebound and a foul it stays on this end you heard me talk about this earlier about young guards when you drive in the paint you got to stay on your feet because if you fall coming back you your its impossible to get matched up that time Clemson didnt get matched up they were able to get a shot and an offensive rebound thats something the young guys got to be cognizant of 10th offensive rebound for Clemson Gerard trying to hook it inside and a foul on the scramble itll be called on Blake Henson Henson nursing his ribs took a shot on The Spill kimson is coming out with the great intensity on defensive end feder Rico feder Rico with the length and leg is getting around on the inside theyre trying to get around at the night of post and theyre getting back in this game and theyre doing it on the defensive end of the floor Gerard step back pop his nails for Joe Gerard that is such a tough difficult shot going right for a righthanded Applause shooter he is climbing up the alltime threepoint scoring list for sure its is fourth three today Hensen Burrows cant power it in and Tapped Out stays with Clemson make it pit I should say I mean just catching it and Legas gets really aggressive and steps back three thats almost impossible to guard theres nothing you can do but just tip your hat tell get shot Hons Corner three is there or you can just give it to that guy say go back at him I think that that works better fourth pit three second for Blake Henson leads the conference with 26 on the year Wiggins weaving and a Applause foul such a quick release he comes off the Baseline out of bounds play and just he hands down you better get up and have him in his face cuz that release is so quick he doesnt Elevate doesnt need to knocks that down but on the other end this shot comes because PJ Halls ability to knock down three forces you to rotate from the weak side and then Wiggins just drives a close out and gets draws the foul Wiggins has had a nice game seven points with the free throw its also grabbed three rebounds getting his first start of the Season today he looks like hes trying to keep it KN can now shots and rebounding the ball hes going to make it tough for Bernell to for Brad to put him back on the bench cans them both and Clemson leads by Music eight were extending their pressure a little bit on on both Carrington is talented as he is trying to speed him up a little bit as opponents have tried to do against this young man last couple of games down low Austin a hop step nice pass and a foul hon will head to the line pit has not made a free throw today theyve only attempted two theyre over for two as a team scores just know how to score Zack Austin on the post up Henson with the cut off the post and you know when you score like this you just find ways to do so and gets to the line for two Music shots tonight the Huddle crew will have their annual selection Day special a twohour show this year thatll include breakdowns and Analysis of the accs bull bound teams in their matchups our coverage starts at 6 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN Applause app just unbelievable news today with Florida State not making it in the college football playoffs just unbelievable year they had doesnt take away for the greatness of the year that they had know everyones disappointed with that but salute to you semal for a heck of a year and that news with the college football playoff selection show broke the internet earlier today is PJ Hall drills another three his second of the game hes healthy and just knocking down hes knocking down that three shot and its changing your defense you dont want to rotate off of him but youre going to have to you dont want to switch and put your big on the guards but big man is shooting this well from behind the line it just changes everything quick shot from The Freshman on the other end to miss underneath Godfrey cant get it Applause down hson so good in their transition defense theyre taking away the transition baskets and foring you to play five on five Carrington a tough fallway gets it back pulls another Miss and Hall rips it Applause Music down Carrington just two for 10 from the field today as wiggin Roars in and puts it through but why do you think krytons having so much trouble against Clemson this afternoon oh I think its experience theyre just speeding him up and hes competing on a defensive end of the floor its just there a I think the adjustment that hes dealing with right now was that hes the focal point of this team now he goes from a recruit thats coming in you dont know a lot about in against mid major or low major competition to start the season they they get to the Florida game then the Oregon State game and then Missouri and then here against Clemson youre playing against High major teams and theyre focusing on stopping him and thats adjustment within itself is that theres a difference in being on The Scouting Report and then the focus of the scouting report and thats what hes experienced now Gerard draws a foul hell be at theine line when we come back Clemson by a dozen on the road trying to move to 7 and0 freshman back court of Carlton Carrington and Jaylen low and to your point Randolph you look at these last three games the competition has been ratcheted up with Florida Oregon State and Missouri and its not just the competition its just hes a focal point now when you start Jars career with a triple double and continue playing away to Carrington is play youre going to draw so much attention and he and L just getting baptism by fire here theyre throwing these guys in theyre pressuring them these are older more experienced players theyre playing against and uh you know just just the learning curve and thats just a great quote there by the leader of this team just saying hey theyre not struggling they learning and thats exactly what theyre doing on the other side how has Clemson been able to build what is now a 13point lead their largest of the game well having this guy Joe Gerard part of it I mean hes just silky move I mean he shoots it so well as we know and but hes so efficient and hes coming in as a proven scorer in this league a veteran guard and you can never have enough his backourt M whos really good Chase Hunter is struggling tonight he hadnt scored yet but theres no pressure with PJ hall theres so many weapons on his team and Wiggins and garrey theres just so many weapons and so many ways to to hurt you when the offensive end the floor and if you know Clemson theyre tough physical defensive team theyre going to do that this is this is one of the better teams in the country I just dont think people talking about and theres a reason why theyre the only undefeated ACC team theyre on a 70 run over the last minute 50 largest lead of the game for Clemson Henson trying to end the drought and he does its always a good idea to find that guy hes going to have to get some help someone else on the offensive end is going to have to step up and help him ishma Leed has gotten it going and hes had moments but theyre being led by their second team preseason all big man Henson had 22 on Tuesday against Missouri the rest of the team made just nine shots went N9 for 35 around him for 25 Godfrey able to feather it in so impressive to see these sophomores just stepping up we had questions marked we had we talked to Brunell about that about his young guys and you see them getting after here getting dirty on the floor getting after loose balls look at the hustle to force the tie Applause up just coming out here and just a great play coming out of it pin down there from fo Blake Henson and he knocks it down and they go right back at garrey goes right back at him in the post there nice jump hook theyre getting production from their bench and their sophomores and their bench players are just stepping up and its going to further add to how difficult it would be to beat this Clemson team Godfrey played only nine minutes per game a season too this year hes averaging almost nine points per game its always interesting to see sophomores because they take that freshman jump thats the first year youre on campus for entire and offseason you got a year worth of film as PJ Hall gets the easy bucket there no help on the cross screen and thats the other part of the game The Freshman got to learn it was a cross screen there by Bob Haring Carrington didnt help out and an easy Deuce Carringtons jumper is through hell make that all day he is s in his comfort zone when he get to that right hand in that midrange Applause shot Clemsons made three in a row in five of their last six Gerard has it poked out of bounds itll stay on this end with the Tigers they quitting these guys you can bet leged is taking that match up personally when hes hes going to make Gerard work for everything he gets lob out front hall bumped and fouled I think the most underrated thing to describe this Clemson team on the offensive end of the floor is just their versatility I mean they got big men knocking down shots that can dribble in and like that off the dribbling attack you guards posting up spacing the floor theyre just going attack you in so many different ways averaging over 80 points per game shooting nearly 50 as a team and the release of their bigs from the outside I mean they look like guards its just such a smooth shot from Hall and Wiggins among others just been attacking in so many different ways five out four out one in post up guards its just so much depth and talent Beetle beats the buzzer Miss offensive rebound Gerard pulls the Applause trigger Austin drives Baseline into traffic and a foul on Clemson this will put Zack Austin at the stripe good job by pit there pushing a Tempo there you got a you got a defensive possession you got to stop there push it try to score before Clemson sets their defense great job by Zack Austin there forcing a ref to make the call both coaches talked to us about just how physical they anticipated this game being and how important the rebounding would be Randolph its 3124 on the glass in favor of Clemson and they have 11 offensive rebounds yeah I think thats the biggest thing thats concerning coach cable here early this is one of the better rebounding teams in the country on both ends of the floor and Clemson has just come in teams are attacking that way missoui he did it last game and Clintons coming today and theyre attacking them the same way rebound Clemson BOS Lia has Applause it Panthers have not helped their position from the line just two for six as a team from the free throw strike Beetle has a big on him wraps around Diaz grah cant finish pit with the rebound an opportunity to run for Austin Austin bumped he lost it whistle and itll s by Austin yeah great job by Austin there driving Music there 1142 left Clemson leads it 53 41 on the road leads it by 12 big pictures some top 10 losses from just this weekend number one Purdue goes down KU and Yukon had an epic Thriller Georgia Tech picked up a big win its march here the first weekend of December it feels like yeah teams are still trying to find their identity and settling on some rotation Hensons fouled on a Applause three that foul there by Chase Hunter who struggled on the offensive end and usually really reliable even on the defensive end there and closes out late fouls Blake Henson you dont want to put him on the line for with three shots Henson is 63 for the year from the free throw line its the first he just gets caught on the screen there he goes under hits him on the elbow trying to get in his line of sight right there and but when you shoot it this well you just you know guys Rush at you so thats why hes always open on his shot fake cuz he shoots it so quick you got to get to him Pittsburgh struggling to score but Hensons doing his part goes two for three he has 16 of pits 43 points Applause Hunter big steps Gerard a clean look hell hit it every time his fifth three hes up to 20 points you can take that possession and put it on the clinic and just show it I mean just penetration kick kick kick reverse find the open Guy this is a connected unselfish group of guys and they are playing extremely high level leg it drops it in Le putting so much pressure on the rim doing a really good job getting to his spots had a great threepoint shoot is really comfortable getting in that midrange shoot floaters and midrange jumpers and knocking that down hes got a really he has his hands full on the other end of the floor right now hes got Joe Gerard there a foul on Diaz Graham I mean look at this dribble hand off Forces help Drive close out kick kick and why not give it to that guy for with open three just so un selfish basketball by all these guys spacing is great you mentioned the connectivity that this Clemson team has is it rare to see a transfer just fit like a missing puzzle piece to a roster like Joe Gerard has for this Clemson team his list of schools he could have gone anywhere in the country so credit to coach reell I mean his you know the Clemson reputation throughout the league theres nationally they dont get as much credit as people do when they respect him and this guy is so critical to any team hes an experienced guy has played in the NCA tournament hes played with the ball off the ball I think the only transition and adjustment he had picking on was about hes had to play manto man now he went from playing Zone his whole career now hes got to get in the defensive stance he probably hadnt done that since hes like 10 years old its been a Applause while hes done a great job tonight on these pit guards carrying 10 wipe off the basket a foul on the floor on the dribble Drive yeah its been a seemingless transition for him and so little pressure in the depth of his team gets to come out hes playing well on the offensive end now and he just got multiple guys h a tough shot he cannot lose him does a great job coming off screens getting his feet ready and that great quick release has 19 here trying to will his pit team back in the game Henson and legot have combined for 30 of their teams 48 they need some help Paul gets it down Paul is just saying hey I know youre talking about youre in the talks of player of the year but so am I responds with a midrank jump shot hit was on a 10 to three extended run layup rolls off for Carrington Paul hits the deck Clemson basketball much to the dismay of the Oakland Zoo here in pit again he tacks you off the dribble gets to a shot little Fade Away over feder Rico feder Rico there and telling the zoo sh quiet down over there I thought he long as they kept possession he didnt have to call it but you cant argue theres contact there he goes down with the ball that was the eighth team foul on pit Clemson at the line in the one and one yeah what you dont want to do is have that that kind of foul put points on the board as it does for PJ Hall thats the one thing about playing against Clemson as well too when you get down by double digit against these guys theyre so good defensively so physical and Its just tough to make up a ton of points you got to start this now you cant wait till three or four minutes left in the game you got to start shipping away well you got time Paul splits the pair 83 s from the line for the year the 611 big who leades the ACC at 21 points per game Hall Throwing It Off The Hip of Henson what a play from PJ Hall wow just big man man how many big man out there 610 doing this gets the deflection on the perimeter chases it down I mean look at this hes out threepoint line defending gets this ball saves It Off throws it off H just a great play talk about him on the offensive end hes showing you hes a twoway player hes smiling cuz hes healthy right now hes anyone thats been injured knows how that feeling is you get back youre healthy playing with a level of love and joy for the Music game Clemson by 11 theyve LED most of the way by double digits oh Catch and Music Applause Release whistle and a blocking foul called on Joe Gerard great job D pit trying to make defense in the offense you got to run before this defense gets set pushing it you had numbers oneonone there youre in the bonus put pressure draw fouls get to the line and more importantly it stops the clock seventh Clemson foul ishma leot has made 21 straight free throws 90 from the line this season hes only missed four all year long hits them both to trim it to Applause nine Paul oneonone with feder Rico double comes Wiggins is open and he makes some pay from the elbow Beau want to dble double him that far from the basket there you give him a chance the best thing you want to do when youre big and youre getting doubled is turn and face you get to see the double team Easy Pass Easy Shot kington answers through and a timeout with just over 8 minutes left Clemson leads at 61 52 Blake Henson dancing his way to 19 points but PJ Halls had the answer quieting down the oak L Zoo okay were down by Clemson has built a 9point lead with 811 left they lead it 61 52 PJ Hall with 17 points and nine rebounds on just 11 shots whats impressed you most about his game today hes just doing what he does I mean he hasnt really impressed me because I know hes a great player and everyone else does too and no one knows that better than Brad brell and Jeff cable they just this guy justes has it at all three levels and thats rare from a guy thats 610 and hes coming in shooting 41 from behind the arc and hes knock down a couple threes T nighted hes just hes healthy he looks like hes enjoying the game hes having fun and when its all said and done hell be right there when the player the year conversation is done hes one rebound from another double double in his career and this Clemson team led by PJ Hall would be a force to deal with all year long 18 in a row in double figures for PJ Hall Applause oh twisting and hes able to put it through I mean he doesnt need to bury you deep he just gets it there it doesnt matter where he gets it from he turns over either shoulder hes making this look easy in feder Rico feder Rico is one of the better defensive bigs in the ACC Henson plus one hes up to 21 points they had they hadnt had an answer for Henson either hes hes coming right back hes putting his pit team on his back catching that there driving the big man getting the and one pit trying to come back here in the pet okay get this right and at the under eight pit Trails by nine with Randolph Cham James West you look at hinsons numbers five points in the first half 16 here in the second on five of six shooting whats been the difference for Blake Hinson hes just coming out and hes you know punishing matchups I mean hes has that great quick release so hes deadly from threepoint line we talked about that but what hes doing a great job of is playing off that two shot fake and driving and when he gets his matchups in the mid post he just shoots right over you too strong on the free throw last touch by Clemson I think offensively for Henson the only thing hes not done great this year is free throw shooting hes which is surprising hes has a great release great quick shot release a three ring the B he just needs to back up hes too close free throw line watch him 15 foot you can shoot it from 25 ft he just shoot his free throws from 25 ft thats what he should do he is shooting better from three today than he is from the foul line changing things up here to back in their 131 Zone D rebuttal is money trying to make a run you try to change things up and go to your Zone and Clemson was prepared for that you screen the corner Gerard just knocks down an open three just a tough tough play against his only guard six three of the game for Gerard just moved up another spot in the alltime ACC career threepoint leaders list and a walk down low pit turns it over back to the Tigers he just passed Justin Gray another fellow Demi Deacon friend of mine head coach of Western Carolina and theres a physical play here on the defensive end of the floor just walls up on him and just great defense just bodying him up and Pinon tried to get an Applause angle Wiggins second thought three halfway down and out and an over the back foul called on cheffin they finally got in front of him and boxed him out he has seven offensive rebounds he was trying to get eight there these type of fouls theyre big in games because you go from scoring the offensive into now youre giving up points on the line great block out here by Zach Austin Austin averaging eight points and six rebounds per game 67 free throw shooter for pit just keep chipping away if you pit just youre at the bonus knock down your free throws here plenty of time here to get back in this Applause game pit as a team seven of 13 from the line just Music 54 Austin goes two for two see if they go back to the man or the Zone here and think they going to stick to the Applause man this guy Chase Hunter does not have a point hasnt had to score but he is a closer hes the type of guy that can step up when the game when they need a basket and make a play here Hall from just below the foul line hoists up an air ball everybody shoots those he just laughs it off he wont hesitate to shoot the next one I can promise you that sevenpoint lead for Clemson Carrington the midrange savons its down to a fivepoint lead get into that right hand shooting his comfortable midrange jumper going right time out Clemson the lead has shrunken to five Clemson 66 pit 61 as we head to a timeout The Freshman guard Carlton Carrington now up to 11 points Rand off yeah he just comes off there theres no help there he gets to the elbow and just knocks down that midrange jumper and at his size he gets theres he doesnt see anything but the rim and really comfortable doing that I thought he could have turned the corner and got to the rim I think thats something hell add to his game here going for for but hes 11 and six and hes getting close to his average and like I said six assists is right on par for what he does and that number only Ares at his size and vision leads the ACC with 59 assists per game as you noted he has six also he had those three early turnovers hes not turned the ball over since hes game slowing down for him hunters in the book his first points we talked about it I I said it before the break I mean hes a guy he hadnt scored yet but hes a closer hes a guy hes a gamer when the games on the line they comfortable putting the ball in his hands hes had gamewinners before and steps up coming out of a time out the shut the run down for pit H had 13 in the second half against Alabama on Tuesday leg it bumping and a shove and a foul called on Clemson Gerard this will put pit back at the line great job by Leed by not settling there driving takes the contact and forced the official to call because it was either out of bounds or foul and fortunate for pity he called the Applause foul leg gets three for three today from the line no one on the floor for with four fouls everyone with couple guys with three and shooting from every foul here R out in the last five minutes of the game so free throw shooting is Big its back down to five the margin Clemson on Applause top Hunter off the head fake and he draws a pit foul again thats one of those plays The Freshman will learn from Hunter shot the midrange shot before he had his first bucket of the game and got him on got him leave his feet here enabled him to get the angle and cut him off right there Force contact get to the line just a veteran play just using his experience get the Freshman to get points second foul called on Carrington and Hunter an 85 free throw shooter barries the first to push the lead to six this is what makes this team dangerous I mean youre talking about Hunter hadnt done much all game long being quiet and here in the last five minutes hes making plays this free throw might be the last four points for Clemson back to a sevenpoint lead for the Tigers off to a 6 and0 start this season their best since 2008 carington a three off of screen around and out Henson double clutch three its good a shot there by Henson Hunter cant counter look for a ball screen here with two man game if you switch it they going to throw it back to Henson and hes just going to shoot over the smaller Defender Hinson is tied a career high with 27 this would be a 30 burger its rounded out stays on this end with Applause pit hon chases that down when youll score your score is looking for it knocks down to 27 point we have a game here come back and join us after the break Food Lion official grer of the Music ACC alongside former Wake Forest Sharpshooter Randolph chis Im James wesling Randolph these two teams shooting the cover off the ball in this second half both of them over 50 from the field and riging in threes left and right well Blake Henson right now is the hottest guy floor I mean hes got 22 in the second half and hes knocked down six triples on the other end for Clemson I mean what can you say Joe Gerards been answering Bell for Bell he got it going early hes cooled off here a little bit lately but hes in such a Groove as well from behind the ark what a matchup nightmare for opponents when looking at pit Blake Henson is 68 230 and maybe the best shooter in this conference what they do a great job of is that youll see him like last possession hell set that rub screen or ball screen to top and if you switch it hes just so big and so tall he just elevates over your the smaller guard fourpoint lead for Clemson Leed bumping and scoring and its down to a twopoint Clemson lead a whistle and a foul down low on Henson thatll be his third itll put Clemson at the line great job here with the call out of a timeout putting Joe Gerard who we talked about early a comfortable playing in zone isolates him in manto man against ishmail Leed drives get to lay at The Rim makes it a one possession game Applause here sheflin gets the bounce chefin is just the ultimate glue guy he just does a little bit of everything you need a three knocks him down you need free throws knocks him down defend rebounds just has such an impact on the game and he doesnt need the ball to do so he has a game High 13 rebounds seven offensive boards for this Clemson team both free throws gives Clemson a fourpoint Applause lead feder Rico downhill a miss and a foul on PJ Applause Hall F Rico there caught PJ Hall by surprise he wasnt expecting him to turn and drive there and got the angled and PJ didnt like the call I thought he got him but great call there a Miss on the first one fic just a 46 free throw shooter yeah hes struggling from the line right now and thats the difficult thing about bigs this lant games its hard to put the ball in your hands when youre not shooting free throws well hes missed his four free throw Applause today pick with an empty possession there lets see how Clemson comes back choose to attack look for Hall in a high low action Applause here shein on the SLP puts it through as you said great slip there Mr xfactor do it all slips the screen gets the Applause Finish Music and a steal from Hall sheflin peels it back to Gerard Clemson will run some clock with 220 left leading by six Hunter rice is for a Applause three Carrington stop it start feder Rico needs some help lean cant drill it shefflin his 14th rebound thats a play where feder Rico needs to position himself in a dunker spot underneath the rim so when he receives that pass he just needs to go up and finish that time spread himself a little too far from the rim and didnt feel comfortable shooting it pck comes away with empty possession pit always good at home if one t number last 11 is Hall gets the bounce on the three friendly roll he is so talented on the offenseive been the floor here he just does it all 22 points and 10 rebounds ninth career double double for PJ Hall and a foul putting pit at the line usually does so much of his damage inside the post tries to post up fto Rico does a great job tipping out of his hand and PJ har wson with a three ball in the corner pocket in his eyes for playing good defense unfortunate luck if youre a pit fan but this young man is having a heck of a year right now with his second double double of the year and so fun to see him healthy and this is what Clemson did on Tuesday at number 23 Alabama they were actually down in that game by seven with 12 minutes left then they held Alabama scoreless for over the next 6 minutes of play and here today theyve held pit without a field goal for over three minutes of action to build this eightpoint lead oh experienced group of guys they know how to dig deep when it matters most and theyre so difficult because even in this matchup they have multiple handlers thats experiencing and really good free throw shooters and opposite of P when we talking about bigs too PJ Hall shooting over 80 from the free throw line theres no one to foul under a minute left eightpoint lead for Clemson trying to put this game on Ice Hunter Roars in offensive foul and a turnover great job stepping in there by Blake Henson not a shot blocker but he good really good position Defender comes over to help hes definitely there by the time Chase Hunter leaves his feet hes standing there outside the No Charge easy call for the ref Henson has 27 of his teams 69 Music points 40 seconds left pit has to go full length of the floor down by eight Carrington against shefin and he draws a Applause foul thats usually what pits going to get into late when they need a basket when when Henson has it going like this run a ball screen if you switch it either Carrington or the guard attacks off the dribble usually hell throw it back to Hinson and he elevates and shoots over the smaller guard but tries to back him in and post him up Carrington two for three from the foul line today up to 13 points has six assists and four rebounds and also more importantly zero turnovers here hes showing you growth in games hes just got to put that 40minute game together and as hes adjusting to the focal point of teams pit has to foul Gerard and thats who Clemson wants at the line an 82 foul shooter for the Tigers yeah you dont have a lot of options here and who you can foul at times against you and they got so much experience and ball handling on the floor Clemson by eight its been a businesslike attitude for the Tigers on the road they have led nearly wire to wire pit LED for just 90 seconds at the onset Chases brother comes in Dylan Hunter and theyre making an offensive defensive substit U there taking Joe Gerard out of the game youll see Joe Gerard come back in here in a second yeah theyre going to go off his defense leaves him in on the offensive end and experience free throw shoot a ball handler when they cant take him out on the offensive end I mean defensive end Paul and Clemson can dribble out the clock ninepoint win for the Clemson Tigers they extend their winning streak over pit to 11 straight good win here by Clemson and Not only was it a win its a road
