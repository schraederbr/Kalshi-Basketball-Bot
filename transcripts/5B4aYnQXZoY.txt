playing very well this is a really good matchup between these two guys tonight Curry and asadulla and there you see El Ellis I think he is the biggest key for Louisville a satchelor the only player in Ace on history with 1500 points 800 rebounds a 300 assists in his career you will see an excellent pass in big man and we are set to go here Matt Potter tossing it up our officials Jimmy lucky Matt Potter and Remy stallions and here we go LLS with the ball cards did turn it over 22 times on Saturday against Ford a m cards going with Mike James L Ellis Brandon Huntley Hatfield Sydney Curry and Jalen Withers this is the starting lineup we have now seen for 10 of the third 11 of the 13 games the cards are playing yeah and getting off to an early start here to see how you deal with a little success as Huntley Hatfield takes a shot and misses that one how you deal with a little bit of success that youve had now in the last week against a very good Lipscomb team who can really score it Darren Boyd to assadula kicks it over to abenham and Trey Benham is three off the bat these they have a lot of guys as were gonna have a foul down low Sydney Curry fighting for position down there and that Fountain is going to be on it Venom who missed that threepointer just a second ago they are a coach the Lipscomb Bisons by Lenny Acuff 600 career wins uh very decorated career in division two where he went to 11 NCAA division two tournaments at Applause Music Applause it has been look Louisville gets does a good job as Jalen Withers draws a foul Louisville gets possession under the basket and then just cant get it in balance that has been an issue with this team this season for Louisville the Cardinals averaging over 17 turnover of the game card get a turnovers Jalen Withers Dives on the floor for Here Comes L Ellis he had a career high 30 points in the cards first win of the season last Wednesday over Western Kentucky and Jonah they had 13 threes in that game and a good start for Ellis and it is again youve seen the first couple possessions Pruitt on Ellis he is athletically could can go by Pruitt that time he was backed off a little bit so if youre going to leave it here Im just going to shoot it the cards are probably gonna have to make some threes to win this game Brandon honey with some good post defense knocked it away from Jacob and then download the card to turn it right back over here comes will Pruitt coming off that career at 27 point effort and hes going to get a charge a little late on the game but the charge is that LL stood in there and took it on a driving through its the correct call by Jamie lucky just a little late all the calls you see Kenny Payne there last week finally getting that first victory of his career over Western Kentucky and following it up with one where they didnt play as well on Saturday against Florida a m but they got it again I think early in the year Louisville loses that game to Florida a m thats what this team has done theyve improved a little bit on some different things Withers with a big size advantage of the post but he hooks Venom and hell get called for the foul at this end a lot of stars out and you win games and the Stars start to come to your games Jody weve got new U of L head football coach Jeff Brown The Stance camera what is in the stands the former Buffalo Bills hes actually not in the stands hes right next to the quiz a better seat than us Lipscomb with three turnovers in their first four possessions Applause through it the Boyd from Crawford County Kentucky and then you see asato hes just crafty in the post hes not athletic but he can pass and he can score at the basket although this year its something hes only shoot 48 percent so far this season a size with over only five games where hes played over 25 minutes this year and thats because of foul trouble almost every game hes been getting into foul trouble hes got to stay out of that for the Lipscomb to have a shot here tonight 46 he shoot him but he got that one in and then a missed by Ellison then offensive rebound by Withers back up its blocked by assadula from behind thats something you dont expect to see too much from him but Boyd all the way to the basket and the lefthander gets it up and in off the glass for a 43 bisons lead now Boyd can score it he had averaged 197 points last 167 points last year at Georgetown College hey uh allconference guy there for three years they average 16 points both seasons he played for the Tigers one of the real NAIA Powers as we see with the spinning finish and thats where Louisvilles got to take advantage of this game physically they can take it to a Lipscomb on the offensive end if they dont turn it over and they get shots they should have some success at scoring theres a side Hill on Curry again he cant leave Pruitt Alice is doing a pretty good job of sticking with him as assadua goes to work and misses in close and the rebound crap by Withers up to James get it back to Withers and then the well kind of a circus shot but he made it I thought Mike James is going to take the shot and he said you know what I think Jalen Withers has an easier shot well he didnt but he still made it boy for three off the back of the rim and NASA that got the rebound but he was out of bounds itll be Louisville ball as they lead it 74 and Joey getting some good easy baskets on the break is something we didnt see for the first remember the offensive foul is one of those turnovers so Louisville taking care of the ball right now when they have the ball and on the offensive end and getting pretty easy shots thats a recipe for this team thats what you got to do you got to make it as easy as you possibly can to score freshman party lands checks into the cards hes having 11 points over the course of those two wins but get it for curry on the Baseline over a side healer that one off the side of the backboard and out of bounds and then deflected down announced by the cards itll be Lipscomb ball when we return cards lead it 74 Mike James to Jalen Withers and welcome back count for two Music LL is one for one from three here early cards lead Lipscomb seven to four and obviously Jody cant tell Jody Courtside here LLS is the number one option offensively before this team hes been out of late but what jumps out you know he didnt hit a three in the last game the winner of Florida again but he does have 17 assists and 10 turnovers in the last two games and thats a ratio that I think you can live with yes you have to live with that and its much better than what it had been for El Ellis and again he is more comfortable I think of what hes doing it helps that Fabio basilis gotten a few minutes as well to help him kind of off the ball a quick three by AJ McGinnis whos checked in the game assagily gets the rebound back to Boyd McGinnis they were trying to get into McGinnis but it was deflected by James and hes their leading scorer he misses the 15foot jumper and here come the cards with that 74 lead probably Hatfield back in the lane we saw him score its about that same spot earlier in the game cards with Ellis James Hatfield Curry and Kamari lands exactly blocked by James but he gets it back and puts it up and in they have McGinnis Pruitt Boyd assadula and agnoster coming forward right now for the Bisons as they are within one and Ellis is going to be able to I think get by most of the guys who are going to be guarding him this evening the question is what will he do with it once he does goodbye plans to James if they go inside here to Curry posting a passage for that but Ellis is going to pull the three instead and misses yeah and thats not a good shot right there hes got to do something with that or take that ball into the paint he missed on the one drive before he missed didnt shoot him one time before and then missed a bad shot Applause they tried to drive on Huntley Hatfield and takes the bump thatll be the first time hunting Hatfield the second team foul on the cards they bring guys in who can just score Off the Bench a lot of different guys uh four Lipscomb and we see McGinnis he played a year at Cincinnati and youre in UNC Greensboro hes a guy in high school was a high score he got just a ton of options for them to school you find that in just just about all their players also checking in the game for them is matchner who played a division three Emery and averaged 23 points a game last year for Emery I went to the NCAA tournament division three three times and theres McGinnis all the way to the basket theyve been following West Miller recruited UNC Greensboro went to Cincinnati with him and now at Lipscomb and he drives in to put the Bisons up 87 here in the early on JJ Trainor and then again for the cards now Alice in the paint loves it for trainer just a little bit high but Ellas able to get the rebound back James misses the wide open three something hes been pretty consistent an open three for the corner you feel pretty good about him taking it but boy loses the ball out of bounds you do feel good about him he felt so good about it he didnt even follow his shot up in that ball looked like he was going to go right to Boyd and he just mishandled it out out of bounds as Louisville gets Huntley Hatfield and Withers back in curry and James will get a break here and Im excited to see JJ trainer uh and see if he can continue Kent um his shooting that he has been doing in the last few games we saw when Florida a m made that game close he gets foreign Applause ER able to finish right at the basket we saw him hit a big three and then a big pullup jumper as Ford a m the Rattlers were keeping that game close on Saturday Applause morning drives and kicks it over the boy history from the corner is good yeah you cant leave Boyd open that much and he was wide open right there twotime MidSouth conference First Team all uh first team performer from Georgetown College he can score it he cant leave him wide open Quincy Clark had the assist there hes coming off a career high 15point effort in their loss at Michigan last time I like the fact that hunting Hatfield knows hes got a mismatch and hes going to the basket hes just got to finish thats two shots that hes come up short with Clark is not a threepoint threat but he is a scoring threat right banks in that jumper and all of a sudden its 139 dices Applause Brothers got to the basket but its a 92 run right now by milinskim over the last two and a half minutes like massive and pulls the chair up at three he got it you can make it a 122 run by the woods come by since they lead the cards 169 12 23 left here in the first half and they are starting to hit from d Applause we love our new

youll love the allnew kefir Mazda back to back threepointers by the lipscombiases the first by Darian Boyd from Caldwell County and Jody good offense it really was I mean Clarks not a guy who hes more of a scorer hes only got seven assists you saw that time though when he drove how many Louisville guys converged on him near the basket thats what coach Payne wants to see on the other end of the floor is he wants to see his team get that and he just flipped it out there Clark did to Boyd for a wide open threepointer Lipscomb on a 122 run cards with Withers Huntley Hatfield Ellis lands and trainer on the foreign Applause Applause Music Applause country and you saw it right there just a nice little Nifty pass for an easy bucket there from the Dennis Applause but he hit that big three for them Jody and its something that maybe as we see Withers get to the basket and score you dont necessarily necessarily expect from him if you looked at this years stats but for his career hes an excellent threepointer real threat out there yeah but this year just five of 26 before he hit that one Applause again in his 2011 Lipscomb and you kind of knew going into this one that the Bisons theyre going to be able to score they have some serious offensive Talent the question is the cars gonna be able to score with them and hes got some catching up to do here earlier with tamari lands gets bound on that Baseline jumper is it a two or three I couldnt tell from my advantage what is a three so hes gonna get three free throws and uh Jamie lucky just to ask are you sure it was three I think theyre gonna go look at it but it was really close right there that it is a threepointer lets hope it was a three for a U of L fans certainly hope it was a three because maybe the surest thing this season so far Jody has been Kamari lands at the free throw and lets take a look at it here takes the pass from Huntley Hatfield and he does get behind the line oh yeah close so hell get three 25 of 26 from the line so far this season six percent that was almost Taylor jinx were gonna get Cindy Curry back in here when the after the second free throw thanks Kamari ties his shoe there I like what Louisvilles doing they know they have a mismatch underneath him theyre going to the basket the problem is right now theyre missing easy shots Applause Music Guinness to the back foreign Music Applause Applause yeah and its right in front of the bench and and the coaches were up yelling at jail and Withers you know whats coming when he has that ball there you just called him I mean called it before he did it you know its coming its in The Scouting Report and Jalen just lets him go right behind well see if the cards can get Curry some touches down low Applause and Hatfield with seven on the shot clock hes probably gonna have to go to work here and he pulls the trigger on the jumper and hits off the background curry with the tip but snerd comes up with it and then Huntley Hatfield is going to come up with his second foul on that loose ball its the third team foul on the cards but the second on Huntley Hatfield and that might give him some time a little time on the bench that is I actually thought it was going to be a foul on CD Curry there he did a nice job of keeping it alive but thought he was over the back but they got Huntley Hatfield for the bomb the premieres is 2214 and the guy for them who scored 27 in their last game hasnt even taken a shot yet signs are looking for that back cut again heres battle off the Assad to the pick lands with some serious defense to Clark Ellis Payne a lot of attention to prove but now he leaves him just a little bit to leak into the lane well see if Clark is rejected by Curry at 19 seconds on the shot clock for the Bisons as theyll have it out of bounds really good defense and really good communication there by Louisville Applause Music especially into excitement that was a long 19 seconds so Kent Lipscomb three turnovers in the first minute and 45 seconds thats just number four right there so theyve done a really good job in the last nine minutes when theyve built this lead of taking care of the ball impressive too that will Pruitt is not forcing anything offensively coming off that 27point effort in Chrysler Arena foreign and then he gets three from behind the line 2217 a quick 60 Kamari lands ride Louisville being very aggressive doing a good job of communicating and doing some things on the defensive end in this possession just like they did the last time Clark almost took that and then heres Pruitts first shot of the game and he hits the triple and its 2517 Bisons yeah and again its he scored 27 a lot in their last game but theyve got so many guys that can fill it up they just dont force it and he for one uh its his first shot he is hes coming in hes gonna be 52 threepoint shooter trainer with a big offensive rebound and off the Ellis missed the guards are going to get another hes gone and it lands all the way to the basket with the defensive rebound Music we went to Schnur guarded by trainer back out to assadula hes going to try the three and I think uofl is fine with that yes Ellis to a leaking Curry what a catch him finish for the big fella and the cards are within six Jim Brown might like that he looked like a tight end running down the floor he fended off the defender of sajula and caught it with the left hand and then put it up very nice job by Sydney Curry signing days tomorrow you never know Assad would approve it in his first shot just a second ago back to the side of it lands with the deflection goes off James and then trainer with the same goes very awesome very good hustle there by Lands uh by the lanes first of all then James and then trainer getting it and then Ellis almost turns it over on the Baseline but that deflected off of the Bison so the cards will get it back they Trail by six 2519 Lipscomb Geico has been offering savings for over 85 years its longer than the

and Jody demling uh they are scoring early and often here on the cards yeah they really are at one point hit eight straight field goal attempts a 100 run helped open this thing up for them its down 2519 but you see a lot of different people and a lot of different pretty easy shots and open shots for looks coming as they started two for eight from the field since then nine of 12 11 of 20 overall three of seven from threepoint range there he made their second threepointer in the game a career 44 threepoint shooter including his time at Valpo but came in as you mentioned earlier just five for 26 early this season some uncharacteristic things from this Lipscomb team earlier this season sergeant not necessarily playing the way he had for his entire career but they seem to be playing pretty well now well and thats thats the the product of having more guys who are able to do that you know theyve done a good job of getting some guys in from different places and uh this is a team that is very very talented on the offensive end we see Sydney courage Applause and check again and the Freshman big man from Wisconsin draws a quick foul as Sydney Curry goes right at Grant Aspen six foot Tim and uh Curry just takes his time hes patient and then puts it up and gets the bucket and hes found Applause look at that first nine games less than two points and four rebounds a game in the last two games he has made absolutely on fire hes lost 10 pounds a new diet this is the free throw but guards within four and he does look different in a week I can tell you that Applause the thing about Lipscomb great job of moving the ball the ball is never still misses the three you have to watch out for asthma shooting the three as well the big fella seven of 18 in the early going so thats something that you necessarily dont get for massages even though we spawn fake one but uh you have to keep your eye on that with him on the court giving assago a bit of a breather here lands trainer Fabio basilia in the game for the Cardinals won the city three now Ellis and this is improved with a rebound for Lipscomb a little bit of a a not a terrible shot just a rush shot I dont want to see that I want to see them get the ball in the paint a massive egg right to the basket Applause gets another two for Netflix Applause did a such a good job for a stretch they were missing the shots but getting the ball to basket theyve got the advantage when they get the ball in the paint theyve got to just take advantage of it if I can even go right back to Curry here hes already got the basket here we go hes got the match up with wood he goes jumps in the lane and then cant get the jumper to go off the back of the rim Here Comes Boyd McGinnis has an open three and he doesnt hit it Applause the silly all the way to the basket on Pruitt but it rolls out birds have missed some shots at the basket already some easy shots again though thats what the plan its not that easy though a shot he could make but just kind of spun out youre on Sydney uh should have made that heres as we mentioned an inner glasses hes a capable threepoint shooter and then Alice with the rebound analyst of preassist and now two uh two rebounds on the ninth Fleet able to stay in front of Alice on that drive Applause Lance is aggressive at this end of the court time oh theres three off the rim and out of bounds the ball a bit of a lull of scoring for both uh teams here and Im watching Kenny Payne and Foxy could read his lips he just said the lands the exact same thing he said possessions like I want you to drive I want you to take the ball to the basket and when Louisville does that theyve been getting shots in that right there its not a shot that you uh that you want Withers trainer Curry Ellis and basily on the court for the cards Music Applause Music closing in now on three minutes Applause Applause but theres almost the return of the boys comes up with a six on the shot clock for the car its five trainers gonna have to shoot it Applause that little pullup jumper out he did not see that for him in his first couple years no hes confident with it I mean he didnt force that threepointer he knew he had a little bit of an advantage gets right by his man and takes the pull out I like that from JJ training now Tommy Murr if you give him some daylight Jody can he score it off he can score it quite a bit as uh through it off the front like oh what a tip to an awesome thing what a play by the big felon I dont know if theyre gonna yeah that is just a fantastic play just the tip right under the basket to his teammate for a reverse layup oh my God Applause basically the drive and the illadvised shot by Mur and heres Pruitt wide open through three cant as far as Dodge the bullets there you cant leave him open although two straight misses for him but the lead he is eight four of the Bisons theres a nine of 28 just three turnovers so doing a better job with that Music on the floor the sun has showing off his passing skill by completed by eight Geico has been offering savings for over 85 years its longer than the buffalo wings been around Music her lips are burning oh

Taylor Courtside its trivia Tuesday JT this is the third meeting between the Bisons and the Cardinals a little lips can play last into 2018 what year did they play before that it was okay I think we were on the call for that game in 2018 I dont know was it like 1923 or something youre youre close to its 100 I guess its 100 a guess try again try again a little a little sooner than that sooner 1911 before 1930 19 close 1936 okay 1936 Applause back in 1936 Jody who was the president of the United States well yes I knew that Franklin Delano Roosevelt 19 cents a gallon there you go Green Bay Packers won the championship look at that thats whats at the top of your Christmas list balsa wood models as Pruitt gets in for the layoff cards have got back within five on the withers three but then will Pruitt with the layup for Lipscomb as they are back up by seven Pruitt with Five Points here theyre not going to stop back door and theyre not going to stop cutting to the basket like they do and when they do that if Louisville doesnt do a better job defensively its going to continue to be more easy baskets five seconds on the shot clock Withers is in addition to James in the corn hes gonna shoot it one wow nice job there by James of actually realizing he had to get that shot off and not pulling the trigger from the three either he drove and got as close as he could but it was close but he got it in Boyds following jumper a sideway with another offensive rebound Applause Music fifth offensive rebound of the ninth so far for Lipscomb Curry comes up with the turnover and heres Ellis running on a side to see if he can draw a foul for a big guy he just beats him to the basket and lays it in yeah and again Elles just realized Im gonna get one thing Im either gonna get fouled or Im gonna get a basket and went straight to it without hesitation a little surprised the sideline didnt challenge him at all he does not have a personal foul and a half here Boyd gets to the basket but thinks better trying to shoot a recurring heres Murray hes got some offensive skills but he turns it over right to trainer and here comes Ellis on the break again and right now basket again two great plays by El Ellis to finish but Kent its the other end of the floor that Louisvilles doing it theyve picked up the intensity on defense 3332 when you order in the McDonalds app you and three friends could win free McDonalds for life with them a gold card in hand youll feel McDonalds rich ordering the app and you and your friends could win each week okay Im an alien if youre making a scifi movie you need to finish the special effects does that look good and if you want to save by bundling home and car insurance you need Geico Music cards with 12 points off turnovers impressive in this first half as they are turning it up defensively uh Kent Taylor and Jody Devon here and Jody back to back Force turnovers and layups by LLS at the other end yeah Sydney Curry gets the first one there and Ellis just goes right into the big fella and says guess what Im there well then JJ trainer comes down and gets one and he does the same thing and cuts it to one back to live action here agnostovic inside to assagila back out to Tommy Murr and he pulls the trigger but cannot hit the three score in high school Ive been wanting to say this the entire time Tommy Burr in high school scored 5716 career points he had 1226 free throws made during his high school career that is a national record that is a guy that can fill it up and he just missed an open shot Louisville Dodges a bullet there that was his chance to uh second most in the nations Dad Steve was his high school coach here we go about a six second difference between the shot clock and the game clock cards down one and LL is guarded by Pruitt out front Applause get a screen from Curry Pruitt stays with him Alice pulls the trigger on the three cant get it heres Boyd the Bisons are going to get the final shot of the half Applause five seconds Boyd goes on lands kicks it back to Pruitt and Pruitts three is way short at the buzzer and the cards and the half on a 92 run and after 20 minutes of play here in the KFC Yum Center Lipscomb with a 3332 lead on Louisville Applause whats going on welcome into this ACC Network
