team was decimated with injuries all year long and you cant play coach Hams system with 10 or 12 guys when youre limited with a six or seven man rotation so theyre finally healthy and theyre competing and theyre starting to play good basketball Florida State wins the tip in the home white Georgia Tech in the road blue and gold trim AJ desde Jamal Spearman Michael kits are officials inside to Malik Yan the J Cod trainer trans ER who has been excellent in League Play showing a little rope great sign to go to him early hes really been playing well to go to him in a post to attack Suare great footwork using pump fakes getting that angle putting the Sims up for quick Deuce Georgia Tech using its seventh different starting lineup today in large part due to all the injuries Terry a high pass in the first turnover gives it back to the seminal thats what the simal want to do they want to speed you up first turnovers Jord Tech has got to take care of the basketball find a way to get shots so they can set their defense jir Watkins not only the leading scorer on this team the lone returning starter from a season ago for Florida State and thats whats been important with this group is his leadership B Bowen for three hes starting to knock it down hes starting to heat up from behind three point line the defense and the talents always been there the shooting is starting to Applause come long pass ahead to Chandler Jackson he was trying to shuffle it to bbo and now up ahead to Terry oh what a reverse by the Georgia Tech leading score you can tell Malik Yan is seeing the highlights of Lance T in his athleticism he wanted no parts of trying to challenge him at The Rim oh deep three from Watkins and now Javen McAllen the Oklahoma transfer brings it up the floor being relied upon more as that was blocked by Yan and up ahead to Davis defense the offense that is this teams calling card thats their identity and whats happening Malik Yuan as a center his ability as we just saw to defend point guards or any guard on the perimeter without help is why this simal team was just surging now and creating so many issues for their opponents and now you see he rebounds and hes able to push the basketball so it makes them even better in in transition Davis for Applause three quick Pace to start this game here in Tallahassee mum the pullup and now Davis two on two not much of a resistance there from too easy just too easy there I think they had numbers and and George its does this team can afford to pick up fouls you see there they they know they have lack of depth right now theyre probably going to go five six deep I mean six deep maybe one other big coming in Ryan bambo will come in for a few minutes but theyre going to play with six guys and you saw him there not wantan to commit a foul only played six in the second half loss to Clemson Matumbo who started that game did not play in the second half and they lost Jaden moof for part of it he is out again today for Georgia Tech a column no from three that many teams has a big man that can guard you oneonone meet you at the rim and slap it off the backboard and start the great you cannot no one gives turns defense in the offense the way to sim and their length has been so disruptive particularly in games where theyve asserted themselves Randolph five out of the last seven games they have won defense has been a big part of it jir Watkins has led the way doing that but also the injecting Jak decoin Davis in the stting lineup and the way hes been attacking point Applause guards I thought he was the key to the pitch game he started out his defense against low I think catapulted this similar team over the win over Panther it was a 12point win for Florida State here at home that is a foul on Davis and it will send Duncan Powell to the line you never want to foul a jump shooter and its a bad foul by The Freshman Eric on pow Pals not a great shooter hes in the game hes only shooting 33 behind the threepoint line doesnt take a ton you like to contest but you dont want to foul Applause well Florida States offense has gotten off to incredibly slow starts during this threegame losing streak Trail 50 to 19 at the half in the lost to SMU earlier this week they went seven minutes without scoring a point in the loss to Clemson looking for something here a spark for Coach stms team against the Florida state group that is so disruptive defensively you want tool to Tempo and Pace but its challenging because youre playing this game as we talked about youre going to have a three guard rotation and youre going to rotate your bigs three guards you know the three bigs together and so youre trying to conserve files youre trying to conserve energy and the simuls just dont do that they want to play at an Up Tempo Pace speed you up as you see Yellow Jack is now falling back into the zone and theyll play a lot of Zone again dont have the bodies simal have well see how long they can they can hold in the zone well with Watkins hitting threes like that thatll challenge The Zone thats what thats acceptable Corner Baseline threes last thing you want to see you see the simal knocking down threepoint shots they deadly at attack in the rim but theyve struggled from behind the threepoint Applause line T to shoot Lance Terry still looking for his first point point and that was blocked Yan got a piece of it ball still on the floor and scooped up by Florida State double comes extra Pass open Applause three dang from downtown timeout Georgia Tech theres no let down with the seminal coach ham was concerned about the energy of his group that that question been answered theyre coming out shooting the lights out from behind the threepoint line Sims up Music early Georgia Tech head coach first year great building block of success had four quad one or two wins this year its been a different story Rand off in large part because of the injuries I mean its just been impossible they cant practice a lot they cant go up and down five5 theyve just been limited its been one injury after another and even Georges Miss time Jon McCullum has Miss n it just been so many injuries just hadnt had a chance to have any continuity in practice kaazi Reeves has not played a single ACC game and he was really turning into quite a player for Damon STM you see all the guys in Boots today for Georgia Tech three different players out with various lower body injuries not having kaas Reeves not having the shooter and OBrien it has affected what theyre able to do offensively oh absolutely and look at this group I I thought Jordan Tech team was the team that could take a step in a year where youre wondering outside of Duke wheres the accs going to go whos going to step up I thought they had a chance but theyve just been derailed with the injuries and the inconsistencies in the lineup in their production its just limited him so much they have not scored a field goal in the last three and 1 half minutes and McCollum ends that with a jumper in the lane theyve got to find a way to get by Dongo involved in this game he hasnt attempted a shot hes also a preseason second teamer and when they switch these ball screens were seeing the guards doing a lot of attacking but lets not forget the inside of Jord Tech they have guards on them and by dong goes a heck of a player hes got to get more touches and attack those heres Boston hold off the bench dang no but there was a foul and that will send Tang to the line lot a great ball moving by Florida State they knocked down a couple of Threes but theyre not settling great pass and great cut there well a big Tuesday night in college basketball first off in the SEC Tennessee one loss this year six ranked team that loss came to Florida Meanwhile your alma mater against North Carolina in a game that will have major March Madness implication it is I I think its a big opportunity for Wake Wars they have Duke and Carolina backtoback home games I think it gives the deakes a chance to elevate themselves in the odd of the committee Duncan Powell draws a foul on den and hes headed back to the foul line you Jord Tech you cant Panic you got to continue to space the basketball spread it move around but when you drive you got to be a passer when you drive this Florida state seal defense theyre collapsing they lead the ACC in Block shots and steals so when you dribble it youre going to draw a crowd they are a very physical team theyve allowed the fourth most free throw attempts in the ACC so if youre Georgia Tech maybe thats a recipe to stay in this game be competitive given the lack of rotational depth that they have with all the injuries so youre going to have to control the Temple of that theyre going to be aggressive theyre going to defend theyre going to foul but they have the bodies to do so and theyre just going to continue to rotate guys in and out so J Tech star need extend this Zone a little bit you got to keep the ball out of the middle youre Florida State you want to find the right Shooters 25 Thomas is one of those guys you got to know where he is at all times against the Zone Jackson with five in the lane the bunny wont go and a great rebound by by Dongo who is coming off his fifth double double of the season in the loss to Applause Clemson he got to get it going on the offensive end they got to find a way get the ball in his hands there he is on the low block defended by D back inside with five you cant settle the double teams coming first time hes touched so he had to let that one go get himself going I know the feeling play seven minutes of the game and not get a touch he was going to determin to shoot that one but great defense by the S Hulk for three oh what a rebound that was by Malo freshing Off the Bench 15 on the timer for Florida State dening left open oh Rings it in his second three thats a mistake cuz jury ding is the shooter got to know where he is when he gets in the lineup so completely just lost him and not communicating on the defensive end of the floor already four M threes in this game for Florida State a team thats averaging 6 and2 per game thats not their strength theyre knocking down threes theyre a tough out ball is sticking in a lot of dribbling got to move bodies and move the basketball right now great pass Terry is laid in and now theyre going to wave off the basket it was interfered with by Dongo and he didnt have to do it oh bigas McCollum had put it down just see a lot of frustration right there doesnt had many touches J Techs got a stle down they want to get back in this game call on the floor is offensive bat interfer PR plays under for off Music right Music Army please stand and Music Music Music Music well they just reviewed the call on the floor and it is confirmed by dong go after the call on the floor stands right there ball was already starting to rim back down on the Layin by Javen McCollum is this just the team pressing a little bit too much cuz theyve only made two exactly and then a really good player that hasnt been involved in this first half yet on the offense vend to to floorida and in this lineup theres matchups you got to watch out Florida state does so much switching the guards right now are doing predominant shooting because theyre attacking The Bigs but on the inside by Dongo and these bigs are are guarded by the guards they have a Mitch Match inside and theyre a little bit frustrated not getting touches and you know situations like that happen when youre pressing youre trying to do things and flot the state just being disruptive right now thats what they do so lets see if this zone right now works got a the biggest question they got to have now is can Jord take rebound out of this Zone Applause look ther state to get right there in the middle of that zone there and got to rebound it another offensive rebound leads to a h Second Chance points and Damon STM not pleased that would bu Don go out he was their leading rebounder he has six rebounds Jord tech only has seven so someone has to step up on the floor and rebounding his Zone and already eight of Florida States 21 points have come on Second Chances turnover the pressure this is what the what happens against CL theyre switching everything theyre denying theyre pressuring your guards just INSP just you get sped up youve got to remain calm youve got to slow down got to be smart about which youre doing get a get a quality shot right now Florida States getting whatever they want the midrange guys are getting to the basket the threepoint Shooters are getting looks behind the line and cant get sped up theyre going to switch theyre going to deny with this lineup on the floor now its got to be Davon McCullum and Nate George has got to be aggressive hes a pass first guy extra pass to George rebound effort by Suare and he wins the foul itll stay here good possession offensively for Jord DET Techo the balls moving from second to third side got a good look didnt knock it down but when shots go up like that you kind of get a chance to get in extra possession cuz everyone knows your offensive guys crash the glass now this is another part of the game because Florida State runs this man matchup Zone here most teams just throw it long Music dong go still scoreless has only taken one shot attempt it was a forced turnaround jumper late in the shot clock five to shoot mcallum with Applause two and that will go against Georgia Tech just not a great look by Jord Tech and theyre going to struggle on the offensive end but this lineup I think you got to run your offense try to get with with your guard run a ball screen maybe with by Dongo get a switch get him going right now J and mullum is struggling right now get a good look Florida State on a 70 run they have shot above 50 from the floor so far this afternoon Jackson last Touch by Georgia Tech itll stay here with 12 to shoot Jackson lucky that time he went off his leg and touched it by accident not seeing it got out of his Zone he got into back into their man and man now but theyre going to be a sagging man and man looking to stay inside Jacksons got quite a streak going one turnover in the last five games that holds for now five to shoot three ball from maluke and the rebound Powell 4minute scoring drop for the yellow jackets Yellow Jackets essentially playing with three bigs on the floor with Suare by Dongo and Duncan no F Duncan and its its its just no space Dongo with the offensive board found Suare whos making his second career start today first one came against Clemson in which he did not attempt a shot and theres a foul on the floor underneath its going to go against Javen McCollum theyre starting a three guard rotation now with Lance Terry coming back in and theyre still playing with three Frontline players this is a Jord Tech team that is accustomed to playing with three guards on the floor at all times but Justin mustaf is now out hes over on the bench in the boot heres Jackson another good rebound by dong hes so skill he has to find a way to get involved in this game right now its j Tech when it gets back in its got to be by dongle got to start having an impact in this game and even Nate George hes got to start attacking hes a pass first point guard right now theres a lot of standing around by georia Tech and theyre not going to get quality looks against Florida State Defense unless youre moving bodies and cutting and moving moving the Basketball Baseline Corner only 3 seconds left watch for a pass back to the inbounder Terry three on two Davis th is being left open right now for Georgia Tech to climb back into this game with just a shade over eight minutes left in the first half Florida State at times help you out they theyre not prone to going in the scoring drops because they dont run a system every bodys just free to take shots and this is the end of the floor what it creates their offense Watkins from Applause downtown I think Damon stard seen enough of that he jir Watkins with his Steph carry imitation steals it in transition to stop and Pops in three jir Walkins turning defense and the offense there but oh no I dont want the layup I want the three simal up 16 e Music well going to commercial break after the timeout by Damon stmy there was a technical assess to dayquon Davis right there middle of your screen five white just flipping the ball into the chest of Music Suare and dayquon Davis frustrated with himself hes actually been in the words of his head coach Leonard Hamilton incredibly mature for being a true freshman who started the last eight games just a mental error there by the Freshman point guard yeah just a freshman mistake but what hes brought to this seminal team and the way he attacks the other league guards I thought he set the tone against pit as I said with his defense on low and hes been a spark plug for this seminal group on both ends of the floor and let his emotions get the best of him there well this is an opportunity for Georgia Tech they were in the midst of another lengthy scoring drought before those two made technical foul Shots by Lance Terry now theyll get the ball and a chance to cut into this 14point deficit with less than eight minutes to go in the opening Applause half you get the matchups you want they running the switch here and got to try to get by Dongo involved in this game finds the open man and Powell rims out of three now Georgia Tech 0 for eight from distance in the first half lob to Yan left it short coach ham thought there was a lot of contact there and find your matchup right now theyre switching everything this was a game of hot potato leads to an open three George knocks it down George has the ability to score the basketball hes just a pass for his guys hes grierson coming up the floor gripping that right thigh and again they can ill afford any players particularly at the guard poar might have to play if they get another from the back B Bowen rebound Yan double team lurking with Dongo in the paint and AJ Desai kept that one in bounds for the Florida state seminal 10 to shoot open three Jackson Applause theyre going to give that to Jackson Anytime hes behind a threepoint line theyre going to take their chances with him that was really well executed by Nate George who continues to Grimace down the floor finding Duncan pow for a dunk 70 run by the yellow jackets here started with that technical foul last Touch by Yan itll go back to the yellow Applause jackets go to Tech trying to get back in it there its a great save on a pass by George he comes in walks into one knocks down a three starting to chip away at this lead Music theyre not think about Florida state theyre not going to let you run your play you got to just play pick your match up move the basketball move your body Powell contested three not his strong suit I thought there was a chance to get the ball Music inside and a whistle second foul on by Dongo and the fifth on Georgia Tech I think by dong goes telling Duncan pow hey I think I got had to guard on me inside throw that one inside sometimes a quick shot is like a turnover and I think thats the underrated part of what defensively what Florida state does to we got to have body movement ball movement get it the second third side you cant come down with zero passes with one pass good feed Watkins inside to Christian NE to fres off the bench for two coach ham loves KN to he actually says he thinks he has a chance to be the next one coming out of FL State meaning the next NBA player he thinks he has that type of ability at his size really gifted to play on the perimeter but that time scoring a basket inside is Nate George an unforced turnover there just sets the ball screen rolls inside no communication by Georgia Tech on the back end no rotation just one of the many ways that Watkins hurts you as well hes that time attacking you in a ball screen and most of the time hes doing his damage on the offensive glass and just punishing smaller Music Defenders tried to zip it back in the need to Terry might have CAU the brunt of that one got him on the side of the face it looked like blocked it and 12 to shoot for Florida State yeah he had he was wide open again on a pick and roll its got to be bit more communication but when youre in these situations like Jord Tech you have these lineups youre not accustom to having theyre not theyre not accustom to playing together you make these kind of mistakes nice take by Boston Holt who earlier in the year was in the starting lineup for Leonard Hamilton delal with some injury missed a couple of games has been coming off the bench ever since but if youre not familiar with Leonard Hamiltons system it really doesnt matter if you start or not because you still could be playing quote unquote starter minutes absolutely and I think he struggled early in the year because he was a packline guy and if you know anything about lyard Hamilton he runs anything but a packline how about that flush by Lance Terry Lance Terry showing you that athleticism we talked about earlier need to step C that three this is when I think Flo State they got it off they get anything they want those are the quick shots I think they can they slow down themselves on the offensive end and put themselves in scor drops when they take these quick shots continue to move the basketball now no need to be still run your ball screen keep attacking these switches b b last touched by the sophomore and gives it back to Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets hanging around down 11 on the road looking for their first win in Tallahassee since 2016 e e Music Sun Applause I feel as though theyre the second best team in the country from everyone that Ive seen so far but we got a lot of basketball left the play who else in the ACC is contending for that top two spot I thought it was a group early was kid Clemson I I would throw Wake Forest in that group but Louisville that seem to have separated themselves I think from everyone else well you and I had the Louisville pit game last weekend Louisville won that in thrilling fashion I saw Louisville beat Clemson earlier on this year so theyve got the headtohead against those other teams that were in the conversation at least the first time around no they have and thats why I said theres a lot of basketball left but and their team have had their fair share of injuries as well and their culture and their style of play and everything theyve done overcome those issues where others have just unable to do good block by NE sort of a volleyball block at the net knocking it out of bounds 11 on the clock for Georgia Tech you got to know youre going to draw a crowd when you attack the paint against Florida State and their length is just so disruptive every pass requires such effort tough Fade Away by McCollum and again last Touch by Florida State so itll stay here what Jord is doing against this Baseline out of bound pressure theyre sending their big to this corner and hes just posting up against the guard Suare Taps it into the hands of Powell contact and a whistle comes in late and for the third time in the first half Duncan Powell will be shooting free throws but dunin pow is a grown man inside physically he has a motor that continues to attack the rim when the shot goes up the one way you attack length is with physicality po definitely has that hes got the build of a power for tight end 68 235 and his head coach Damon STM calls him a grinder comes over from Sacramento state began his career at North Carolina t and relishing the moment to play in the ACC back to a ninepoint game two and a half to go in the opening Music half Florida State semal fan when they move the ball side to side they do a pretty good job their were offense and look for Malik euan in in some type of ball screen action slipping inside Music that was a tough pass there from Thomas to Yan apparently Suare got a piece of it so itll stay here I didnt think he got any of thats a confident pass there I didnt think there was a chance hed get that in there and but what hes relying on is Malik Yan walking his Defender up the lane and having enough time and space to throw it over the top one to shoot and the rebound Applause George floater Terry what an athletic move to try and tip it in could not now B Bowen with the jam thats a fourpoint swing I thought Jordan Tech had numbers early there in that possession he ended up throwing it away thats a quick shot there by George you cant get it back when you make a mistake cant make compound it by creating another one and Damon STM is IR he is called his third timeout of the first half well take it with him back in 30 in Tallahassee Music Damon Damon AAR is not happy right now and you have numbers going down and you essentially turn it over and transition you dont get back give up a basket come down take a quick shot and again dont get back on the defensive end Dam stard has every right to be upset with his ball club and in particular Nate George there they have seven turnovers in the first half but you said something earlier that the quick shots are basically like turnovers against Florida State its something they do so well theres been a bunch of those forced for the Yellow Jackets today as well even this possession its its one pass and a shot and now your defense isnt set and Florida state has numbers you in love and put down by Watkins 11 assists and one turnover for the seals in the first half and the biggest issue you have in preparing for Florida state is you cant simulate the size you can get your walk on and and end of the rotation guys but you cant simulate this length I mean thats the C pushing the break throwing it to the Wing In transition its just difficult for you to simulate that most times when you defending that your bigs run to the paint you you play Florida State your big has to stop the basketball your guards have to pick up inside and youre going to be in all types of cross matchups you just got to learn how to play out of it the column missed in the front end of the one and one less than a minute to go in tallahassees first half Watkins challenging Duncan Powell and Florida States leading scorer will head to the free throw line they hadnt had an answer for anything involving Watkins when hes in the ball screens when you switch hes been able to find guys that time he rejected the ball screen and attacked the rim and Drew the foul just nothing you can do if youre going to be that late in the ball screen rotation and his vision his l his size and the boss hes throwing over the top of this joria Tech Team and you can see theyre bickering amongst each other theyre frustrated as well you can feel it yeah you can feel the Georgia Tech frustration bubbling up here in the midst of a three game skid there was so much promise for this team after the foundation built last year remember they beat this Florida State team last year they beat North Carolina they beat Duke Clemson this team opened up ACC play a year ago beating Duke at home and you just they beat Carolina at home you were expecting this team to take a step and again theyve been decimated with injuries theres no doubt about that but right now you can see the frustration mounting in the middle of a three game losing streak and bodies are still guys that continue to be unavailable to Dam stardem and its frustrating enough playing against the Sims in their style of play as a team that their starting to click Duncan Powell on the catch and shoot from distance just the second made three of the first half for Georgia Tech theyve taken 14 and they Trail by 13 fla State here will hold for the last Applause possession again the Watkins ball screen action is hell pick the match up he want going to try to attack fou on the ball screen good tap by McCollum four to shoot for Florida State plenty of time 4 seconds you got to know you often tell you guys you got how many seconds on the clock thats how many dribbles you have in a half court you got plenty of options here you dont have to settle for a catch and shoot three Leonard Hamiltons going to take a timeout here he wants to draw something up we will step aside and back in 30 seconds for the conclusion of the first half Music Music yeah yeah theyre upset a spirited Georgia Tech huddle jamen McCollum in the middle of it trying to inspire his teammates who as weve talked about over the first 20 minutes of this game have been decimated by injuries disappointing losses and trying to get a stop here first and foremost to close the first half and keep it to a 13point game and you get frustrated and its the problem is everybodys upset at themselves and the way things are going and its the tone of it when youre in a battle like this you know Energys high attentions high you youre yelling and you mean well you hope the guys just listen to what youre saying and not how youre saying it thre to shoot Watkins well defended to Clos the first half by Georgia Tech but Florida State shot 44 including teammate Juan Davis is really heating up the basketball he does a great job of standing in front oh thats a tough shot by Nate George Well defended by Davis thats good defense a better offense Yan not Super Active scoring the ball in the first half turns it over he was very effective rebounding the ball and sharing it with his teammates and yet they had a 13point lead at the break regardless no one really forces the ball offensively Sim I think when they all sharing it theyre at their best Malik Yan gets it in the post hes looking to pass underrated skill set as a passer heres a guy you want to see get going by Dongo had just one field goal attempt in the first half Terry off the bounce yeah ball went inside hes throwing it back out when the double team comes Id like to see him throw it back into him a couple of times but no problem with reversing in guard on the weak side attack great defense there by Terry and draws a foul as he crashes hard to the floor and gripping that wrist which held him out of the Clemson game earlier this week yeah I think he used it arm to brace himself after the foul and great job creating the steal gets the contact there and again if youre not familiar with the way Georgia Tech season has gone just about every injury they could have theyve had including Lance Terry missing their last game play Under review to his shooting hand and theyre going to check this for a flagrant theres a shot of the three gentlemen who are missing today OBrien kaasi Reeves and jayen moose off did you see flagrant contact here on this play well I I think by the intent of the rule Watkins bumped him without making a play for the ball like watch this I I I didnt think that was enough to call a flagrant theres contact theres a foul I this this left arm is where the foul is its definitely a foul I dont know if Id call it a flagrant I thought he censed the contact and was trying to avoid the foul and obviously with Lance Terry laying there and pain and if youre Jord DET Tech youre right here you battle back strong start to this second half giving yourself a chance to get back in this definitely want the official to take a look at it of course Terry was an Airborne player but there wasnt seemingly excessive contact call the floor stands as a common foul I think thats the right call common foul will send Lance Terry to the line Assuming hes okay here thats the bigger story for Georgia Tech gripping the wrist of his shooting hand and it appears hes going to stay in the game hes a tough kid hes banged up was supposed to be eased into the lineup maybe a maybe a little bit of minute restriction today but none of that today I think thats got thrown out of the Applause Music window 5 20po games this year for Lance Applause Terry has cut it to six deep three Watkins left it short B bow in the rebound tapped Away by McCollum and one back for Georgia Tech great offensive rebound even better defense there by JB McCullum stripping the basketball and knocking it off of B Bowens knee we wondered what we would see from Georgia Tech coming out of the halftime locker room very telling these first few minutes here the second frame Dongo counted in the foul and a chance to make it a one possession game great job there getting Dongo the ball on the move theyve been doubling him in the post he knows he coming you get him on the perimeter now he puts it down double team cant get there quick enough and Dongo with a Chance win an and one here just great job getting in the paint but great great coaching move by STM he not involved in this game when you try to post him up get him on the perimeter get him on the Move get him more touches he had 10 rebounds in the first half just one field goal attempt and makes it a onep possession game after they Trail by 13 at the half Watkins forcing the issue draws a foul on the floor goes against Terry thats the one play they had able to stop walking to the ball screen and letting him be your playmaker in a half court is finding guys drawing fouls or dumping it inside I think you need to continue to run your offense through a in a half cour but he he doesnt need to settle he needs to attack leads the country in fouls drawn per game with over eight second in the nation in free throw attempts per game Chandler Jackson flexing on the low block tu through contact continue to move the basketball for Jo to TI dont settle drive to pass McCollum stripped Suare fighting for it and tied up between Dongo and Chandler Jackson when you attack Florida State youre going to throw a crowd you get in the paint against all that length you got to attack and look to kick the basketball outside you get inside to score four bodies inside by Dongo tries to tie up Jackson ends up being a turnover for the yellow jackets this has been a play thats given him a lot of trouble this ball screen action again another foul it is the second on the red shirt freshman ebrahim Suare and another foul drawn by jir Watkins I asked him about that coming into the game you know is that something that youre intentional about he said not really its just always been my game to be aggressive and hes so athletic So Physical it comes natural to draw those fouls and another foul on Suare that will be number three heve got a couple of quick ones there but back to Watkins hes just a matchup nightmare me hes 68 hes physical his body type if you put a big on him he takes you on the perimeter you put a guard on him he post you up inside he sees over the top and thats what hes doing to the yellow jackets now when he gets in these ball screens hes just throwing over over top of the smaller Defenders now hes trying to post up Terry here Suare goes to the bench with three fouls in comes Duncan Powell and the rebound Dongo you can see the game plan is to lead chantler Jackson open behind the threepoint line youre more worried about him penetrating and so whoevers guarding him is going to stay in the paint try to help on the penetration by the other the other players floated into Dongo and stripped but there was a foul and it goes against the seals Chandler Jackson tagged with his first the switching in the length of the guards Jord DET Tech I mean Florida state is is an issue they switch they dont have small guards dayquon Davis is the smallest guy 61 and hes not involved in a play then youre dealing with a lot of size threepoint line has not been kind today the Georgia Tech now two for 15 Florida State running back the other way B Bowen steps into a three another poor possession there by the yellow jackers not matching up defensively not communicating and g bo bow an open look back to an eightpoint game 16 minutes to go in Applause regulation five to shoot from McCollum hounded by Davis tough Fade Away wow numbers for Florida State Davis set back by George and itll stay here this is a different Florida State team you dont match up in transition they will Pi you make you pay B bone with another three Music Music for a hot second it was a threepoint game then Florida State stretched the lead back out to eight led by as many as 13 at the half and this is a big game for Leonard Hamiltons team coming off their first quad one win of the Season against pit right here a few days ago no bad losses quote unquote bad losses this would be a quad three loss against Georgia Tech you want to keep that section of your resume unblemished you want to keep it clean you dont have a ton of quad one opportunities going forward and right now as we enter late January and end of February you want to see a team start and take that step and get to the top of this league thats the tough part though about the ACC this year Georgia Techs not an easy out no theyre going to catch some teams on the road and that will go down as a Q3 loss which then hurts your resume so every time a teams playing Georgia Tech at home it is a huge game particularly if youre Florida State they come in 65th in the net today Randol theyre very much in the bubble conversation absolutely and they have a tremendous opportunity not just taking care of business today they go to California they got the cow in the Stanford trip they come home and host the hokeys and you can somehow win those two games and take care business at home youre talking about seven and three and and literally I think that puts them in the tournament and in tournament conversation pit right now down at home against Clemson they were down 10 at the half which is a huge game for pit after losing on the road here a couple of days ago yeah pitch down now 11 there I think thats a massive game that pits has to take care of because if they that would be four straight games but more importantly they would have dropped two at home uh against with Louisville and Clemson the two teams that they kind of were competing against but that NCAA tournament spot and again this is a pit team that last year just missed out on the NCAA tournament they had nine q1 and Q2 wins theyre not anywhere close to that this year thats why they need some of those wins at home as Terry knocks down a deep two I think thats the best offensive possession Jordan Tas had just penetrating creating opportunity the ball going from side to side on the floor you got to move this seminal defense Watkins step back three and he is in double figures for the 15th consecutive Applause game you got to live with that if you Georgia Tech thats just a big time shot he is starting to become really consistent behind the threepoint line oh thats a ticky tacky foul there for Watkins hes trying to steal it you just want to pressure the basketball speed equan up I mean JB McCullum is too good with the ball in his hands youre not going to steal it mum a three oh Shooters roll on the road and he makes it back to a singled digigit deficit he shakes it off hes a score now you an extra pass snatched by Terry here comes Duncan Powell step through draws a foul on top thas and that is number two on the UTSA transfer sometimes its better to be lucky than good ball short hits the rim gets the friendly Hometown bous cut into this Sim leite timeout taken by Leonard Hamilton we will take it with him Georgia Tech hanging around in tahi Music Music Florida State on top 4739 1416 left divisional playoffs this weekend the NFL Patrick Mahomes undefeated as a starter in AFC divisional gamees 6 and0 Randolph 13 touchdowns no picks if youre a betting man who you going with in that game uh I think Im going to bet with Mahomes I Im Im just penciling them in the conference Championship game its just just what they do what Pat Mahomes does his start his career is man hes on the pace hes on right now pretty amazing oh my goodness they also have a lethal weapon in the kicking game Harrison bucker who got his start at Georgia Tech who right now is trying to get it back to a twopossession game while its trying to snap a three game losing streak its been no quit in the yellow jackets they have battled back and similars I think has helped him been a little C with the basketball and the decision making they too can get in trouble taking quick shots Thomas left that way short you and kept it alive shot clock did not reset Watkins no and the rebound secured by George George attack with life still less than 14 minutes to play Terry a lot of the fans behind us wanted to walk they wont get it but a foul sends Watkins to the floor and is that on Suare it is and that is his fourth he just checked back into the game and now well be headed back to the bench with four fouls yeah SAR as a freshmans got to know just got to get back you got three you notice coaches told him how Watkins love to draw fouls and forc the official to blow the whistle and he did so on that possession now you got to go sit for a significant amount of time ball Bowen with his seventh double figure scoring performance of the season from downtown Dongo sent Away by Watkins spiked into the third row yeah Watkins comes inside youre going to draw help this is the ACC leader in Block shots because they got multiple guys coming and by Dongo did a great job of beating his man but you plan is similars youre going to have to be two and three Defenders to get an open look second tallest team in the country behind only Duke and their length always in play Terry for three got it and Tech remains in it 16 for their leading score Music Y in fouled by Dongo on the second tap just continue to move the basketball there but Florida State again Watkins has a playmaker is a problem and still cant match it up but this is what you got to do against this defense penetrate to pass Baseline Drive kick it one more it over and reverse it you get an open look thats the way you have to attack the seminal and how many of those type of possessions can you string together determine if they can get back in this lead and and overtake the seals and on his other end for the seals here Watkins as a playmaker just virtually been Unstoppable that time with the smaller lanch Terry on him he goes inside and again hes just looking over top of the smaller Defenders you comeing double through the LOM Le un and was fouled on the play and youre not making shots find Waters put him inside against the guard or put him in a ball screen when hes guarded by a bigger Defender I think gets a quality shot for the s full court pressure shouldnt bother you as much the amount of hand they have but you cant be sloppy with the basketball looking at JV and McCullen right now like what are you doing 10th turnover and now 19 points off turnovers for Florida State in this game they have absolutely just punished them on those turnovers if you going turn it over its got to be dead ball great penetration kick one more drive it pass it mum for three Clinic of how you attack this team but you got to get back steals the pass floats and hits and McCullum with seven points makes it an eightpoint game dang off the window with some touch J the tech was late to transition back into their zone defense there couple of guys were in manto man a couple of guys are in zone never established their defense Duncan Pow with a strong take left it short and last Touch by Georgia Tech gives it back to FSU who extended their lead back to 10 turnovers a v issue when you cannot have live ball turnovers against the seminal wont get any easier than that by hope Music all right Applause Music Applause Music Music shorten Georgia Tech bench with injuries missing four players today and now theyre missing Ibrahim Suare hes been on the bench for a long stretch of time with four fouls by just picked up his third foul trouble plus injuries has really tightened the rotation for Damon STM well hes going zone now trying to protect this group with sare picking up four the five guys they have left dong go into five is just going to have to figure it out going to have to play Zona Protect by Dongo inside its pretty remarkable what Damon stms team has been able to do yes theyre not necessarily winning these tough ACC games but theyve played six players competing and against this pressure you know the extension of pressure full court at times and not a bad amount of turnovers its just that Florida state has just punished them and been so efficient and taking turnovers and scorned on them now theyre packing it in so they can rebound Jackson in the midrange has been money has eight points this Applause afternoon McCollum floater Dongo had it tapped away Deng comes away with it but he had an opportunity there and there was a back court violation meanwhile at the end of the play Chandler Jackson went down I thought the call was late but I thought it was correct established himself from the full court throw it in the back court he was late but I thought it was the right call Damon STM was helping the officials out with that call hes fighting man they dont call him mudy Mouse for nothing hes hes out here competing 13year NBA veteran telling his guards hes on his guards at Opportunity there the lob the by Dongo in the previous possession was there and jaon McCullum threw it late end up being a turnover nearly stolen by Thomas and thats something we see so frequently with this Florida State team something as academic as an inbounds pass becomes a lot more difficult against this length they remind me of and since we talked about it last when you and I had pit and Louisville how they try to win sideline out of bounds and Baseline out of bound plays Florida state does the same they just doing on the defensive end of the floor theyre running pressure theyre pressing you out of that their Zone pressure trying to create and force turnover out of Baseline out of bounds ins side out of bounds and as a player how much does that exhaust you oh it is because you end up putting in plays your coaching staff ends up putting in plays just getting the ball and so youre no longer running plays to score youre running plays just to inbound the basketball drive and pass it five to shoot McCollum tries and hits from downtown got to get the ball from one side to the other great offensive possession there for the yellow jackets Holt on the drive left it short bodies on the deck McCullum comes away with it home run pass to Terry and here comes Applause Tech going back in the zone Thomas has got to free himself up Justin Thomas here airball his last shot its got to get Applause ready and theres a whistle off the ball against Florida State it will go against air maluk theyre starting to settle in the penetration there one more its been the key you got to pass Drive the basketball to pass to a teammate sure detect getting a chance to run out there The Zone allows you to do that theyre back in that zone right now because they only have five bodies out there Suare has four fouls I think hes on the bench for an extended period of time lets just hope they can keep enough energy as theyre making their run to get back in this game one more foul for each team will put the other in the bonus still well over 9 minutes to play in regulation Powell and here comes Watkins a bad shot but the execution on the offensive end to get the shot was good Watkins power dribble threads it in Yan who draws a foul with the left hand and that might be number four on by Dango it is and now where do you go if youre Damon STM they do have Ryan Matumbo on the bench we have not seen him today I think he has to maybe try to put saring in with four fouls and if he fouls out then at least you can come back with B Dongo but theyre making a run theyre right back theyre right they right back in this game but you can look forward to having foul out its a ton of time its sevenpoint game over nine minutes to play and on Q heres ebraham swar coming in foul troubles been an issue all year for Bongo hes fouled out of three games hes been in significant foul trouble and five others make it six as he heads to the bench with his fourth I think thats whats Limited him from taking another step thats the step you expected him to take as a sophomore just a CR difficult matchup McCollum draws a foul and heads into the first row of seats taking out a cameraman with him second foul on Watkins and are the officials going to review this here they count foul yeah there Jordan Texas bench Leonard Hamiltons wanting an explanation were going to get one real quick here from Michael kits play Under theyre reviewing whether or not this was go tending I thought wat got his hand on it the way up I yeah he did yeah to me changed the course of the ball when Watkins extended his arm yes but nonetheless both teams now in the bonus which I dont know about you but I feel like that favors Georgia Tech yeah I think Watkins gets a gets a hand of that gets a piece of that and well see the problem I think with that is now youre going to be forced to put someone in a lineup at Georgia Tech free throw shooting wise in favor turn two shots I think they got it right on that w Watkins got beat on the play but got a piece of it and the officials telling him to tuck a shirt its just a two shot foul which is critical instead of an n one I guess my thought for Damon stms team as theyve had it as close as three but they havent been able to get over that hump maybe scoring at the foul line with the clock stop allows them to but again to your point they have to not foul on the defensive side thats the other side of it both teams are in the bonus and you got Ibraham swar in now with four fouls his next one hes out and if he fouls out by Dongo has four fouls and you know the simal know that theyre going to attack him by the way that was the third on Florida States leading score jir Watkins two possession game nine minutes and change to play in Tallahasse Florida State winners of five of their last seven coming off their first quad one win of the season against pit undefeated in Q3 and Q4 games this is a Q3 game against Georgia Tech dang Off the Mark but his teammate Yan is there to dunk it Applause home continue to drive pass to a teammate Applause Powell Second Chance was fouled by Applause Yuan a great job here by Yuan no box out tare goes over to help and no one there to box out Malik Yan and he keeps it off the glass and flushes it home well weve just received word that Chandler Jackson will not return in this game for Florida State remember a couple of minutes ago after the over and back call we saw Chandler Jackson Down Under the Florida state basket and grimacing and we have received word that After exiting the game he will not Applause Music return really and get a picture of Jackson there and hes played well defensively been a pest and knocked down some timely floaters hes also a leader of this team most experienced player then here the longest he and walks other guys that lead this ball club and two very easy buckets back to back for Florida State and extends their lead back to double digits timeout Damon Applause STM Florida state has made three in a row trying to hang on for their sixth win in the last eight games Cal California trip affects people in different ways and when you havent experienced it yet you dont know what to expect and how you get there and when you get there and what time you play is always an issue but I think they have a favor of scheduling that because their game is at 900 eastern time on the Wednesday George rims it down little bit different ACC now than when you were playing huh yes but you know what I actually went to California played the game when Jason kids was there in college was that difficult for you to adjust to the time change Im too old to Laughter remember it depends if if we lost the game then thats what Im blame exactly I was going to say its a good excuse Davis extra pass Thomas no rebound Watkins and the putb is good thats the problem you have with Watkins when you have a smaller defender on him its its just find ways to score and Applause now where do you go if you Jordan Tech it h it has to be the same you have to drive past the teammates great cut there by Lance Terry unable to finish K back door some against this overly aggressive defense you and no rebound pow Applause George with a two on two here if he wants it Stripped by Davis and the Freshman wins it back for Florida State now hang on a second because coach stmy wants the officials to get together here and theyre going to overturn the call Jamal Spearman came in from a crosscourt he saw something different as we take another look that is great job of Dave is moving his feet guessing which direction Nate George was going to go and almost creating the steal and see now look at the lineup of Florida state theyre zoning this they zoning this up watch Davis hes standing there taking a player that comes in so youre not just getting it in bounds you cant run your normal stuff because if not you get a turnover that is what most teams do you just throw it back you just throw it back and run your offense so they eliminate having to defend your sideline out of bound plates nice take by Duncan Powell and the Sacramento State transfer is headed back to the free throw line yet again its a great job there you can thats one thing that can hurt the seminal is that when you fake dribble handoffs because theyre anticipating the switch they switch everything the dribble handoffs coming right before they can switch Duncan pow fakes it and drives it Duncan Powell has made more free throws than the seminal have attempted this afternoon he is now 11 for 12 and he cuts it to a sevenpoint deficit he just does everything well just a solid player not a great shooter but he knocks down threes I believe theres an issue here with the sh shot clock or with the game clock one of two Jamal Spearman blowing it dead as dayquon Davis was bringing it up the floor and they got it corrected 28 to shoot for Florida State look at you Yan inside the middle of that zone and look at the Cutters they got constant movement and Cutters on the Baseline as well you in that is great Touch by the jco transfer yeah getting him the ball in the middle of that zone his ability to pass George step back three Splash take that shot you got to make it no one else touches it you dribble up the floor get the pressure and take a quick shot thats one of those no no no yes yes thats exactly what it is like what are you great Music shot Yan try to use his size Davis with less than 10 bit of a scramble here for the seminal BB was fouled and thats on Dongo and he is fouled out and has extra words for Michael kits as he goes to the bench hes frustrated thats a really bad foul D start telling them calm down Applause got in the way of the landing zone for B he clipped him on the left on in a follow through on his right arm and just got to allow him to come down you come out and contest and tried to avoid it its a frustrating night for both by Dongo couldnt get involved in the game early not a lot of Touches for him thats sort of a d whammy for Georgia Tech it was late in the shot clock on a great defensive possession not three shots at the foul line and you lose arguably your best post player in bonga its a brutal foul again weve talked about it hes hes got to find a way to stay on the floor hes just invaluable to the yellow jackets and that was a big possession there its a sixpoint game you rebound that come down a chance to make it a fourpoint game three so now Ibrahim Suare is back on the floor in place of Bongo he too is playing with four fouls one more and he will be out well you look at the bench uh James Forest there hes out of Eligibility David St out of Eligibility star is out bonsy Wells out of Eligibility I I dont know where theyre going to go some good names there though oh yeah that mean put them out there yes they won a lot of basketball games only one made shot out of three at the line for B Bowen sevenpoint game five minutes and change to go in Tallahassee Georgia Tech trying to snap a threegame skid McCollum extra pass Terry pays It Off from distance dangerous moment here for Florida State I mean its simp Jordan Tech has found the recipe theyre theyre getting the ball in the paint getting rotation spraying it out the shooters and right now on this end of the floor the balls got to go to Yuan and continue to move in Cut Yan over the top of Powell and flexes after that BS in off the Applause window home run pass Davis up and in and the foul how many times have we see that very situation quick shot you miss and give up a basket on the other end and the way this game is going Yellow Jack is going to look at just those opportunities Nate George with a quick shot Davis releases and George compounds the problem with giving him a foul and the potential a one Leonard Hamilton told us dayquon Davis has that it Factor highly touted recruit top 60 in the country coming out of high school we are starting to see that take form in his first year in the Colgate game yeah its its going well and its got to be happy with the way things are going recruiting has always went well for the Applause simal oh and a blocking foul there even with the extended arm by Nate George sending Holt to the floor and you can here how the Tallahassee faithful feel about it I I I would agree with the fans and luckily for Nate George hes such a competitor but hes making a mistake and when he makes a mistake he tries to come back and make a play hes got to learn just reset just play on get to the the next play he get fortunate with that call Applause Second Chance one back by Powell McCollum driving kick George Suare the board left it short and draws a foul back to the line go the yellow jackets but how many of those near misses have we seen from Tech particularly in the second half theyre knocking on the door theyre right there and Sim was unable to put them away Applause nothing drives a coach matter than free throw not boxing out the free throw line and giving up offensive rebounds youre hoping that he gives you one Ibraham Suarez shootting 28 on the year doesnt shoot a ton of free throws hes 4 or 14 on the year youre just hoping to get a split when he goes to the line and see if he can help you out blig and no he misses both theyve missed four in a row prior to that they had only missed two in the game Florida State on the verge of blowing this open Watkins and off the foot of yan but there was a foul in there called by Spearman and it will go against Duncan Powell and that will send Florida State to the free free throw line Jordan Tech get emptyhanded on that last possession giving themselves an opportunity with two chances yes and missing the free throws and running out of bodies and youre fatigued and S is starting to make a concerted effort to put the ball Malu hand meanwhile Malik Yan with his fourth consecutive double double makes him both and pushes the lead back to 11 four minutes to go in Applause Music Tallahassee theyre going to switch too much dribbling you got to drive it and make a play for someone else last Touch by Watkins itll stay here when we return Florida State on a 70 run over the last 65 seconds they lead it by 11 at Music home well coming up next to big game for the SMU Mustangs who are currently next four out according to our Joe lonardi bopy Miller went off in the game against Virginia a scary game for SMU winning at the buzzer meanwhile ly kid trying to lead a Resurgence for this Miami team that is so talented and so capable of rattling off a number of wins in this league thats a big game for SMU it is and the Hurricanes coming in with a six game losing streak and just a lot of Talent on that team too much talent for the way the season has gone to be only six in conference play theyll eventually figure it out and win some games particularly at home in Miami but if SMU wants to take a step and put themselves on the other side of the bubble they need to find a way to win that game meanwhile Florida State trying to play themselves onto the bubble three to shoot for McCollum step back with one backs it in thats all you could do just tries to step back and heave it up and over the length of Watkins banged in a three mcum with 15 no look pass to B Bowen threaded by yui who has had an excellent game 15 points 11 boards four Applause assists picked off by Yan watch out he is is so valuable so versatile and I think so underrated he just does everything I mean how many centers are out in the passing Lane in the wing theres a reason he was the number one Jo recruit in the country and the defensive player of the year but his offensive skills are on display speaking of defensive players hes dribbling the ball backing down pile the triple team com and I think his most underrated skill set is his passing ability and here in the passing Lane with the steal and the easy two points Watkins look like he wanted to pick that one Applause off instead he picks the pocket of pow and one I think going to get Duncan Pow with an intentional foul there he grabbed the Applause Jersey as he was going up I think the officials are trying to calm Watkins down watch here he grabs his jersey just great defense another two points off turnovers for SP the seminal this is going to stay a common foul stay a common foul they did not go to the monitor though they did confer after the whistle on the floor jir Watkins at the line L Hammer just over there asking for it he just waved his hands but he was asking for and I thought he righteously so they called the foul but I thought that was he grabbed his jersey in a breakaway Florida State on a 143 run over the last two and a half minutes and barring a miracle have secured their sixth win in the last eight Applause games Davis L to b b hammer Applause Music time and they just got him for hanging on the rim but I dont think it matters to anybody in this building right now I dont think anyones concerned about that Up Up and Away by b b and I think its the slap on the glass I think if he lets go when he dunks it here hes okay but when you pull up and slap the backboard theyre going theyre not going to let you get away with that one boorn with the exclamation point here for the seminal hes looking to make a statement and let everybody know in the ACC simal have knocking on the doorstep to get them put themselves in the conversation and in the tournament talk coach ham said he was worried about his guys they had played out against pit but there was a little bit of conversation going back and forth because cam cornw is on that team was the fla simal and he helped motivate his guys he was worried about his guys coming out today with a yellow jacket team that was limited for players and how they respond I think hes got to be pleased with his guys no doubt Lance Terry at the line to shoot the technical foul shots but weve talked about it I mean this is a big game for Florida State in terms of their NCAA tournament resume they will remain undefeated against Q3 and Q4 opponents you look ahead for Lam leard Hamiltons team lot of q1 and Q2 opportunities left not here immediately but once you get into February six q1 and q2s left on the schedule for Florida State you like to go 5 and0 in that stretch but they can find a way to go four and four one if not go five and0 they will find themselves I think on the right side of the bubble and theyre really floating right there 65 in the net the metrics like them they do not have any any bad losses you string together three or four wins over that Q q1 Q2 stretch in February you dont lose any of those on your next five now all of a sudden youre looking at an Applause opportunity the question will become is can they handle success you start winning did you keep the same tenacity on the defensive end of the floor this team has had let Downs in the past and theyre hungry for it here they havent been to the tournament since 2021 theyve missed the last three before that they went to four out of five they were the they were one of the Premier teams in the league yes years ago and I think the pandemic I think was their best chance to be a final four if not a national championship team that was an elite roster tell you what Javen mccollums had a heck of an afternoon 20 points four assists two boards it comes in a losing effort but a value wanted that for Georgia Tech depleted like no other team in this conference right now they played six guys today one fouled out two with four theyre missing four due to injury and they continue to fight theyre going to battle I mean credit to Damon star tomorrow and his staff these guys are continue to compete and they have enough they can just get one or two of those guys back give them some quality minutes on the Applause bench got to keep the ball here no foul just dribble the clock out Florida States going to do it wasnt easy the whole time threepoint game at one point for Leonard Hamiltons team who has now won six of their last eight and they are certainly inching their way
