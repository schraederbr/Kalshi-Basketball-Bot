won more conference games this year than the previous two combined and were expecting what could be the biggest crowd at the Young Center since 2022 so an upward trajectory for Louisville trying to stay on a roll when its eighth straight they begin the game with a turnover DayDay Ames of Virginia will rattle it out Chucky heer back to the F pops the ball in the air to Terrence Edwards Jr heres R Smith The Games first shot for Louisville and he is fouled on it fouled shooting at three by Elijah Saunders can you imagine the worst start for Virginia I you get a cheap turnover you get a layup a a a shot that Virginia does not get a lot of and then you come back down in the other direction and you foul rign Smith who is one of the best threepoint Shooters in the country obviously The Scouting Report is going to tell you to close out hard but what a back and forth Miss layup on one end and you foul a threepoint shooter now R Smith who not only a great threepoint shooter 39 hes now 25 of 28 from the free throw line senior out of Australia part of what is likely to be a sevenman rotation for Louisville today no Noah Waterman today hes out with a thumb injury thats been persistently an issue its a little more sword today so theyre going to hold him out for at least a game starting five for uba Ames Ro and mcney the guards and and Ros played very well McNeely their best shooter Saunders and the Freshman Jacob Kofi UVA just one and five in the ACC under interim head coach Rod Sanchez coming off a buzzer beating or close to it lost to SMU on Wednesday mcney flanked by Javon Hadley a top two is good for the sharp shooting Isaac mcney Virginia going to work it late into the shot clock play at the slowest Tempo nationally good job keeping Poise against a very good Louisville defense heers been an all conference level point guard with Smith Hadley Edwards and Scott every player in the rotation to transfer except the Freshman Kai ruths Ames rejects he shot with 112 shoot Tony Bennett retired abruptly October 18th Ron Sanchez longtime Deputy takes over UVA one and five in ACC play though for the first time since 0809 which was the final year before Tony bet Dave lato was the head coach here heer will inbound for Louisville one of the best offensive teams in the country top 30 adjusted offensive efficiency Hatley had it knocked away heer poises it at the end of the shot clock it did graze the iron and its kept Alive by Hadley Lille a tenacious offensive rebound Banning team one of the countrys best and Hadley will give it back to heord the colado transfer Hadley with a three well this is not a vintage Virginia Defense this year and when you give second shots Louisvilles an offense right now that is cooking and will burn you and they have a number of guys who could put it on the floor but are also capable Shooters UVA lowest scoring team in the ACC which is not a surprise with their Pace but also the worst shooting team under 43 kopy against Scott absolute mismatch and the big man takes it away for U heres Edwards a Jitter bug from James Madison is fouled on the way up Sean Hall by the way with the call there Ted Valentine Kellen Milner or other officials James Scott only a sophomore came from Charleston with Pat Kel hes having a heck of a year I mean hes a glue guy a connector whatever you want to call him plays really hard hes incredibly bouncy and athletic and owns his role just buys into to what he does for this team know Virginias going to have to prove today Kevin that they can they can defend Louisville off of the bouns you know that thats the one thing in the first matchup Louisville dominated Virginia in the pain and Virginia is a jump shooting team its not a team that offensively gets into the paint a lot but they had a hard time keeping Louisville especially off of the dribble out of their paint that first meeting just couple of weeks ago Louisville out scored Virginia 3618 in the paint so doubled him up won the game 70 to 50 in Charlottesville see the little resume for Pat Kelce backtoback trips to the tournament at the College of Charleston great success at Winbrook two ases wraps it around for mcneel Saunders gets a good look for three and hes a good shooter 37 from out there Elijah Saunders hes the most veratile guy they have has struggled with consistency but hes pretty talented in terms of his versatility PE bur back from Scott bouncing in the lane throws it off of bros knee loose ball to Harley Smith is open and for Virginia those are the three most terrifying words in the arena Smith is open well obviously you cant leave him but even on a loose ball offensive rebound you cannot leave rign Smith at any point in a half court ases probing Blake Buchanan on the floor had one of the best games of his career Wednesday for UVA 11 and 15 Saunders backto back deep ones and Elijah Saunders a hot start from the field Virginia did not shoot sh well in that first matchup only five at 26 its a team that needs to make threes Edwards right in between mcne and saers great touch to the game for the fifth year senior its too easy and Terrence Edwards his shooting numbers not great in conference play but you know that he is a a bucket getter and will stay aggressive Talk balance scoring off the top Smiths got six already Edwards four Hadley with three and their leading scorer heer hasnt even scored roie with the Miss thats knocked out of bounds going to Louisville Cardinals are three of five for the style of play what is it about Pat Kelce and the time you spent around him Chris that makes you think hes been the right fit for this program well first of all he he studied under one of the best in skip prer it was his assistant longtime assistant its his energy you know his energy infectious play feet off of it and hes won everywhere as a head coach Ian he won seven Big South championships at Winthrop he won four CAA championships at Charleston and hes turned this program around in half a season he he is hes a bit of a savant and it starts with his energy his team leading by five now his aims got tripped and a foul on Chucky heper coached under skip proser played for skip proser a backup point guard for him at zav be director of opson and assistant for proster Wake Forest 01 to 09 for folks who didnt get to know Skip Pro could spend time I know you spent a little bit of time with him coaching against and recruiting what was he like and what do you see of skip prer in Pat Kelce he was he was an every man you know like they could walk into any room skip proster could walk into any room and relate to folks in that room he had a great sense of humor he was a competitor uh had a great sort of feel for not just preparation but for ingame I was on staff at Duke competing against working for Coach K competing against some of the great teams that Skip and Pat had at Wake Forest remember sitting next to skip proster one time out recruiting and he offered me a stick of gum and I took it and he turned to me and he said its not because your breath is bad dont worry about that did you believe him no Smith for three that short saw Miss dunk by Saunders at the other end 138 the lval lead five and a half minutes gone by Virginias got the Freshman guard isan Sharma on the floor into Saunders again this time he will finish hes got eight of uvas 10 oh good execution open side there pick and roll twoman game and and Saunders showing you the diversity he has has already hit two threes nice little roll when finish at The Rim first year over from San Diego State Edwards rounded out in a step back three another offensive rebound Hadley and another kick out for Smith this time he cannot converts youre lucky if youre Virginia R Smith making over four threes a game in conference play hes one of the best in the country 39 on the year from three and Conference play thats gone up to 46 Saunders another look from Deep thats his first Miss rebound to heer whos still yet to score for Louisville their leading score at 156 a game averaging nearly six assists as well Hadley on the drive heer trying to wiggle his way around Buchanan and went into Buchanon for the F Elijah Saunders has been really good at times and then theres times where hell disappear in a game but he has shown you the pick and pop the ability to step out and hit a three and and theres the role to the rim you know they they need him to play well they need Isaac McNeely to play well they they just this offense doesnt have enough punch enough Firepower to compete you know so they need a guy like Saunders to play well every minute hes out there do they need to be more assertive getting him looks or does he need to be more assertive getting himself looks I think its a combination of both I think you also have to understand like Isaac mcne and Elijah Saunders are at the top of a scouting report a lot of that having to do with Virginias Talent deficit those are not those are like fourth or fifth options on a good team and theyve been thrust into that spotline Saunders into roie much improved season for Andrew roie his Miss crap I Canon thrown two Saunders in the corner its a three for McNeely rebound by Scott its the guy you want taking a shot for uba their alltime leaders in threepoint percentage third best thats the guy you want taking the shot of your lisal Smith with his second three in an early nine for the Applause Aussie were told those umbrellas in the student section are for rain banan throws it away Cardinals can run again half heurn out of bounds to Virginia hes got a lot of options in transition first of all the head of the snake Chucky heurn youve got to stop his momentum early youve got to find rain Smith whos running right to that threepoint line and then James Scott shows you his ability to just run right to the front of the rim and keep the play alive heer and will get his first break of the game freshman Roots off to the bench as well AB bacard trayor senior transfer from Long Beach State is on hes played well since returning from broken arm his best game was against Virginia 15 and8 and 16 minutes Buchanan on the roll and Buchanan is denied tayori came over to take it off the rim Smith step back thats a tough one a round and out it Wentz Applause even when he misses the ball goes halfway down Roy this time its an easier finish for Buchanan his first two sophomore from cordelane Idaho already got four rebounds after a career high 15 Wednesday Edwards takes the bu and scores through hes got six both team shooting at 5 for 13 Virginia has not attempted a free throw Louisville seven for seven roie trying to find some space drori with a rebound tough youre always under duress against this Louisville defense starts with their effort and how hard they play heres Smith again tane Murray the New Zealander guarding the Australian Smith now Edwards against roie Edwards will try to take him Edwards puts it off the glass and good Strong finish hes been doing work in the paint they have not been able to keep Terrence Edwards out of the paint it nearly lost it here comes Applause Trey Elijah Saunders back on the floor and Saunders gets fouled well great week of mens college basketball finishing today and another great week coming up Tuesday night SEC ACC double Eder we start on ESPN 2 Mississippi State which has a fantastic game today against Old Miss in a couple of hours on the road against Tennessee then a big one here in the ACC North Carolina and a wake farest team trying to play its way back out of the bubble those games on ESPN 2 and ESPN Virginias got 13 Saunders has nine coming out of the Ron Sanchez called timeout out already in a double figures for Elijah Saunders yeah well there was good set coming out of the timeout and even even still James Scott comes over to block the shot and commits the foul Ard back on the floor for Louisville Edwards Lo Scott is bumped and fouled freshman Sharma was down there on M65 on the 611 James Scott and free throws coming for the sopore you know one of the byproducts when you have the ability to really attack the rim off of the dribble or with a lob threat like Scott is youre going to get to the foul line a lot and and one of the things for Louisvilles offense is in conference play they have made 14 more free throws than their opponents have attempted I mean they are getting to the line so much more than their opponents and its been a big part of their offense and that Miss by Scott snapped a streak of 20 consecutive made free throws so getting there converting in a good number the first Miss of the day but theyre still eight for nine they do not foul much they create lots of turnovers and theyre great rebounders so theyre not a tremendous field goal percentage defense but they do everything else well even without case in Prior out of the season with a Tor ACL McNeely gets a clean look misses his second three and trayor ahead to Edwards shots mcneelys got a hit and hes coming off a game against SMU he did not shoot well its first game without a made three after a streak of 33 straight with the m three second longest in Virginia history deep shot clock for heer off the back of the rim and deflected to a ases starting point guard yet to score or have an assist and just amazing Hustle by this team trayor is on the deck came back from a fractured bone in his left arm recently Louisvilles basically playing with a sevenman rotation they still dont stop they play hard man I mean again it starts with their effort and then they they put great pressure on the ball they deny one pass away not really in a closed denial more open but theyre denying and they really good versatility defensively you just you always feel them and youre always under duress help Virginia without a field goal for three minutes plus right now Ro slips it through to Kofi ases open ases off the iron chased down by roie though and a rare offensive rebound for Virginia leads to a threepoint opportunity for Kofi nice job keeping his Poise against two defenders in there Jacob Kofi only a freshman hes played well and Ron Sanchez has gone in the direction of him hes a good athlete with a very good second jump plays with a a good motor and thats where with the the season theyve had I I I think Ron Sanchez going into direction of some of these younger guys Kofi ish Sharma Blake Buchanan I think you you want try to get those guys experience Kofi make it his eighth consecutive start today couldnt convert the threepoint play Frank Anum eBay is on for the first time for Louisville at 13 hell get typically some spot minutes as the eighth guy in the rotation today heer steps inside Kofi shot fake Kofi didnt bite May the angle tough Saunders with a rebound Music so hard to shake free of Chucky heer for Ames or whoever hes guarding eer two and a half steals a game Hadley will contest this three from Saunders kicks out to Applause Smith a little bit of a drought for Louisville here and Edwards will try to change that inside Anum got foul anelim eBay with a couple of free throws coming up been a good atmosphere at the Y Center they lose prior with a torn ACL seven games into the season against Oklahoma and yet theyve gotten better defensively how have they done that without such an important piece well I think time you know now they played two really good teams after they lost prior and oh miss and and dude but I think there was an adjustment and and when Pat Kelce took over he started with the defense which is you know thats where the offense coming on has been a real surprise but I think as these guys have adjusted to to Prior and Corin Johnson guys like that being out guys have stepped up and embraced you know more time and different roles inside that ball got its way to Kofi back to Ames five to shoot Saunders been the whole team today that ball deflects to McNeely whos off balance three is not close and mcne just two points one for four 0 for three from three their leading score has been held completely in check you know when youre a shooter and thats your job is to make threes and when youre not making it can really impact the mind and I think were starting to see that with Isaac M mcney theres so much pressure on him to make threes and he just doesnt have it going Smith R Smith with his third from Deep and then you get caught in a bad match up there Jacob Kofi you you got to know your personnel man like you have got to crowd rain Smith his 32 threepointer in conference play most of anybody in any conference this year anel amay with a rejection and then he saves it to heer Knocked Out of Bounds its Louis b ball frank andbe right at the tail end of the rotation head minutes as he hits the bench and heres this three just confusion Jacob Kofi has to switch out you got a big on a small and thats where if youre Kofi youve got to make rain Smith put it on the floor there hes got to dribble the ball active leaders and threepoint field goals made only Gibson Jimerson at St Louis with more than Smith inside Hadley good feed from heer Aim stayed down Hadley will just bully his way in with the left and this is the large his lead for Louisville and once again the Young Center sounds like the Young Center is supposed to sound last Touch by heper Virginia will retain possession Louisville runs their stuff with really good pace and then youve got guys again really versatile guys theres Javon Hadley who whos you know below the rim guy but plays with angles can hit a three but is also really good around the basket transfer from Colorado is a huge part of a very good buffalo team a year ago Lille returned two points two total points from the year not points per game two total as ases gets a wrap on layup for his first bucket Aiden mol to walk on the only returning player who had scored a point for Louisville last year but they brought in a world of experience Hatley leading the way lefthanded again no and tayori called for his second foul going over the Applause top so tayori will stay on the floor Virginias only going to go eight deep again Noah water bin not available with a sore right thumb today Applause hard screen by Kofi that freed mcney for a good look Ron Sanchez you know searching offensively they you they run a lot of five out here they go to that mover blocker good flare screen you get MC to the wiim Scott thats a rare Miss James Scott had been 55 for 67 from the field dunks everything in sight Applause Virginia shooting just 8 for 23 Saunders and there is a foul called there Kell Milner has the foul on Hadley Saunders was asking for it before the whistle came its Hadleys first crowd tells you what they Applause think ah I dont know about that I dont I didnt see him hit his Applause arm Saunders may have baited his way into that thats a ball dont lie first shot yeah maybe I mean look any guy who shoots an air ball is always going to look for a foul call can we say ball maybe lies ball White Lies yeah one for two would feel appropriate Saunders who is the sixth best free throw shooter in the EC will split the paer hes got 11 Virginia trying to hang around first game two weeks ago Louisville won 70 to 50 though Virginia didnt hang around for much of the second half they were down too early in the second half where the Cardinals had a big run late tayori charging into roie thats something yeah thats good call jump offall defend yeah really nicely defended by Andrew roie tell you what Kadir Tori comes in to make an impact though yeah thats really well Applause defended R Sanchez told us earlier this year we asked about Rs Improvement he said I Im impressed with how hes improved defensively forget about his shooting best communicator on the floor second year after coming over from St Thomas Saunders trying to take Hadley wrestling with him Saunders looking for a foul again this time he didnt get it get a good look there you iceo him at the elbow hes just got to show a little composure Edwards spin onone on Buchanan Edwards in the double figures the second Cardinal to get there its as well as hes played offensively of late just two for n at UVA two weeks ago for seven points McNeely a lot of dribbling top two wont go this is where Rod Sanchez was so worried transition defense against Louisville Smith and before the three thats the third foul on tror offensive fell so a little bit of an issue there mostly going well though for Pat Kels Cardinals Smith with a dozen and the guys and then the sophomore James Scott so they got guys who have played a lot of basketball all five of their starters made it to the NCA tournament a year ago and in fact Edwards and his James Madison team beat Chucky heern Wisconsin team in the first round at 125 game Edwards is a leading score for JMU in the upset with 14 Ro inside over heer theres the first basket for Virginias Andrew roie it is remarkable how much better Andrew roie is playing you and I had their Memphis game he couldnt have been worse had five turnovers in the game Edwards again muscles his way in and answers with two maybe one more and you said it Kev musling I mean there is not a matchup that Virginia has had with him thats been able to keep him out of the paint and he knows it you know so often we talk about a shooter being in a Zone you can get into a Zone driving the basketball Applause Edwards with a dozen in this game mention the struggles in conference play his last five averaging 98 a game the previous five he was a 21 a game McNeely and mcney scores plus a foul Edwards a little late on the bump there so Edwards missing a threepoint opportunity on one end off the foul of mcney and this time Edwards fouls mcne on a make really good execution again allowing the offense to work for you you get just a rip screen a back screen for McNeely and thats two straight layups for him there he sees a free throw go in well see if that unlocks him a little bit from three seven points for uvas leading score on the year 119 a game Hadley will take a seat and Smith returns with his three threes freshman roots back on the floor as well with Scott heern Edwards and now R Smith always thinking about it R Music Smith Scott on the handoff fake for Smith well defended by Sharman now Smith deflected by Buchanan and collected but not finished by Ru itll stay with Lis but part of R Smiths thing is he never stops moving Hes Just In Perpetual movement and then his teammates the other four guys are so aware of of trying to get him the ball nice job by Blake Buchanan switching out there to block the shot theres a little entanglement right now between new Canan and Scott Saunders and ruths and watch R Smith on under out of bounds they love going to him Hur Scott too yeah well if its that easy they did you know Pat Kelce out of timeouts and under out of Music bounds he is so good and they are so efficient its one of the things that really jumps out watching them they always seem to get a great shot Saunders got a back from roie into Buchanan and Scott had his head down Blake buchana finishes been a 15point lead for Louisville its down to nine minute plus to go in the first half Edwards SC again starts with the paint touch from Terence Edwards again cannot keep Terence Edwards out of the paint the help comes up and these guys have become so good at throwing lobs to James Scott final minute of the half yanan from Sharma sophore into the Freshman ruths bu Cannon righthanded flip rebounded by Roots Edwards hustling down the floor for heer who still has not hit a field goal in the first half now for seven and a good strong Rebound duana with his Fifth and heern had good looks UVA can just about hold for one as Edwards implores the crowd to stand and tries to jump M nes pocket roie Saunders deep one not close and mville will have 710 of a second to get something up P burn if only that had been the first field goal but he bur with a slow start has not mattered too much he does have four assists only one turnover and hes looking for another assist here Smith could not hit from three its Tracked Down by Scott and Louisville sixth offensive rebound caral shooting at 45 Cavaliers 36 Edwards rejected but fouled Buchanan is starting the second half in place of Kofi otherwise the starters for UVA I I like it like the thing about Blake Buchanan and you saw that in their SMU game the other day is he competes part of Virginias problem is they dont have enough competitors I think you have a lot of guys out there just kind of going through the motions playing or competing in spurts and so I think going in the direction of Blake Buchan it is the way to go now there you give a second shot to Louisville he gets caught in a funky matchup with Terrence Edwards Jr and you pick up a foul but you know I think Ron Sanchez is searching and first first and foremost hes searching for guys who are going to play with effort and compete he said after the game Wednesday he hopes for Blake Buchanan that he will get that kind of effort and that this he hopes is the turn for him he had 15 rebounds six of them in the closing minutes and buan takes it here burns down the house on the feed for mcney plus a Applause foul good move Ron Sanchez really nice and a very nice pass from mcne you see the attention he draws that tag Defender Javon Hadley comes over late and what a finish through contact by Buchanon averaging just over five and five a game on the year and he bricks a free throw here so hes got six and five today plus a block shot 11point lead for Louisville Cardinals off their best start in five years in ACC play heer try to turn around Buchanon starting five for Louisville heper Smith Hadley Edwards Jr and Scott heres heper stepping inside Buchanan and heper another Miss grabs his own miss this time hes got Saunders on him Jitterbug into the lane and finally Chucky Hepper gets a bucket to go after an 0 for eight starts must be the doll he had had enough of that he said I am finishing this possession no matter what Andrew Ro just one for six in that first half Virginia led by Saunders with 11 mcneels got seven hooked Away by heper now its Edwards running against mcney hell step inside and score for 16 points what a play by heer to force that turnover just a little sneaky play from behind into Saunders trying to throw it down through a couple of cardinals took a Applause hit Chucky heurn is so disruptive you know it hasnt been his best day but he has been one of the five best point guards in the country thats how well he has played so far this year hes a tenacious Defender hes really sneaky off of the ball like that play there and then he controls the game offensively Pat Kelce told us before the game he thinks Chucky is a top five point guard you agree with Pat Kel Center yeah its funny I I laughed when he said that cuz I had I had it written down in my notes I mean he had a good year last year for Wisconsin played well he has gone to a much much higher level and he has played as one of the five best so far do you have a top five good question Kevin Braden Smith would be in there zakai Zigler tamon lipy from Iowa State Ryan neart would be my other four there you go you come prepared well I knew who I was working with the journalist and Kevin Brown would ask the followup thats right yeah real mck breaker over Music here Kofi will come on for Buchanan who just picked up his third so Buchanan gave some good energy to the start of this half but did pick up two quick fouls so hell take a quick seat he gets it back off the inbound tring to turn the corner on Ames Now using his physicality leans in misses Scott does not catch and an easy twoand delivery for Scott whos got seven Great rebounders always assume a Miss James Scott stayed ready this is the largest lead now at 16 for Louisville plus five to begin the Applause half and to s is knocked away Edwards was all over it Scott on the deck for the takeaway heer Chucky wants a screen from Scott hell fake the pass to him hell set up Edwards rebound Kofi Ro leak out to Saunders Kofi doesnt take a lot of Threes And he will miss s hit just eight of them all season tended shoot for heer spinning on Hayes heer at The Rim will finish its his change of pace and shiftiness that puts the defense on his heels feel was like the kind of guy who would have been awfully tough to defend in the dirt ball the great summer tournament Louisville look its inspiring these uniforms the Cardinals are wearing today timeout uba the Chucky doll has awakened Chucky heurn look at the shiftiness on a string dancing right by day day as little smooch ESPN the Irish and the Buckeyes who you got Im going Notre Dame I like the Irish I assume youre a buckeye well not by nature but I think theyre going to win the game well makes you for those few hours a buck eyye I dont have any vested interest nobodys going to remember my pck think NE Miss three but I like what you did cuz not a lot of people are picking Notre name so if they win you can go hey I was on top of that Ohio State wins nobodys going to remember the millions of people that picked Ohio State I just wanted to say I got the Irish yeah well Chris I hope you enjoyed that segment of uh broadcasting lets go back to break now where Virginia basketball CR goes from here well I think its important to understand that this this program would have been hovering right right around where it is recordwise even if Tony Bennett was the coach I mean their problem this year has been a talent problem or lack thereof and thats what was left to Ron Sanchez so you know I think Virginia and Miami have the same question like I understand coach Lena and coach Bennett stepping down because of the climate and not wanting to participate in this any longer but the reality is Miami and Virginia right now in ACC play are a combined 1 and 11 so if if neither of those coaches had more Talent this year perhaps theyd still be coaching and so I think both institutions have been put in a tough spot and I have have a lot of things theyre going to have to figure out moving forward foul was on Sharma there on Sanchez 11 years at UV was an assistant for nine went to take over the head coaching job and Charlotte came back a season ago as ass associate head coach wasnt fired by Charlotte just left to rejoin the staff here as heer is short on a three and Ron Sanchez and Tony benon have talked a lot about how Virginia has succeeded as a developmental program and there has been a lot of ink spilled and a lot of words said about how its harder to do that now in the nil transfer portal era get back to that in a second Anthony Robinson is foul look the reality is guys like coach K and Roy Williams and Jim Lena and Tony Bennett like and Jim be I like I get it the way that things are now it was not in the job description of being a college coach when those guys got into it and and its not what they got into it for I get it but part of the accs problem is like all of a sudden now Louisvilles back to being good but you lose Virginia in Miami you know Mike Bray did not leave behind a great situation at Notre Dame Syracuse is battling some of the Fallout from Jim baheim these are programs that the ACC needs to be good this is a great league but it needs those programs to be good kind of at the same time right now five NCAA tournament teams projected for Joel lard its five out of 18 Edwards shoves it off the rim knocked away Edwards tries to save it and Edwards does save it ridiculous Hustle by the former sunb belt Player of the Year whos having quite a campaign in Kentucky hes had a heck of a day he really has and this is just an extra effort play like he has scored the basketball but that is who L Louisville collectively has been this year those types of competitive plays Tuesday they won by 24 at Syracuse pet Kelsey said I think its as complete a game as we played all year up by 17 here no let down Factor after a big win and you wonder well they beat Virginia two weeks ago on the road whats going to be Louisvilles level of focus execution you already seen this team beat him by 20 its been dialed in from the opening moments as Roy misses a three just another Testament its what a job Pat Kels done the Freshman roots trying to get on the scoreboard he wont well its also these Applause guys its also these guys for Louisville picking each other up like Javon Hadley goes for 32 in that game against Clemson hes had a quiet day Chucky heurn goes for 26 the other night against Syracuse hes been quiet but its Terrence Edwards its rain Smith like its its a collective effort of picking each other up and they have a lot of different ways they can beat you hey managed to do so with very limited depth because of all their injuries too inside Hadley too strong rebound to Robinson The Freshman Virginia is without Waterman today Corin Johnson K prior out for the season Johnson suffered a labor issu two games in they knew Ali Khalifa and Kobe Rogers who were transfers were going to miss the season they were both slated to shirt Pat Kelce told us the good news with khif and Rogers they can start getting into practices now even though theyre not going to play because Louisvilles having trouble just running full competitive practices with their lack of available bodies and here they are winners of seven straight alone in second in the ACC looking for all the world like a tournament team loves it and you knew it was going to be Scott on the end of that as that Prime connection once again rears its head theyre so good out of that Zoom action getting guys coming off usually heern he gets two feet in the paint and theyre so good at reading James Scott Defender as he helps up thats when they throw that lob its automatic an epically long drop for Virginia meanwhile heord with a steel Here Comes Roots hes hacked by Robinson Chucky heer on both ends a significant impact he hasnt scored but hes impacted the game starts on the wing there and he actually hits the roller it was James Scott who sets that Wing ball screen and then rolls to the rim now were going to get an official review here for a possible flagrant foul on that foul by Robinson Music Applause Kellen Milner is over at the table along with Ted Applause Valentine yeah I I think this is a basketball play he he sticks his arm in there to try to make a play on the ball he certainly wants to commit a foul which it obviously was I think the hand on the back was there just to not you know he doesnt want to injure Kai ruths but this is one of those plays when you have a player on a fast break who seems unabated they are going to review these automatically Sean Hall is taking a look Kellen Milner by the way whos back is to us the Young official here former kraton blue jay played there from 2002 to 2005 seven point per game scores so the rare College basketall basetball player at high level in division one and now division one referee 19point Louisville lead as this play is sorted out Virginia has one field goal and four points in the second half it was a Buchanan dunk 6 minutes and 55 seconds ago at at the further review the common foul called on the court has been elevated to a flagrant one F now maybe this is just anecdotal maybe this is just the games Ive seen or worked but it feels like and maybe this woman Mantic experience it feels like more close or maybe not so close calls are being upgraded this year yeah these types of plays look the officials are doing what they have been asked to do so this is not a complaint about the officials in fact Louisville had a play like this against in their Clemson game where Chase Hunter came from behind got he actually blocked the shot but because the the player was elevated anyway it it ended up being upgraded to a flagrant one I am not in favor of those being upgraded like I think thats a basketball play it always has been this is basketball is a physical game but I think on those particular plays the officials have been asked to protect the the shooter the offensive player so ruths hits the free throws first points for the Freshman out of Washington DC Louisville looks to get a lob to Scott thats basically a jump shot for him and he left it short Scott four for six off shooting night for the guy whos at 82 charma meanwhile who had huge baskets late against SMU takes his first shot of the game and probably hits it I think he needs to play more cuz he comes in to make an impact and hes a really good shooter and has bailed them out of some games this year with the tying three and four free throws late against SMU Wednesday Edwards all the way trayor rips it away from Buchanan a bubacar with a finish mcne looking for space gets it into Buchanan and trayor blocked the shot but got called for his fourth foul was better for him on the other end though well hes coming in to use his athleticism and physicality to make an impact look at this play Just snatching it thats my bike and my chain offensive rebounds so theyre theyre forced to make threes and they just they havent done it here today theres three of 14 as Buchanan hits the first of two tomorrow great womens college basketball double header Stanford and Duke two powerhouses now in the ACC on ESPN 2 and then Oklahoma South Carolina on ESPN congratulations to Don Staley the highest paid coach now woms basketball hist IND R signed a new 25 million extension this week her Gamecock will be in action tomorrow ESPN and the ESPN app 18point lead Buchanan 8 and five now for Virginia and knocks that ball away and the LA from Smith it gets back to Scott Edwards from Hadley driving and delivering to Scott who lost it on the way up mcney Sharma another threepoint try for him and its good so Virginia had its first two threes go now from Saunders missed 11 in a row and now charm is hit two straight and heres a takea away with Ames running the break to Robinson and a foul a little life here for UVA and coming from freshman I mean thats what Im saying if yon Sanchez youve got to go in the direction of these young players I mean you and I saw Anthony Robinson play his best game of the year against Memphis and Im not sure why Virginia has been unable to develop him from that game like these guys come in to make an impact playing Just 5 minutes a game Edwards and Louisville will take a timeout Virginia had been really struggling to score theyre on a seven nothing run back in 30 to the Y Center Enthusiast or did you add that as your own I love reading the copy ACC enthusiasts in fact today is in all caps Im not sure if I did that Justice can watch today when I say today I just want to say to today junior but thats not on the copy so be classy San Diego inside Hadley Buchanan with another block shot link Buchanans got a couple of those so you look at the floor right now for Virginia Chris Buchanan a sore Robinson a freshman sharmas a freshman a little bit of a younger group here getting UVA back in the game five to shoot heer got it back from Smith out of the inbounds step back on Ames is well short Midway through the second half a long way to go and hemper jumps the passing Lane as he so wonderfully does his third Ste a great read and thats helping the helper Smith hasnt HED three in a while hell take it to the basket and get fouled will that be a shooting foul is the question and Ted Valentine is going to say its just a baseline out of bounds although it is the eighth foul in Virginia so its got to be a one one which the officials are now realizing a non shooting foul but Louisvilles in the bonus ases with his second shoot the one one Smith 27 out of 30 free throw shooter on the year P Kelce told us before the game rain Smith is like a son to him three years at Charleston and he really stepped into this role in a big way after Corin Johnson suffered a torn Labron two games into the year right now Javon Hadley is dealing with some blood and thats being cleaned up by member of the training staff yeah rain rain Smith is a real weapon man I mean he first of all hes a winner big part of of Pat Kels great teams at College of Charleston and he is starting to get comfortable in that Louisville uniform all of his shooting numbers have gone up and conference Applause play you wonder what it is sometimes about a player whos a a mid major a low major who has big numbers and transfers up sometimes you see the up transfer get swallowed up by the higher caliber of the league Smith has met the quality of play in this league why do you think that is well I think he has really good players around him so as much as I can sit here and pontificate about how you cant leave him and you got to find him early in transition all these coaching things when you play with other good players thats going to require help and its going to shift the defense hes in great shape so hes always In Perpetual movement and hes super confident so he always believes hes going to make the next one AES got to the rim swirls at home nice Finish By Day Day Ames Smith moving without the ball again rolls into the corner Corner away from the play Edwards has it steps back for three Saunders back on the FL with a Music rebound shot selection for louiso has not been great over the last few minutes Buchanan takes it into Scott draws the six Louisville outou of the half well KFC y center typically is one of the greatest places to watch a basketball game in the country its been a lot emptier the last couple of years obviously with the Louisville struggles but this is a welcome site 1823 3 largest crowd since January 29th of 2022 you got Stewie Griffin you got the Chucky dolls you got the umbrellas this is really a special special Basketball City you coached here against some of the best Louisville teams that weve seen over the past couple of decades what is it like when this building gets gone its its one of the best in college basketball the the sport needs it for forget just the ACC and I actually I did that game on on January 29th in 2022 it was it was a game against Duke the year they had poo banero and it was you know again this is a program with great tradition going back to Denny crumb obviously through Rick patino and theyve hired one of those types of coaches who can Galvanize and look it you dont have to give this fan base much you got to give them hard playing guys and you got to win and and thats what this program has done and they have a coach who connects with this fan base the sport needs Louisville and it needs this building that goes two for two Louisville game notes helpfully let us know uh this is consistently the highest rated TV Market in the country during NCAA tournament time they just cannot get enough of their basketball in Louisville in the state of Kentucky obviously with UK and Lexington and both these programs Louisville and Kentucky are playing some of the best basketball theyve played in years but this game is far from over Saunders with a three Virginia starting to get hot from the outside and the lead is down to 11 theyre shooting free you know when youre down theres nothing to lose you can you can let it fly and Louisvilles been a little bit complicit and Edwards took a little bit of a bump here so he will lip to the bench on an official timeout you know bad shot selection on one end and again I mean its a pretty good contested shot with a little bit of depth from Saunders but when youre down you got nothing to lose you start to shoot a little more freely Louisvilles got to get back to attack in the basket Hadley back on the floor for Edwards lilles injury will continue looks like Edwards is having a left knee checked out Smith gets free Smith gets his four threepointer or do that he is so good at reading the screen you know we talked about his Perpetual movement hes so good coming off and reading how his Defender plays it how crazy would he drive you if you had to scout against him oh my gosh his 33rd three eight conference games over four a game offensive foul will send it back the other way so just like that Louisville kicks uvas run in the teeth rain Smith he makes it rain nice little flare as Sharma goes over the top hes wet so so wet start shoot the ball better which has opened even more things up theyre as we expected they they are they have gone to that next level theyre now top 40 in the country in threepoint percentage and K pomroys metrics basketball gospel and some way statistically have duped the nations second best offense and second best defense they and Auburn have been a class to themselves the last month or so in college basketball so Duke BC 800 tonight ESPN looking forward to that one another exciting day of ACC Hoops cley into Saunders and theres a push off its going to go against somebody unable that was ANM eBay with his second nice job there by Elijah Saunders keeping his feet as Javon Hadley went super pivot trying to find his angle and heres you know another Anthony Robinson impact play get getting himself to the foul Applause line one and one for Robinson swirls it in Terrence Edwards Jr looked like he got tangled up the left knee Edwards still on the bench for Louisville they dont have Noah Waterman today because of a sore right thumb they get a game Tuesday and then a week off so theyre hoping they can get Waterman back soon but this is a time where Louisville has a a little bit softer of a schedule just in terms of days off theres the thumb for Waterman hes been playing through a thumb injury hes got four screws in his right thumb Pat Kelsey told us had surgery in December and has still been gutting it out for Louisville the sixyear player offensive foul will send it the other way just the seventh Louisville Music turnover Anthony Robinson again and again Louisville and it can happen you know psychology youre fighting when you get up big up 20 theyve gotten a little sloppy here over the last 10 minutes Robinsons got five points three rebounds s minutes good hustle plays roie with a three Robinson got a hand to it over jumped it and hes late to get back into the play so five out on four for heper sets up a three its gone from the corner for roots just his seventh of the Year could be the back breaker yeah a three on one end open three from Ro he misses and then you get a three from an unlikely Source in ruths coming back in the other direction Ames from Ro and then ases throws it away for roie Virginia turns it over for the 11th time Music Chuy heurn when hes on the break youve got to figure out a way to stop his momentum it it is a big part of how they get into their offense you got to stop him higher cuz once he gets that head of steam and gets into your paint hes going to break you down and a really good kick to Roose in the corner says Chucky he burs at the moment seventh consecutive game with exactly seven assists and his eight straight game of at least East Seven assists hes fifth in the ACC theres a basket for Hadley on the drive plus a foul and this appears to be a game sealing little flurry for Louisville well they tightened it back up just an ISO here on that pinch post and Elijah Saunders is caught watching the play opposite instead of trying to stay in front being diligent with Javon Hadley what a smart play threepoint play for Hadley hes got eight all five alul starters have at least eight the balanced scoring you mentioned off the top bearing fruit Saunders drives and finishes and another threepoint opportunity 17 for Saunders Tuesday night mens basketball double header starts in the SEC Tennessees played well suffering its first loss to Florida will host Mississippi State 7 Eastern on ESPN 2 they had a big one between North Carolina and a Wake Forest team trying to fight its way back in tournament consideration thats 900 on ESPN tell you what North Carolina starting to play much better and you to speak of freshman and Jackson is really starting to figure it out yeah Carolina team that had a brutal nonconference starting to find its form as Hadley muscles in other two hes into double figures by the way great SEC game right now just down the road on ESPN Alabama leading by four at Kentucky 7369 with under nine to go so Kentucky and Louisville both home today Sharma Off the Mark for three good to see Edwards back on the floor for Louisville hes got 16 Smith one point ahead of him Smith will drive it on Sharma Saunders got a hand in the cookie jar and then a foul Ted Valentines going to come in here make sure this doesnt get out of Applause hand a loose ball foul on the Applause scramble thats on Sharma of Virginia number nine right there Applause and you said it Ted Valentine shot out of a cannon Ted can still move now I mean hes quick start from Teddy V fourth foul on Sharma are we going to have an official review Applause here Ted saying to Sean Hall what time is your flight what time is my flight lets see last play is under review I have a rule when its an 18point game we do no reviews Im not asking for running clock but in all these are the reviews Kevin like I think the the sport also has to selfreflect and understand this is an entertainment Enterprise we are airing these games to an audience I mean you know to go to the monitor it Music just I hear you in the last 3 minutes or so of the Virginia SMU game Wednesday took about 21 minutes to play and again from an official perspective this is what youre being coached to do what youre being taught to do but then it becomes not the priorities of the folks on the court its what we want to prioritize overall in the game entertainment while not losing the impact of safety certain things to review sure there there is a nobility in wanting to get the call right but it loses its nobility when the ends after further review theall stands common foul when the ends no longer justif the means and I think on some of these reviews that was obvious I dont think the ends are justifying what we have to go through what our audience has to go through in order to do that well our audience does get to spend more time with you for the review so maybe that is what they want and they get to see more shots of that guy with the umbrella on his head so Sharma to the bench a fourth foul and more free throws for Smith whos now six for six at the line and trayor will come in for Scott Sharma with six points Off the Bench couple of Threes Virginia got this thing down to 11 and its back up to 20 which was the margin of Victory two weeks ago in Charlottesville that by the way was the first time Louisville had won in Charlottesville since 1990 as roie splashes one from deep and Ro along two was a ninegame win streak for Virginia in this series Hadley St start over Robinson hes got it does it its a small lineup out there for Louisville tough to find a matchup for Anthony Robinson Saunders posting trayor its five and Saunders uses his size Advantage 19 for Elijah Applause Saunders little hop aato between heurn Hadley and Edwards Hadley will give it off to Smith step back three no Applause good McNeils yet to hit a three he had 30 three straight games with a made three he might be at backto back games without one another rip away by heord tryi spinning and winning abacar tayori out of Long Beach State Kota from there Mak it a home here at the Yum Center what great accent work by you Kevin Brown Co good little fight there from R Smith and then theres Chucky heern again and coming down to help his teammate out of and running a cal B Louisville one of the five with Duke Carolina pit and Clemson SMU in the next four out your mid January Bracketology update of course a million things can and will happen 21point game here Louisville set to sweep Virginia in the season series BR hits his first three alltime series Virginia 24 Louisville 6 coming into today last time Louisville won two straight in the series The only time January 1989 and February 1990 Edwards cant convert to three the wi Louisville would win its eighth straight overall as well and that has been a big problem in the second half cuz Virginias shot at 10 for 16 in the half but they have turned it over 10 times in the half well turnovers have been a problem all year for Virginia theyve theyve wred a writed the ship a little bit on that over the last handful of games but its been real put a lot of pressure obviously on their offense but but on their defense as well 213th in the country turnover and their losses averaging 122 a game which at the slow tempo they play is a very high number Edwards three thats rejected Ames got a hand on it and then Saunders tied up with trayor itll be Virginia Ball by the way we take a minute to appreciate the Louisville uniforms for today the dirt bow uniforms the dirt ballls a summer tournament which is a huge part of this city of Louisville began in 1969 runs from June to August its just a tournament on the west side of town about 15 minutes west of here shaie park as McNeely hits his first three of the game and anybody can and does sign up ls got these uniforms to honor that great part of their city as Scott is fouled scores it and a chance for three for the big man James Applause Scott its cool these uniforms are cool Im glad they they did this today its one of the great traditions of outdoor basketball you dont you dont have many of those anymore you know in the line of a Rucker Park most folks know in New York City dirt bowl is is one of those great traditions and its its a cool thing for Louisville to do got the multicolored piping down the shorts symbolizing the diversity of folks that play the diversity of neighborhoods all these different neighborhoods different age groups different people anticipate some of the great players in this Citys history darl Griffith was a part of the dirt bowl once see incredible Louisville player most outstanding player of the final four in 1980 when Louisville won its first title and the tradition lives on here every summer in Louisville Kentucky outdoor basketball and now looks like theyre getting their tradition of indoor basketball back again Saunders was out of bounds the 15th Virginia turnover and Louisville doing something not a lot of teams do against Virginia putting up 80 points time Virginia timeout take back in 30 seconds Louisville up 18 floor as they host Pittsburgh in March its crazy remarkable I mean I said it at the beginning of the game you know pack Kels one of those coaches he rolls out of bed hes going to get you 25 wins from where they were to think that this team could do that and make the NCA tournament it is as good a job as as we have seen in resurrecting the program heres whats next Tuesday is not going to be easy SMU a good start to its ACC tenure SMU beat Louisville just before the buzzer on a poopy Miller 3 with 410 of a second to go Wednesday Wake Forest is playing well but a pretty manageable stretch overall and a couple of the WalkOns check in now for Louisville Cole Sherman Jor Guard from Louisville is in the game Aiden MC the one player who had scored a point for Louisville last year who returns to the roster TJ power also in the game for Virginia 23 who was a much sought after transfer from duke whos falling out of the rotation of late one minute to go as charm is misses Thunder lead put back in by Robinson maybe earn himself more playing time next time out felt like we said that the last time Applause true 17 points is the lead Sherman deep one oh off the front of the rim Cole Sherman the Louisville kid going to put his name on the score sheet I know somebodys watching this possession Murray for three its good tan Murray makes this a 14 point game and that appears to be where it will end up yes it does Kevin and Moville is going to dribble out the clock which is going to draw some mixed reactions from some Beijing our friend MVP final seconds ticket away the Louisville Revival the Revival as Pat Kelsey called it rolls merrily Along on this Saturday afternoon seven and one and
