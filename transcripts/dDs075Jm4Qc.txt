trying to skip it to Abram Threw it away You like the idea though Oh the idea The action was going in the right way I thought probably should have taken that shot on the baseline music One extra pass

number six for Tennessees come into the ball game Hes a freshman averaging about 13 minutes a game and nearly six points Theres a runner Starling will draw the foul Thats Bishop Boswell He played at

poked away by a and its out of bounds Ar to shoot in a tie game And here comes Jaylen Carrie back in the game So Apara and Carrie on the floor again One of the things Rick Barnes talked about the ability to measure guys up inside Red Autrys concern could we compete on the glass and battle and he talked about with those big to the balls they all can move their feet in the pick and roll game because they run so much pick and roll action Nate George working against Aar trying to beat him on the dribble Kept it alive Four to shoot Heres Kings whos been hot for the Orange Shot fake layup good Wow Kings now has got 17 in the first half and hes got a season high How about that Amen on the drive It rolled off A par touched it That was close And tapped it home First points for Felix Apara Well the crowd didnt like it It was close Locked up at 27 Kyle back for George It hit Potter out of bounds Turned over to the Volunteers Rick Barnes hands in his pocket across the way I love it Just love it I just love everything that he brings to the table and and the fact that his age he still can get guys like Nate Emtt to come to Tennessee Yep Bird with 15 to shoot Amen Offensive foul Yeah Pushed that chicken wing out a little too far that time but I like the fact they still being aggressive attacking the defense Second foul Nine foul on Tennessee So Amit to the bench with 205 to play Gillespie has two as well So the two guys we profiled at the top over on the bench Theres another foul Is that two on Boswell too That is two on Boswell and 10 now Now he has to go have a seat now Thats your three main rotation guys in Bwell Yes And this is the part of the game where you said last week Tennessee left some points on the Yes on the table against teams like Houston and Kansas in the first two nights in Vegas And that was one of the things that Rick Barnes talked about this morning and for all college coaches you have to have a deep bench Travel schedule foul trouble You see a couple key guys with injuries So if your bench is not deep enough you dont have that trust you could be in problems So heres Kings And the first one good King said I dont know what you guys are talking about I feel good Im making shots Yeah The rest of my teammates still have dead legs Last year averaged 12 points shot 45 from three for the Beavers Had 20 or more four times Thats what they brought him here for right They brought him here As you look at Danny Freeman right there but they they brought Kings here to shoot the ball Yeah Ah I dont like that foul Stling midcourt foul on JJ Stling 35 ft away from the basket Wes not a good foul So Stling gives him a foul And Amari Evans who had not played in the last couple games played 13 minutes out in Vegas against Ruters playing here tonight and getting some extended time really earlier in this half and now certainly here in the last 146 to go He and Ethan Berg Oh more cookies Yep that ball got poked away by Starling right to Nate George Good pass ahead Kings feeling it from the corner short Kyle caught it Shot fake up strong It rolled out Tap follow Foul cheering William Kyle had two cracks on the doorstep and couldnt knock on the door Oh I just love this pass after the cookies Nate advances the ball Stings advances the ball Unfortunately Kings you see the air ball on that one but you get the rebound You stay with the second third effort you get to the free throw line But all young guards at home the reason that play was successful of advancing the basketball Heres Kyle at the line Hes one for two And that bounds away So heres Troy Henderson 61 freshman from Richmond Virginia checking in He wears 24 for the balls A paras come back I think Dwayne Browns on the floor because Jaylen Kerry picked up his second a moment ago So thats four guys now William Kyle missed both free throws Entry pass Last touch by Kyle or Betsy 17 to shoot 119 to go Well like we talked about with coach which guy do you believe in these last minute 19 Because your full rotational guys are on the bench now Thats why your guys on the bench have to be ready to play Henderson kick out three Amari Abram buries it Big time shot Both field goals by Abram have been knocked down threes Tennessee by one Heres a kick out for Stling to answer Cannot Kyle went to the basket William went to the deck Theres a foul on Evans I think on the challenge The 65 freshman from Pittsburgh went big game hunting on William Kyle Yes he did But once again Nate George does an excellent job getting to the paint for the kick Then Kyle at the rim Both guys fighting for Kyles back at the free throw line Yep Kyle will put it up and it rattles out All right Im going to get the shooter to tell me what you see here Im have to put my coat on this one Had to put my shooters coat because hes holding the ball in front of him and then the hitch is throwing me off and then hes leaving his follow through but that hit just he got to shoot on that one I had

young freshman everyones talking about Lets throw him in the fire and see if its real And so far we like what we see Tied up here with 15 seconds to go And JJ Stling Little zone with Barn mixed it up Went from man to man to zone Heres Kings Long three Missed on the rim Gets it back Deeper three CAUGHT INSIDE BETSY AT THE HORN cheering SCORED FOR THE ORANGE and they take the lead to the locker room I was wondering what Kings was doing that last shot To his left is Justin Gainy with the uh hand on the chin former player at NC State of course And now yep And Syracuse turns over the ball to start the second half Being a little lackadasical with the ball Justin Gayy knows all too well what these ACC SEC challenges are about Hes done a marvelous job at the side of Rick Barnes in his career Gillespie on the hard drive baseline forced up the shot Ties the game Jacobe Gillespie now with eight on his fourth field goal He comes out and creates a turnover and then gets a bucket Right You see Sadique White been very quiet Just a single field goal Kate Phillips back on the floor to start the second half of the balls Original starters really for both schools Kyle going to work inside on

got blocked and a foul on William Kyle Thatll be the second on Kyle the senior transfer from UCLA Itll be the second on the Orange I like his move there Wes I thought maybe he could have went after the first dribble the second dribble he gets the foul but thats when the help able to come over Now youre playing through two people Crowd here sees a replay on the video board They thought it was a clean block by Kyle A leading freshman scorer in the South Eastern Conference now has four points Hes the number nine freshman scorer in the country in a storyline that is continuing to involve in the

able to get out and get the easy baskets theyve been getting And then holding Tennessee to one basket attempt has helped out as well Nate Aean is the third top five recruit in Tennessee basketball history Hell hit the second free throw Some big names to go there too First was Allen Houston Alan Houston I was ready to say the second Come on 3D Come on Thats Bernard King Tobias Harris Oh Im

time thats happened tonight Yeah it it reached almost pandemic status in college basketball last year Won a game on each team that seemingly was bound to happen And I challenge each young man like what are you doing What are you looking at Like you played enough basketball you have to know where you are on the floor So the turnover gets it back to the Orange cheering As Greenberg said earlier theres a William Kyle miscue trying to go to Anthony As coach Greenberg said late in the first half the element tonight is a lot more present for Syracuse than it is Tennessee The reason being is Syracuse would love a win albeit at home against a ranked team that can carry them into ACC play And this is kind of their last chance to get that in the nonconference Drive by Gillespie and the balls are in front Jacobe Gillespies got 10 Tough move Weve been looking for him to get going be more aggressive in the second half First lead since 3029 for the Balls Anthony and the orange to work Kings who is redot in the first half lost it scrambled away and thats three straight turnovers now by the Orange Eight minutes to go in the game and number 13 Tennessees regain the lead and perhaps some of the momentum along the way Im looking for Gillespie running off stagger screens Air ball the three Kyle the rebound tried to bounce it off a carry Theyre going to scramble for it Heres a Its a change of possession So the shot clock went back to 30 Carrie inside and Kyle blocked it Wow Here is White for Anthony The layup No good But a foul applause and we get a timeout The under mens card continues

night span And heres Ken Anthony after the foul on Abram got us to the timeout and the game is tied first free throws for the 66 freshman from Brooklyn who I think one of the most interesting comments he made after signing with Syracuse Im not going there to chase my dads legacy And I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the maturity of a young guy who has to come in the shadow of a dad who people still wear his jerseys here to the game on mass Love to hear those words Wes Love to hear those words Baseline Gillespie tried to put Tennessee back in front Heres Brown in traffic I think Kings might have got a piece of that And they threw it away Heres Sterling Doesnt have numbers Doesnt matter Thats just a tough shot AJ Sterling for two In the park we call that a teardrop cheering
