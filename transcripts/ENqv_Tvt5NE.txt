Point effort in the last game for the Tigers a week ago when they blew out the Queens Royals in a first ever meeting against that Squad opening tip in the fifth alltime meeting between Clemson and the school out of Radford Virginia last time they played back in the 20189 campaign it was a tight game Tigers eventually won by eight Hall on the feed from Gerard and theres an example of the Tigers sharing the basketball for the first points of the contest I think Joe Gerards passing has been such an important part for the Tigers so far this year Radford is very good on the Glass outrebounded West Virginia by eight last week in their win in Morgantown Clemson wants to continue to guard the basketball theyre so talented offensively theyve got to continue to put in work on the defensive end keep an eye on those keys to the game as the contest goes on Highlanders team under size and without their top rebounder on the night their leading scorer Kenyan Giles cant hit the runner Here Come the Tigers tiger team that of course with Hall and Gerard the scores as expected and PJs first attempt from outside wont go down Wiggins an emerging sophomore among those in the Tigers starting five second time doesnt go but the rebound by shefflin Wiggins and the rejection from behind DeAndre Pierce a senior out of Denver and Coach darus Nichols is very high on DeAndre Pierce when we spoke yesterday on the phone we wanted to talk about the three guards he immediately wanted to talk about Pierce and his shot blocking ability two shots per game right now you see an early one right there all the handoff chase Hunter the top distributor on the Clemson team but its knocked away Tigers will keep with seven on the shot clock good Scrappy hustle thats what the Radford Highlanders do and that time Brian Antoine almost came up with the steal he leads them in that category and this is a very physical Scrappy rad for team very talented guards but they want to be good on the defensive end as well Hunter shefflin again battles on on the glass but it comes away to Smith Highlanders without as we noted the guy who leads them in rebounding Justin archer in their starting five he suffered injur against West Virginia was a game time decision so the likes of Pierce will have to clean up inside but the guards you just saw in anine Smith and Giles they are lethal weapons in terms of scoring another Runner wont go for the sophomore Music Giles shefflin will try his hand from outside and the lid remains on from long range so far it does four early threes by the Tigers coach Brena wants to see the ball touch the paint Giles came to them out of Silverado High in Las Vegas gr up in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia actually went out to Vegas to be with his brothers and further improve his basketball skills Miss on the inside Try by Music Antoine coach Brownell wants to see the ball touch the paint right here on this possession going to result in a turnover though Gerard giving it up darus Nicholls third season guiding the Highlanders team in his first year they won 11 last year quite a turnaround 21 victories pick second behind UNCC Asheville in the Big South and he does have some connections to this Clemson program well talk more about those we continue on in the ball game tonight so were holding at two nothing tigers scored in the first few seconds on the feed from Gerard de Hall neither team lighting it up so far Highlanders have missed their first three shots tigers are one of six and just as we talked about the Tigers key to guarding the basketball youre seeing Radford play five around the perimeter get it as spaced out as possible to try to create room for those Dynamic guards to get downhill Hunter defending truth Harris who missed on his layup Music try Gerard and Hall up high Music Shak claw coming up on 10 Wiggins from the left wing tigers are one of seven from the field radfords doing an outstanding job keeping the ball in front right now Tigers cant touch the paint first bucket of the night will go down for Giles after a bumpy start hes a 30 threepoint shooter he ended up in a ball screen switch right there with PJ Hall and ble to take advantage of it and knock down the three Gerard has yet to take a shot so far and Antoine knocking it out of bounds so we told you the big win for the Highlanders nine days ago up in Morgantown they were down by a point late they didnt have timeouts left so they played through in the final seconds Smith was on the wing lost the handle rekindled and the final two of his 18 points the winner in a 6665 Tri Hall knocking down the threepoint try giv it a couple of shots third times the charm Tigers keep chipping away at it PJ gets another open look and knocks that one down going back Pete to that big game winner for Radford at West Virginia talking to the Radford staff earlier today they fumbled the ball The Possession didnt go the way they had planned Smith stayed with it able to knock down the game winner and send them home with a win from Morgantown huge win for the Highlanders they had another power five win theyve been giant Killers over the years the year they came in here the last time in that 1819 campaign they have beaten Texas theres Gerard with his first attempt of the night Tigers build on the early Advantage Joe Gerard in the ball screen Radford continue to back up Gerard knocks it down from Deep Highlanders team averaging about 75 points a game 46 from the the field 38 Beyond The Arc Smith withraw defending Chandler Turner missed the runner moments to go and the BG transfer with a turnover Chase Hunter pushing the pace gets the bounce and the Clemson staff talked about defensively they felt like the second half at Queens didnt quite wasnt as sharp as they wanted it to be defensively they want to do a better job guarding the basketball they want to be aggressive defense Ely with Radford but Radford has them so spread out right now theyre having a difficult time doing Music that Radford LED moments ago three to2 Turner on the drive around Hall who swats it away for PJ his 29th block of the Season among the best in the nation Tigers off to a good start Joe Gerard his first attempt a swish from downtown andard doing what he does well Tigers head coach Brad Brownell closing in on 4 20 wins in his career after number 419 tonight and of course the winningest head coach in Clemson history what a start his team is off to really this team looks like it could be as good as any hes had in this decade and a half at the helm I think it can be one of the best Clemson teams in the last 25 years in program history I mean the sky is the limit well talk more about seating and quad wins and all that type stuff a little bit later but its a really special group and uh talking to the staff they know it the players know it and I think its why theyre so engaged every day in practice just when you talk to the players theyre really locked in right now he likes what has been happening with his team offensively Antoine trying to beat the shot clock buzzer itll go as a violation and a tiger team that Brad branell says with the emergence of sophomores like Wiggins and RJ Godfrey whos just checked in during that last timeout in others its its given them offensive depth yes I dont know that you could see a team that could go as deep in terms of the score sheet in recent years that this one has for Clemson I think the big thing with the Tigers you know who the top three scores are going to be scores number four five and six have changed throughout the season and thats part of what a special team can do Godfrey couldnt get it to go down Tigers recycle The Possession doing a good job on the board so far fourth offensive rebound already for the Music tigers tigers on off offense scoring better than 81 points a game Godfrey backing in thats where he lives and Coach Brownell wanted the ball to get into the paint you saw it go in there twice first on the high low feed and then godre right there backing him down getting to his spot continuing to be able to score to his left shoulder another turnover by the Highlanders whove been efficient in that category thats their third tigers with a ninepoint advantage and the opportunity to add on you see some of the numbers for Clemson and again those assists per game if youre ever around Brad branell right after a game the first time he looks at a box score hes going to look at assists to field goals a huge stat as Hunter loads up Chase Hunter with the stroke from the corner outstanding skip pass by Chelsea Wiggins leads to that three tigers on a 130 run first half theyre any team going into the Christmas holiday or coming out of it is always a little bit leery especially coming out or guys legs back under them are they reengage well the Tigers have looked just the part RJ Godfrey had the bucket before the hunter basket and again reexploring those numbers the 39 as a team Beyond The Arc Joe Gerards 45 speaks to that but really impressive work offensively to this point and youve got to remember theyre doing that right now without Jack Clark without Alex hemway uh and and the staff feels like they need to get those two guys back healthy because theyre going to need their shooting when they get into League Play Thats Kenyon Giles game they tell us hell take some shots that make you wonder but those are encourag he is an offbalance kind of player and hes been great at it so far nearly 15 a Game Hunter of the drive and well get the foul call radfords three guards are as talented as any three youll find uh in college basketball and you see that isolation action right there Kenyan Giles able to create his own shot without Justin Archer radfords going to space the floor as much as possible try to spread the Tigers out and allow those guards to play downhill Chase Hunter 83 second on the team from the line contre price the biggest of the guys in their rotation tonight at 610 picking up the first personal and the first foul called on either side tonight Hunter 10 and a half points a game a little bit down from last year hell be the first one to tell you hes not necessarily been in the flow scoring wise that he wants to but an indication as hell get a rest of just how good this team has been offensively is they dont really need much more from him right now I dont know that its so much that hes out of it as much as hes got more weapons around him you know last year Chase really had to score the basketball had Brevin Galloway there beside him but right now Joe Gerard and then that fourth score right now its Chancey Wiggins earlier in the year it was RJ Godfrey theyve got a lot of weapons offensively Josh Beetle defending Giles Works inside turnaround swish wow and thats good defense Josh Beetle checks in the game has good length contests a shot thats just one of those shots where great offense is better than good defense Dyan Hunter off the crossover Beetle the hesitation Gerard and Hall checking back in moments Music ago Godfree shot clock at five the drive pierce the rejection you got two guys in this game that have nearly 30 blocks thats the 28th for him we saw PJ Hall at his 29th earlier and Pierce came into the game averaging two blocks per game hes already gotten those two in the first eight minutes Giles has all seven of their points now hes got all nine hes starting to feel it after a tough start Giles has made some really tough shots Tigers going to have to do a better job pushing out the catch right now Hunter no and the rebound pulled down by the senior out of Denver deontre Pierce truth Harris with the ball guy who seen his playing time increase as the seasons gone along Junior College transfer for them Giles over Gerard that time hes on his own scoring run just like that Highlanders back within five and I think thats a 90 run right now and as you said Kenyan JS I think has all 12 Tigers were trying to deny the catch but he came off of that pin down was able to get any space once he touches it right now hes open Gerard has five answers for the Tigers Clemson 40 all time against Radford Turner lost the handle got it Music back he misses on a second try from the field Gerard loves the transition game and the pullup too look at the work inside Wiggins I should say Godfrey at 67 able to muscle his way underneath and RJ Godfrey is coming off of a career high 19 points against Queens he knows who he is hes out standing around the rim hes a very good offensive rebounder there for the Tigers rebounds it and puts it right back in Godfrey 67 really 68 Wiggins at 610 boy we told you Giles likes to shoot off balance and sometimes you scratch your head some times great offense is just better than really good defense and thats Kenyan Giles had 12 points in their win back on the 20th in West Virginia he has matched that tonight hes done all of their scoring and well the sophomore guard who was an all big South freshman performer keeping his team in this game he was the Freshman of the player of the week week one in the Big South Conference 18 points at the University of North Carolina and then back that up with 22 in a game at The Greenbrier in West Virginia when they beat Marshall and so obviously a really talented guard can score the basketball the tigers are seeing that right now Radford team pick second behind a very good UNCC Asheville Squad in the Big South Conference thatll like their backourt Trenton Walters freshman out of Frisco Texas just checked in he gave it away to Smith who gets the attention of Chase Hunter Smith looking for his first points of the night off the 18 against the Mountaineers and the first player not named Kenyon Giles to get a bucket in this game for the Highlanders outstanding dribble drive right there beat Chase Hunter to the Baseline was able to get to the Rim second turnover for Clemson Tigers ran out to leads of 153 and 17 to5 the personal 70 run by Giles got Radford back in it now a chance to get a little bit Music closer its Kyle Burns the red shirt freshman with the ball and over top of PJ Hall Beetle brings it front Music Courts trying for an 11th win on the year on this last regular season nonconference game Gerard from the left wing not that time shefflin in a battle for the rebound is foul Ian shefflin is one of the best rebounders in college basketball and youre seeing that early right now tonight thats already his second offensive rebound he continues to be a force on the glass they came down off of Joe Gerard PJ Hall kicks it out leaves Ian on the backside for the offensive rebound first foul on Smith second on the Highlanders here in the opening half Hunter skips it Music Beetle it remains a sevenpoint Music game and the Highlanders have been able to do this right now Kenyan Gils checked out during the last media timeout theyre plus two right now coming out of the media Moguls one of the Walk called on Walters shot clock under 10 Gerard defending Walters forces shefin to Gerard to Hunter he wanted to throw it down hell settle for the layup I think Ian shiffon is an outstanding passer you saw on that rebound he turned his shoulders to start the outlet pass immediately got it at the floor and it leads to a twoon one great Outlet pass off the rebound by Ian shefflin Music Smith came to them from Murray State one of their assistants had been on that staff five on the shot clock Turner a big whos known for his outside shot tried to feed it A Smith tiger is forcing another turnover youre see Radford and youre seeing the aggressiveness right now on the ball screen defense Tigers trying to force it down to the side keeping Radford to the sideline and able push it back tigers have done an outstanding job on the glass Ian shefflin with a terrific Outlet pass right here gets it ahead to Joe Gerard pitches it to chase Hunter and the tigers are often running in transition Brad brells teams going to be left on the doorstep on selection Sunday this year you know at this point as theyre about to resume ACC play JD its almost like theyre playing for tournament seating they are and thats such an important part right now in the NCAA tournament is who you play where you play them um because this is a talented Clemson basketball team and theyve got a chance to play deep into the NCAA tournament and I told one of the staff members earlier this week you see it right now theyre playing like every day matters and it does because the seed matters you see those quad one wins most in the ACC this year but not just the quad one but the Quad 4 is really important thats probably what kept them out last year they went nine and three in quad four this year theyre 40 theyve only had four they might have one more potentially but theyre doing an outstanding job and you see that in their net ranking right now chff and the Tigers back to a double figure Advantage up by 11 Smith Harris out of bounds back over to Clemson its an improved ACC thats an important part of the equation over the next couple of months it is and a big part of that that the ACC has won 71 of their nonconference games so far far six teams in the top 5050 uh the league is off to a great start so what that means is when the league plays each other in January February March it helps the league and it doesnt hurt it and The Beat Goes On Tigers build their largest lead of the Music night Tigers continue to move the ball very well great rotation right there defensively by Ian shefin Paul just made a bucket now he forces the turnover looking to give it back to Hunter Wiggins and Hall out Music High hunter to Hall turnaround PJ Hall on his way to another one of those 20point games hes got a pile of those came into the night averaging nearly 21 points a contest great maturity right there by Chase Hunter though he gets the kick out could have taken the 13th three of the first half instead throws it down down low to their AllAmerican candidate gets another paint touch 90 run for Clemson which had a 130 run earlier in this half Giles again off balance took a Victory lap as he fired over Hunter and felt like he got fouled on the dribble penetration thats outstanding defense by Chase Hunter Kenyan Giles is just scoring it really well right now Giles with 14 of their 16 points Wiggins missing badly theres Hall Hunter Pierce impact that shot into the front Court Harris will slow it down boy Giles thought about it from out near the Paw with Wiggins defending he steps back well their top rebounder archer in there clearing the glass going to be an issue for this Radford team but a very good job by chony Wiggins using his length and making J score over the top of him and one for Joe Gerard and thats where I think Joe Gerard has been so good for the Tigers this year he was known as is just a catch and shoot guy but he is outstanding off the bounce talking to associate head coach Billy Donan last night the staff had pulled a stat over the Christmas break Joe Gerard leads the country in pick and roll efficiency right now and you see it right there in his ability to attack downhill gets to the rim strong with the basketball outstanding finish right there for Joe Gerard 91 from the line so he rarely misses Gerard in the game now with tiger growing the Music lead Turner tough go of it so far from Beyond The Arc for several of these Radford Shooters other than Giles Gerard for three Joe Gerard is so special for the Clemson offense talking to the Radford staff last night and earlier today as you talk to other coaching staffs and they watch Clemson old film hes just a GameChanger he changes the Clemson offense and hes why Clemson has a chance to have an incredible season six turnover the night for Radford Hunter and the Tigers trying to extend this run 152 over the past three and a half dont think theyre going to get to 69 like they did last week in the opening 20 minutes against Queens but they are doing a fine job so we talk about the strength of the ACC and again and top 75 is important facing teams like that in conference play it is because thats what goes into the equation for Quad one wins Top 75 uh on the road home neutral once they get to the ACC tournament and thats what the league works for in November and December uh and thats a testament to the scheduling in the non conference couldnt get it to go lets see if he was beyond the arc Smith got him on the arm for his second personal foul Joe Gerard you think of him you mentioned the pick and roll but this is what I think of when I think of Joe Gerard that right there downtown the sixth alltime leading threepoint shooter in ACC basketball history you think about the history of this incredible league and were going to talk about it later you know kind of got off to a little bit of a slow start this season settling in but now hes really really good offensively for the Tigers as as they get into the rest of the league play having already played one ACC game this year building on his scoring night and the second of three free Music throws its been really its been really interesting too is is youve been around Joe Gerard and you see him with the program the way that PJ Hall embraced him whenever he came the teammates hes been a great fit in the Clemson Community just talking to him hes hes an outstanding young man and hes really enjoying his time in Clemson and hall both in double figures dillah Hunter extending the defense on Giles hes the only one theyve not been able to contain Turner back to Giles five on the shot clock a bullet inside Pierce had the size advantage on Gerard and took advantage of it and you mentioned the sophomores for Coach Brown L just a minute ago youre seeing Dylan Hunter now guard Kenyan Giles coach brell wants to see those young guys be effective on the defensive end sheflin for godf and off of Turner Tigers will keep in their end Highlanders trying to hang around theyre down big although a pretty pass inside great job game two assist per game 25 blocks can score it inside and out has incredible touch uh just a really Dynamic player from here in the upstate um hes just hes healthy uh talking to him over Christmas just really excited about his team um he mentioned the fact that you know for so many guys whether youre talking about a Joe Gerard some of the older ones you dont know how many more opportunities like this that you have and you know their motto leave no doubt and you can see it every day in the way that they come to prepare and um as they get ready for the second game of the ACC later this week tough to go inside on that guy second block of the night now 29 on the year for deontre Pierce one of the few stops theyve gotten though over the past several minutes Turner and the Bowling Green transfer able to knock one down from the outside he had been 0 for four but still a mighty Hill to climb for the school from Southwestern Music Virginia they trailed just once this year at the half that was at North Carolina in the first contest of the Year Gerard is feeling it another trade give him three in the game hes got 17 closing in on a 20point opening half great ball Movement by the the Tigers right there Joe Gerard catches it quick shot fake s step knocks down the three Giles over the reach of Hall sheflin pulling down another board nine in the opening half of the tiger Jr Hall able to save it sheff in the lob Hall underneath had the mismatch and theyll get a reach in foul and you see the way Radford has chosen to guard PJ Hall theyre fronting him even when its a guard which means those skip passes are wide open great pass right here ball goes inside theyre moving it Ian shefflin kicks it out terrific pass by shefflin too often you see a threepoint shooter with a pump fake or a hesitation and they generally Miss Gerard about as good at shedding a Defender and then making as Ive seen yeah I think thats a shot thats really become one that in skill development with guards youre constantly working on as a high level shooter uh NBA guys have made that popular over the last 10 years where youve got that guy running at you like theyre going to do to Joe Gerard quick shot fake but the best part of it is the pace with it you know so many players we get in a hurry with the shot fake its not about how fast you can shot fake its about how good the shot fake is great shot fake to a side step young players can learn a lot from that move right there all 78 this season Giles just picked up his first for Radford seven on the Highlanders team and Kenyan Giles done there fronting PJ Hall in the high low uh working really hard the Chesapeake Virginia native is a really tough guard for the ra Highlanders back out to a 23point advantage that matches the largest of the night another turnover by a usually efficient team but then Gerard will give it right back deflection by PJ deflection by PJ Hall leads to transition thats a pass that Joe Gerard wont fumble very many times coming up on two to go in the opening half and tiger team thats holding a squad that averages about 75 game points a game to just 21 over the first 18 minutes and as you mentioned in the opening radfords without multiple guys down low uh obviously Kenyan Giles has shown how Dynamic of a score he can be but this is a really good Radford team missing some important pieces right now Hunter shefflin lines it up battle for the rebound theres contact lets see Balls going to go back over to Radford and I cant say enough about Kenyan Giles you can see the toughness and in talking to Shane Nicholls one of the assistants who obviously has some Upstate ties having played at wford talked about his toughness you know as as a Chesapeake Tidewater Virginia guy down there battling PJ Hall uh really competitive around the basket kenion Giles the sophomore 511 they list him at 165 looks a little bit heavier than that he has scored 14 of their 21 points under one and a half to go Smith trying to get his night going what a pretty move right over Dylan Hunter its an outstanding shot and a finish right there got his shoulder into Dylan Hunter created a little bit of space to be able to get that rightand floater off still a 21p point Clemson Music Advantage Hunter looked low for Music Applause Hall Baseline jumper not going to go for PJ and it comes down to Giles with a chance to get inside a 20 down quickly ahead Pierce in the corner bad Miss by Burns Ive been very impressed with DeAndre Pierce though and and Coach Nicholls talked about him a little bit yesterday we brought up the three Dynamic guards and he immediately went to pierce and talked about his development you saw the pace right there hes running in transition thats a hard catch for a big man called it gathered it and instead of taking a difficult shot at the rims able to find a guard on the perimeter thats an outstanding job passing the basketball by Pier and while the Highlanders are without some really important bigs tonight this is going to prove valuable for for Radford down the road Pierce just picked up his second personal so hell head to the bench PJ Hall one of two and double figures he is 12 Joe Gerard was 17 and Chase Hunter now able to knock down the free throw to join them in that Music category Hunter of course made two of the more important free throws of the Season up in Asheville early on in the win over UAB and we told you earlier came in at 83 second on the team behind his buddy Joe Gerard Gerard will get a rest 39 point6 to go before the break but defensively right here for the Tigers four of the sophomores on the floor right here to try to get this last stop of the half coach brell is using these minutes valuably to try to test his young Music Tigers you see the differential shot clock to game clock Giles hun Music defend coming up on five on the shot clock Smith on the wing he just realized hes coming up on two then one and he forced the three over Dylan Hunter five to go in the half Chase Hunter crossover kick to his brother fitting in to the opening half one Hunter to another great example of what we talked about in the opening Just sh points again the AllAmerican candidate has scored 20 or more 22 times in his career off to a great start here in the first half heated up from three as the game went along 12 in the opening half for the tiger senior at a dormant high in the sparenberg area and Clemson rolling once again 69 last Friday in the first 20 minutes against Queens well the 49 good for a massive lead once again heading into a second half here at home guy with the ball right now is somebody theyre trying to get going tonight their top scorer Antoine and they set a play for him but he cant knock it down just a second attempt of the night and Brian Ana now 0 for Music two so we gave you the keys JD off the top lets see how things have aligned as the first half preceded we talked about radfords physicality and the rebounding really hard as that theyre under man right now particularly without Justin Archer for Clemson it was about guarding the basketball they did not do a great job of that in the second half against Queens I know the coaching staff talked about that extensively they want to see the Tigers do a better job guarding here in the second half you dont see the hook shot that much anymore in college H but PJ Hall uses it as a regular weapon its great when you arrive at the arena early and you get to see the assistant coaches going through things with their players dick Bender out there with PJ Hall Ian sheflin RJ Godfrey BOS Lia all those guys working on that shot they have great touch at The Rim Smith held in check in the first half Giles trying to build on his 14point night give him the assist Antoine and his head coach had a conversation earlier in the year he comes into the night again should be their top score averaging about 11 a game coach said Ive got to get you up around 12 he responded with his career high of a huge output 30 against Elon but still looking for more out of him and weve got a foul on the floor PJ Hall doing an outstanding job getting deep post position thats been one of the few times Pierce has allowed him to catch it that deep the Highlanders had been fronting the post working to make that catch harder he allows PJ Hall to catch it that deep theres not much of a defense for Music that drive inside by Gerard off the inbound play outstanding drive to his left Joe Gerard saw that Gap took it all the way to the rim and finished it at the hole just DeAndre Pierce their best big with his third of the night Highlanders cant afford to trade baskets obviously with this deficit Walters freshman point guard from just outside of Dallas Gerard nearly knocked it away what a nice inbound play this was and again Joe Gerard you think about him as a longrange shooter but he is very good at attacking the basket hes very crafty hes got strong shoulders he recognized this Gap to the left Ive been really impressed this season with his ability to tack off the dribble outstanding shooter obviously but can really play off the bounce as well Smith just made like his buddy Giles forcing the shot gets it to go hes got half a dozen but still the big deficit Gerard another drive went up and under outstanding job attacking that close out right there had the back cut from Chelsea Wiggins Joe Gerard catches it on the wing and attacks off the dribble hes got 21 it was against a team from the state of Virginia that had his career high of 31 a season ago against Richmond as Hall nearly took it away so could be a night where he sets another milestone for himself quick pass on the wing Turner he got Hall in the air goes over top of shefflin and PJ Hall clears the glass great recognition by Joe Gerard that DeAndre Pierce had picked up another foul they took the shot blocker off the floor for the Highlanders Tigers played at The Rim Yeah able to lay it in no no Rim protection right now for the Highlanders Hunter lobs Hall kicks shefflin delivers outstanding pass right there by PJ Hall catches it with one hand immediately finds his teammate Ian shefflin right there on the perimeter knocking down that three we talked about the best in the ACC at sharing the basketball youre seeing it right here in the first half from the Tigers rolling early second half 5827 on the Radford Highlanders off the top we talked about how well this Clemson team shares the basketball this is great vision by PJ Hall as this ball is post fed by Chase Hunter he catches it with one hand and before he ever touches the floor he knew exactly where Ian shefflin was you talk about a connected group and the chance to have a special season those are the types of plays that uh you get excited about as a coach on film because he knew exactly where his teammate was going to be tiger showing some full court pressure sheflin doesnt take many threes that was his first made of the 90s s of 12 on the season Beyond The Arc Giles they were trying to set a play for him looking to break down Hunter on the wing for burns get the pull up jumper to fall Gerard Hall in transition around Turner goes under the defender Pierce and ju and I think the thing that youre going to keep your eyes on in the second half is going to be the defense for the Tigers as we talked about staff didnt feel quite like they guarded as well in the second half against Queens as they would have liked great possession again defensively leads to that right there PJ catches it at the top of the key and the Tigers took a lot of Threes in the first half and they shoot it so well theyre shooting 38 uh but they continue to attack the rim with a little bit more intentionality in the second half than they did in the first pierce had just checked back in now hes back on the bench with a fourth personal foul PA building on a nice night perfect from the line three out of three give him 17 of course he had that impressive effort with 27 points last Friday night against Queens 21 and the only loss of the Season at Memphis the game before Turner on BOS Lia who just checked in and the foul be called on the transfer from UNCG whos actually played against Radford before and BOS Lia originally from the Netherlands been in the States now for quite a while and Mom and Dad are here theres Helen and Adrien Lia came over to visit for a few weeks see their son and the Clemson coaching staff has really good confidence in B Lia again talking to Dick Bender last night uh he was playing 10 12 minutes per game November early December did not play as much late in December they know theyve got to get him more valuable minutes because theyre going to need him in January and February they dont want to see PJ Hall playing 32 plus minutes a game in the ACC they know the physicality of it theyve got to get Lia going other than the injuries for Clark and hemway and Brad branell telling us this morning that hes been told that its optimistic on those guys returning sooner than later what hasnt worked for this Clemson team laa has come in and fit his role Gerard obviously the growth of the sophomores w wi and Godfrey in particular as Wiggins goes to work on Turner and hell be called for the travel but everything seemingly has fit into place shefflin emerging as a factor especially inside with his seventh double figure rebound game of the season so far tonight I made the comment to Dick Bender last night uh the the the bench is short right now its a little bit easier as a coach you dont have to worry about you know whos getting minutes whos not playing obviously they need those guys back they feel like theyre going to need their shooting in the ACC but as you said theyre playing so well now as those guys build back in it presents a challenge within the opportunity Burns now 0 for two Beyond The Arc 0 for four on the night kind of how its gone for the Radford Highlanders that man should be smiling more but hes feeling good inside when he looks at the scoreboard basetball day for Clemsons first family theres president Jim clemenss daughter Grace they were down at the Gator Bowl wouldnt have see that exciting come from behind Victory 3835 here they are tonight at the basketball game and his wife Beth is also on hand tonight and theyre celebrating their 33rd wedding anniversary so congratulations to the Clemens on that as well its a special day you know you dont plan for days like today the bowl game obviously fell on the same day as a basketball game that happens sometimes football team got the win much needed going into the off season basketball team is having a great season G to continue to play well and then a great turnout here tonight uh and the next home game is going to continue to be like this as North Carolina comes to town Gerard already on a 21point night Hunter on the right wing got the feed from his brother remember he kicked it out to Dylan to close out the opening half and Chase Hunter having one of his better scoring nights hes got 14 so far given back to his brother after getting the assist at the end of the Music half Highlanders team has been held in check 38 for the game but it just seems like much lower than that and theyve had very little flow offensively other than that guy Giles who will head to the line its a great challenge for the Tigers to guard the basketball here in the second half going to go to Miami next Wednesday the schedules going to get hard uh the staff wants to continue to see this team that is so talented offensively lock in on the defensive end Giles 91 from the line this season although there are others who are ahead of him on their team shows the nice touch his first points of the second half after he scored 14 of their 23 opening Half Point darus Nicholls told me today he wasnt here just to hang around in the game they were coming in here to win its like they did in Morgantown back on the 20th one out of two for Giles but as Clemson is like to do they have made it difficult on a foe here in Little John this season Radford is very good close loss to Old Dominion James Madison beat Marshall uh one at West Virginia theyre better than this performance tonight theyre without a lot of guys theyll try to get some guys healthy as conference play starts next week Giles hesitated then slipped amazing they didnt turn it over Smith from the wing halfway down it comes out Harris couldnt hold on to the rebound for the Highlanders loose ball almost came 34 Point Advantage loose ball allus came up big for the Highlanders with the open three Music laa had a choice of hunters gave it to chase how about BOS from the outside Mom and Dad have got to be loving that just a few feet away from where he drained that threepointer his first as a tiger first one of the Season parents are here in attendance good for BOS Lia biggest lead of the night Tigers extended to 37 Gil trying to split Defenders Dylan and Chase Hunter shot clock at five and the bomb for truth Harris 44 Beyond The Arc the junior here from Indian Hills Community College averaging seven points per game this year just just gives coach Nicholls another Dynamic score on the perimeter Gerard Antoine had a hand in his face Wiggins cleans up inside chony Wiggins getting into the scoring column coming in averaging about seven and a half a game as first bucket of the night 13 points per game in the last four has really emerged in the second half of December to give the Tigers another scoring option but what theyll love right there is the offensive rebound and scoring it in the paint Lia out defending the much smaller Giles who breaks him down and gets the roll thats an outstanding shot by Kenyan Giles was able to create face step away from the bigger B Lia able to get it off great touch at The Music Rim Harris reaching in almost took that one away Dylan Hunter Wiggins from the free throw line he loves the midrange game outstanding flash there by chony Wiggins since the last media timeout Clemson has gone a little bit more to some motion playing through the elbow a little bit of a overaction right there to a back cut with a ball screen great shot by chony Wiggins away from the ball a foul and itll be a hold on Wiggins so how about BOS Lia giving him something to talk about for this family reunion absolutely family in town for about a month you see the reaction right there uh theyre excited what a thrill for that family to be over here to see their son I think they said for 3 to four weeks so theyll get to see some ACC games at home big shot for BOS ligher right there his second appearance against Radford his first points didnt score when he was on UNCG and the teams played a few years back off the inbound Giles fade away and Beetle defending well great job by the sophomore guard for the Tigers coach bro wants to see Dylan Hunter Josh Beetle continue to step up and guard Kenyan Giles here in the second half feed inside to Godfrey theyll get an one on the reach in tough go of it for the visitors and little John Tigers rolling Tigers knew when Joseph Gerard came down from Syracuse as the returning leading score in the ACC they we get somebody who could fill it up first couple of games hes settled in since hes been Dynamite Joe Gerard has been everything that coach branell and the staff could have hoped for and more watching him come into practice in the summer um they talked about learning to defend manto man but just seeing the way the Tigers have shared the basketball uh he made another three to tie Scott wood for fifth place all time in the ACC uh for fifth all time in threes made really Dynamic all outstanding player for the Tigers and is having a great year off the inbound beetle look at the ball movement Godfrey to Gerard thats a milestone three the 335th of his career right time to pass Scott Wood from NC State for fifth all time outstanding pass by RJ Godfrey recognized the one more throws it to Gerard he knocks it down 24 in the game for the native of runs Falls New Music York tiger pushing a 40point lead here I love watching RJ Godfrey and ball screen defense for the Tigers they went to a switch right there I believe RJ Godfrey is their best post player to switch the ball screen and so he allows them to change that up they were pushing most of them down to the sideline Godfrey came in got into a switch and was able to Music guard Godfrey shot clock at 10 tried to get it inside the Li and out of bounds back over to the Highlanders just the sixth turnover for the Clemson team Lia getting extended minutes you know his family loves that but on top of all hes able to give PJ Hall an extended rest and now tiger star Postman old check in but Mom and Dad have to like what theyve seen at of BOS Lia filling that that role perfectly is a guy they only need about 10 minutes a game out of to give hall or shefflin arrest absolutely and the staff knows that they felt like late in December he didnt get as many minutes as he needed so you can see a conscious effort here in the second half to get him more time and continue to get him more comfortable Burns keeping the possession alive Joseph Gerard good catch and shoot guy as good as youll find outstanding job on the set play out of the timeout Josh Beetle comes off with that curl kicks it to the corner and again I go back to RJ Godfreys pass very good knocks it down right there to Joe Gerard Chand Turner Chandler Turner came to their program from Bowling Green in the back but you see the score Tigers continue to lead comfortably Gerard getting a rest just in recent memory Tigers had a couple of guards come into the program from Robert Morris and Vanderbilt respectively Maris Reed Sheldon Mitchell another block for Pierce it was four fouls but Godfrey inside to finish it up RJ Godfrey has done a great job all season on the offensive glass but Im really impressed with DeAndre Pierce uh its been very good defending at The Rim hes got the four fouls coach Nichols is going to continue to let him play because he will grow from this opportunity tonight Music Applause great communication right there by the Tigers you saw a ball screen that involved two post players RJ Godfrey and PJ Hall they initially were in a down coverage PJ changed it mid ball screen and got it into a switch really impressive I know the Highlanders scored there but thats great communication on the defensive end by the Tigers Turner now has nine Hall unable to get it to go look at beetles skying with red jerseys on either side and the arrow will keep it in the Clemson in Josh Beetle continues to be athletic hes done a great job over the last couple of weeks on the defensive then for the tigers attacking offensively off the dribble they are going to the offensive glass so Gerard here for just one year theres Maris Reed and Shelton Mitchell were here for multiple Seasons we know the impact they had on a team that made it to the Sweet 16 go way back to the 90s and uh boy the Tigers had a fine guard who was here for just a couple of years way back when Chris Whitney was an outstanding guard growing up in Westminister South Carolina getting to come to games at Little John I remember seeing Chris play outstanding J player for the Tigers that was almost a turnover on the part of Truth Harris but you look at Chris Whitney and what he was able to do in two years under Cliff Ellis and then really Reed and Mitchell and then you add Gerard and in terms of short tenured guys in the back court those may be the the four best that have come through this Clemson program yeah the name Chris Whitney was just such a thats a great one by you Pete and you talk about the impact that Joe Gerard has has a chance to have for the Tigers this year with the season that theyre having um and now hes going into the history books hes one of the top five alltime Shooters in the ACC now of course the longtime fans says wait a minute skip Y is just one year but had he stayed his entire career he might have been the greatest player in Clemson history were talking about guys who came to the program from other places from the corner bad Miss for Antoine whos struggling tonight Music 7639 game coming up on8 to go but in terms of being able to go out in the portal era and get guys who can come in and help you big time Brad Brown ells done a very nice job of that in recent Seasons as I think about college basketball right now and you think about guys Hunter Dickinson at Kansas comes to mind is in terms of transfers that have had a huge impact Joe Gerard is in that list when you talk about the tigers being in the top 20 right now the season that theyre having having Hunter Dickerson obviously will be at Kansas for one year um those types of transfers are having a major Music impact Hunter having one of his better scoring nights goes over top of Applause Harris 16 of the game for the tiger senior from just outside of Atlanta good to see Chase Hunter right there he just got into a spot elevated knocked down the pullup jump shot Tigers again on the verge of a 40point lead coming up on seven and a half to go Anon trying to get past Godfrey and taken away Beatle ahead to Hunter had to rekindle now hell load up Beetle off the deflection for Paul I dont know give PJ assist I think so I I might even give the assist to chase Hunter you know youre talented offensively as a team when you take a transition layup dribble it out shoot the three it goes to the r but a great job by Josh Beetle again on the offensive glass continues to use his athleticism to scor eff head coach in his first time facing the Tigers in that capacity but he has seen Clemson before Madison Square Garden March of 2007 the NIT final and there he is Nicholls if he wasnt driving he was hitting fadeaways a 13point effort you notice they didnt spell Virginia correctly on the tshirts but they were happy to hold them up as they knocked off the tigers by five a 25 win Clemson team that almost want an nit title but guy whos running the show for Radford big hand in that he had actually made the game winner late against Mississippi State in the semifinals or else it would have been Tigers Bulldogs in the championship Ive had the pleasure of knowing darus Nichols for a number of years he was an assistant at wford was at the University of Florida with Mike White and so I reached out to coach white yesterday and I I asked him I said when he was an assistant for you when did you know he was special and the two things that coach white came back was his personality and his presence and the thing that immediately came to my mind when coach white told me that is the retention of their players and Coach Nichols has talked about it so much of it isnt just about who you get its who you keep and you can tell in the relationship that he has with his guys coach Nichols is a bright star radfords got a really good one Godfrey got Pierce in the air RJ Godfrey now was eight on the night Tigers up by better than 40 and still about six and a half to go quick move to the bucket by The Freshman Walters out front Antoine got to feel good for him five on the night hes now one of three Beyond The Arc five points in the second half for the senior for Radford theyll need more of that as they get into the Big South Conference Godfrey and Pierce with four fouls can only be so aggressive hes a really good shot blocker I think that the evening has been so valuable for DeAndre Pierce Id like to see him go ahead and just play aggressive you youre going to get that fifth foul here over the next couple of minutes go ahead and guard continue to play aggressive defensively and continue to grow from this tonight he is like to shoot it him there Kenyan Giles as the double team comes five on the shot clock tried to give it away to Walters Hunter couldnt save it take a look at RJ Godfrey hes really found a home close in this year led the Tigers in Phil go percent this past season at 62 continues to be athletic at The Rim both as a shot BL as a offensive rebounder putting the ball back in but hes done a really good job of getting deep post position youve seen him score to his jump hook a couple of times hes really grown this season to beat the shot clock out in front itll go down for Trenton Walters a 39 threepoint shooter Godfrey one of the double figures scores with 10 gets the ball out high he had the career high 19 last week against Queens shefflin lobbing for Godfrey tried to kick it across the lane Antoine came in with 21 Steals on the year to lead their team Giles on sheflin look like Godfrey got a hand on it Turner and RJ Godfrey clears the glass hes got five boards in the game tigers in some key stat areas really doing great work Wiggins no but shefflin on a double fig rebounding night for him Dylan Hunter Godfrey again the rebounding totals although the turnover and Antoine and Godfrey with the foul and just on the glass alone that tells a big story in this game as Clemson has outrebounded the Highlanders 4013 they have back toback turnovers right here for the Tigers watching coach branell and the staff the ball has gotten deep into the pain in two straight possessions RJ Godfrey probably passed up a shot The Possession before when he kicked it out and led to the turnover I think coach Brett would like to see his young player take that up strong and finish it at The Rim godre is first Antoine Villanova transfer was plagued by injury when he was with the wild cats but a year ago he was first team all big South 91 on the Year from the line you know for the second straight Friday the game has gone into the second half with the outcome not in question and you you just saw Brad Brownell looking pretty intensely because there were some things in the second half last week in the dominant win over Queens he wasnt necessarily happy with you see him coaching up RJ Godfrey there yeah you know its something that we talked about over the holiday break with the coaching staff the game was so out of hand uh they were in a certain ball screen coverage they wanted to stick with it but they want to see him guard they want to guard the basketball because they know that starting next Wednesday in Miami its going to get much harder uh and theyve got to be able to play on the defensive end get stops whenever the offensive baskets arent quite as easy Josh Beetle changing hands in the air I cant say enough about Josh Beetle and the growth that hes had over the last month or so got off to a little bit of a slow SE uh start to the season coming off of the injury but its really bought into his role right now as a Defender and attacking the rim off the bounce Walters haded ring out theres six of 19 Beyond The Ark Wiggins and the size on Walters who Music stay other end Harris hitting the three in transition two tigers and a Highlander were Tangled Up on the opposite end of the Court 8650 is our score Tigers rolling on win number 11 just a few minutes do an already Sterling NCAA attorney resume tigers with three quad wins so far this year the most in the ACC second in the RPI as we talked to the coaching staff before the season we knew November and December were big we talked about going nine and3 against Quad 4 this past year some of those losses in November and December and they were challenged early in the year UAB Davidson obviously South Carolinas very good an outstanding season but they responded in those those games they did what they needed to do in the nonconference and now ACC play continues on Wednesday and they continue to build on the body of work that theyve already got and our producer couldnt stop talking about it throughout the day about the quad one win opportunities ahead itll be tough at Miami home against North Carolina at Virginia Tech hasnt been tough for Josh Beetle got a chance to complete it by the way just to note if youre into such things and when your mind is like mine and and often just thinking of things to come up with Virginia Tech and Radford not only they just a few miles apart in Southwest Virginia they share the commonality of having the only two division one head coaches who were also Radford High alums so in the span of four games the Tigers will face head coaches with that on their High School diplomas as Mike young of course the head coach at Virginia Tech essentially went home when he took over the Hokies a few years ago and darus Nichols a proud Alum of that high school as is his brother and assistant coach Shane and and both were inducted to their High School Hall of Fame this past fall congrats to them Wiggins picking up the scoring in the second half second straight game Tigers get past 90 dont know if theyll get to 100 after scoring 109 against Music Queens I asked coach darus Nichols that question yesterday I said whats it like to coach in your hometown obviously he said the community support is so important its really helped in recruiting uh hes able to help guys when theyre wanting to make majoring something or to meet someone on that official visit he said theres challenges you know with being at home like that but I know the people back in Radford are really proud of Coach Nicholls and and both Shane and darus and what theyve been able to continue to build at raford Turner now has 11 for the Highlanders Matt Kelly on the floor for the Tigers he had the ball moments ago look at the move by Wiggins the ceiling I still think is huge for a guy who just continues to grow up at 610 he can step out you can give the Tigers two 610 guys at the same time with him and Hall who can hit threes and then another big in chlin hell conclude his night with that as his Farewell eight points in the game for the sophomore chony Wiggins when you go into a gym and you talk about what NBA players look like physically thats what they look like and his his body changed so much this past summer uh they wanted him to get stronger so that he could score better at the paint be a better offensive rebounder weve seen that in both of these last two possessions but hes really worked hard physically and they felt like coming off of his freshman year his Pace had to change some in practice but youre seeing the fruits of the labor 13 points per game in the last four games hes really talented Daniel NOS just checked in commits the personal foul truth Harris came to them from Indian Hills Community College originally from just outside of New York City Highlanders were held to a season low for a first half just 24 points that try from long range knocking go down for Latif so I had the unique opportunity when I was uh at the College of Charleston for my last year Andrew Latif came to us from Daniel high school he was going to walk on unfortunately broke his leg right before school started but stayed there with us was was worked with our team during his recovery before transferring back to Clemson really proud of that young man and what hes done hes about to get his degree from Clemson forcing it unable to get it to go down Burns Red Shir freshman under a minute and a half to go Tigers will go to Five and0 all time against a team out of the Big South who will be very good in their conference hson will get a second win against the Big South team remember they opened against winr with a dominant performance Hunter on the drive had it knocked Away by Walters then some ping pong action and the Highlanders will keep it UNC Asheville pick to win I think they and Radford from the Big South teams Ive seen so far in their own realm at this point as far as that conference goes I think winth can do some good things High Point very good Gardner Webb got a great home win against a good Western Carolina team earlier this season I think the Big South Conference is very good I asked coach Nichols that question yesterday tell me about the league and and the first thing he said its better than what people think some very good coaches in that League really talented players itll be a really good year uh in the Big South Conference little pump fake and a drive by Kelly Tigers working the perimeter Beetle kicks and Latif with the walk youre supposed to shoot those as the walk on Josh Beetle knew exactly what he was doing he drove it kicked it to his teammate uh youre supposed to shoot those Andrew good effort all around loading up from the outside and getting it to fall Walters hes got six in the game both on threepointers Tigers going to just dribble it out itll be another convincing win what a nonconference run when you consider the only loss outside of the league was by two points on the road in overtime at Memphis a game that they very easily could have won L it the half or I say it overtime late game tight game down you know very very tough game and the Tigers did what they needed to do in the nonconference uh anyone that would have signed up for this record right now going into January going into next Wednesday at Miami would have done it in a heart
