One and two Syracuse in the white jerseys Monmouth in the road blue Tony Henderson our lead official to toss the ball in the air Hes joined by Jerry Heer and Eric Lewis Theres the new Syracuse point guard Nathan George facing Manmas defense on the first possession of the game Heres Starling driving down the lane Scoop shot off glass is rebounded by Cornelius Robinson for the Hawks We take a look at the Manmma starting five their leader in points rebounds steals and blocks as number one Jason Rivera Torres Also keep an eye on Jack Collins a fouryear starter for the Hawks Back to him Torres turned away by Syracuse and William Kyle III Syracuse already showing off that size and athleticism protecting the rim Freeman is fouled on the way to the rim and he will go to the line William Kyle leads the team in blocks and he turned away what looked like a layup there for the Hawks Yeah Mama thought they had a open lane and out of nowhere I even thought they had the open basket and out of nowhere they came flying and cleaned up the glass The foul on Justin Ray his first is Donnie Freeman one of the two returning scholarship players on this team will go to the line and the first point of the game applause We mentioned those three wins for Syracuse Monmouth 12 a division 2 win over Caldwell to start the year and then losses at Lasal and Satan Hall but played well for long stretches in both games as another foul is called against Monmouth This will be on Stfanos Spartales So Im not really mad at this foul In order for mom to really have a chance they have to meet the physicality of Syracuse So letting them know that theyre there early Im okay with Spartala big freshman from Greece has a nice pass to George who lays it in First field goal of the game for the Orange You see Stling back in the lineup That means Cayenne Anthony goes to the bench Stling and Donnie Freeman the two returning players for the Orange this year So what Mammoth Mama has to do a lot to do have a lot to have to take a lot of boxes to win this game One thing they cant do is turn the ball over Thats in their Achilles heel and they just got to make sure to take care of the rock threepointer from Collins Knocks it down to tie the game Jack Collins a rare fouryear player in this day and age Hes a fouryear starter at Monmouth and he was preseason second team all CAA And coach King Rice told us we played well in 25 30 minute stretches as fouls piling up early against Monmouth Thats going to be another one on Spartales Its already a second Yeah Mamus defense has actually been pretty solid this early part of the season Where they struggle is their offense It tends to become stagnant So what they need to remember to do is just keep moving keep cutting and find quality shots King Rice a Bingmpington native in his 15th season as Mess head coach He is the winningest coach in school history 221 career victories George lobs it for Kyle Oh had it knocked away nicely What was going to be a dunk Good job by Robinson Itll stay with the orange with 12 on the shot clock So one of the focal points this morning was to make sure that the lane was clogged Kyle got into the lane a little bit easier than King Coach King would have liked but they made up for it and got the the rip away Kings the three and its good Nate Kings who struggled so far this year Coach Audreys got kind of like to see that first one go in Is you know he hasnt had the best start shoot seasoning but He shot 44 last year and as a shooter all you can do is see a couple go in and that confidence will come right back We saw him at practice yesterday I dont think he missed a single shot in about two hours A soft touch Heres Rivera Torres the focal point of the Monmouth attack Kicks it out for a Robinson cheering three Its good Cornelius Robinson first threepointer of the season So far Monmouth looking sharp on offense Threes are falling Freeman banging bodies with Justin Ray Shoots it over Was rebounded by Robinson whos been active early Hawks patient on offense here This is Rivera Torres who started his career at Vanderbilt play last year at San Francisco and a fat applause He had to be caught on JJ Stling His first Syracuse led by thirdyear head coach Adrien Red Autry class of 1994 and hes got the Orange off to a terrific start this year leading division one in basically the most important defensive categories field goal percentage defense as well as points allowed Also threepoint defense Thats all due to their increased size and length He really you know there theres a revamp in the bigs You know he wanted to he wanted the bigs to reflect a little bit more how the game was going Defensively he wanted them to guard multiple positions Offensively he wanted them to be able to handle the ball move the rod move it uh move the defense move the defense as well as attack the rim And coach Autry said he really wanted to address their athleticism in recruiting and the transfer portal in the offseason especially in the front court And youve seen that early Definitely bringing in guys like William Kyle can really attack the rim The return of Donnie Freeman Akir Suare a big body off the bench as well like all all those all the bigs super versatile super athletic They have long arms that both can get in the lanes and also protect the rim Seven on the shot clock Heres Freeman going oneonone with Rivera Torres and another foul Thatll be the fourth foul on Manmouth already in this first three and a half minutes So one thing that coach Autry wanted to stress is again mobile bigs who can attack and put pressure on the rim You put pressure on the rim not only do you put pressure on the defense you put pressure on the the ref to call fouls Here comes Kayenne Anthony about three and a half minutes into the game for JJ Starling who spotlighted those two players off the top Anthony gets a big hand as does Stling as hell take a breather Theres mom Laai Anthony Get out GET OUT GET IT DONE WOW Another foul Thatll be the fifth foul on Manmouth This is the second on Rivera Torres the Hawks best player So this is going to Didnt like that call huh Mecca No you got you got to let you got to let players warm up to the game Ref whistle are kind of tight one way and you know basketballs a physical game Its not a noncont sport the nature of playing defense You cant punish a team for being physical And thats what Mas are trying to do Trying to hit first You got to hit a bully first Thats what were trying to do Andrew Ball checks in for Rivera Torres the teams leading scorer and rebounder Nathan George a three He knocks it down Nathan George now five out of 11 from threepoint range this season And Nathan Jordan hes hes a pass first point guard but he but Syracuse is really really at his best when hes looked when he looks to be aggressive Monmouth yet to get it inside the arc with eight on the shot clock They throw it into the second row A turnover under six Stress stress defense And you can see the early results Now you saw that note on how many threepointers Syracuse has given up all season Only eight but Manmouth with two already accounting for all six of his points Freeman attacks the rim Sadi White who just checked into the game couldnt follow And its rebounded by Jack Collins He turns it over in the back court and then steals it back Thats how you make up with effort Almost led to a Syracuse basket but Collins good hustle to get it back Doc Mar has checked in for Manmouth He replaced Rivera Torres whos on the bench with two fouls cheering Ray a three Robinsons been very active Gets this man in the air and scores So offensive rebounding is going to be very important for Mon They need to go They have to find buckets where they can Robinson already five points three rebounds and an assist as Anthony is tracked And he had it ripped away And its a jump ball caused by Robinson And the jump ball will go over to the Hawks So in my notes music I said that you know Mamemoth theyre going to continuously have to hunt out winning plays And that right there is a winning play Going after the ball getting getting the tie up and getting the possession Well you said something earlier You got you got to punch that bully in the mouth Obviously mans coming in here Nobody thinks theyre going to win Theyre coming out strong and theyre they dont look afraid You got to you got to meet fear with power Thats what theyre doing Robinson has led the charge so far Number 23 Good patience here by the Hawks move projected by Suare but Mamemoth keeps possession and a foul on White will reset the shot clock I felt that block You know something about that right I do You see both teams rank right up at the top of the country in blocks Both teams have sizing length A little different type but they both protect the paint pretty well Monmouth is in the top 20 nationally in field goal percentage defense 36 So even though theyre one and two theyve done a good job at this end of the court as well Their their their problem has been offense which actually theyre doing pretty well Theyre moving the ball Theyre taking their time Theyre getting quality shots First two of the game for Andrew Ball as Monmouth takes its first lead of the game Taking it right back is Syracuse George And part part of the game plan for Manmouth they want to take away the middle So theyre going to give up a little bit more threes than theyre used to They just dont want Syracuse hanging on the rim and getting the bigs warmed up and getting the crowd involved Heres Collins going oneonone Skips it for Ray Hell shoot a three Oh thats good Ray is very important Thats their shooter Its important to him to get off to a good start He had a great first game been struggling to find his start I mean his his stroke these past two games So good to see that hes hes online Ray is now six out of 11 from threepoint range this season Kings an air ball Rebounded by Robinson Monmouth up two with the ball Ray off a screen Had it knocked away and turns it over George running the break ahead for White who will dunk it cheering Syracuse has sticky hands cannot be loose with the ball If youre loose with the ball youll pay for on the other end And thats what King Rice told us Turning the ball over has been our Achilles heel That leads to a run out and a big dump Back and forth action early on cheering Awkward sequence here for Manmouth with five on the shot clock Ray with two shoots it from the baseline and is fouled with one second on the shot clock And itll be two free throws coming up for Regy So Mommouth is going to have to really really be patient off Theres a concept called good to great right So trying to pass up a cheering good a good shot for a great These are ACC Networks featured mens basketball matchups Camboozer and number five Duke host Howard on Sunday afternoon at 4 Eastern at Cameron Indoor Coach Beheim on the call on that game Plus sixth ranked Louisville host Eastern Michigan Monday at 700 Both are available on the allnew ESPN app Good to great Finish that off First day on the job folks Yeah good to great So you know against a good defense and speltering and dominant defense as uh Syracuse that great shot isnt going to be available So you got to take the first good look You got two free throws for Ray Hes up to five points as Monmouth regains the lead Bryce Zephus checked in All sorts of subs Actually Zephrs in the game Starlings back in as well Threepointer from Anthony is off the back iron Rebounded by Ball Monmouth has brought in Anthony Martinez a freshman point guard from France Hes got it here Also checking in Janu Dubul as a foul is called I think on Starling Thats his second Mamas a very tricky team They hang around and they play hard They play together They dont give up They do what they can They take care of the ball Well see how this take well see how this game ends up So two fouls on Stling Hell stay in the game with 12 minutes to go in the first half Dub glides to the rim turned away gets it back Robinson and he is foul There are a lot of connections between these two coaching staff 41 years ago Coach Ree said Thats my best friend He said he used to stay over at Adrien Autys house in Harlem when they had basketball tournaments He actually recruited Adrians son Trey to play for them at Monmouth He ended up going to GW And Coach Autry said Thats my brother Ive known him my whole life and we still keep in touch all the time And that still shot of St Nicholas of Tolentine High School Brian Reese was on the right Adrien Archery was in the upper left as Anthony drives to the rim Missed the shot Its rebounded by Dubul as Monmouth will run the other way The Hawks hanging in there early as they did change in the timeout A threepointer to a two for Manmouth So the score is 154 as Manmouth had a point taken off the board Five on the shot clock Zephr all over ball and he traveled applause and cheering So with this group were going to have a little bit of trouble scoring Did a did a decent job moving the ball but just couldnt put enough pressure Ball tried to put his head and go down or just shuffle his feet Had the right had the right intention though Incidentally both Actry and Reese ended up being McDonalds AllAmericans in 1990 And in that game that video which we unearthed on YouTube they played Archbishop Malloy which was led by superstar Kenny Anderson Stling is fouled by Martinez Martinez as Collins will come back into the game So Monmouth already with six fouls So Syracuse is going to be shooting free throws for the final 10 and change of this first half as William Kyle comes in for Suare but a host of players actually two players for each team already have two fouls Whistles whistle been kind of loose this game so far What have you seen from Syracuse on offense so far Offense you know they theyre moving the ball well Theyre hitting more threes than they have in the past right there Theyre so thrilled They found that back there and thats you know make angry because a specific incident They wanted to load to the ball and make sure that middle clock so that that those rim dunks were not allowed White finishes the high low feed from Kyle as Syracuse retakes the lead to bowl Back iron Collins volleys it out to Martinez Collins throws it into the second row And again you talked about it Those turnovers fifth of the game already Yeah Their their coach said Hey we get a lot of offensive rebounds but we negate it by turning the ball over And it makes an already difficult job that much more difficult These guys are playing hard They keep themselves in the game A couple of a couple of turnovers less and just wasted possessions And you see that turnover comparison Syracuse excels turnover margin fifth in the NCA Monmouth bottom 15 in the country 17 almost 17 turnovers a game This is going to be a key factor in this game as now Syracuse turns it over That is the third turnover for the Orange And and you never want turnovers but if you do have them you want those quote unquote dead ball turnovers where the ball goes out of bounds or its traveling not a live ball turnover that leads to a run out in the dunk Yeah you want a dead ball turn but you dont want a live ball turn Not especially against Syracuse They are the elite at turning defense into offense and dont want to get into get that track Bartales back in follows it up and in His first two of the game as Monmouth 3 takes the lead Also into the game for the Hawks freshman Omari and Harvey number eight And this is going to put Syracuse at the line Yeah So theres a concept called bumping the cutter and its a physical act I I dont think that should be a foul cuz if you dont bump the cutter its a free lane to the rim You were taught it the whole my my whole basketball career as a big you always taught to chuck the cutter chuck the cutter chuck the cutter Now you played 20 years ago Theyve really tried to clean up a lot of that sort of offball you know physicality and improve the flow of the game away from the ball Yeah I I I get it but you know it makes it just makes it very hard to def laughter makes it very hard to defend I guess you have to decide what the priorities are You know whether you want to free throw on offense or uh have the defense have a chance cuz in this case if Mama doesnt put a body on Kyle on Sadi on Freeman theres going to be living at the at the rim Now Kyle has a very unorthodox free throw shooting motion and it led to a lane violation for Monmouth Hell get another shot at it Hell miss that one too And its rebounded by Spartales You know so far Monmouth is doing all the little things to keep himself in the game Their defensive rebounding their offensive rebounding you know the turnover battle right now They can just take care of the ball as we speak right there you know but you get some runway cuz youre going to need some runway against this team cuz its only a like once Syracuse warms up to the game and gets their flow Watch out Six turnovers now for the Hawks Freeman will pop the three Rebounded by Dubul Transfer from Portland Manmouth picked sixth out of 13 teams in the Coastal Athletic Association poll The top three were Talson UNCC Wilmington the defending champs and Charleston And its Bartales the freshman Hes got four points I I like Spartalis Hes really a real solid present in the post Oh Stling almost turned it over Itll stay with the orange Monmouth 13 and 20 last year 10 and eight in the CA each of the last two seasons Monmouth theyve played really really hard and youre going to have to have some elevated performances from a lot of key players for them to to pull this one out and theyve looked loose They looked loose Yes they the offense is flowing again They got to take care of the ball Defense theyre theyre hunkering down Theyre making it tough on Syracuse And King Rice told us he likes to really give his team a lot of freedom and allow them to build confidence as another foul is caught on Martinez is going to put Syracuse at the line But that freedom and the ability to you know maybe take a bad shot here and there and not go straight to the bench thats got to be empowering for his players No the basketball is all about confidence If you feel that you can take the ball and kick it into the stands youll still be on the court It just allows you to be out there be out there with your teammates and uh be carefree but attend George the transfer from Georgia Tech will head to the line Honorable mention all ACC last year He actually leads Syracuse with nine points already Yeah I like I I love pass first point guards When you have a pass force uh pass first point guard that can score it just opens up the offense The more comfortable he gets scoring the ball and is already procuring the pass hes just going to open up opportunities for his teammates He was 11th in the country and first in the ACC in assists last year averaging almost six a game for his career Collins the open three He got it Jack Collins with six points Theyre going to have to hit open shots Theyre going is a must The margins of error are 10 tom miss fourth threepointer of the game already cheering as Freeman going oneonone with the smaller Ray and he scores over him And you know thats a lot harder than it than it looks You know if ever ever whenever a big gets a little they want you to take You have to be so delicate because the ref are is just waiting for you to hit them too hard And if the guard flops its a foul So that was high high skill from Freemans part Collins deflected Heres a turnover Orange run Twoon one Freeman slices to the rim and draws the foul Hell head to the line for two when we return Another Monmouth turnover leads to another Syracuse offensive opportunity Nathan George running the break Freeman music will go to the line down by two Theyre in their fourth year in the CAA And we should mention that its the end of college football season Monmouth has a very good football team Uh theyre going to make the FCS playoffs starting next weekend and theyre hoping to get the services back of the FCSs best quarterback Derek Robertson Freeman made the first and he makes the second as well Hes got four points and were tied at 22 Rivera Torres is back in the game as a threes off the mark for Ray Freeman clears the glass and they handle that press pretty well You know those threes are in transition against the press are there and hey take it Stling is yet to score as another foul will be called Itll send Freeman back to the line Harvey picks up his second So Syracuse already into the double bonus with seven minutes left to go and King Rice doesnt like the call So Freeman back to the line leads the team in scoring almost 18 points a game this season a sophomore from DC Saturday morning we talked about football This is football 10 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be in Atlanta for the Big Pit Georgia Tech game and itll get you ready for another full day of football The 2hour pregame show game previews Expert analysis feature music stories right here on ACC Network and the all new ESPN app Fullourt press again here for the Orange and they trap Rivera Torres in the back court He breaks the press and now Monmouth with numbers Collins pulls up for three An air ball short I think he cheering was a little bit more open than he anticipated he turned around and saw open space and kind of just couldnt quite focus And also too I I will say the depth perception in if you havent played in this building before the depth perception especially the shooting can throw you off a little bit So a little little homecourt advantage on Syracuse side Stling attacks the rim athletically and scores his first two of the game What have you seen from Stling so far That that was a good aggressive move Uh Jack Hollings played good defense and sometimes all you can do is shake a guys hand So first two points of the game for the senior from Baldwinville about 20 miles northwest of here at the JMA Wireless dome Syracuse regains the lead Has matched its biggest lead of the game Three points Collins down the lane Blocked again Orange on the run Four on three Stalling down the middle to Kings puts it on the deck attacks the rim blocked Spartales has got it and he is fouled And that that was just pure effort You know Mama did not mama didnt give up on the play You have to run out and Jack Collins comes and blocks it So thatll be a foul on Kings Its his second He is now the third Orange player with two fouls as Monmouth has broken this press pretty smartly so far and theyve got another open look for Rivera Torres who missed the three Kyle clears the glass and now the Orange will run the other way I I would say mom needs to just take their time just because youre open If your feet arent set hey run a good offensive set bring it back out and give it a go cheering Rivera Torres rebounds The Freeman miss Torres averages 14 points and eight rebounds a game Both best on the team He also leads Monmouth in blocks and steals Spartales coming off a good game Scores again He had a team high 16 against Satan Hall When youre having trouble scoring take it to the rim Go down low The 69 freshman from Greece has been impressive Freeman met at the rim by Robinson who wasnt afraid Here comes Rivera Torres the other way That was excellent defense That was a thing of beauty Great verticality They ran uh they took away the lob threat Freeman tried to go and take it to the rim and they met him with long arms SPARTES OFF GLASS REBOUND PUT UP NO FOUL there as Freeman ends up with it for Syracuse Starling extra pass to a wideopen Kings Long rebound to George Hell shoot a three kind of a so rag tag sequence there If you notice again from shoot round they want to take away the paint They know Syracuse isnt the best at shooting threes So hey well give up the three Well let you have it Were not letting you get the paint And so far its keeping them in the game Syracuse only a 31 threepoint shooting team for the season Spartales lefthanded finish Eight points for Stfano Spartales I I get excited when I see a a good hook shot laughter Reminds me of the good old days That one with the left hand as Kings lays it up and in Both teams look a little winded here Five points now for Kings In general Mama does a good a pretty good job getting back but with this team they got to make sure they get back with a purpose Long stretch of uninterrupted play Another turnover by the Hawks Freeman attacks the rim and draws the foul Itll be the third on Rivera Torres That could have e that could have easily been a particular this particular game And foul trouble is an issue too as MMAs top player Jason Rivera Torres has to go to the bench with three fouls Donnie Freeman at the line hes already drawn five fouls and that you know when youre athletic big and you can move and you can dribble and you attack the rim as aggressively as Freeman youre going to live at the line Like theres no way around it Ive guarded guys like him and its its super frustrating but thats his one of his superpowers He came in averaging seven free throw attempts a game Hes already taken eight today Six out of eight inside Spartales again Great position too strong that time and George the rebound He needs to take he he had it like right when he came off that cross again George nice feed to Freeman Lakes it up and in Donnie Freeman nine points But one thing moving at the line allows you to get some rhythm as well So hes just feeling his flow right now Make that 10 points now for Freeman as the Orange have their biggest lead of the game Collins beinged by Kings 10 on the shot clock Zubir Griffin number 20 has checked in for the Hawks cheering Pounding defense for Syracuse Spartales missed the three Excellent defensive possession for the Orange cheering Cayenne Anthony yet to score Changes that right here Chance for three Great recognition by Cayenne Anthony Passed up the three Saw the lane Pass up three Saw the lane and just made a beline and one Another foul on Ray his second Hes just so good at manipulating his body and finding the gaps A freshman from Brooklyn Needless to say very famous in Syracuse for many years His dad Carmelo Syracuse legend Cayenne has opened up Syracuses biggest lead of the game now with that threepoint play This is where mom is going to is going to struggle You know theyre theyve been having trouble finding offense and trying to come back from behind Where are these points going to come from So midrange jumper wont go Long rebound Out of bounds for the Hawks cheering Syracuse is saying they should have the ball but I think it would have probably been a foul See Yeah I think sometimes ref kind of instead of calling a foul just give them the ball Just give them the ball cuz that that was definitely a foul Oh technical that breaks Syracuses 90 run Justin being a shooter he just he constantly needs to see that ball going in the net no matter what So hopefully maybe well see this cheering give him a little a little uh little jolt Seven points now for Ray was in the bonus This will be a one and one for Reduge So there was the technical free throws for the technical on Autry Now this is the the free throws for the foul on White cheering and it could be four straight for Ray from the line It is However you splice it thats four points and four times a shooter saw the ball go in the net So well see how that manifests It ends a Syracuse 90 run Two minutes left to go first half from the JMA Wireless Robert Lee Yukon legend Acha Okafor with you on this Tuesday night Kings shoots the three Kyle the athletic rebound falls to the ground is tied up and itll be a jump ball The arrow will favor Syracuse Syracuse mom is wasting no time jumping They understand what they have to do They have to seek out winning plays 5050 ball That was a 5050 ball Mordar back in for Spartales who has two fouls and will go to the bench Manmouth has five players with at least two fouls Is a team that goes about eight or maybe nine deep Kyle Oh tried to attack the rim but he was fouled No its goend Goending Okay So count the bucket for Kyle Defin Kyle will take it Its his first two of the game Extends the lead to six Collins passed up the open three 90 seconds to go in the first half Been closely played 10 lead changes four ties This cheering Syracuse defense is making it so tough Dubul well he has not been shy so far Hes now 0 for four from the field I I I I appreciate his aggression but you got to be a little selective out here you know all day Keep moving the ball Get your feet set Hit the open shot especially early in the shot clock Early in the shot clock His teammates like Come on man Lets move the ball around a little bit We can get that shot anytime we want Ky Anthony going oneonone with Morar Gets into him Slices to the rim and Morar turns him away Anthony gets it back Hits the bottom of the rim Third opportunity blocked again turning them away at the rim as Anthony the freshman is turned away by Mordar You talk about being relentless That was both him Kudos to Anthony for keeping his head in it Monmouth will call its use it or lose it timeout Yeah we talked coming into the game about the gaudy numbers that Syracuse had put up at the defensive end but Monmouth has been stout also No Monmouth is there aint no theyre not sleepers out here you know They theyre top theyre top percentile Theyre top 15 in blocking shots Theyre uh actually top four or top four in nine Jason Rivera Torres is Monmouths leading scoreer He has three fouls Hes only played seven minutes in this game He averages 14 a game He has no points and Monmouth is down by just six Syracuse off to a 30 start winning its games by 36 points a game so far but getting a tough test from the Hawks out of the CA tonight Ball the three He splashes it Hes an interesting guy So ball they they you know originally they were trying to figure out if hes a big guard or not and they kind of played around with his position and eventually settle on him being a a four five guy and he can dribble He can shoot Hes long He can be physical So he can rebound cheering Really came out at the end of last year Manmouth one more shot Robinson reverse Oh turned away by Kyle And thats how the first half comes to an end A threepoint lead for Syracuse comp work for every single bucket Monmouth their thing they have to do which theyve already started to do is take care of the ball and not turn it over Monmouth in the blue jerseys will start the second half with the ball down by three Rivera Torres with three fouls and no points is back in there for the Hawks Hes got it here Kings is all over him Spartales oneonone with Kyle into the corner for Ray who immediately ties the game I I told you guys you you let a shooter see the ball go through the hoop four times hes going to come out gunn you 12 points now for Ray a sophomore from South Carolina Syracuse off to a 30 start And theyve really been untested Theyve won the each of the three games by over 30 points This is good work as Stling will score on a foul but you know Im sure coach Autry would love to be up by 20 but this is a good opportunity for the team to play in a pressure situation It is So here you know you let you let a shooter get hot you let him feel it and it goes in And you know Starley hey the best way to find your rhythm is just to take it to the rim and find it at the at the line like like uh his counterpart Justin Ray did What the hell That was that was very strange cuz Stling just shot that ball very quickly there I dont think that was the official free throw attempt but its not something you see very often there JJ missed the last really three games He played three minutes in the season opener against Bingington Went down early with a hamstring injury Hasnt played since What have you seen from him getting back into action I I mean Im not surprised It Its going to take a little bit time to find this rhythm You know you just cant walk in and expect to be at at 100 caps You would like to but this is very normal as an athlete Ive been there You know take a game or two not only to get you know yourself and find yourself back in your own flow but with the flow of your team You talk about getting into the flow What about Rivera Torres as Ray Another long three Hes keeping up Justin Ray 15 points his third threepointer of the game and he ties it George Kyle couldnt handle the pass Monmouth will run three on three Ray whos got the hot hand right now Just hit one from deep a moment ago Leads all scorers with 15 Hes one off his careerhigh He averages nine a game cheering Rivera Torres blocked and to get back to the point Rivera Torres basically played none of the first half Hes the leading scoreer on the team How hard is it to get it back into rhythm in the second half So you know when youve been sitting that long its going to take a little bit of time just to get back in the flow get your blood flowing get loose get just feel the rhythm of the game Seven on the shot clock and its a nice feed and its blocked by Kings thing about saying every everybody you got to watch out for everybody Offensive foul William Kyle Id have to get another look at that I I mean I I think that was good I think the speed of it that that was a picking transition It looked like you know and to be fair you can call a foul on every single screen because theres slight movement You know it wasnt dirty There was plenty of time Thats really on his teammates You got to call screen and let him know its coming Spartales midrange jumper rebounded by Kyle who leads the team with nine and a half boards a game The Orange trying to get back to the NCA tournament this year Nice feed to Kings who lays it in Theyve missed the tournament four years in a row The longest streak since the early 70s over 50 years ago The weak side needs to make sure theyre over We side failed If he wasnt if he was over more that basket wouldnt happen Rivera Torres sideep three Rebounded by Freeman Ridden up the court by Robinson Bryce Zephr in for Syracuse Kings Nice move and a score The weak side help has been nonexistent these past two plays Uh Mama cant afford to do that Syracuse is too good too quick You dont want them to catch fire Kings a fifth year senior transfer from Oregon State Came in with a reputation as a knockdown shooter 45 last year in a foul against Monmouth but hes showing ability to take the ball to the rim and blocked a shot at the other end as well So you know one of the things that well finish that thought in a moment timeout is called by Manmouth and he said flat out I was going to play at Syracuse until Carolina came calling He had a great career at UNC Syracuse did all right that Sherman Douglas ended up running the point the original general but King said that coach Beheim coach Jim Beheim always made him feel like part of the program even though he didnt end up attending school here Hes very grateful for that Uh upstate people stick together you know Cayenne from way downtown Oh it down Cayenne Anthony six points They went to a zone there and the zone did exactly what they wanted it to do They didnt allow any penetration into the paint and forced a long threepointer Just Anthony has a has a little point though Smooth stroke there Hes averaging over 17 a game to start the year Freshman from Brooklyn Collins out of control move Rebounded by the long arms of Freeman Outlets for Bryce Zephr Good hands by Collins to steal it away Twoon one to a trailing Robinson Runs over Anthony Spiked away but laid up and in by Jason Rivera Torres his first two of the game So that thats probably the most important part of that possession is Torres Rivera Torres seeing the ball go in the bucket So well see how that changes his uh feel and a nickel timer on Cornelius Robinson Cen Anonys dad Carmelo did this a few times in his one year at Syracuse He averaged 22 and 10 that season leading the Orange to the title His son Cayenne a freshman music knocks down the three Syracuse led by Donnie Freeman and Nathan George with 10 a piece Justin Ray leads the way for Monmouth with 15 Heres Stling Five points so far in his return Kings on three Splashes in Kings getting it going from the inside and out today His season high coming in was just seven points last time out against Drexel 12 points now for Nate Kings Coach Audreys got to love to see that again Shot 45 from three at Oregon State last year Came into the game two for 12 from beyond the arc Heres Robinson Nice feed for Spartales Gets two men in the air Missed the layup Maybe he was intimidated by the long arms of Kyle When you get in there those windows close up so quick Anthony smooth and draws the foul kind of look like daddy right there that that you know Kathy his game hes a young dude but his game is very mature and he has a good pace to him good good he can read good rhythm and like you can see where his game can go and how much uh improvement he has to make but hes still doing a great job now and coach Archer said he knew hed be a double figure scorer I dont think he knew he was going to be a 17point a game guy he may not be at the end of the here But applause technical foul on King Rice here King Rice is unfaced Hes clapping his hands They got to put Anthony at the line I guess a better analogy You know sometimes when you see a kid thats strong he has a good frame but hes still skinny Like hey man youre strong now but youll fill out later Like his games going to fill out as he gets older and more experienced Hes only a 50 free throw shooter so far But coachry wants him to improve with the defensive end of the court Its a technical foul on King Rice This is tomorrow nights womens basketball double header Zoe Brooks Camille Pierre and number 10 NC State host Coastal Carolina at 6 Eastern Then Laura Seagler and Louisville host Morehead State Both games also available on the allnew ESPN app Womens basketball coming up tomorrow on ACC Network Anthony made the second shot One more Played his first two years of high school at Christ the King He missed again His last two years at National Power Long Island Lutheran Blueh High scoring double figures in every game so far 151 19 and then 18 Last game was a team high against Drexley Goes one out of four from the line Missed opportunity there for Anthony M needs to buckle down and get a bucket here with this game you know about to slip away a little bit The foul was on Rivera Torres Its his fourth foul of the game Hes just had no luck here tonight So hes back on the bench And a foul on White Thatll be his fourth of the game He hasnt had a whole lot of luck tonight either Junior Hes played only eight minutes When in doubt go to the rim Hell go down low put some pressure Sadique White a top 30 recruit averaging six points and three rebounds a game And he cant believe it Its his fourth foul Hes going to have to go to the bench William Kyle back in Each coach has already gotten a technical foul So another technical foul would be an ejection for either head coach You see some of the fouls piling up for Syracuse particularly White Heres Ray scores and a foul Justin Ray careerhigh 17 points for those four free throws that he had in a row That chance hes had to collect himself gather himself and see the ball go in the net is the reason why hes making this run that hes making Thats a third foul on Kings Looks good feels good Ray a sophomore from Greer South Carolina near Greenville Spartanberg Completes the threepoint play has a careerhigh 18 points double his season average as George comes in for Kings And a much needed shot in the arm there from Mmouth They were falling behind This was huge This was huge They had to break the rhythm That was Syracuses biggest lead of the game Nine points Its back down to six George was hot early scoring The ball has been held in check since Kick ball by Spartales Hell reset the shot clock again Syracuse trying to go 40 on the season with a couple of huge games coming up in Vegas next week Number two Houston on Monday at 600 the MGM Grand Arena and then take on Kansas on Tuesday Theyre also in the top 25 But the Hay is not in the barn here yet Palm give him a real good test Sony Jane down making them work now Three on the shot clock Oh blocked by Ball Excellent defense by the Hawks This Moth group is a scrappy scrappy group Syracuse hasnt really been able to find their flow find their game Theyre ahead but you know its not the game hasnt been the way they normally like it They like you know force some turnovers push the pace a little bit and get out in transition They just havent been able to do that Spartales good position spins on Kyle pivots runs into him Brick wall Nathan George the rebound Good solid defense there ALIU KYLE WHIPS THE RIM cheering My goodness And I know you guys just heard the crowd and thats what coach Rice wanted not to happen He said Hey when they start dunking like that the crowd gets in and the team gets energy Assist by George as Kyle gets the crowd fired up Robinson draws the foul You see why Kyle is shooting a team best 70 from the field this year Like he literally tries to dunk everything Hes a big man coaches like best dream Donnie Freeman the foul his second as Robinson will go to the line applause lead of the game Nine points a moment ago Robinson one out of two Nathan George will call out the play with the Orange leading by seven Coming up on 12 minutes to go from the JMA Wireless Dome Orange lead the alltime series 30 All the games here most recently in 2022 Almost a turnover George regains with seven on the shot clock George in traffic and draws the foul with four to shoot Mecha youve rocked the rim like this a time or two a few a few times but not I I I havent gone up this high right here Bringing the whole thing down calling the game with the sun playing out here You know basketballs full circle you showed that clip about how paths cross and um the basketball community just have those moments all the time Carmelo just went into the Hall of Fame in September but that that last block was kind of disrespectful He should have come in the paint laughter I I didnt invite him I think you did invite him cuz you sent him back to the bench Come on in there young fella Domelo Anthony 22 points 10 rebounds that year He was the most outstanding player in the NCA tournament Amecha was the following year for Yukon Carmelo went on to be a 10time allstar and a threetime gold medalist in the Olympics Awome shot there by Robinson Rebounded by Kyle Again Syracuse making that Monmouth offense really worked George by the way missed two free throws out of the timeout as Syracuse is starting to struggle from the line Freeman the dunk off the George feed Freeman you have to keep your eyes on Thats one guy you cant lose track of Syracuse 11 out of 19 from the line 58 including two out of seven this half And and this is a point where the game test kind of dangerous for for mom that they they battle hard Um but the game kind of tends to just wear down on the offensive end this whole game Theyve just been working so hard to find every single bucket that it they it just start to get tired They dont go very deep and some of their players especially Rivera Torres have barely played with foul trouble Ball quick three and that really hurts him Rivera Torres has really been a you know one of the engines on offense Stling runs the floor and scores the lead score and him not being in the game Thats a big chunk of their offense there Beautiful look in transition there by Nate Kings who continues to show that hes got more to his game than just shooting Yeah You know so the point of emphasis was threepoint shooting They wanted to improve it but Coach Audrey just didnt want didnt want applause shooting specials He wanted scorers He wanted people who yeah you can shoot you know hit you hit you know 35 36 of the time but we want you to be able to put it on the floor put pressure on the rim and get to the line and handle the ball as well This is now the biggest lead of the game for Syracuse You talked about Kings welltraveled played at a division 2 school in 2122 then went to junior college at Southern Idaho Hurt his knee at Oregon State Really bowled out for Oregon State last year 12 points on 45 from beyond the arc And he takes it to the rim but hes turned away by Mordar Good job digging it out by Kyle Hes being hacked at Kyle in amongst the trees Its Kings for three HE GOT IT THAT THAT WAS A great possession on both sides man Both sides were fighting You know Kyle was he tried He tried I understand he he was right by the rim He wanted that bucket back but made the right decision Threw it back out and got his buddy a three Kings came in averaging six a game Hes got 15 as hes broken out of a shooting slump here tonight Ray scores again 20 points for Justin Ray Justin Ray continues to be a shining light in this game for Vermont Hes hes Hes doing his thing Breaks a two and a half minute scoring drought for the Hawks Freeman pass to the rim Lease it up and draws the foul And hell go back to the line Freeman has now drawn seven fouls in this game Hes just so long lean adept at knowing how to use his body and his athleticism to get what he wants at the rim Nathan George who led the ACC in assists last year six and a half a game has seven assists Now it feels like Syracuse is just kind of dialed in We were talking to to coach Audrey Adrian Audrey at round practice yesterday He talked about level five He wants level five intensity on defense rebounding from the the juice control as his bench And I feel like for the most part of the game Syracuse was operating on level three four and it seems like theyre now starting to break that level five We asked him what the biggest positives about his team were so far and he said energy and effort Its been consistent right from the start Yes the games are lopsided so far but the energy and effort has been there every night And now Sadique White is back in the game with four fouls This matches Syracuses biggest lead of the game Yeah So now the question for Mon is you know you can get an offensive production from Justin Ray Where else is it going to come from And hes got 20 No one else on the team is in double figures And at some point you figure Rivera Torres theyre just going to have to roll with it and bring him back in with four fouls to try to get some scoring punch and a foul Interesting story on how they found this player Stefanos Spartales So King Rices son Xander was a standout for Monmouth a couple of years ago Scored 20 points a game was first team all league He played in Greece last year Well Stefano Partzes was on King Rices sons team So he watched every game He said This guy can really play And so hes here playing as a freshman at 69 from Greece Hes pretty much understood hes going to go back to play for Olympos in Greece when hes done But hes made an impact so far Hes averaging 13 a game You know in this new landscape if you can hoop theyre going to find you one way or another Its not like what I played back in my day you have to worry about whether you get found or not But here with Instagram and all technology if you if theres a if you have some game someone will come snag you up Oh Kayen Anonys grabbing at his his midsection and a turnover Looks like hes actually grabbing at his left hand Hes got his bigger jam Hes grabbing his hand Kayen Anthony staying on the court right now Spartales again backs in Suare Good job by Suare defending the rim and clearing the glass Four on two Aliu for Sadi White The front court for Syracuse Probably one of the more athletic ones youll see in the country Sadique Freeman Kyle Suarez Those boys can get up And I know you love a point guard who feeds it up like that Eight assists for George Rivera Torres is back in there He has two points Averages 14 a game Ray Oh WHAT WAS ROBINSON DOING IT WAS GOING TO BE A BUCKET and Robinson interfered with the rim to take two points off the board Oh a big mistake by Robinson It was going to be a chance for a threepoint play King Rice cant believe it but Sadique White the alleyoop slam at the other end Nathan George serving it up on a platter These these bigs are young and hungry You got to feed the bigs They got to eat Ray with 22 points shattering his previous careerhigh of 16 which he scored in the season opener against division 2 Caldwell Nathan George getting close to a double double Oh little bit too high for White Gets his own rebound WHITE MUSCLES IT UP AND IN If there I didnt know there was such a thing as too high He almost had that He was up there I look crazy in person White with eight points Spartales Nice stop and score 12 for Spartales That was a really aggressive run attack Just put his head down Took it up strong You mentioned that hes a little different than the typical quote unquote Euro player as George Miston Spartales couldnt clear the glass George scored but hes a physical guy out there Hes physical You know he hes hes down You know when I was playing the European big was more of a stretch They could shoot Um Starales he can bang with the best of them Likes the contact I I I personally always put it on big to rebound more I wish he can rebound a little bit more but he definitely hasnt shot with any contact whatsoever And he draws contact there on Suare Hell go to the line for one and one This matches the biggest lead of the game for the Orange Monmouth has got a start getting stops and scores in succession Hawks come in one and two Lost their last two games at Lasal and then at Satan Hall on Thursday In both those games that they lost they were they were in it the 67 So against Lasowl theyre only down a point with about six minutes to go And against Satan Hall it was about a sevenpoint game with six minutes to go Still within within ear shot but again theyre the offense just hits this this little dry pass and they cant seem to get over the hump You say 67 67 How many points Syracuse have Oh 67 14 now for Spartales and cuts the lead to a dozen You got kids dont you I got kids man My son tried to explain to me I still dont get it He told me that theres nothing to get Dad You just got to do it Anthony and over the back on the rebound and gets my missal applause and cheering his third His third personal defer to put Akir Suare at the line Suare a transfer from Georgia Tech has not scored this season Yeah hes more for defense Coach Audreys really big on defense Hes been a good part of their defensive powers Still has not And then a foul Its going to be called on White He fouls out of the game cheering and its going to put Monmouth at the line Syracuse number zero Sydney White Junior Dwight Jun is another kid thats really defensive minded You know he we didnt really get a chance to see him do much but hes Im impressed with him and Im really more impressed with his mindset He says Hey you have a lot of guys in the NBA who can score 30 I want to be one of those guys who stops him And to have that mentality to want the toughest assignment as an incoming freshman you know as a as a guy whos played defense cheering and took defense seriously myself I I find that very admirable He only played 11 minutes tonight and finishes with eight points as Kyle comes in for Suare cheering Nice stroke from Spartales who matches a careerhigh with 16 points And Monteneath pulls back to within 10 with six and a half to go If they can get a couple of stops they can get a couple of stops Lets see Ratchet up the pressure You know they can get a couple of stops George was a pass to the basket Midrange jumper too strong Rebounded by Robinson They can get a couple of buckets See if they can get it to Ray or Spartales Thats been their twopronged attack tonight Set play here for the Hawks Ray guarded by Kings Rivera Torres glides to the rim Couldnt finish Anthony the rebound He had a good look Just couldnt put enough English on it Anthony gets by Robera Torres and then Rivera Torres with four fouls blocks the shot That that was a good offensive move and good defensive move Yeah Ray big three splashes it again 25 for Justin Ray and he cuts it to seven Talk about a get right game Time out Syracuse This is This is what Mammoth does They they just linger around They linger around and right here your classic music defense to offense gets the turnover for the trade Four out of six from downtown tonight and hes got Monmouth on a 70 run to pull back within seven Almost a steal against Kyle Coming up on five minutes to go George turns the corner for Starling Threepointer is gone JJ is JJ working himself into the flow at the appropriate time Huge shot there for Starling Hes got 10 points now and extends the lead back to 10 Spartales knocked out of bounds Itll stay with Monmouth Mom has had you know part of their game plan was to hey well give up the three And Jays like All right Im going to show you what I can do Five on the shot clock Rivera Torres oneonone Step back three Too strong Long rebound run down by Kings for the Orange Oh Verators got four fouls Got to be very careful Its winning time at this point Freeman banging with Spartales Tough fade away Air ball rebounded by Rivera Torres That was a good defensive stand They wanted they part of the game plan Well make sure you stand Freeman up Make him make tough shots Ray set up on the left wing George is guarding him in the manto man cheering Spartales at the right elbow Attacks the rim Too strong Defended well by Kyle Sterling Tough shot and a foul cheering Hell go to the line after a timeout Four fouls music on Spartales coming down the home stretch And what Ive seen from Syracuse so far I Ive like they have theyre connected on defense Theyre connected on offense They respect their opponents They got to watch out for free JJ missed the last three games He missed Hes still trying to find his flow You know JJs coming back and I think they just have to make sure they Oh second time Manmouth has interfered with the ball on the rim and JJ Stling will get another shot at it Spartales there There was nobody even contesting the rebound except him Oh you know what though Spartal Do you know why Spartal Hes European You can do that in Europe Okay So so part of it you know in basketball different places have different rules So thats not goalending where hes from So hes still stuck in the old wiring So thats what happened Syracuse 14 out of 25 from the line 56 Yeah But I I think these tuneup games have been have been has checked all the boxes Uh its an entirely new group We want to see how everybody plays and I think you know parts are oiled lights are on Now the system needs to be stressed I think these next games coming up its theyre going to stress the system Coach Aubrey will see hey where the cracks are If theres no cracks hey were going to fortify what weve got to do and hell get a better idea of what he needs to clean up and what he can hang his hat on going forward And yes you want to win every game and theyve have an eightpoint lead right now as Kings drives to the rim Kyle is a very poor free throw shooter but he scores and hell have a chance for three We want to win the game But a game like this where youre tested can be very valuable more so than a 40point win Yeah Like right right here Its all about mentality right like right right here That play was about mentality He had the ball but he said You know what Im going to go up and finish And with these games you want to make sure youre playing the right way and that youre just checking the boxes as you go along You understand the big the bigger picture of what youre trying to accomplish and youre not looking too far ahead Spartales fouls out Terrific game for the freshman A careerhigh 18 points on six out of 14 shooting made all six of his free throws also had five rebounds and itll put Kyle at the line where hes 0 for two this season Watch out Watch out Watch out And again hes got a bit of an unorthodox free throw stroke as Monro does a good job staying put in the lane as Kyle completes the threepoint play and extends it to an 11point lead Monmouth desperate here with 240 to go Kyle almost stole it Robinsons got it Motion here for the Hawks Ball closed out on by Freeman and hes fouled Fourth on Freeman Stops the clock Gives Mammoth a chance to pull closer This game this has been Mamemoths brand the whole this early part of the season They just they hang around They hang on They play hard is just they cant seem to cross that cross that threshold And granted they played theyre playing hard teams You know they played playing Syracuse Satan Hall Lasowl These are are decent teams And I think that uh similar you know theyre being battle tested for their own conference play You know if for for a team like Monmouth if they dont win teams like if they dont if they dont win enough games like this they have to win They have to go through their conference tournament I think that theyve played well enough that its going to put them in good seating when their conference plays happen Fight foul on Kyle will put Rivera Torres at the line The lineman laughter finished tied for fifth in its league last year Finished 10 and eight in the CA lost in the quarterfinals in a heartbreaker to college of Charleston by a point in OT He doesnt give up all fight And if youre Syracuse you definitely dont want the clock stopped and giving up free throws here These guys hang around M is not a team that you want just to have buzzing around cuz a couple errant passes two minutes is a lot of time Two minutes anything can happen cheering So you dont want to mess with the game Two shots for Rivera Torres Again came in as Monmouths leading scoreer 14 a game Now has three points Has been saddled with foul trouble all night A junior from the Bronx Cuts the lead to eight Syracuse has got to finish here as we come up on two minutes to go George gets away from two defenders Syracuse will run some time off the clock here with 155 to go Really Manmouth cant let Syracuse score any more points at this point if they want to win the game or send it to overtime Starling high off the window Rebounded by the Hawks Jack Collins Threepossession game with 135 remaining inside Robinson to Albera Torres Wide open three Oh didnt get it to go Its rebounded by Freeman Great to be there Stolen Collins in amongst the trees Didnt know what to do SHOOTS AND SCORES Figured it out Time out Memphis Its a sixpoint lead This is a scrappy team They figure it out Looked music like they were turned away but Collins the scrappy play there He just comes when theres a will away smells at that ball music takes his time The other days right Syracuse Georgetown Pearl Washington hits the shot runs into the tunnel Rick Callahan was here for that as Mmouth fouls JJ Starling And now Syracuse is going to have to shoot free throws As you see Rick Callahan there hes been with King Rice for decades Syracuse is shooting 56 from the line And in the second half they are five out of 13 39 Stling is one for three cheering Stling makes the first We saw Kayen Anthony earlier kind of grabbing his hand He is now in sweats over on the sideline Yeah Im not Starling now two out of four from the line Air balls a second free throw in this cheering game in the second half Wow So that that foul got a little insurance right He say All right well take well trade one for hopefully two or three or three Three possession game Rivera Torres drives to the rim and scores Jason Rivera Torres heating up cuts at the lead to five with one minute to go Now look for Monmouth to foul if the right person gets the ball for Syracuse Nathan George is GOING TO KEEP IT HES GOING TO RUN TIME off the clock here with 15 on the shot clock Theyre going to double hit He gets away He feeds IT TO KYLE HE TURNS IT OVER with 40 seconds to go Kyle didnt want to get fouled Two possession game COLLINS A HUGE THREE HE GOT IT Sean Collins cuts the lead to two with 35 seconds to go Cant let Mith hang These guys have no They have no quit man They have no quit They have no quit Jacking and fighting they find ways They find ways to win They dont give up They smell it out When theres a will theres a way You got a great opportunity Calm and collective Eye on the prize Come on Australia has checked in Number nine Its his first appearance of this game Freeman trouble getting it in to Kings Orange have 4 seconds to get it across Two seconds and its deflected out of bounds Syracuse inbound in the front court with 26 seconds to go So Fenel playing for the first time in this game He is three for three from the free throw line this season They foul Freeman So Freeman 73 coming in and eight out of 10 tonight So they didnt want any more time to go They need the time Time is of the essence here So time has been their friend and theyre going to play that game You got to draw and extend this game out as much as possible to leave enough room for Syracuse to hopefully make errors and for them to capitalize on them Starts here on the line This would make it a twop possession game as Fenel goes back out Kyle comes in Offense defense substitution Anthony out Zephr checks in Each team one timeout Timeout left Two huge free throws for Donnie Freeman Hes got 16 points Timeout Monmouth Were Were Weve been This is a This been a treat of a game Its a nice little treat Game on the line Two possession game Manmouth with the ball down by four 23 seconds left Clock running with 20 Set play here for King Rice Rivera Torres takes Zephr Picks up the dribble Ray floating three Came up short Rebound to Robera Torres Hes fouled Hes fouled on the loose ball by Zephr Hell go to the line with 10 and 12 seconds to go They they are fighting to the very bitter at this person right here 5050 ball Who wants it more Got to get on the floor Rivera Torres is two for two from the free throw line tonight Hes 71 for the season Big free throws cheering Again Mon has no timeouts left cheering applause can still make it a one possession game but theyll have to foul if they cant cause a turnover cheering One out of two makes it a threepoint game Anthony back into the game for Kyle William the third in for Zephr He is foul Bryce Zephr has not attempted a free throw this season The foul is on Ray Its his fourth One make makes it a two possession game Hell have two shots with 10 seconds to go Kyle is back in for Anthony His defensive presence and his rebounding Monmouth has no timeouts Syracuse has one Zephr missed two Monmouth with a chance to tie with a three 7 seconds left Robinson Rivera Torres pump fake Shoots a three NO GOOD And the orange wo are fouled with 310en of a second left and a threepoint lead Hey you know Monmouth they got to tip your hat man They cheering they never never never gave up 13 head of fourth personal you know not not the best look that he wanted but things are are are moving so fast that was more open before he pumped fake Good defense by Zephyr on that play as well So 310 of a second left Still time for a catch and shoot but one free throw by Freeman would end the game And it does cheering applause Freeman finishes the game with 18 points Fullourt shot at the buzzer
