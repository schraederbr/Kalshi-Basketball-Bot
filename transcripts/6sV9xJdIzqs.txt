and Miamis finally got all their starters back and they feel the same way yeah two teams desperate for a win here at the end of the season both come in on losing streaks we are underway on a Wednesday night in the ACC and Miami all smiles they start with the ball two starters back into the lineup wuga popper and Nigel pack so thats a big boost to the back court omir lines up a three and drills it to open the scoring just what we talked about hes a guy that you could drop off of previously and hes now made 23 threepoint baskets on here shoots a pretty good percentage it his first two seasons playing college basketball he only made one three at Arkansas State he has transferred to Miami and been terrific really improved his shot Boston College answers inside Devin mlon and thats been a problem for the Hurricanes all year long theyre just not very big and mlon I mean hes big strong and hes really having a good year for for the Eagles of Boston College hurricane starting five we mentioned popper and pack back in it this is the first time in more than a month that Miami has had a full Squad to work with theyve had plenty of time off as well they last played last Monday on big Monday in Chapel Hill without popper and pack and they played very well against a good North Carolina team well you make threes you can play pretty well and Miami relies heavily on the Applause three yet trying to break a seven game losing streak tonight here at home against Boston College mton good pump fake it Cashes in boy that was nice I mean I he almost walked on that play but when you make a pump fake like that he took his time thats not an easy shot to make mton has all four for the Eagles to start Applause tonight wide open three benley Joseph makes BC pay W and Bley Joseph had a huge game against North Carolina particularly knocking down the three ball hes maybe a guy you shouldnt leave out Applause there Jaden Zachary trying to shake free lost the ball Joseph tipped it away hes an excellent Defender the steel and the three benley Music Joseph what a start now you wouldnt know by how theyve come out in the first two and a half minutes of this Miami team is on a seven game losing streak the longest losing streak of the Jim Lona era here in Coral Gables now Jim Lena what success hes had in fact what success hes had everywhere hes been hes not happy about something I didnt really see what it was now that Banner the 23 final four from a year ago would not be hanging without Lona Boston College finding form too both of these teams shot out of a cannon to start well theyre shooting the ball very well and Harris scoring is good news for Boston College he is a scorer who has struggled to score recently ohir again open from three Off the Mark the first Miss shot of the night and that is a break for Boston College because Quinton post did not block out nor Chad omir and omir hes going to shoot the three but hes going after the rebound so just because hes out Beyond The Arc you cant ignore it been a double double machine here for Miami Harris step back three cant connect but tipped in by Quinton post excellent position by post and that ball came right off in the perfect spot sometimes that happens when you get great position ball comes to you foul off the ball Zachary Holden Miami is a team that likes to spread the court omir is a very effective low post player but he doesnt start in the low post he doesnt set up shop down there and camp in there they spread the court they like to move the ball they like to move players and once they move the defense then theyll put the ball down theyll drive to the basket theres nobody in the lane its sts Miami ball deflected by Madson so 8 seconds to work with here on the shot clock and Madson even as he was playing defense he was shouting at Ted Valentine I never touched it I never touched it and Ted respectfully disagreed with it heres pack who caught the ball and traveled back into the lineup after missing the last four games he saw that double team coming and he was trying to beat it and just didnt get the ball down fast enough well even the last game that pack played he was 0 for seven at zero points so trying to shake off some roughs here early post to three got it wow I mean weve got some shooting going on in this game Music and we said about post is versatility and thats one of the things that makes him so versatile is his ability to score from Beyond The Ark well both of these teams are not shy to let it fly from three omir kick out Cleveland nice fake spinning into the lane re gathers it and finds popler on a three he cant connect omir got his hand on that good tough rebound by post and the Boston College defense flying around here early Zachary left it short he didnt know how Boston College would come out tonight after an embarrassing home loss to pit 90 65 on Saturday but theyve come out with plenty of energy they sure have and the pit is playing as well as anybody in the country and good Heavens pit made 16 threes its hard to win a game when the other guys make 16 threes Earl Grant Boston College head coach coach summed it up pretty good they had a really good day and we had a really bad one sometimes its just that simple five minutes Gone By Post in the post good defense there by omir good oh and oneon one defense she cant double because shes such a good passer fley Joseph leaves it for omir post thought he got him on the other end instead a foul called well we build it as a great big man battle and nor Chad omir here in Quinton post delivering 5 minutes in when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks farther three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years

and its a tie game he I cant believe what I am witnessing the streak wi for the well were less than a week away the ACC mens basketball tournament tipping off on Tuesday this is the projected seating as we sit here tonight it is and of course weve still got a week of basketball left to play and you know Virginia theyve sewn they havent swn up number three but they have sewn up at least number four so Virginia will get a double buy Duke will get a double buy uh North Carolina will get a double buy and if youre a team looking to make a run Miami and Boston College they are both going to play on that first day you got to look and see what the matchups are in a tournament time its all about matchups and it be very interesting you know Miami is not they dont have a great deal of depth but they could certainly go to the ACC tournament win a couple of games they can shoot the ball and you if they get their starters back and healthy this is a Miami team that is much better than their record indicates well thats why these two final games here Boston College and then Florida State on Saturday for Miami just to get something going now that theyre finally healthy they have a full Squad available able for Jim Lena for the first time in more than a month well theyre out there uh poer still battling an ankle injury foul called thatll send Donald Han Jr to the line for three well this is a situation where George gets caught behind that screen and sometimes youre just caught thats the best you can do so you block out you dont want to commit a foul out there particularly not against the threepoint shooter unless you feel you got a really legitimate opportunity to block the ball thats just a bad decision this gives the Eagles a great opportunity to extend their seven nothing run oo way off the mark from hand looked like somebody opened the door and blew that one away and Miami has gone scoreless for the last 3 minutes that much better from hand well those are hands free throws nine and 10 in ACC play play so he doesnt get to the line often was four for eight coming in is one for two on this trip but hell get a third both of the last two looked better than the first one there they go full court pressure for the first time tonight and theyre just you know thats sort of Alla Florida state theyre trying to steal the inbounds pass but if they dont then they back off desan George into the game fellow freshman noo Cashes in with his first touch but he did a nice job moving without the ball caught the ball well and then he just pinned Mighty on his back and theres nothing Mighty could Applause do Harris trying to shake free into traffic its blocked benley Joseph going Coast to Coast to lay it in now Claud Al har has forced that one but again he is a scorer hes going to try to take the ball I think he was looking for a foul right there but when you take a bad shot like that its almost like a turnover Joseph has eight of the Hurricanes 13 Applause early offensive foul called against Mighty on the screen well and Mighty gets trapped down low and doesnt really do a very good job keeping noo away from the basket and now again this is just a force by Harris he was looking for a foul and it results in an easy basket you want to make Miami play against your set defense every time if you can lob noo couldnt handle it re attacks couldnt Applause convert Miami doing a good job getting back on defense so Applause far and Fade Away cant hit it Rans been very aggressive since hes offensively since hes come into the game great pass count it plus the foul Michael naoko to the line for an and one and you know you talk about aggressive offensively noo is a guy who is strictly an inside player but he does a great job catching it traffic and then with the left hand thats really a good good job catching the ball inside and I mean if hes going to be able to play like that and give him those kind of minutes off the bench that saves omir not only from having to play so much keeps him out of foul trouble thats a real good low poost threat and thats crucial for what you were just talking about that if you go down to DC and want to win win five games in five days you need that bench production without any question and after Boston College went on a seven nothing run Miami back with a seven nothing run of their own Zachary trying to end that way off the mark you Zachary hes a pretty good threepoint shooter or has been lately but I still think thats a little early in the shot clock popler the floater doesnt fall rolls around the rim and popler has the ball back and again naoko got his hand on it which is what kept the ball alive shot clock down to seven Kean George a deep three buries it nothing but the bottom of the net W Earl Grants got to wonder whats going on pit lights them up for 16 thats the fourth threepoint made by Miami so far but this is a Miami team that relies heavily on on the three in conference play 38 of the points come from Beyond The Arc Eagles trying to answer with a three of their own offensive rebound post kick out Madson sends it right back inside and thats a turnover now the hurricanes on a 10 nothing run four threes against the Eagles early including this one from the Freshman kesan George hey heres the thing no one can reach the Pinnacle of success on their own you got to find a

sour and then theyre sweet Sour Patch Kids Jim Lena with a full Squad available and healthy tonight for the first time in more than a month you take a look at Miami 11 of their 18 ACC games missing a starter 2 and N when a starter is missing four and three when everyones playing and its just not a matter of having a guy injured and missing a game you have people injured they miss practice its hard to practice that way you know not only in terms of numbers but you cant get any rhythm going if you dont know who youre practicing with Big Time Chance Michael noo and Miami on a 12 nothing run and noo has come in the game and scored seven points for Miami and on the season in ACC play he averages 26 yeah he has come alive Quinton post going right at the Freshman beats him a post Im surprised he was able to keep his pivot foot thats pretty good pressure by noo but again hes on his own in there theyre not going to come and double team him pack step back three left it short post the rebound and interestingly enough were halfway through this first half and thats Packs first field goal attempt of the game he averages 12 a game and hes had a quick trigger tonight misses that one Falls to Matson and he hits it from three now Madson hes a guy whos been very hot from outside the threepoint Arch since he started since he began starting and Donald Han Jr hes a very good percentage threepoint shooter in conference play I just dont know you want him taking those early in the clock Josephs had the hot hand for Miami lost the ball falls on it trying to keep it alive and he does popper down the lane it rolls off doesnt fall offensive rebound stays with Miami poppler trying to finish the possession from three and he drills it boy Boston College just not able to claim the defensive rebound and popper created that whole thing because he forced post to come over to help and then nobody was available to block out moroko Harris goes with the three post wanted him to pass it to him after he set the screen again Harris is a scorer hes going to look to score as his first option popper pull up pop off the mark and again Miami with the court spread out they like to tack you off the dribble theyre going to call Quinton post for a hook battling inside with the freshman Michael noo whos been terrific tonight hes trying to get in there and you can that left arm he just comes around pushes him out of the way and we had the same view the referee has and hes going to call that a foul every time and thats two on Quinton post and keep in mind when they took him out of the game before thats when Miami went on the first 10 run how good has noo been tonight hes been everything you would want him to be I mean again we said he averages 26 points per game in ACC playing hes already got seven comes out of the game for NORAD omir here but theres been no drop off with omir here off the court for Miami well now Boston College playing a little bit smaller lineup their sevenfooter post is out and Prince of League Bay is in in his Applause place shot clock down to 10 mlon going at omir hands off for Harris in a double team finds mcglockton for three cant connect Applause bton actually shoots the three pretty well Joseph transition three he misfires Cleveland the offensive rebound and Miami is cleaning up the glass very well tonight yeah Boston College really having trouble getting their defensive boards in order you know but again that spread that Miami does forces you to cover a lot of ground on defense and sometimes its hard to get back to the basket to rebound Music Music Miami is a team not noted for defense but their mantoman defense has done a nice job keeping pressure on the ball shot clock down to two a league Bay lost the Applause handle pack too much on it omir tracks it down as he often does the offensive rebounding continues to be a strength for Miami tonight but again Boston College got their hands on that ball they just couldnt claim it Miami with Eight Second Chance points already tonight looking for more here packed down the lane floater too strong and its going to be its going to be off its Miami ball as it should be and the Hurricanes comfortably leading by a early heres the thing no one can reach the Pinnacle of success on their own you got to find a Difference Maker and Ive got mine with every team Ive coached I bring Bob in hell talk to the

Applause now Saturday what a loaded slate of college basketball we have for you final weekend of the regular season 5 college basketball game Saturday on ESPN well talk about the two Sonic Blockbusters number one Houston hosting Kansas at 4 and then Saturday Prime Time North Carolina and Duke that is a pretty good slate right there you said five those two are pretty good yeah no doubt about it in the last seven minutes of the game Boston College has gone two for n theyve turned it over five times and theyve given up five offensive rebounds after a five for eight start boy Airs got a mismatch inside pack didnt see it now has a second chance to go to him instead takes the three and misses the three Boston College has not scored since the 1026 Mark and keep in mind Quinton post is on the bench with two personal fouls so its going to be hard for Boston College to get anything going on the inside now hes been everything for the Eagles all season long you can see theyre basically playing without anybody in the low post sort of what Miami does you spread the court try to move the ball 5 Seconds to shoot Jaden Zachary it Fly cant connect and a push foul called on Prince El League Bay and even though you dont have a your big guy post on the inside you cant just throw the ball around the perimeter youve got to do something whether its driving the ball or cutting through or something to get into the lane area to force that defense to collapse and this has been a Miami team not known for their defense this season but its looked very good in this first half against Boston College scoop to the hoop Kean Jordan you know once he gets passed on the outside he doesnt look like hes you know remarkably quick but hes quick enough and once he gets past you so long its hard to catch up Zachary trying to spin his way free and draws the foul attacking benley Joseph theres not even a screen here hand anticipates the screen and moves to his right and when he does that Joseph goes to the defenders left and goes right past in hand just didnt quick enough to catch up Jaden Zachary trying to put an end to a scoring drought thats lasted 4 minutes and 27 seconds here and what he did was he took the ball inside you know you dont expect your point guard to post up but when you need to get the ball inside he has a bit of an advantage against Bley Joseph and he took it and how important does Earl Grant think this stretch is as well with two personal fouls Quinton post is back in the game and Miami is a team that likes to create mismatches and exploit them so lets see if they go after post with omir Boston College showing a little Zone press but now drop back into the manto man double screen for George the Freshman now working on post finds pack open three misfires omir had the offensive Rebound in his hand and let it slip now keep in mind that pack hadnt played in a while and so you know his shot hes just didnt take a shot for the first 10 minutes of the game and the ones hes taken since have looked a little rusty hes missed four straight games and again the game before that he didnt score against Clemson so its been three and a half half weeks without a made bucket for pack tough take inside Zachary couldnt finish well again thats a really nice adjustment by Boston College to Post up Zachary Joseph misses the layup gets his own Miss though omir tipped it away omir is just relentless on the offensive board you have to earn every single rebound going against omir and popler catches in two more Second Chance points thats now 10 in his first half its you know Bost College their first defense isnt bad but you dont youre not on offense so you have the ball and you cant get the ball until you get a defensive rebound Miamis opened up a 10point lead Boston College has not made a basket in more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds pack got a hand on it mcglockton went for the ball and got a piece of it well now that was a very interesting sequence and oh and pack goes down and hes had knee problems holding that left knee take another look its mlon impact tangled up oh he it looks like he actually got tangled up with his own guy looks like he hit benley Joseph and again pack has missed games oh no he just he just came down right on the ankle right on the foot of Music mlon inside no woko whos had a very productive first half miams done a nice job reversing the ball moving it from side to side thats really tough on a defense Cleveland with the shot clock down to two lost the handle they say it stays with Boston College though Ted Valentine making the call underneath the basket Miami a 10point lead 357 remaining in this first half heres the thing no one can reach the Pinnacle of success on their own you got to find a Difference Maker and Ive got mine with every team Ive coached I bring Bob in hell talk to the staff hell talk to the players build up their mental game then I can focus on building a winning team I

story when it comes to seeking Revenge theres no place like home this scene is simply amazing first number one Houston host the jwks oh SNS it down then its round two of the games greatest rivalry from Cameron indor that is the exclamation point Duke Carolina delivers again its two top level rematches to end the season experienced number 14 Kansas number one Houston then number seven North Carolina number nine Duke Saturday on ESPN take a look at our wooden watch presented by principal we just showed you the Duke North Carolina game upcoming three of the four players on the wooden watch in that game nice takeaway for Boston College Claud El Harris fouled attempting a dunk hell get two at the line thats only the second turnover by Miami you know Boston col has not made a field goal since the 1026 month this is actually not a bad foul by Joseph a bad foul would be if he got down and fouled him and he made the basket the only ones with those when someones going for a dunk you worry that it could be a flagrant foul but that one was clean enough to just send Harris to the line for two well it has really been a struggle on the offensive end for Boston College what do you attribute that too well I think Miami is playing really well on the defensive end I think Quinton post being in foul trouble has sort of discombobulated the Boston College offense Zachary you know has not been a big factor in the game and I think Boston College is much better when Zaden Jaden Zachary is a big factor I think for my Zachary had made a field goal yeah no he struggled tonight I think the Hurricanes playing with a lot of passion getting those two players back popper who misfires there and Nigel pack getting a full seven days of practice time before this game Matson putot on the line turnover well Matson is another guy that the way he shot the ball recently not the last game but boy that left footage is is well out of bounds you know its funny you see so many of those calls these days and you know they did extend the threepoint line but the court is the same width as its always been you talk about Matson J he had seven made threes in the first meeting between these two teams hes been a nonfactor in this first half ripped away by Zachary thats a good job with the double team and thats when you have to double team and you poke at the ball when the big guy is dribbling it now lets see if Boston College can get anything done on this end well its been 7 minutes and 37 seconds without a made bucket and that drought continues for Applause BC Grant his guys have played hard they just havent played very well at this point well not many teams could go seven minutes and 4 two seconds without scoring a basket and still be down single digits W theres no question that uh they could be down much further and if they can get their offense in gear they got to feel good about their Applause chances now the shot clock reset and I dont think it should have no because Miami never had possession of the ball its back down to 13 13 there you go but Miami has scrambled this is a perfect example they have been sced scrambling around very effectively on defense its been hard for Boston College to get anything that they want on offense thats another dangerous Applause play I think if Robinson realized where that ball was he could have gotten it post attacks and scores first made Basket in nearly eight minutes for BC and see now if youre Earl Grant you like the fact that post just scored but you have to wonder to keep him in there now Boston College takes it away Madson hesitates then drives in and misses the layup now mat I mean he tried to avoid having the shot block he just takes that up on the side on the right side of the basket maybe omir fouls him but he you know he tried to make a really circus shot and didnt work timeout called by Miami two minutes remaining until halftime Hurricanes up seven when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks farther three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one most of any comp its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC AC now Boston College began this game shooting five of 16 since just three of 16 and Quinton post like he normally does leading the eagles with scoring with nine points tonight well hes got nine points but hes got those two personal fouls and so what do you do here if your Earl Grant do you keep him in the game and risk a third foul before halftime or do you take him out well and thats thats the question for ear Grant because post has been so Central to their offense well he is shooting four of five from the floor the rest of the team shooting four of 17 you may want to take him out on the defensive end and I think hes trying to take him out but uh League Bay is at the table but he was late reporting Music in that was a good defense by post to make Joseph stop heres Matthew Cleveland goes Baseline scoop to the hoop for two and thats how you do that underneath scoop shot madsons attempt about a minute ago didnt come off quite as well post lines up the three cant connect no offensive rebounding potential for Boston College on that one popler cant knock it down and that was a good block out because omir was really fighting in there Harris that rattled in and out and again you take that quick shot if it goes in its great but if it doesnt go in you dont have any chance to get the offensive rebound because you havent moved the defense and theyre in perfect position both of these teams in the last two minutes quick triggers coming up and down the court Harris driving off the window and in for two and we saw Harris force one before that wasnt a force he did a really nice job got his head and shoulders past popler and just went straight to the goal Earl Grant with the use it or lose it timeout he elects to use it Eagles down Music sevenet ronon been looking forward to March since last March but oh how he can nail a software solution you need Ron Ron needs a retirement plan work with principal so we can help you with a plan thats right for him let our expertise round out yours introducing our Allstar lineup the Camry the new Grand Highlander the Rav 4 and the tundra Toyota undefeated now for as poorly as Boston College has shot it in this first half on the road here in Miami theyre only down by seven Dan well and youre absolutely right and Miami Miami has not taken advantage of some of the turnovers because Miami excuse me Miami hasnt shot it particularly well either and the reason Ro grant called that timeout was he get post out of the game about a 4 second difference between the shot clock and the game clock Madson pressing out on benley Joseph and now Cleveland off to the Freshman mismatch inside oh now nice job by mlon to switch back on omir deep three by George and hes way off the mark and it gives the ball back to Boston College with seven seconds here and since the clock has stopped they can get post back in on offense and last year last year that play that George just made fallen down after the three that would have been a flop and this year Ted Valentine just told him to get out Harris with three seconds left in the half off to post good if it goes and it does Quinton post beats the buzzer and Boston College cuts it to four and thats pack hes missed four games but he was 0 for five in in the game today and the two games he played before he went out with his injury he was 0 for seven and 0 for8 so he had missed his last 20 shots for the hurricanes and so you know they will obviously miss him because hes a capable player but he hasnt really been offensively productive in the last couple games hes played oo Matson a three off the post Miss and he comes up empty as well and Matson is a guy who made Seven threes against these guys against Miami the last time he made hes made one tonight popper draws the foul Harris got him so Jim Lena in Miami made a big Point finally fully healthy trying to build something going into the ACC tournament and now you lose pack for the second half well and Bill Courtney the Miami assistant told us before the game even we showed you there are 11 of the 18 games they were missing a starter but in some some of those seven games a starter went out early in the game you know so and they are two and nine in those games without a starter so they have struggled with injuries this season you see pack getting ice on his left knee you just hope for his sake and you mentioned the shooting struggles that he gets a chance to be back on the court sometime this season you dont want to end your year shooting as poorly as he has H you dont want to end youre hurt not being able to play def he was honored on the court before the game for senior day he does have a year of Eligibility left as well as nor Chad omir so they can both come back but if they dont they were celebrated on senior night pregame great ball Movement by BC ball stops with Harris finally gives it up mats it from the other corner and this time he hits it he had more time on that particular particular occasion because of the ball movement you talked about this is what Miami does that little weave out front they try to get you to commit and then they go its exactly like that they get you back on your heels and then once theyve moved you around they attack you off the dribble benley Joseph leads Miami with 10 points Music tonight Harris Miss fires but Jaden Zachary in perfect position to clean up the spill and that is Zacharys first field goal tonight and it comes off an offensive rebound maybe thatll get him going for Boston College back to the threeman weave up Applause top 10 seconds to shoot George in attack mode working on Madson for a double team floats it up on the window wow Applause he is also stronger than he looks Harris fading away he hits it Harris is a scorer and thats what he does you think wow that might be a tough shot but right at the end you know Joseph dropped off of him so he had a wide open shot popler passes out the shot takes it in misses the layup though well unlike in the first half Boston College has been able to get those offensive rebounds post ties it at 38 Quinton post has been automatic from that spot well he sure has and I said offense I meant defensive rebounds those balls that were tipped around in the first half were generally claimed by Miami post has 15 he is knocked down 3 threes great pass ohir rocks the rim onehanded flush and that is only his second field goal of the game nor Chad Applause Music omir Madson off the screen for three got it then Boston College in front that was a very confident play by Matson off the dribble under pressure its the Eagles first lead since it was 13 Applause 11 omir trying to answer from Deep left it short and again post didnt block him out had that ball gone right back to omir hed have got it cuz post wasnt in the Applause way Zachary kicked out Matson missed it this time but tipped in Quinton post flying in post did a great job getting position on the inside but lots of times a threepointer will miss much longer than that so that was a miss right at the basket and Madson here is going to pick up a foul now Quinton post and Mason Matson have taken over this second half the Eagles out scoring the hurricanes 158 in the second half nor Chad omir that dunk the bright spot for Miami but its Boston College leading by three heres the thing no one can reach the Pinnacle of success on their own you got to find a Difference Maker and Ive got mine with every team Ive coached I bring Bob in hell talk to the

its the Bucks and the Lakers coverage begins with NBA Countdown at 7 Easter Quinton post has Boston College up by three here on the road in Miami post leading the way 177 points seven rebounds down another really good game for post whos had an outstanding year for Boston College you know we showed you his numbers before the game that combination of numbers not achieved by anybody in this league since Tim Duncan and there thats a great tip away defense into almost offense everything but the Finish Well Harris couldnt decide whether hes was just going to shoot it or dunk it and he tried to do both and missed and thats sums up the season for Quinton post makes a great play Boston College should get two points out of that see quinson instead he stuck playing defense again Joseph steep back missed it well Boston College missed a big opportunity right there but their defense bailed him Applause out know its interesting talking quinon post the statistics are Incredibles a fouls called on the floor I think if post were on a team that had a better than a six and 12 record hed be all ACC first team or Nob brainer and if they were really good hed be in the conversation as maybe somebody who could be the player of the year well you know RJ Davis is in this league this year and so its going to be hard for anybody to be in the conversation other than him but I agree with you about post but I would also say that there are a lot of guys in the ACC who have have had outstanding seasons we were talking earlier we think its as hard as its ever been as Matson drills the three from the corner to pick a a top 15 players the Le league is that deep I think so and what a pass by Zachary Boston College playing a lot better in this second half is isnt it amazing how you play better when the ball goes in the basket Eagles on a 132 run they are dominating the stretch of this game coming out of break boy this is a p 45° angle baby I dont know how he got it through there its like a quarterback throwing over lineman and the they miss by about an inch threaded the needle Boston College should have two more because of the missed layup by Harris largest lead of the game so far stra pass from post Zachary kicks it out and Harris draws the foul that was some hard pass by Madson I think Zachary did everything he could to catch the ball which is why he didnt get it up to the basket suddenly Boston College playing with an awful lot of confidence on the offensive end but again thats what happens when the ball goes into goal 18 points already at this second half half they just had 28 total of the first Zachary ball off his foot ball back to Miami and thats something they havent done in the second half as turn it over they really had some problems with turnovers in the first half yeah seven turnovers in the first half thats their first in the second a George tangled up with Harris Cleveland misfires on the three and in this second half so far Boston College doing a great job surrounding nor Chad omir really making it difficult for him to get after the offensive board Zachary leaves it for mton who rocks the Applause rim the officials blow the play dead no no they dont they blow play dead that basket will count but theres a wet spot on the floor and theyre trying to address that everybody draw everybody goes to Zachary and nobody rotates down to get mton when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks farther three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winningest programs in division one most of any kind Boston College has opened up an eightpoint lead the Eagles on a 152 run over the last 4 minutes and 30 seconds Miami in desperate need for offense George knocked away claudell Harris three onone up ahead Matson the hot hand cant connect that time well hes got a hot hand but I dont know that you pass up a layup he got two three point attempts missed them both on that possession Jim Lena takes a timeout not happy with how his team is playing in this second half the Hurricanes once LED this game by 10 now Miami trailing by eight at home say

thanks Rory Ill show you Rockstar be a finance and HR Rockstar workday for a changing World Billy just stole the Boston College in front impressively by eight here on the road and its been all Quinton post and Mason Matson well look at those numbers but let me give you another couple of numbers that post and Madson have made all seven of BCs threepoint baskets their 7 for 12 combined the rest of the team is 0 for9 wow and also the Eagles have picked it up on the defensive end because Miami is scoreless in the last 4 minutes and 18 Applause seconds and theyve turned it over a couple times uh Boston College has blocked a couple of shots I think you have to get omir more involved I mean they they have to attack post Robinson pull up pop and he connects of course Robinson is one of the guys whos been pressed into service here with all these injuries thats only his fourth basket of the season in ACC Applause play mton leaves it for post and thats an easy two for Quinton post now that was a great catch by mlon because that ball was thrown behind him and I thought he might throw his back out trying to catch it going inside to omir musling it against post who picks up the foul thats his third thats one of the reasons why you go to omir because sometimes when a guy is playing as well as post your best defense is to get him in foul trouble and get him on the bench thatll be an interesting decision for head coach Earl Grant post with three fouls his team up by eight as we step aside Bravo you use the Quicksilver card from Capital One with no annual fee and unlimited 15 cash

is just how Doug feels when he uses workday thanks Rory Ill show you Rockstar be a finance and HR Rockstar workday for a changing World Billy just stole your now what a lineup for you this weekend this is all on Saturday hockey starts three Eastern Time on ABC penguins and Bruins and then its North Carolina and Duke and our Sonic Blockbuster at 630 Eastern Time on ESPN then back to ABC for some NBA action and then it all ends with the Saturday night cap the world Bantam Championship UFC 299 so that is a loaded Saturday overlap season here in March lots of different sports going on and after that foul Quinton post has indeed come out of the game weve seen post you know he plays with a great deal of emotion and I think thats probably a pretty good idea just so he doesnt get a quick second one I dont think hell be on the bench long that rolls off the rim from omir hes 0 for three at the line tonight on conference plays shoot 68 which isnt terrible but You like a guy whos going to get fouled as much as he does to shoot a little bit better than that and hes been quiet tonight only six points to his name and hes usually up over 17 so Miami really bringing the pressure now this isnt just to get time run off the clock they were trying to take that one so now how does Boston College play with post out of the game well so far tonight its been poorly but Zachary got a good look and thats tipped in by Mighty Zachary Drew everybody once again and mighty didnt have to do very much except just tip that one in youre not going to get an easier opportunity than that you have to think Miami goes more to omir with post out a triple team on him finds Cleveland he attacks the rack and is fouled theyre going to call that on mton I think this is a really nice pass out by omir and you can see three guys are around omir and they all come after Cleveland I think they called the found mlon because he dropped those arms Mighty did a pretty good job jumping going straight up in the air but its not really a matter of going straight up in the air I dont think either one of those guys went straight up in the air they started at one spot and jumped to another spot and so thats not vertical even though you dont come down you if you jump into a guy thats a foul referees call that a point A to point B if you start at Point a and go to point B and theres contact youre responsible for it even if you keep your hands straight up in the Applause air Madson hes missed his last three threes after he was hot to start the second half well you know how Shooters are theyre hot and and they never get cool its just a matter of waiting to get hot again exactly Robinson that rattles in and out no Applause good Robinson at 0 for three before that shot in ACC play from threepoint range so if youre Boston College you might not mind that Miami made one of their last eight they have gone ice cold here and now trailing by seven thats a tough shot that floater weve seen guys make that they make it look easy but its not its a hard shot got to get the touch just right heres omir bodying up by Mighty Lefty hook Beautiful postwork by NORAD omir now if youre going to double team him you got to get to him more quickly than that once he turns to the basket its going to be hard poked Away by popper Falls to omir three on two and benley Joseph had it slip out of his hands thats a real break for Boston College Mighty did a very poor job going after that ball he stood there at half court and waited for the ball to come to him and here Harris goes but he waits until omir picks up his dribble and omir just waits for him to fly by and then gets an easy basket Earl Grant elects to take the timeout Miamis cut the lead to five and Quinton post is checking back into the game for the Eagles and not only does Earl Grant elect to take the timeout but he takes his full timeout so he takes a 60second timeout so hes obviously got a lot he wants to discuss with his guys and Boston Colleges offense just has not run smoothly without Post in the game and E even though the lead is down to just five yeah post went out minut and Boston College lost three points off their lead good time to remind you during the timeout five college basketball games on Saturday on ESPN the two Sonic Blockbusters number one Houston welcomes Kansas at four and thats followed up with North Carolina and Duke the best rivalry the sport has to offer and we were talking earlier how difficult it is to vote for the ACC first team its RJ Davis and then who knows well thats what I think you know Davis has had such a fabulous year but theres all kinds of people who have had great years in the Atlantic Coast Conference who have piled up numbers while they may not be Tim Duncan esque numbers such as post is put up guys have great numbers and theyve really been valuable to their teams Hunter Salis from Wake Forest has had a great year wheres Virginia without Reese beakman you know its not like Armando Bott has gone on vacation you know hes had a pretty good year too Kyle filipowski has had a good year PJ Hall I mean theres a lot of people a guy like Blake Hinson at Pittburgh should be in the conversation no again you can you can have a conversation and you can mention 20 names we did who can all be in the conversation thats what we did during the Boston College shoot around is in three minutes we named 20 guys who could be in consideration and not only who could be but who ought to be yeah and Quinton post is one of them back into the game here for BC Zachary stripped cleanly great Defense benley Joseph missed the finish on the other end thats some defense Applause though po great pass M glockton Misses the layup both of these teams trading missed layups here you cant make a better pass than post just made so mcglockton owes him an assist somewhere Applause takes the three misses the three boy Miami just cant get their hands on the rebound I mean po just couldnt grab the ball there was nobody from BC in the area and Jim Lena you can see his frustration you can understand it now this is the third opportunity on this possession for Boston Applause College step back three Harris too much on it long rebound Falls to zob he goes Coast to Coast it is foul Harris is now 0 for six from Beyond The Arc and this is a tough tough shot and when you take a tough shot you get the long rebound and thats like turning it over and mlon trying to make another good defensive play comes over the back and thats motons third foul Jay its so important your offense really has to help your defense and you help your defense by not turning it over and by taking good shots even if you miss them if you take a good shot youre in position to get back the Hurricanes havent helped themselves from the free throw line either they have really struggled from there tonight six of 10 Jo B connects on the second one fourpoint game NORAD Amir back in it for Miami so noo and air playing Music together yeah the opposite of small ball right now for the Hurricanes Zachary three got it Jaden Applause Zachary thats a big big basket and from Zachary who has seemed reluctant to shoot at times Music Applause todaya calls another timeout so he only has one remaining for the final 8 minutes and 22 seconds of this game not happy with how his team has played in this second half the Eagles

you know Doug Ever Since switching to workday youve been a real rock star rockar what do you know about rock stars ID dont I mean wheres the skin tight leather the shoes are leather wheres the unnecessary Z fat thing Billy Billy Rockstar is just how Doug feels when he uses workday thanks Rory Ill show you Rockstar be a finance and HR Rockstar workday for a changing world now two teams that enter tonight desperate for a win ahead of the ACC tournament both Boston College and Miami entered tonight on losing streaks Boston College looking for their first win here in Coral Gable since 2010 and for Miami this would be eight straight losses the most in 20 years and certainly the longest losing streak under Jim Lena Jim Lena called that timeout because he wanted to get his lineup adjusted he wanted to get Cleveland back in the game omir cant convert the second chance points Cleveland grabs it he misses the layup theyve had three shots on that possession roll off the Applause rim its been that kind of night for Miami the Hurricanes trailing by seven certainly its been that kind of second half Jim Lena would tell you its been that kind of season well Absolut absolutely post tangled up with George I this was a Miami team that coming off that final four you do lose Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller but you do return a lot of pieces from that team and it just has not gone their way well and thats true but they also lost Haron Beverly they also lost Anthony Walker guys who didnt play a lot but when they did play they provided valuable minutes off the bench and so to lose four guys who were key to that kind of of a run and its difficult to put a team together like that particularly now when you have the injury problems its just hard to develop popper gives up the three Cleveland wide open and he makes BC pay and Boston College has looked a little shaky at times against this pressure post passes out of the double team Harris walks it over the line see if youre Harris I dont know that you want to wait for the Press yeah he let them catch up to him yeah the heck with that post to League Bay and hes fouled a league Bay is not a very good free throw shooter only 50 in conference play hadnt been to the line that much only eight for 16 well we mentioned both teams on losing streaks Miami the seven gain losing streak we were talking about for Boston College their last win came against Miami in Chestnut Hill last month so Earl Grant he told us we would love to get this one move on to Louisville finish strong go into the ACC tournament feeling confident feeling good about ourselves well they still have a chance to do that but Im telling you this almost looks like the first half in Reverse where Miami jumped out to a lead in the first half and BC battled back and now Miami theyre doing a nice job staying in the game trailing by five within Striking Distance BC has had a couple of hot stretches but Miami has hung around omir going right into post great defense by Quinton post omir steals it back though and puts it in with the shot clock under Applause one well thats a play thats a really tough play by Harris youre trying to save the ball but you cant save it down there unless youre throwing it right to one of your own guys and NORAD omir never gave up on that possession great pass big finish Prince of League Bay again the lob passed inside to post and he does a really nice job find in League Bay hes surrounded so somebody has to be open but Miami down on the other end they gave the ball to omir and let omir go after post and I I dont think thats a bad play post made a really good defensive play but maybe the next time hell commit a foul and then that would be his fourth a big decision to make of your Earl Grant that was a lot of time left they go right back to omir this time hands it off to Applause Cleveland six minutes left in regulation Miami trailing by five popler deep three way off the mark Applause right back to El League Bay and he draws the foul again Prince El League Bay has caused Miami problems here in the second half yeah he sure has in the league Bay is a guy who you know he plays about 20 minutes a game in conference play but he has been very active down on the inside just one for three from the foul line tonight makes the first as we said hes about a 50 free throw shooter so hes right on par here but if youre going to play off of somebody and foul somebody a league day is probably the guy still a twopossession game Miami shooting just one of six from three and that is way off the mark But Cleveland there to clean up the spill well that looks like he was almost passing it to himself and if that ball hits the rim Boston College probably has a chance to get the rebound deep pass find Zachary spins his way free cant make the layup weve seen a lot of missed layups tonight both Applause sides and Robinson lost the handle well popper really surprised Robinson with that pass I think Robinson was looking to go to the basket to get a rebound post misfires from three popper keeps it in play plays become a little ragged here all of a sudden deep three Joseph cant connect really good rebound by Harris I you know Joseph has shot the three very well particularly in the last couple games but that was a c on Clark Range three I dont know that thats what Jim Lara was looking for well Joseph made the first two threes he took tonight but hes missed the last three Boston College leading by four a league Bay taken out by his own player Zachary the momentum carried him into a league Applause Bay and thats an easy layup for a league Bay of Zachary doesnt go into him well I think that Earl Grant is saying that omir pushed Zachary into him I thought it was his own momentum that carried him in well I I did too but its possible the officials are going to go look and see and if thats the case if he did push him into him then thats a flagrant fou right and it would be a flagrant foul because a flagrant foul is contacts that is excessive Andor unnecessary and this isnt excessive but it might be unnecessary I dont know that he ever touched him I dont think he did you know maybe he touched him at the end but he was bouncing off one of his own guys here he comes here and watch hes going to run right into Joseph and hes trying to catch himself omir he hes not pushing him theres no push there his arms are extended but theres no push his arms are extended because hes tripping right hes tripping over Joseph and hes trying to stop himself from falling down you know I dont know what the officials are going to see but I I didnt see any contact there that would rise to the level of a flagrant foul Keith Kimble Brent Hampton and Ted Valentine and now its Valentine who goes over to the monitor to take a look I would leave this as it was called on the floor well that thats would thats what I would do too but again the officials that their Earl Grant was very upset about that play and I think thats why theyre going to look at it and you want to make sure that lets take a look at it again see omir actually steps away then he runs into Joseph does Zachary and then Zachary also runs into omir right even before that play a chaotic sequence took over this game both teams missing layups chaos chaos is a good way to describe what has been going on I just I I I dont see it but then again were not the ones who have to see it so Keith Kimble just came over to our broadcast location and told us that they are going to upgrade the foul to a flagrant one so Boston College is going to get two free throws and the ball and the ball that is a big call in this game particularly because we just saw four or five replays and didnt think that it would get upgraded but well again again its one of those situations where I I just think he was off balance but theres no question theres no question that as om fell forward he did put both of his hands on Zachary or on on yeah on Zachary I thought he as he was coming down he extended his arms but I dont know if there was ever a push that Music Applause bad now the interesting thing is whos going to shoot the free throw Zachary is going to shoot the free throw okay thats the person whos pushed yes and thats much better for Boston College because a league Bay is 50 and Zachary and Conference play is 85 the flagrant one know not a legitimate play on the ball excessive or unnecessary and then you see the third one a push from behind and thats what the officials Applause deemed Zachary buries them both and Boston College has the ball so instead of Miami ball down four its Boston College ball up six so its thats a thats a thats a tough call you can see in looking at it that why they would say okay that meets the definition but I Im not sure that was a flagrant foul still a two possession game Miami within Striking Distance but its BC in control with a little more than four minutes left in regulation great ball movement popler a three no good battle for the rebound Quinton post diving for it he has made so many little plays like that one that have added up all night long Bo mcglockton has a mismatch inside against Joseph they couldnt find him Applause though high low into post jump ball the possession arrow stays with Boston College the Eagles clinging to a sixpoint lead this will be a fun finish here at the ACC when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks B three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winningest

football Inc is here to stay the UFL season kicks off March 30th now champ week is upon us the ACC mens basketball tournament tips off less than a week from now to Eastern on Tuesday ACC network from Washington DC take a look at our bracket as it stands tonight Miami and Boston College theyll both certainly be playing in that first round and it looks like if Boston College can hold this sixpoint lead theyll be playing 13 or better in Miami if they lose this game theyll be locked into that 14th seed yes because if they lose thatll be two losses to Boston College so BC will hold any tiebreakers against Miami but its its been a weird game in this last stretch where you used the perfect word the game got really chaotic and then have that uh very tough flagrant foul called on Miami Quinton post shot clock down to two cant connect there hes had a good night though 19 points nine rebounds for post Cleveland misses the Applause layup with that that was a layup but it was in tough traffic and thats kind of been Miami second half theyve gotten it in close but through traffic and nice block there falls out to mton shot clock at five I dont know that Harris knows it he does now lets it Fly and hits claudell Harris from deep well hes now one for seven shooting threes and that was a desperation heave that is a big basket its a shot you can probably live with if youre Jim Lona but it goes in for Claud delir Zachary quick hands poked it from behind and now BC a ninepoint lead with the ball 220 to play Its the Eagles largest lead of the night well you can see up in the top of the screen in the middle of the screen the shot clocks running down Harris has to take that one wow that was a long one and its now or never time for Miami Jim Lena uses his final time out hurricanes trailing by nine this is a Miami team that led by 10 in the first half they were in control of this game thats thats what I was talking about before they were in control of the game for most of the first half and then Boston College battled back right before the end of the half maybe the biggest shot of this game so far other than that three by Harris was the three to end the first half by Quinton post that gave BC some confidence coming out at of the locker room at half time but again Boston College with post and Madson they made some shots in the second half in Miami you know this is the kind of year its been before everybody started getting hurt in nonc conference play they shot the three very well scored over 86 points a game and in conference play Everything has slowed down just a little bit and tonight only 23 from behind the arc and this is a Miami team that relies so heavily on the threepoint shot that you just cant afford to shoot 20 from three in a game like this well we looked at each other in halftime and said Boston College had turned it over seven times given up seven offensive rebounds had shot 38 overall 25 from three and there were only four down right and they have played a lot better in this second half and built a ninepoint lead their largest lead of the night trying to hang on to it on the road and snap a four game losing streak Hurricanes out of the timeout Cleveland in attack mode turns around didnt get a good look Falls to omir right into post he misses from in close and post is not going to get credit for that rebound but he tipped it out of the reach of omir so now you dont want to completely take your foot off the gas if youre Boston College but you can afford to take some time you dont have to rush anything Harris with seven seconds to shoot just hit a deep three on the last possession for BC Madson he heaves it as the shot clock sounds misses it m glockton almost put it in for an and one instead well get two at the line well thats instinctive if youre mcglockton you get the ball there youre going to put it back up but he could have easily kicked it out and run another 20 seconds this is really tough hes got the ball and now I think hes off balance thats why he put it back up there he didnt really have a chance to kick it out mton he has been relatively quiet todays had a little bit of foul problems pretty good free throw shooter though this is the first he is 72 on the Applause year still a chance to give DC a 10point lead Music here missed them both miss both so now if youre Miami you got to get moving Joseph splits the double team tried to get it to Cleveland and turns it over but you got to go quickly but you cant be in a giant hurry and thats what happened that time the scoring drought that is now extended past four minutes here for Miami its allowed Boston College to balloon this lead well now Miami really doesnt have much choice no down by nine with only a minute 11 seconds left to go in the game you need the ball and maybe the only way you can get the ball is to foul its a one ofone here heres the biggest problem for Miami they are one of their last 17 from three youre going to need to make some down the stretch here post misses the front end Boston College has left the door open theyve missed three free throws in a row need points in a hurry omir drives right into post and he turns it over he fell down four turnovers down the stretch here for Miami I think now if youre Miami you get a foul quickly yeah way too much time coming off the clock here the Hurricanes electing to play this possession out down nine and now the clock will be big time against them deep three Harris hits it again claudell Harris drills two deep Threes And even though Cleveland makes the dunk its all for not Harris for Boston College down the stretch of this game has been terrific popler he misses fires from three and Boston College is going to win it on the road impressive comeback by Boston College now the Eagles snap a 10 game losing streak here in Coral Gables and a four game losing streak on the season Earl grants team with a big road win
