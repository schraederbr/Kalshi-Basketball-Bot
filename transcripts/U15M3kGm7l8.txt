Casey morcel and Michael okono phs Card meanwhile a Louisville lineup thats become familiar to card fans with Clark and James White Huntley Hatfield at Cory mentioned and theres Tyler Johnson The Freshman from Brooklyn with the ball and the cards get a started here in DC Hunley Hatfield a kick out for Clarks 3 skot Clark 41st three of the year starts our scoring and a great start for Scott Clark hasnt had a great shooting year this year however hes a guy thats more than capable from Beyond The Arc Michael oconer the transfer from Stanford runs Inc States offense heres our first match up with Barnes and hudley Outfield DJ reverses to the Baseline and scores they they have no answer for him if they if he can handle the lengthy amount of time he needs to be in there hes hard to handle and hes got to be the key with horn out Hunley Hatfield white heres Clark again against okell back to Johnson against diara oh Tyler through traffic wol pack with Morel you see NC States order keep an eye on diara he is a terrific rebounder at both ends of the floor especially on the defensive end the WD one thing we know when he makes a three hes a better basketball player Kevin Keats made that very clear as we see hat there with the great job defensively denying DJ Burns first turnover the day belongs to the wolf pack Johnson heres James skot Clark and now James attacks on the dribble hutley Hatfield off the Baseline cards have put five points on the board in their first three trips coach that was great ball Movement by the cards is that thats got to be encouraging when you see your team approach a game like that early right yeah I mean theyre theyre off to a great start and you know States going to answer oconnell a three and they do Michael oconnell almost as if he heard coach over here theyre listening to me I dont know why did your players listen to you okay I was just wondering 153 of the year for oconnell and were locked up at five Tyler Johnson Cory wants the ball in his hand and he kind of ignites whatever Louisvilles offensive set is going to be it feels like he absolutely does hes there facilitated 108 assists on the year however this time he goes to get a bucket hes touched the paint multiple possessions already in this game these these dont look like two teams that have been struggling Jaden Taylor whos been terrific gets his first basket he had 28 at pit in the regular season finale on Saturday night hes been 20 or more in three of his last four for the wolf pack Clark through traffic and he scores thats a tough finish stock Clark gave up the strong side to go to the weak side of the rim and attack DJ Burns body to make sure he wasnt available as a shot blocker diara thought about it to Corys point about shooting threes for the Missouri transfer there goes morcel he lost it in the air Huntley Hatfield recovers the wolf pack turnover oh over oh thats over and back yep turnover on Louisville unforced error for Kenny Paynes team the cards have been attacking the paint and sharing the rock Mike James finds brandley Brandon Hunley Hatfield who knocks down the midrange jumper and then Tyler Johnson going with a little reverse some English off the glass to finish and sky Clark with the tough finish attacking DJ Burns and still the concentration to get the bucket so the dead ball opportunity pushes DJ Burns to Kevin keatss bench Ben Middlebrooks wears 34 for the Wolfpack hes come in to fill that post spot pretty normal exchange if youve seen NC State play at all during the course of the year that ball got deflected itll stay with the higher seated wol pack but coach as you mentioned DJ Burns not in a position to be able to go for long stretches so its important to have a guy like of course Middlebrooks correct middle Brooks is good and it hurts them to have Burns three minutes into the game hes got to come out for a rest thats not thats not good give away by the wolf pack heres hutley Hatfield back to Trey white in traffic who scores louville does not look like a team thats lost a bunch of games in a row and as a coach when you see your team come in with an inspired effort like this into the ACC tournament where you basically starting a new season thats got to make you feel good about your preparation correct yeah its 100 I mean they want theyre doing everything right and there theres no reason for that to happen Kenny pays done obviously done a great job getting them prepared come in here lets play this game and see what happens seven points for Clark on the dunk Louisville hit six of their first seven and they cant collect it there itll stay with the wolf pack well DJ Burns is 137 lead well how about six for seven and NC States three for four thats pretty good for teams that have struggled so much but the problem is NC State only with four attempts compared to the seven for Louisville was the reason why Louisville holds that sixpoint lead yeah Middlebrook stays on the floor heres Taylor for three bounds away Johnson the rebound cards off to this strong start Scott Clark been a big reason hes got seven of their first 13 white misses diara cleans it up and heres Taylor in the wolf pack trying to flip the floor middle Brooks Quick Pass diara rolled in wasnt pretty but it went in yeah I was just about to say coach it was kind of tight Quarters on that pass right more like a handoff than it was a pass yeah oops thats still an assist though right just absolutely all right yeah I knew you would agree with that well coach and I both point guards knocking down the three well I I really was the point guard with Dave being handled the ball all the time so I dont know if you can call me so so well call you just the other guy I was the other guy there you go that works other other guy in the back court with Dave B I was good at taking the ball out of bounds and making sure he got it that was my best attribute sevenpoint lead for Louisville here is oconnell firing one diagonally for Taylor morel back rim missed Taylor will give him a second chance diara back for Jaden again at the front died on the back iron middle Brooks and it rolls off hell be at the line for two here yeah it worked so another look at this in traffic guys yeah this is really Im not sure how he caught it and he got it and he finished so Im going to just the way we drew it its like its like in golf its theres no room on the scorecard for a picture you know its an assist and a bucket coach Ive never heard that one before but I believe I will use it Cardinal its true Caleb Glenn the foul his first thats our first of the ball game and thatll bring Ben Middlebrooks who and DJ Burns is waiting on Middlebrooks by the way uh Jim and this world we live in Middlebrooks left Clemson for State the same day Jack Clark left state for Clemson as I told Cory earlier they the league did not ratify it as a trade but it sure felt like one yeah I think there was a player to be named later too so middle Brooks hit them both that lets DJ Burns back in the game but Cory still a fivepoint deficit here for the Wolfpack well the Wolfpack are a different team especially in the offensive end when DJ Burns is on the floor they have almost like a point Center to be able to play through DJ burn is such a great facilitator but the problem for the Wolfpack to this Point has been they havent been able to get stops against the Applause cars Clark and the jump shot good boy Scott Clarks got nine hes almost a double figures for the sixth time in the last eight games but coach thats why I said that theyre a different team on the offensive end because defensively you see Kenny Payne is going to put DJ Burns in all the action and pick and roll Burns Music and offensive foul lets get a Quick Check of our food line Food For Thought here in this first half and its the last four games for DJ Burns and you look at the numbers scoreless at Florida State only nine against North Carolina on the road but coming home and getting 27 against the Blue Devils at PNC and theyre going to need a big performance for him to get a win here in the ACC tournament hes just not the player he was last year he was just more consistent he could he could go for longer stretches and I think just got his second foul sure did in a series of seconds DJ Burns has gone from no fouls to two fouls both of the team fouls belong to Burns and no DJ horn in the lineup so now the second DJ is getting foul trouble but coach you of course have coached a number of great big men when they were in foul trouble and guys who were prown to get in foul trouble what would you tell them about a play like that you know you just cant commit bad fouls when youre a big guy youve got to use your fouls being aggressive going for the ball you know you cant use them reaching and grabbing people and and you cant waste those fouls now we had the luxury again because we played so much Zone all the time that if you got two I didnt I never took the guy out because you can its hard to attack a particular guy in a zone so thats the one advantage Ive always felt about playing the zone you could leave guys in when they got their second foul well and Louisvilles taking advantage of run this lead to nine at 20 11 Brion pass is coming to the lineup Kevin Keats talked to us yesterday about pass potentially getting a lot more action xan Payne has come in hell try and stop middle Brooks cannot it got tapped around and finally Kenny Sun comes away with a rebound heres the lead for Huntley Hatfield and taking away Taylor a terrific Play heres oconnell kick back for morels three nope Casey Morel unable to get it to go and of course a little more pressure on Casey playing in front of about 25 friends and family no pressure at all on Scott Clark as he has been on one here to start this game WD he has got a D his scoring and its when a guy plays like this it makes him a different team and you know they just didnt have that this year coach he came in at 32 threepoint shooting and 40 from the floor but coach youve been in a scenario before where your team hasnt had the best season but when you go into the turn what are you telling your guys are you talking them about a fres start I mean thats what you do thats what you try to do but its easier said than done for sure but theyre playing like its a fresh start for them and thats what the coach has done boy what a big basket for Brion pass just his fourth three of the year in 11 tries cuts it back to a ninepoint Louisville lead WD Im going to need to see a replay um our super director of Griff in the in the control room because uh I think that was a that hit the glass from the corner it was a glass I mean and and thats almost impossible to do yeah morcel trying to answer cannot Casey struggling look at Middlebrooks go back and hell get to the line for two more on another Louisville foul we get a timeout before we watch the Artistry out of the corner a Brion pass thats next from DC of the HC tournament went on to the national championship game thats right where he lost on a buzzer beating shot by DCs Chris Jenkins DCs own Chris Jenkins Gonzaga High School right down the street see Joe didnt recognize that when he came in here throwing up fo talking about Cory was I was better well Im just saying he did win the case award he absolutely did was a was Elite player and came back and of course won a national championship in 2017 yep yeah 19 points by the way for Barry and title game in this building the last time the tournament was here middle Brooks got one of two and Clark juggles it runs it down against cam Woods whos going to get some action today with horns ability to go and SC Clark is on fire thats 15 in the first half bad Play Broken play threepoint bucket thats the way hes going today Clark 15 the pack 15 Cory well Clark getting off to a great start we saw him get an easy bucket earlier and for guys who shoot and play with a lot of Rhythm that always helps three ball away and thats good Brion pass now thats the traditional look from Bon pass that one straight on knocks it down nothing but net and I love the fact that Brion pass is taking advantage of his opportunity here in ACC tournament yep young man highly recruited out of Reedsville North Carolina as a football wide receiver came to Raleigh to play basketball for Kevin Keats tend to shoot Mike James has been quiet so far back to Clark he has not the volume is all the way up for Scott Clark two more no back rim missed got his own rebound tried to get Huntley Hatfield a quick touch a little too unselfish on that one from Scott he caught it and could had an easy one Taylor had it blocked on the perimeter by Johnson Clarks early start here offensively guys seem to have fueled the whole Louisville team as Tyler scores at The Rim look at it differently WD I think thats the guy Tyler Johnson was in the paint to start this game off finding his teammates sharing the basketball he actually got Scott Clark a good look early I believe hes been the guy that ignited it however Scott clarkk has kept the fire going morcel into traffic reroutes on Hunley Hatfield and Casey morels on the board in the ACC tournament yeah he got closer to the basket hes going to try to get there instead of taking threes lob by Johnson oh it wasnt a lob it was a kiss there you go it was a kiss it was a lob to the basket six for Tyler Johnson my favorite person to pass to coach the glass no the basket the basket but speaking of the glass yeah we had a look earlier oh we got a little extracurricular guys what are we doing now come on fellas Cal it down yeah we got a look earlier from Brion pass knocking down to three in the corner we question questioned it did it hit the glass yes it did I tell you what you cannot duplicate that in a horse contest however this The Touch by Tyler Johnson spectacular off the glass I think theres maybe one a year the from the corner that hit the glass and go in well Im glad Brion redeemed himself because you know in a pickup game coach you know we take that off no no that does not count he came back and redeemed himself knocking down to three from the win Taylor checks out for NC State Zan Payne gets a seat for the cards so You got new faces on the floor here DJ Burns stays on Kevin kes bench with those two fouls about four minutes to uh four minutes ago in game time and morcel hits both free throws so NC State trailing eight here to a hot shooting Louisville team the cards are 12 of 16 four of five from behind the line and heres Glenn inside looking for position and threw it away trying to go to White and its Applause oconnell heres Michael oconnell on the drive and the float are good five for Applause oconnell you know theyre in this game and they really shouldnt be and thats a a good sign for NC State under nine to go in this first half L Tyler Johnson here against morcel Casey defends it well Cory all it for Woods here goes cam Woods trying to get in action and thatll be an offensive foul that is big boy basketball right there cam Woods lowering the shoulder we talked about Brion pass and his football ability this time you see cam Woods this created the contact dislodging Trey White for the bucket but thats going to go to other direction youre never getting away with that one cam Woods trying to jam the route on the release wasnt so Louisville the sixpoint lead here and woods is going to stay on the floor he and passing look at okono now fishes out the pass hell take it down and score okay final giving NC State a great lift the steal in the score getting them back into Striking Distance and had a couple stare Downs with Big John I would say I tell you what youre not going to run past that set youre going to look be respectful and be careful cuz he might come out of there get you of course were in the building where many of the huge Georgetown Syracuse rivalries took place well youre not kidding coach Im sure you got a lot of memories of those match ups mostly bad didnt go well coach they didnt they didnt always go well no not when Big John was here fourpoint lead for the cards NC State is rallied on a six nothing run and theres a foul off the ball on pass trying to defend Mike James so Brion pass who only averaged 5 minutes a game for the wolf Haack in conference play played 14 minutes the other night after horn got hurt being asked to come on here and hes knocked down a couple threes so far for NC stin that ball got deflected in traffic scooped up by James and woods I think stripped it out of there but Lee Cassell no its pass but WD one of the things weve got to make sure we get cleared up now okay everyone hears the terminology the DMV sure which stands for the District of Columbia right Maryland and Virginia however its not the whole state of Maryland and its not the whole state of Virginia it is small sections is DC now of course DC residents for the most part do not claim DMV theyre only DC its normally people from Maryland and Virginia and its only Northern Virginia doing so a lot of history in this tournament from guys from the DMV starting with 2011 Most Valuable Player Nolan Smith who is on the bench for the Louisville Cardinals as one of their assistant coaches as theres my guy who was inducted into the oakill Hall of Fame this past week and so were you well thank you I was waiting I was trying to edge you on to bring that up I didnt want to be the one yeah but like they say you were like low on the list of the better players there heres Middlebrooks inside couldnt finish heres Louisville on the turn Johnson bounce pass thrown away tried to go to Huntley Hatfield Taylor has made some terrific defensive stops for state and at the other end Woods threw it up there and it dropped in thats been the Achilles Hill for the Louisville Cardinals all season long they have a 49 assist to turnover rate throughout the season but 32 overall in ACC play and just like that NC States able to get it back to a fourpoint game off of the misc that is just the fifth field goal of the year for the North Carolina t transfer cam Woods well I can tell you this cam woods now has 15 points on the season nine of those came in his debut yeah tough shot Trey white Coach I mean when you have to make those shots youre going to have a long day normally that was really tough they were moving the ball better earlier and getting better shots and making it Taylor trying to use middle Brooks for the screen OK Connell back thr from middle Brooks and Michael oconnell Cory hes got nine here in the first half yeah he understands DJ horn not on the floor hes going to pick up his scoring is one of the guys whos part of that starting back court for the wolf pack and took it away from car Look Away Morel the catch and the finish and like that state to within Applause two Johnson for Music Applause Clark 10 to shoot five and a half to go in this opening 20 and theres another turnover morcel crosses over layup fell off the rim NC State doing it defensively here thats the way they got this run started getting the job done defensively and then you see cam Woods using every part of the rim trying to find an angle and then defensively okell coming up with the steal the kick ahead pass I wont call it quite West unish however no it was it was a pretty good pass and the only reason I bring up of course the Great West unel because we are talking about the greatest of all time for the Louisville Cardinals and His Banner happens to hang in this building which we sit and the greatest Outlet passer of all time absolutely I I saw him in person when I was young so I know what Im oh wait wait when you were hold on a second hold on now like go you might want to go ahead and finish this story here because College yeah I saw him you didnt recruit him you played against him right no he was younger than me a little bit freshman so wait a minute so when he says he was young so Wes was even younger oh yeah he was a he was a 17y old he he left his handprint up on the practice gym basket right at the top of the circle I said okay I said thats good I like him you knew greatness was on the way on the way Curtis Williams you see the Freshman from Detroit hes wearing number one for Louisville on the floor for the first time Scott Clarks the games leading score hes got 15 but were tied at 34 after the more self free throws hutley Hatfield to work on diara into traffic right hand blocked by Mo diara oneonone basketball opposite of what they played in the beginning when they were getting good shots Woods trying to beat Clark on the bounce and Scott Clark swats it out of there 17 to shoot here for the pack Clark has not gotten a shot since he was five for five in the beginning missed one shot and he hasnt seen the ball since then and this is why Louisvilles struggled all year they play really well and then they turn it over layup turn it over layup and now youre theyre right back in the game woods T to shoot for oconnell skip for Taylor on the drive and it a block is called its going to be on Mike James and thatll put Jaden Taylor the butler transfer to the line with a chance to give the wolf pack the lead Cory well you know today is of course an opportunity for Jaden Taylor to be able to step into the lineup and make sure that he you mentioned the career high 28 the last time out for him its an opportunity for him without DJ horn to be able to step up as the offensive role however give the cards a lot of credit for kind of holding him in check to this point but and he stayed off that defense and now with that free throw built their first lead of the game Jim to your point Louisvilles had a harder time getting the shots they got earlier but coincide that Kevin Keats is getting some effort by guys on his bench yeah theyre playing well off the bench and you know thats a kind of call right there that go either way you hit really you know toughest call thats one of the toughest calls in basketball but coach as you been in this game which just seemly be forever youve seen how much different it is for to be able to get a charge I mean now in comparison to before yeah its its much harder but its still I think should be harder I think they should take the circle out and make everything everything a block just take it out of the game I would have loved that would have kept me on the floor longer all the offensive fouls I got 18 for Clark by the way as he pushes Louisville back in front oconnell cannot answer here are the cards now under four to go Applause Hunley Hatfield against diara backs him all the way down and the short Fall Away rolls in thats a good comeback he gets his shot blocked last time down he comes right back at him I think hes got a chance to be a good player hes starting to get there but I think he still got a lot lot of range left in his game yeah just the Junior from Clarksville Tennessee originally started his career in Knoxville second year with Louisville here goes Taylor into traffic oh nice move around Williams and the layup for Jaden Taylor and we see jayen Taylor now after seeing the ball go through the basket at the free throw line hes starting to pick it up offensively using multiple listen to me multiple pivot feet huh you think about that to be able to get that bucket itll hit you later no no I know what youre saying I hear you Scott Clark see circling the big slide meanwhile heres Taylor the steel and the dunk seven for Taylor all here in the last couple of sequences too many mistakes and thats why you lose ninth turnover by the Cardinals and turnovers that lead to buckets James in traffic and hell Score first field goal for Orlandos Mike James yeah Mike James had 20 points the last time these two teams got together on January 13th so normally when you see a guy have success theyre looking to be ultra aggressive early that has a been the case for Jam okell for Michael okell it has been the case for oconnell I havent seen him this aggressive in a game thus far for the wolfback well its nice to see them pick up the slack PJ Horns not playing and theyre going to come out here and do something about thats thats pretty good to see Huntley Hatfield trying to beat Pi up scores and puts Louisville back in front eight for Brandon Hunley Hatfield WD he comes in averaging 17 points and nine rebounds over his last 10 games so hes been playing the best basketball of his career as of late I agree morcel hard shot and he scores thats 10 for Casey morcel tied at 43 well weve seen great de offense here in this first half defense optional however and knocked away it will stay with the cards well WD we dont have a cake for it however today is the win Earl Grant team Victorious at removal on Saturday to close the regular season Eagles played much better as the season wore on thatll be the third of our three first round games here on this Tuesday in Washington Scott Clark has been terrific for Louisville hutley Hatfield on the kick out Mike James the Miss and Trey white cant finish the tap and here is Jaden Taylor in the wolf pack tied at 43 with 70 seconds and change a Steady Hand of mik o connells been impressive here in the first half too he absolutely has on both ends of the floor not just as offense but defensively getting the job done as well Taylor missed the jump shot Clark and the cards on the run here goes Scott Clark trying to make his own money Huntley Hatfield out of the corner and it drops in for three just the ninth three of the year for Hunley Hatfield did you ever get a bounce like that come on seriously for Brandon hutley headfield coach being that we dont have a video proof to deny it all of mine hit the bottom of the net no Bankers from the corner threepoint lead final half minute middle Brooks Burns has been in foul trouble since about the 12 and 12 minute Mark Ben inside the scoop and score with a left hand five for Middle Brooks Louisville can hold for the final shot here Scott Clarks been terrific hes got 18 in this first half and hell take the last shot off balance three and thatll do it teams will go to the locker room Louisville leads by one here Cory and Coach WD Louisville ended the half we never saw him again well he should have be rested then I guess thats the coachs way of looking at so Taylor diara morcel DJ Burns Michael okell no DJ horn today for the wolf pack here is Burns right away with a left hand and he gets the roll starting off the game the second half the same way start off the first half attacking in the painted area Louisville deciding not to trap simply because hes such a great passer theyll take their chances with him playing oneonone against Brandon hudley hfield white goes over him back the turnover by the cards thatll be their 10th in the ball game they cannot stop burns down low I he may miss a shot or two but hes theyre not going to stop him hes just too hard down there to handle horis just too too thin to to play him down there but coach from from a strategy standpoint do you continue to throw the ball inside to Burns to Force Louisville to try to trap him to open up things on the outside for your players keep throwing to him till he tells you hes tired which doesnt usually take long time conell of three and boy what a terrific box out both Trey white and Scott Clark who got the rebound cards going to work with Clark and heres Tyler Johnson and thats an offensive foul Michael Conor steps in front here this is there all the way I mean he just made up his mind he was going to drive and didnt react to the defense and just went right right through DJ Burns giving up the pass and well see what happens on this possession guy won 1100 games wants it to go to the Hall of Famer wants it going back inside to 30 y another one that was close to another charge Morel morcel knocks down the three hes got 13 now and thats his first three and that thatll make a difference with him Ma has been a much better player in the second half of games as of late especially for NC State struggles with his shooting a little bit in the first half but first one of the second half good PA Morel off the bouns another look at this well you got to see does the right arm extend yeah no oh it does not extend coach no coach you dont call that one offensive foul I didnt say you call it I said it extended a little bit but it was more of a fake than a actual Applause charge hotley atfield taking it right at burns with the two fouls and Brandon scores see and thats the difference if Im Brandon Hunley hfield when I know Im going to have to battle to defend DJ Burns Im going at him every time on the offensive floor when I get the ball in my hands out front heres now Burns again got Huntley Hatfield in the air and hell get the Music one lot to look at here coach its a pretty good move by DJ Burns you cannot guard him manto man down there you just cant I dont think theres anybody in the league Ill give you any hes getting mauled in there and hes hes getting double grabbed with both hands hes just too good down low its almost a continuation there he kind of got hit on the ground but well well give him the n one on that one the smart play by DJ with the pump fake to get Hunley Hatfield in the air but also recognizing once hes in the air to get the shot on the basket comes up with a threepoint play hes got three of the Wolfpack six here to start the Music half oh sorry five of their eight rather start the half thank you park third field goal a free Music throw and to your point Jim Louisville needs a little offensive punch here but this is where you go make him have to defend and theres the foul on burns counter one with the other dont youns through the foul now Hunley Hatfield gets Burns to his third thats what they have to do make him play defense see if you can get him out cuz they cant guard him on the other end thats the best way to get him out of there but I will have to say this may have been good defense by DJ Burns lets see he has two hands there but as he goes out yeah he got him a little bit he does get him on the left does get him on that left elbow free throw by Brandon Huntley Hatfield is good hes now got three in the half 14 in the ball game this third field goal Kevin Keats right now opting to keep DJ burns on the floor trusting him to stay away from that fourth foul which weve seen DJ pick up fouls in bunches we saw the two fouls happened about 20 seconds in the first half oconnell Scoops Burns will follow and draw another foul I think he almost passed that but that I might be giv him a little too much credit you think you talking about ell yeah you give him too much credit that was a shot cach that was a shot all right thats the type of passes you used to throw yeah that might be give him a little too much credit well and the only reason I say that is because if you passing that normally its off the glass for your big man to go dunk it and that was DJ burns on the other side of that so then that was going to be below the rim finish for DJ hes not ding that dont forget the fourth leading score in conference play is a noo today thats DJ horn who averaged 181 against the lead and remember Cory he had 27 with six threes in the and the only meeting during the regular season with Louisville no he thats really what started the scoring spree for DJ yeah horn where he went on to score over 25 points for five straight games almost getting to JJ reic status who did it for six straight games that D yep heres Tyler Johnson setting for three Middlebrooks has come in to replace Burns and you see diara pull away the rebound wolf packed by four morcel weaving through traffic heres middle Brooks and then okon almost threw it away did throw it away Taylor had it once Johnson had it once and now last Touch by Jen Taylor I dont want it you take it well and thats it coach Casey morsel got into the painted area the only person back there was Brandon Hunley Hatfield now of course Huntley Hai a much taller Defender but if youre Casey Morel you want to be able to attack that and it ends up being a bad possession for NC State as we see the scramble to get the basketball Kenny Payne thinks it should be going in his Direction and ages with the call by the way thats the first NC State turnover in about 11 12 minute of game time miss out of the corner Taylor fouled in the back court collision with Trey white thatll be white second and the fourth on the cards that would have been a good Block in a football game but not here Jeff broms a few seats down from us we can go ask him the cards he he like hed like that play there he is played in the ACC title game last year against Florida State and Charlotte a lot of expectations whats going to happen this fall when his second edition of Louisville takes the field theres a three by Taylor hutley Hatfield the rebound saw Coach Brown make a road trip this year to Chapel Hill he likes his hoop now and a scoop and score no white couldnt get it to go diara pulls away one that hung on the rim great job by spot Clark touching the paint though maybe he was a little too unselfish on that one himself morel falling to the ground lost his balance and Middlebrooks cleans it up thats what Ben Middlebrooks has done 19 offensive rebounds in the last six games coming into this one and has already picked up a number of them here today thats his third offensive rebound very physical kid yeah Johnson looking for Hunley Hatfield now were going to get a foul called and its on Brandon could have gone both ways they both were doing it its just who do you catch so this is off the ball Cory and its something weve seen called during the course of the year because it has to do with the the reach around right right trying to give yourself an advantage to be able to catch the basketball on the post Kenny Payne coaching up Brandon Hunley Hatfield on the sideline right now as he has to take him out of the game with that third foul and we know how important it is to have him on the floor but how about this you come off you get coached up by Kenny Payne and then once you get further down the bench Danny Manning 1988 National Player of the Year and national champ stops you to give you a couple of nuggets as well Music exactly so the wolf packed by six with four and a half gone in the second half after Louisvilles best shooting half in the first 20 minutes heres Taylor off the turnover and hes fouled couldnt finish the shot hell get a couple of free throws and were going to get a timeout in Washington thats thats the only thing that its better than seven for Taylor as hell go to the line we welcome you back to to Washington day one of the 71st ACC tournament presented by tro price with Jim beaham Cory Alexander West Durham great to have Kim Belton who was a former beheim recruit as our producer yeah he chose otherwise though another one that got away and Mike Griffin our director terrific crew Dave OBrien Jay bis had game one for you I dont know how much credit I can give Griff though cuz we went to Insomnia Cookies last night and I think he ate the entire box WD he left me like one cookie wow Angel gray Our God I mean we had the whole crew wow and I think I got one cookie left Im just sure okay I highly doubt that yeah getting ready to say heres James turning and scoring Mike James second field goal hes got six big basket for the cards there coach 5 minutes in well they need it they need to get going they need to try to get the ball back to Clark and get a couple shots see if he can continue to shoot well its been a while since hes had a shot okon more cell Taylor looked at midd Brooks and now gets it to him with Glenn defending Ben burrowing in and thatll be a foul on Caleb Glenn thatll be his second and that is seven now on Louisville quick reminder to you weve got ACC Softball coming up for you tomorrow night 700 number 15 Alabama visits Lon Ela and number 18 Florida State terrific battle in the top 20 coverage begins at 7 Eastern right here on acc Network and and the ESPN app so Ben Middlebrook speaking of Florida state whos the nephew of the former seminal quarterback Danny canel at the line for the front end of the one and one you know Wes always comes up with some information that we really dont even need oh coach how do you put him you dont put him together with so coach what youre saying is we need to th bubble on West is is is that what needs to happen at this point we got we got put one over top of his head will it be a bunch of information that we dont need to know 100 middle Brooks has nine by the way coach as we move along sevenpoint lead I didnt say he wasnt good I just said I dont know why we need to put him with Danny canel but whats his uncle thats a thought that might be applicable you know heres Clark on the drop plus Dan he might be watching saved off the middle Brooks block oh and then the collision and Clark will scoop and score now you cant blow the whistle because Ben Middlebrooks actually fouled Casey morel teammate who had the basketball on that and it ends up being an easy bucket for Scott Clark first point since about four minutes to go in the first half for Scott Clark hes now got 20 and the cards to within five heres middle Brooks back toward the basket cant finish inside Glenn the rebound and a whistling foul will be on the wolf pack and its on Jaden Taylor that gives NC State its second team foul first on the Junior from Indianapolis just unlucky play for NC State you see Ben Middlebrooks hit Casey morcel after the nice save from okano but turns the basketball right over into the hands of Scott Clark with the easy layup Curtis Williams bring to the front Court freshman from Detroit had 15 in the regular season meeting against the wolfback yeah four for six from Beyond the threepoint Arc unable to get anything going so far in this one offensively Clark tried to wrap it back to Glenn and turns it over morcel the other way off the Louisville turnover and diar bounce pass from Casey yeah but great job by Casey really probing keeping his head up seeing what the defense was going to give him got to a point to he really could have taking the midrange pullup but the nice pass to diara under the basket lead is seven now for NC State trying to find its 18th win of the year they split their last six games of the regular season and finished the campaign with an eightpoint loss at pit on Saturday and James fouled on the drive and its going to be on Middlebrooks itll be his first and the third on the wolf pack so the winner of this game will get the seventh seated orange of Syracuse Cory thats tomorrow night late following Clemson meeting the winner of our next game third game of the day Boston College in Miami noted aim will meet Wake Forest in a 125 match up at 230 tomorrow behind Virginia Florida State who started high noon I can tell you what were going to do WD we are going to get a ISO cam on one said Hall of Famer to my right during that that Syracuse game because I can tell you he is going to be in motion during that one heres Williams at the front and Curtis Williams drops down the two and this is a young man who can be instant offense coming off the bench seeing him have some big performances for the cards as a freshman this season need some experience but he can absolutely help those are Louisvilles first bench points of the night NC States had 17 from their bench remember playing without horn tonight Taylor thought about it steps to the left and guns for three and Middlebrooks will catch another foul thatll be his second four on NC State Williams getting to the midrange a little bit of Separation to step back but you see with his size has the ability to shoot over top of most Defenders nice touch to make it a fivepoint game now the cards with an opportunity after the Zone defensively coach now the cards need to make a couple offensive plays they need to get in it back in it right now Burns is still out lets get a couple buckets get into this game here is James on the turn everything but the best last possession defensively was Zone for the cars now lets see if they are able to get back into it looks like theyre going to stay Applause man Brion pass has come back out on the floor during that exchange of moment ago middle Brooks with James double team help from pay and a little of a foul is called and its going to be on xan Payne so hell draw the foul in there whats whats the negativity there they they theyre not with us I understand okay theyre not with us the great late great lambay no question as well as my man wal The Whiz Williams theyre not here with us but they were with us so you cant just write them out of history now I can I can hey likes with us now but he wasnt with us up until like 2013 thats okay hes with us now okay so I can talk about him I got you midd Brooks hits them both by the way lead is seven for the wolf pack I would note that Bob Lewis you mentioned a couple of weeks ago when RJ Davis was attacking Carolina single game scoring record against Miami in Chapel Hill Bob Lewis from Washington 49 in 1965 against Florida state that was not a conference game for those of you just joining and no no uh threepoint line for those 49 either W and Curtis Williams finds a threepoint line why didnt you say 1965 like you couldnt couldnt score back then I played back then thats exactly why we said it B got 46 so and and I took the ball out of bounds every time and gave it to him Casey morcel who also went to St Johns College there you go High School here in DC knocking down the three ball from the corner hes got 16 by the way and he was late to the party in terms of the scoring yeah but hes got 25 people in theend thats watching and he better show up in this game Hunley Hatfield against Middlebrooks 10 to shoot sevenpoint game Brandon trying to squeeze the trigger and does 6 and a half 17 in the game Huntley Hatfield 17th double figure game against the league here tonight and he stayed with that when early in the year he wasnt now hes finishing some of those plays hes improved this year Zone again defensively coach Kenny pay mixing it up he must know youre here watching middle Brooks he and Hunley Hatfield starting to square off thought they might whistle him for a walk it got deflected itll go out of bounds last Touch by NC State well they didnt call the walk so then they didnt call the foul which thats thats right right Im going to trust you on all this because youre the one that had to sit over there for so long well thats what just happened down there all right halfway home fivepoint lead winner gets Syracuse tomorrow night 700 in the third of the four second round games on a Wednesday here in DC Clark off a high screen from Huntley Hatfield its been a quiet second half for scottt against p pass draws the foul and hell get a couple of free throws thats three on pass okay Coach I need you to break this down for me youve seen a lot of basketball watch more basketball than anyone I know I need for you to see tell me what is this celebration right here I dont know why anybody thats got the recent history of these guys is celebrating oh my goodness anything except I guess being here I mean thats it thats all I can see Ernest Ross those are the three goggles coach I know what they are but lets not celebrate until we win a game or two 21 for Clark so coach when someone on your team youre coaching and Carmelo Anthony makes a big three in the corner and one of his teammates puts on the three goggles is it okay or not its okay cuz we probably won eight or nine games in a row okay thats fair all right thats fair the celebration when youre down 20 like some of those guys do in football games or whatever you know celebrate that okay waitting until you win thats fair 22 for Clark four in this second half so DJ Burns has come back in the ball game time for our Bojangles bigb moment of tonights game at be DJ Burns going to work here Cory he absolutely has he started out the game attacking the basket then back to the second half the same action for Kevin Keats but Burns in foul trouble hasnt been able to stay stay on the floor and now hes on the inside trying to attack this Zone look at Burns high off the window and last Touch by Connell trying to save it and this Zone has helped Kenny pay and the Louisville defensively they thrown a little bit of a you know hesitation in North Carolina State offense yeah sometimes you just it catches you off guard and you have two or three bad possessions and that can help you you know get back in it and get a couple stops wol packed by three Hunley had F Well out against Burns hell spot at 16 I dont like the settle however thats really where you need to go oh my double dribble on Taylor think Jaden might have exchanged hands here and Kevin Keats WD I can that one go by the boards vividly the official was right on the call so I mean he Ill go right back to it with Hunley Hatfield Im not sure why he gives the basketball up Force DJ Burns to have to guard him Trey white fourth field goal nine points Louisville to within one we go inside a 9 minutes to play now and you have to like Louisville fighting back like this after they gave up the lead get down six or eight and then theyre fighting back thats thats pretty good Woods heres Burns now OK Connell back for DJ Burns and a foul you really cant stop him down there when he gets down in there hes a really unique offensive player and you know you just wonder why over his time he hasnt been able to get himself to where he can play longer minutes and with more energy but especially when you switch defensively and you put a smaller Guy having to contend with DJ burns down there in the paint six for burns by the way eight in the ball game it really doesnt matter when a big guy plays him he just uses his move moves and step throughs and gets the guy up in the air I mean hes just a unique player down there I mean hes got a great low post game and he really reminds me of Zack Randolph I had Zack Randolph when he was coming out of high school same build same kind of body and moves uh you know Zach got himself down into better shape though and was able to go Music better Zack Randolph aim malagan thats not bad comparisons terms of your footwork and your movement at the post yeah hes got all the most hes very good there threepoint lead for the wolf pack both these teams trying to play for another day Hunley Hatfield oh ok conell reached in almost swiped it Jeff walls the Louisville womens Coach sitting down here to our left flawlessly handled that ball when it got knocked theirs coach walls no mistake no error no turn he handled it great n only been impressed if he shot got it but WD you mentioned hakee alijan now whats the first thing that comes to your mind when you start thinking NC State and aim alijan no h yeah alberquerque in 83 there you go with my guy Dereck whittenberg who was not on the graphic although he is a DMV Legend from damaa high school to this day still says it was a pass it was not it was a shot its a good car its a good try from wh though oh yeah great try from wh No One Believes that not his not his closest relative mother does not believe that so cam Woods is going to go to the line he is just three for four on the year on the 10th foul against the Cardinals you see DJ horn on the bench hes not played today its a hip flexor were being told and came out did go through some degree of the warmup but the wolfpacks leading score not available now theyre up three with eight to go should the Wolfpack win be interesting to see if hed be available for their line tomorrow I mean it happens but it always puzzles me as a coach when a guy cant go today but goes tomorrow I mean you know thats pretty well I think hes in a position to where it its dayto day because we saw him warming up yesterday we watched him warm up earlier today and we actually wonder whether he would play or not but more importantly he was able to go into halftime and put his ice on though yeah maybe he will Ian they played really well without they theyve kind ofs picked it up a little bit so thats what you do when you lose a a key guy other guys have to step up and you can do that over one game its hard to do it every game heres Middlebrooks fighting through blocked by Huntley Hatfield out of bounds itll stay with the Wolfpack 732 to go in heel and befriended Everett case in watching NC State play in the old southern at Thompson Jim he was a leg a legend he was a luminary he was a trusted friend and mentor to so many who have covered this event for so many years and hell be sorely missed at 98 but he leaves us with some incredible memories and DJ Burns just goes right to the basket yep fivepoint lead for the wol pack out of the timeout ahead of seven to play here in Washington on day one of this ACC tournament presented by tro price and Taylor the rebound of the Huntley Hatfield Miss feels like were in a danger zone so to speak with the cards Cory we are in a danger zone right now for the cards Im also in a danger zone WD because we put that graphic out with so many different DMV guys and you know Im one of the voices of the ACC can you imagine how many guys are hitting me up right now because theyre not on the graphic Scott Clark on the steel and the layup 6 and a half for Clark 24 in the game Louisville within three let me start out with some guys who Im getting in trouble with one my brother the greatest ACC Tournament of all time Rand says Casey morcel is fouled on the three yeah was not on the graphic he is from Clinton Maryland yes he is he is in the DMV right but even worse oh no oh no its worse than that worse than that it gets worse than that oh no it doesnt come on tell me it doesnt the great Dennis Scott 3D Flint Hill prep oh my God just text me and says no love WD thats your fault no its not Georgia Tech you a Georgia Tech guy that should never happen you you approved that graphic beforehand wait a second hold on hold on now dont drag me into your trash 3D my apologies and okay lets start with this NC State 1991 ACC Player of the Year thats right call him ice Rodney Monro no I didnt hear from Rodney yet good but Rodneys hagers town so Im not quite certain that is not the DM no but thats what Im saying but I think from the DMV and move to tank yeah that that might be okay oh the list goes on on on but I just want my produc my producer Kim Belton and our director former bam recruit Kim yes the one that turned beam down now he got me in trouble but its okay are we going to go through my whole list of people I coached 47 years there about a thousand of them I lost come on you only got to get one out of 10 you know Marcel hits all three free throws hes got nine and a half and 19 now in the ball ball game Casey morcel and the Wolf Pack lead is six Tyler Johnson The Freshman from Brooklyn and almost threw it away Clark with a heck of a catch against Brion pass Scott oh to The Cutting white great cut by white to get to the open spot not standing on the threepoint line and Scott Clark has done it all for the cards here today and gotten them back within four 11 double figure games on the year for Trey White against the ACC fourpoint game under six to go none bigger than the Clemson 20 29 and 14 though he put up West unsell numbers in that game WD heres morcel of three Johnson the rebound Tyler front Court great job by Tyler recognizing Ron pass trying to sneak up and get that steal skip for Clark three ball its the first three L hes got since the first five minutes of the game and with 27 points five for six from Beyond The Arc I have to say this is probably the best game that Scott Clark has played in a Louisville uniform this is one of the best games anybodys played any uniform this year heres a onepoint lead for State Taylor in traffic fouled on the Applause play thatll be two shots coming for the wolf pack yeah Sky Clarks another guy you look at freshman year coming all the hype and everything did had a very poor year and now next year hes back four on Huntley Hatfield with 5 minutes to play here guys it it just takes a year sometimes maybe even two and we just dont give him that dont forget our baseball game of the week features the number seven team in the nation Wake Forest visits Brian oconor at number 17 Virginia youll get the second game of their three game series Saturday afternoon 400 right here on AC CC Network and the ESPN app Taylor the free throw the lead is three Huntley Hatfield goes out and Caleb Glenn checking ining down huh yeah you got a much smaller lineup which becomes a problem trying to keep Ben Middlebrooks off of the offensive glass its already been a problem and now with this smaller lineup how will L will take care of business we got about five guards in there dont they Taylors got 10 Louisville trailing three Clark for the tie but thats always the great equalizer coach if youre going to be small then you got to shoot the ball and Scott Clark gets a nice look for the top of the key knocking down the through CER high 30 now for Clark were tied at 75 and a timeout Kevin Keats wants to talk about it here Jim what youre Kenny Payne what are you telling your team you know they havent been here enough and thats whats you know theyve just got to theyve got to find a way to get a couple stops and its going to be here double team on burns thats probably a good move Tay you going work how about that because thats what we talked about before do you go double team because when you double team that opens up opportunities Taylors been shooting at hot basketball as of late and hes too good a passer its just you know its just something you cant do but with Hunley Hatfield with the four fouls on the bench it is a significant mismatch with DJ Burns in the post Clark all the way through deflected away scooped up white eight to shoot for Louisville skip for Johnson all the way through up off the glass Tyler Johnson with eight crafty play by Tyler really just taking extending that step to get around the defender and get the easy layup onepoint lead for State pass to Burns double team coming thats Glenn and Johnson on the Big Man Taylor launching again and it rattles in backto back threes for States Jaden Taylor and Kevin ke is excited on the sideline watching DJ Burns handle the traps with perfection Applause Johnson caught squeeze the trigger and oconnell collects it in the corner three minutes to go and a backourt foul on Johnson frustration foul well in youre going to get oconnell to the free throw line whos 84 but coach its a fourpoint game here well he thought he was going to get fouled and he didnt so he went the other three guys over here dressed very nice by the way yall are sharp but the only one doing any work over there is Kelsey she carries them and when Im not there they really struggle so I mean I dont know how they do however the ACC tournament is always the anniversary of when Kelsey forgot me West went back to West Durham Music and yes I can understand that okono by the way puts State up six now with 3 minutes to go Boston College Miami closed this first round later tonight heres James to White Scott Clarks got 30 hes been terrific for Louisville hutley Hatfield playing with the four fouls eight to shoot for Williams skip for Clark and a three B unbelievable 33 for Clark have a night land 73 to be honest this was the sky Clark that Louisville was supposed to get his reputation is a shooter a high level scorer and he has saved his best but what could be last however hes trying to keep it going yep well he was the guy that high level guy Louisville or the Illinois thought they H missed three from morcel oh you know what Im doing right here w 55 o lost it on the dribble he took a tough hit from Taylor too the turnover first big mistake hes made today 15 of them now for Louisville today nine for the wolf pack first turnover in 11 minutes for the Ville threepoint lead for state morcel and a reach in on Curtis Williams foul on Williams his first two free throws coming for the wolf pack here and this is a game where Louisville just hasnt been able to win these games theyve kept it close in a number of games but they just havent been able to finish and you know NC States got some guys that have finished some games so you know they have a little bit of an advantage here I take it back to November with Louisville where Kenny Payne and his crew had Texas on the ropes oh yeah mismanaged a couple plays one at the end of the first half heres Morel for the second of two free throws Casey by the way now has a career high against any ACC opponent Cory yeah well he actually had a career high 21 points against I believe it was Florida State yep you and I did that game correct thats correct played well that night two weeks ago and so morcel Applause most points hes ever scored against an ACC opponent now free throw or jump shot from Williams no good and Casey the rebound for the wolf pack and the foul will be on Mike James 8580 with 79 seconds left and Scott Clark has had a day guys he absolutely has and you look at his shot chart 33 points 12 of 15 from Beyond The Arc super efficient coach you know what that percentage is dont worry about the Syracuse thats 80 about it but it also isnt all behind the arc thats his total field goal yeah true that coach Scott Clark is the sixth player to have 30 points and six made threes in an ACC Tournament game over the last 25 years he joins JJ reick Tyrese rice Harrison Barnes Olivier Handlin and Hunter Couture all great names yep all great names by the way all my guys well I I think that it would have been better the last two possessions if he had gotten another couple looks well down seven now with 75 seconds left Clark uhoh had it knocked away middle Brooks will Scurry to scoop it up but thats been again thats been the issue for the cards the entire season and its reared his ugly head here late in this game when you look at the one thing that Scott CLK has struggled with throughout this game he now has six turnovers and crucial ones here down the stretch and just mishandling the basketball give Brion pass a lot of credit for just sticking his hand in coming up with the steal there and now an opportunity for NC State to make this a three possession game oconnell at the line on the day two for two knocks that down now an eightpoint game and you have to give NC State a huge amount of credit for being able to hang in there when Louisville played so well you see Milt Wagner on the bench the last Louisville player in a conference tournament to have 30 or more was Milt Wagner who had 31 at Metro in 1986 Clark has broken Milt Wagners Mark today but was that the Metro conference turn it was an 86 y there goes Clark missed the layup white tried to follow first and now the second time the charm but it is 8980 with 51 seconds left and a timeout taken by Kenny Payne and our Dynamic play of the game is brought to you by T price and even though theyre down seven its Scot Clark here yeah he has been Dynamic absolutely in this game we talked about the numbers and the efficiency of Scott Clark making big shot after Big Shot for the cards throughout this game may not be enough to keep his season alive but he is definitely given his best effort here this evening yep both teams have play that really high level and you have to give them credit this stage of the year to play like this the finality coach sets in though when you get to this doesnt it yeah its the end of the year is is so difficult for players and coaches cuz you always think no matter where you are that you could could have won this game and now you got another chance to play but it you know it just got away from Louisville but its kind of been the way its been for them when they played well theyve still not been able to close the game NC States made 13 straight free throws to push the margin to seven and there is a quick backourt foul and thats going to be on Glenn and a NC State team that has been in the bonus and the double bonus Cory since 142 minutes to go in the ball game yeah and you identified that when it happened and you think about what an advantage it is for NC State to know that if youre strong with the basketball youre going to have an opportunity to put two points on the board just by getting to the free throw line right and theyve taken advantage of those opportunities as well oconnell at the line for a pair and the first one good and thatll make it eight points with 50 seconds Huntley Hatfield returns he plays with four Syracuse the seven seed awaits the winner of this tomorrow night at 7 oclock orange beat the Wolfpack twice they beat him at the Dome and then lost in Raleigh to Adrien As team by the way snaps the streak at 14 in a row after aell missed the back in white the scoop oconnell The Rebound with 35 seconds left and a pitch ahead here is Taylor and the layup well in the final half minute the lead is 10 at 9282 and heres Clark whos working on on a careerhigh in a record setting tournament night for Louisville and therell be a foul on Middlebrooks and Cory 16 12 seconds left to go into the ball game and for the Cardinals this will bring a close to the season and immediately discussions will begin about the future of Kenny pay they absolutely will and again you know everyone will have their own opinion I personally dont believe that Kenny pay has really been given much of a chance considering the the program that he took over Louisville wasnt just in bad shape it was broken and I believe it was going to take more than 2 years to try to get this program back to where it would be I personally would love to see Kenny Payne get a longer opportunity I dont know that that will happen Jim its a production business we all know that right yeah I mean Louisvilles got such a history of winning and have to be very careful how you treat your own because the recruits are watching yeah cards will put it in play here with 166 to go Clark out of the corner fouled on the play by Middlebrooks and Scott Clarks going to get free three free throws and Ben Middlebrooks is going to get a soft jog down to Kevin Keats for a oneway discussion here coach the game is over lets just get it over thats what the discussion is is going is that what it is right there lets just get it over and thats when you want to get on a player because you are going to win the game you know if it was a fivepoint game and you do something like that then you might not win the Applause game second of the three oh what a night for Clark huh not many better games than this 35 mean hes been hes been rolling since the opening he absolutely has he he started off strong finishing strong yep third of the three completely clean Music the lead seven with 13 and a half to go Jaden Taylor out of a double team and Kevin Keats took a timeout and he wants to wave everybody in so Brion pass well get a little instruction this is full Kevin Keats coaching points right here well Kevin Keats is looking at his high school quarterback the football players saying hey can you please take the ball out of bounds because hes the guy that he trust to be able to throw it in and of course that there needs to be a long pass to be made he knows Brion pass is capable all right so lets move ahead a little bit were going to see BC Miami later tonight BC by the way third meeting between those two schools in 25 days Jim yeah and BCs played has really had M Miamis had just so many injuries so many setbacks and you know uh post is a difficult guy for them to play against inside and uh you know Boston College is going to have a lot of conf coming into that game we got a we got a heck of a game tonight in the post not Quinton post with nor Chad oir in Quinton post mm size versus strength yep inbounds to Morel theres the cards double team and a foul called Mark snner whos worked with Jerry heer and Lee Cassel tonight tickets Trey white for his fourth WD you think about this whats that our guy hasnt said anything negative about the officials the entire game oh ho ho now the officials are good in this league Ive always said that I dont do agree with some of their calls but these guys are good officials we have a great chief of officials and and Brian kiry in this league yeah and you know but youre going to miss calls and you know coaches are going to say something about them thats what were over there for Coach beheim I dont even know who you are right now I
