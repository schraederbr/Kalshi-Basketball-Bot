better shot McNeel is on fire Jerry Deng can step out and hit that shot Abel Hollowman Deng and a Bouet break the pressure Hubstead layup Good ball movement Posies three Strong and again he crashes the boards Gets his own miss and carries it all the way to the rim Anderson to the corner Hayes short getting after the offensive boards Both Hubstead and Posey capable offensive rebounders Copeland
