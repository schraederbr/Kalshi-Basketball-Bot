sente is senior from Spain Isaiah Carr the sevenfooter from New Mexico and Isaiah Ado anra Brad student from Houston Texas tip is controlled by Carr and we are underway for the 2425 season here at Stanford and thatll be the main man for Denver Craig who floats it in the Pioneers they had Kevin Bruner the leading scorer in the country last year at over 25 points per game hes now a pro just signed with the Rip City remix in the gleague hes gone as Denver lost their top three scores inside to go right into the Frenchman as well but mentioned earlier was able to get downhill we speaking of Clark the point guard right to the rim was able to finish like nice little floater little miscommunication there on the first turnover the game Monday mat its game one of two well have here on the farm Stanford women will face off with L Moy theyve got a new head coach as well Kate pay its a new beginning for Stanford this is their first year in the ACC we get into that later as well Reno nice Cross Court pass three on the way for sellers is short its a nice look by Reno recognizing being double team for the opposite side skip out Craig left wide open three on the way short Craig so far has the first basket for both teams heres Jaylen Blakes grad transfer went to Duke sers played against the Cardinal last year with USC here in Maples excited to see what Blakes can bring played in the ACC played for Duke understands the toughness thats need to be played in that conference as well and he goes right to the rim for his first bucket as a Applause cardinal made three starts with Duke Stanford recruited to come here back in 2021 he ended up picking Duke and the Cardinal are happy he eventually made his way to the West Coast he hails from northern New Jersey and eventually WS with back playing in the ACC as well nice cross close pass stolen geler couldnt get it to go s second efforts offer did a great job of reading the passing Lanes usually when you get live ball turnovers Tim usually those are buckets not able to finish the Cardinal I was talking to people around both programs before this game they said it might be a little disjointed to start Denver lost all their top scores Stanford is has 10 newcomers Craig all the way to the hoop Craig again ability to get downhill going to use the left hand and finish Four Points four to two Craig Stanford had not had an undergraduates transfer since 2009 and theyve got three of them on this team alone see a couple of them later giler three rattles down G did a great job of becoming available as rno again being double team through the open spot was able to deliver 10 toes behind the line knocked it down for the three bowl and Benny started as a walk on earned a scholarship coach Smith told me hes as solid as they come he started one game last year it was at Arizona and he had nine assists Stanford last year Arizona game they were six and4 in the Pack 12 up at the half one game out of first place they end up losing that game losing eight of nine and the wheel kind of came off in the second half for Stanford hoping for a stronger finish to this year three in the corner rattles down thats a anra the grad student from Houston Texas went to UTSA for a couple of years and made his way to Denver and Jeff W Brun with him both teams feature a lot of transfers as well the portter was active re know again was not able to deliver down on the left block a little bit short you saw the immediate double team anytime Maxine gets that ball down low just the point of emphases you cant let him beat you mentioned earlier 1522 points a game almost a double double 96 assist and away from the play first foul of the 2425 year for both these teams DeAndre Craig is called for it announc it in house ofah sellers but that had to be on Denver comington Jr Conor money Tyler Sandman the officials talked to him before the game briefly and they had some good news for us coach no new rules thats interesting but he say there going to be a ton of them next year as well Id like to see what those rules will consist of I would love to see four quarters if they go to that and timeouts as well at the end of the game you can advance the basketball thats what I like to see have both those in the womens game well have game two of our double header at 700 local Maxine Renault thats his first bucket the most improved player in the Pack 12 added seven points and four rebounds to his numbers from his Junior to senior year and it was able to get some real estate down low I love the jump hook over the left shoulder nice size nice finish nice touch around the rim Reno steals it away Showtime shows his athleticism playing in a passing Lane that time Stanford was able to score on a live ball turnover I mean you ever seen someone 71 win millets how about that and he did it with ease he knew that thats what he wanted to do first action here for Sebastian Atkins as well as teimo Stern nitzki Stern nitzki in the bottom of your screen number nine he haes from Finland step back oh man smooth from Craig whos already got six Denver got away with a travel seven zente traveled official didnt see it that way as a result Den was able to score reeno doubled immediately looking to find the open man sers gave up the three 15 on the timer healer from NBA range long rebound to the Cardinal sers step back three third attempt here for Stanford Gaylor takes a three its good third time to charm Gaylor last year shot 36 from behind the arc thats his second one so far oh get into B Smith loves the number Stanford tracks 51 different numbers and doesnt take a mathematician to know if youre watching basketball now youre going to see a lot of threepoint shots like the one that sternitzky just missed but early on Maxine Renault came back to Stanford he had other offers and Kyle Smith and Company pretty happy because of things like this Cardinal up three early on Cardinal fans for every ass thisf hey I stepped on you one time that was my fault ChickfilA keep the going through the game today so lets make that noise for the Applause Cardinal its Ted Ted Robinson oh yeah you know him at all nice guy hes doing the uh hes doing the uh oh hes he just come to check out the game yeah I think hes he lives around here oh okay so come back with Kyle maybe what do you want me to tee you up about Kyle anything um yeah team me up and Im going to mention that you know hes been a winner everywhere hes went last year 25 wins so I ended it with this you know Kyle Smith told me when I talked to him this week about goals the goal is first of all to get a winning record stord hasnt had one in three years okay and then you want me to take over at that point yeah yeah or you give me more than that or you just no Im going to talk for a little bit hey we got theres Kyle Smith first game in charge hes been all around the bar hes lived in Marin San Francisco orenda mention the fact I love the uh the winning record and then Im going to say you need always have you know realistic expectations but listen wherever hes wi hes been a winner last year at Washington State he had 25 wins went to the second round of the nc2a tournament yeah first ranking in NCA tournament since 2008 when Tony Bennett who just retired was in charge okay ch Music well thanks for joining us on acc Network extra it is a Monday mattina at Maples KY Smith his first game in charge its the fourth time hes had a first game in charge he was at Columbia USF latest stop was Washington State the Pack 12 coach of the year last year Kyle Smith hes lived All Around The Bay Area he was an assistant 10 years at St Marys hes lived in San Francisco Marin Moraga Lafayette arinda and when I talked to him before the this game about any goals for this year he said the first thing is we got to have a winning record Stanford has not had a winning record in three seasons yeah you want to give your team realistic expectations and we know his pedigree as well 25 wins last season went to the nc2a second round so he knows what hes doing as a coach hes been a winner wherever hes been so Stanford is in good hands in the 2025 season chisam Makar just came in hes a the transfer Junior from Harvard and Ryan agarwall who red shirted last year because of injury hes a big reedition for Stanford so far theyre making sure theyre feeding the big man hes getting a lot of real estate down on the painted area John Manny running the Baseline for Denver hes checked in for his first Collegian action hes a freshman from Los Angeles long twopointer smooth shot from Pedro Lopez San vente vente one of those returners started 15 out of 16 games last season 64 points per game look for him for his leadership as well he was a big player last year for Denver he went 17 and 17 its three consecutive years of improved wins under Jeff wbr Reno woohoo watch out what I love about that Tim he used the shot fake went to the rim I thought he was going to smash it again but it decided to show his finesse and kiss it off the window for the bucket whole game has been played within five points sternitzky three is just off he played for some Finnish national teams in the Youth Level Blakes calming presence that Stanford needs in the back court AAR was one of the best players in the ivy league 16 and a half five rebounds a game shots off to Renault heres Craig take with him when Renault was able to knock that shot down he will be a hard handle to play at three levels stern nitki of a little hesitation move and dare I say a Euro Step he was fouled by see a nice job of getting inside floated right over the front of the rim right now throw line just on the elbow for the foul his first foul St nitk from played for some Polish national teams long active player with great basketball IQ thats what Jeff rbr told me about him one of the interesting things to monitor if you are a Stanford fan this year is Kyle Smith he was telling me a story when he was growing up in El Paso he was reading Bill James in the historical baseball abstract and he remember specifically reading about Jose Cruz senior not Junior that long ago hitting 280 in the Astrodome and it contextualized that and since then he has been obs best with numbers see Stanford take more threes for sure this year sty makes both but Stanford tracks 51 different numbers and you said the main thing is quantifying winning plays something like boxing out he said 75 box out rate is very good 90 youre one of the best in the country but little things like that you might not hear about often or read about is what hes trying to quantify with the Stanford team hes gone to three places San Francisco Columbia Washington state that arent traditional powers and won a lot of games of those places Ager walls off Denver did a great job on that free throw to change the defense with a 221 press kind of slowed down Stanford got the one shot Now drain the shot clock down effective on the first time around Sebastian Akins his first action at the Collegian level off to The Far Side Manny whos from Beverly Hills High Music School fouls on the floor and that one is against chisar mandatory time out on the floor here at Maples Stanford up by one on acc Network extra Music rightn Music Music yeah that three has changed to a two okay theyre looking at it they dont know yet no he just told me oh he just told e e theyre going to switch it from a three to a two theres Jeff R Brun he spent a lot of time here on the farm five years in assistance under Jered has said nothing but great things to say about Stanford talking to him right before the game he said he missed being here he missed the 7 de and uh he has had quite a journey he was started out as an assistant at Cal back in 1986 he wasnt named a head coach until he went from Stanford to Denver at 61 years old aara swats it away and for Jeff wbr when he was talking about Denver he said everything I learned at Stanford in terms of the right fit High character plays academics those type of things are things I wanted to bring from Stanford to Denver and that his program with the pioneers is is pretty much uh really the blueprint is all about what he learned his 5 years here at Stanford yeah par did a great job Tim of coming over from the help side long arm of the law was able to deny it theyre going to call a push on akara there thats the second on Chisum grew up in Brockville New York St nitki got there and need to kind of push him in the back St nitki sold it St n is is real active as well moves well without the basketball teimo the first one back for stford number 42 Max hver Pioneers last year they went 17 and 17 they went 6 and 10 in the summit League they were the seven seed in the summit League they pick last this year but uh they got all the way to the final they have not been to the NCA tournament as a division one institution 1998 is when they reclassified from D1 to D1 I should say 13 years in the Sun Belt one in the whack and they joined the summit league in 2014 continue run one Run and Jump defense effective again the first timeout it a one shot now but what they doing Tim theyre doing a Run and Jump one two2 picking up the ball and theyre switching in as well so the pass would go to the other side here it is you see theres the trapped there and then see Craig hes going to the next available pass and at that point thats your 8second violation yeah they call it a 10second viation watching a little bit too much NBA lately huh doing the G league as well right so professional eight seconds eight in the pros 10 here in division one basketball Craig that was deflected away from him yeah Bruner was the leading score in the country last year and thats the big question I heard from those around the Denver program who will step into his shoes is the leader for the Pioneers DeAndre Craig double figures his last four games he was on fire in the summit League tournaments deflected out of Play No agarwall saves it great team defense healer into the corner Stanford a lot of movement theyll take a lot of Threes so far seven of their 16 attempts from Beyond The Arc cam down the lane and its deflected out of play last off of Stanford what they missed raino on that screen roll the middle of the screen he had it you see raino was the last person get his hands on it knock it out of bounds on neither teams hit a field goal for about three minutes now and you can expect that usually the first game out to get your nerves like you said its going to be somewhat disjointed right Applause now loose ball ends up with Anthony Batson Jr hes a freshman from Scottdale Arizona this is his first Collegian action Renault couldnt knock down the three definitely taking a lot of Threes he has the green light as you said in this offense Craig swings it out out Lopez San vente for three couldnt get it to go Carr offensive rebound blocked by Renault and then Carr fell to the ground look like he might have traveled Stanford second block with Craig again right man right spot average six points a game last year currently at eight leading all scores Craig picked up where he left off now for Denver its kind of about who is going to step up into the that main roll keer side step threes in then hes got nine his career high is 14 all three from behind the ark mentioned earlier 36 last season coming with a lot of confidence so far as a valedictorian at Rolling Hills prep a year as a walkon earned a scholarship his second year at Stanford shano fouled on his way up a nice job to getting inside the teeth of the defense come with a jump stop with the foul I love the jump stop right into the middle of the Defense Force defense to clap right here this see giler again setting it up taking the screen says you know what youre not going to guard me Im going to knock it down from distance thats something with the former Collegian head coach Wen Wallace they went under the screen and giler was able to just knock down a three its definitely something that you look at a scouting report and you say this is the one guy you cant go under the screen 30 6 so far three for three so Im sure they theyre going to trap the screen to get it out of his hands would definitely have to go over the top or may hedge High to redirect him but if you give him a plain look like that he will knock it down thats Alise T 611 freshman from Roseville kind of a Hidden Gem thats whats KY Smith said about him hes in for the first time in his Collegian career three star recruit excellent length and size and Smith referred to him as Maxines understudy for this year Stanford has very high hopes around té three right wing for agar walls off that three was from the hash mark as well thats Steph Curry range long so far so good Denver has to be pleased right now with a onepoint lead with 856 remaining in the first half Lopez San V ente to inbound it to Craig up as San vente he had three gamewinning shots last year including one in the summit tournament Denver as I mentioned they were picked last in the summit League running the floor all the way down Aiden camon thats the third live ball turnover Stanford has been able to create they two for three so far and thats Aidens first Collegian bucket he red shirted last year chano into Junior College mclenon Community College Waco Texas I always love looking up the the alumni Vinnie the microwave Johnson went to that Junior College and he turns it over to geler giving up some size Benny is straight to the hoop he knocks into one of our cameramen and he was looking for a call hes not going to get one Craig did a great job as he was able to recover it and what he did Tim he it off of giler while he was on the ground so heres giler with the steel they trapped the ball here is the play here thought he should have got foul but watch Craig right here what he does he throws it right off of geler at that point guess what Denver has it nice heads up play first time weve seen a little bit of fullcourt pressure from Stanford Kyle Smith we mentioned the 25 wins last year who was the Pack 12 Coach of the Year won an NCAA game in Washington state put that into context Washington state had not one an NCA game since 2008 it was just the fourth time ever that they finished a year rank in the back court Blake steals it away extra pass sers goes up and flushes it Blakes did a great job of the on ball defense shared the will made the pass for the flush talking about Kyle Smith at Washington State it was their most conference wins in 41 years last time they W an NCAA tournament game Tony Bennett the national championship winning coach at Virginia was the head coach in the in the Poo Ben Bowen a nice Cut and he lays it in fourthe Jr his dad an assistant with the Denver Nuggets grew up around the game coach wbr telling him a very high basketball Applause IQ double team down low sers attack pulls up gets the shooters roll I love how sellers took that contact I love how the officials are allowing the players to play through the contact as well to what Blakes is doing a great job on the on ball defense creating Havoc the front stellers Five Points a game last year for USC its from Hayward he was really happy that should have been a double dribble Stanford bench thought so a little bit the is very happy to be home grew up in Hayward went to the Southern California Academy for high school and gets his first bucket at Stanford in style sellers able to complete the hustle play from jayen Blakes Cardinal up by three Music all right this afternoon were going to have a little bit of stord and right here I got that now listen up shes going to have a previous question popping up here on the screen in just a second and shes a to get the right answer shes going home with this only here stand tshirt so lets see the question up on the board how many points did ma bre no average last season Vanessa what at a 155 B 178 or C 212 and helpout A or C thats take a what do you think then do you know coming out for I hear some a shes thinking a she said a Vanessa is it a congratulations Vanessa it is a and you are going home only Ma Che in number Zan well introducing you a little bit to the Denver Pioneers they lost the summit League final last year they lost their leading score the ncaas leading score Tommy Bruner but they had a very successful year most since the 12 13 season for Jeff wbr and Company he took over a program that won two games went to 11 15 and now 17 and uh both these coaches had very specific goals I like to ask coaches before the year what are your goals normally its just improve every day for Jeff wbr its make it to the NCA tournament weve never been there as division one school as Blakes will get to the line and for for Kyle Smith it was Stanford to have a winning record yeah you see Blakes here yeah Tim you see Blakes here its downhill Stanford did a great job they anticipated the press it was having trouble with it earlier Blakes just took it as a a press break or onean press was able to get to the rim Stanfords going to lean on the experience Jaylen Blakes played 84 games at Duke Stanford going to play the Blue Devils at Cameron Indoor 20 ACC games for Stanford play every team in the league once and then SMU Wake Forest and Cal theyll play twice December 7th at Cals the ACC opener Stanford theyll go down to to Palm Springs for a game a neutral sight game theyll play at Santa CLA Oregon and San Jose but in terms of the nonconference schedule its all in California and other than that Palm Springs trip it will be all in the Bay Area so not much travel for Stanford as KY Smith trying to put in his systems tell with Denver theyre hurting themselves with 10 turnovers here in the first half only trailing by five hin is Applause blocked Stanford already four blocks Blakes nice move off the pick and roll got blocked hyon into the lane left it off renoa Stripped Away Inver pinch wanted to travel there plenty time left Tim just run some offense here Batson Jr shot is off REO an offensive rebound and he was fouled Stanford is doing a great job on the glass 158 thats their fifth offensive rebound Im sorry thats yeah thats their fifth offensive rebound so far Isaiah out anchor called for the foul his first both teams still far away from the bonus Carr with the steel off the pass from Batson I love that seeing that defensively outside hand technique by Carr hes able to get his hands on it get the turnover John Manny freshman his first action Renault picks up the rebound off the Miss from chano Stanford has been stingy with the basketball only two turnovers nice hesitation move from Blakes looking for a cutter and nice little hook shots from Cayman Cayman did a great job of getting to that area right in the middle of the the key there was no one there moving without the basketball largest lead for Stanford at seven r no no no no so C again see here him downhill but Cam said no no no camon pardon me with the block Stanford has four Music blocks lope so Stanford vertical spacers down low is definitely making it difficult getting inside the lanes Craig double pump fake short nice defense from sers biggest lead of the game for Stanford is seven I love when your guards can get the rebound as well get active Reno face up 17 footer short but he gets another offensive rebounds fifth rebound of the game camon wide open three short Reno put it in but its going to go the other way oh the bucket does count Denver was reacting as if it was a foul against Stanford and what a put back from Renault see the offensive rebound here Reno was able to guide it right off the glass opportunity for a threepoint play we talked about it last year he was a leading score most improved player in the Pack 12 seam 86 rebounds a block and assist in there and a steal for good measure number five a 15 12 9 and 12 rebounds two assists last year the only players returning with those averages Maxim and Hunter Dickinson one of the best players in the country goes to Kansas Im sure when hes able to line up the three ball as well hes 0 for three its going to be added to his game as well as I mentioned earlier be able to play at four levels you always have to include the free throw line as well 36 from Beyond The Arc for Reno who grew up playing with Victor reama played against him long Rudy go bear during the summer with the French national team its a nice job by Cayman to get around that entry pass then he comes right back with a moving screen offensive foul on Stanfords number 52 aen cam camon called for his first Stanford on a 132 run ball AED to Denver what you think yeah you see there know he needed to set kind of ran into the man easy call for the official camon and over Massachusetts didnt play last year but Stanford is very happy to have him Manny shot his off joh Manny he went to Beverly Hills High School and the alumni list for Beverly Hills High School it reads like an aist movie heres aara playing with two fouls and agall by its a nice finish again layups putbacks and free throws those are metrics that you can measure can score against as well withing your analytics theyre doing a great job were speaking of spamf well Stanford is on a 152 run and they have opened up their biggest lead of the game at 12 here on opening day in Maples becomes immediate Timeout on the floor it was called a 32 no Music man2 I Wasing at Georgia Tech 22 Myer student of you guys I done nothing in my 22e career to help student athletes and so I decided right and there because we felt that it would bees that theres sometimes hard is fores to understand we need to help our depart acag STL Val so Cardinal up by 12 four blocks early on for Stanford yeah you can see the length the vertical spacers down low four so far and theyre continuing to press the ball up as well so when you get inside again look car no not here tonight and then right here you can see getting inside weak side help no so four blocks theyre showing their vertical spacers theyre linked inside the trees are on the farm the trees are on the farm right yes thats what it is the trees are on the farm here this afternoon three blocks per game last year for Stanford that was 10th most in the in the Pack 12 thats been a point of emphasis ter of of improvement for the Music Cardinal and you couple the block shots Tim with the turnovers 11 turnovers for Denver shootting themselves in the foot although Craig is having outstanding game scoring he has five turnover Carr between the Rings Las cruus New Mexico seven footer trying to get down low on Renault thats not officially a block but he affected that shot and sers saves it so I think what Denver would need to do is bring their bigs out speaking of stamp and try to get downhill as theyre sitting in the painted area its easy ax for them to get the long levers up and just block those shots we talked about all the numbers that Kyle Smith will break down one of the easiest ones defensive rating how many points you score per 100 possessions and there is a direct a correlation between defensive rating and length and theres a foul and looks like okara will go to the line but you look at aara very impressive Junior yeah Power transfer coming in thats a flop 165 points a game in Harvard last season had a match up he liked called on the floor Stanford talking about length started caming at 610 REO its 71 geler from way downtown Benny is feeling it thats his fourth three of the first half with 12 points 10 toes behind the line lining up those like layups to him so far so good five plus minutes screwing drought for Denver Stanford on a 152 run thatll help nice job by deer getting his hands in digging down sers transition three on the way rattles in talking about Stanford will to push the tempo play from behind High the ark back to back threes Ziah sers a big time undergrad transfer again Stanford has three undergrad transfers this year they hadnt had one for 15 years since Andrew Zimmerman back in 2009 s shot 43 in his action for USC last year coming home to the Bay Area said he was so happy to be home one of his high school teammates Jaylen Thompson unavailable for the Cardinal tonight hes a East Bay native from Oakland Carr puts in a bucket for Denver his first of the game thats a nice step through by Applause Carr offensive F on talked about how what to play behind the AR as giler right there lining it up for his four3 ball and then they come right back in the corner as well lined it up 10 toes behind the line again yes got the friendly Rim at home sellers with the three with Dr Wen Wallace the former head coach in the Bay Area at the Collegian level had a bone to pick with coaches they every single coach I have ever heard hired says we want to push the ball we want to push the ball we want to play fast but G means it we weve seen a few of those transition threes and those transition buckets for Stanford well you know one of the things that you have to look at Tim if you want to play fast one thing you have to be able to play defense fast as well because the ball is going to come right back at you but what theyre doing in the half court set theyre able to set the tone they have turnovers 11 turnovers so far they getting their hands on the basketball deflections steals live ball turnovers and has proved dividends this afternoon and nine steals for Stanford you said the key word live ball turnovers Auto anchor air balls a three Yeah Tim as a coach you rather have your players just throw the ball out of bounds because at least you have a chance to set your defense up lie ball turnovers are pretty much impossible to guard all the Stanford coaches and the players in there warming up wearing the vote shirts Eric reveno associate head coach a big reason why Stanford fans very happy to have Coach reveno back on the farm Reno couldnt get the put back fourth efforts off and Renault lets see jump ball call but go to Denver but you kind of hold your breath as a coach cuz that could have been the second on Max and you can see the length of Stanford hes able to get multiple opportunities at The Rim were not able to convert but you have to like coach Kyle Smith were up by 16 points in our first game here this afternoon turning the ball over as well in respect to Denver they getting out in transition knock it down threes as well je buun his son went to palal to high school across the street was on the bench as a ga in the national championship game for Purdue daughter has con to Stanford for some of her schooling as well loves it here in the Bay Area aens 15sec difference to with Stanford defensively is locking it down 172 running the last six minutes chano is blocked Away by sellers Stanford here needs to play for the last Applause shot Blakes is asking for it theyre going to isolate Reno the extra pass camon at the buzzer short but Stanford ends the first half on a 172 run and in 16 years their most conference wins in over 40 years and that last year with the coups and hes made his way down here back to the Bay Area he spent a lot of time here and I was talking to him this week he could be a great real estate agent hes lived in San Francisco Marin the East Bay now Palo Alto was telling about all his favorite spots in the bay Tim lets talk about the 11 teams that didnt give him a chance and two head coaches that had to work for that first job got a play Jeff wbr he didnt get his first head coaching do he was 61 years old started out as an assistant at Cal back in 1986 he had an interesting path as well he was outside of coaching for a few years when he started a family was a real estate agent got back into it as an assistant for nine years at UAB and then Stanford under Jared H and now is has his own program fourth year Denver theyre trying to get to the NCA tournament win the summit League that is their goal I love how Blakes was able to get over that screen nice job using the second side with a rebound Lopez San vente theyre expecting him to have a big season thats his second bucket of the day opening day in college basketball double header here on acc Network extra stellers ma Renault with a great job the pass the back door with a finish four assists for Renault that leads everybody dont normally hear that 71 player but Maxim is going to have the ball a lot coming with those double teams great vision Lopez San vente drives the Baseline and gets it to go sente we talked about it earlier his abil to put the ball on the floor here shot lift hard finish had the opportunity the oldfashioned three San vente 21 minutes the game last year 6 and a half points he had just 80 total points his first two years only made three starts his first two years chisar has played for Spain in fbe youth tournaments theres Chisum Music oara Chisum terms of averages last year 16 and a half the leading score on Stanford in terms of this roster he was at Harvard last year and hes definitely the Sixth Man the first man off the bench for Kyle Smith and hes done well so far in his first game here in the farm Lopez San fa santes off five for seven at the free throw line for Denver Stanfords three for three referee is kind of let him play in the first half we like that Carr making himself big and then drawing the foul against Blakes its a nice job by Carr playing with his hands straight up about the vertical spacer bles try to get downhill nice job car straight up no foul last time jayen Blakes played a a Collegiate game was in the Elite 8 played 12 minutes and that loss Duke losing to NC states and state made the final four last year they were a middle of the road maybe even lower half of the ACC team and that thats the new league that Stanford will go to extremely deep extremely competitive Blakes again showing his defense got a deflection turned over to a steel his on ball defense has been spot on not allowing Craig any opportunity to get downhill see the size Blakes have the strength long arms ability to defend Craig into the front Court Carr Lopez San vente using that pump fake again extra pass Rhythm three out of acras off last off of Stanford Blakes was trying to get out of the way thought that was off of Denver 14point lead for Stanford just two points so far in the second half what is Denver doing better defensively well first and foremost theyre theyre getting out theyre theyre contesting but one of the things theyre doing theyre not turning the ball over as much so if you going turn the ball over its easier to play Music defense chano step back long twoo shots down thats a great job of negotiating the ball screen was able to create space although people in the analytics world do not like that because it was inside the three I love it anytime you can score is positive gords leads gone from at 18 its dwindling down now 12 Im sure if Denver scores and Stanford doesnt it be a time on the floor coach Smith get the momentum back geler long twopoint shot off deflected last off of Denver but you say analytics World obviously weve spoken about KY Smiths called a nerd ball tracking 51 different stats but thats a shot you have to take just two seconds left in the shot clock as you saw in the Miss from geler so you dont want to take the long two but its better than shot clock violation yeah you want to get something attempt to the rim sers gets the rebound goes up hangs up in the air and hes fouled we talked about Stanfords ability on the boards ter of offensive rebounds thats their 11 see tracking the basketball another opportunity to score theres the foul sellers has a chance for two sells been active as well nine points very happy to be home six starts last year for Andy Enfield his final year at USC was 83 from the line very good shooter 43 from Deep played 14 minutes a game last season he will be playing a lot more this year for the Cardinal already up to 18 minutes today with 16 and a half left Cardinal get on the board down by up by 14 as you mentioned Stanford has five transfers on this team alone so they will be getting a lot of opportunity to score and play sellers is one a three undergrads seen Blakes and Cole cner is a grad transfer from Virginia Blakes in the open floor acrobatic got it in the foul so advancing the basketball Blakes was using some Hocus Pocus razmataz was able to finish mention Cole cner from Palo Alto went to meno school three time lacrosse AllAmerican and he will uh hope to get some minutes for Stanford this year Co cner one of the people that he

second three bow FS on the floor number you see here did a great job of keeping his chin up and S able to line it up and knock it down for a second three ball of the afternoon what a good number for Stanford 12 assists on 19 buckets thats outstanding theyre not turning the ball over theyre getting good action to the rim as well as a coach anything you ask your team is give you a chance to score 44 from the field 35 from Deep for Stanford theyve held Denver to under 40 shooting from the field and 20 from Deep nice turn around geler just short G was able to take the Music contact sternitzky second effort he was fou on his way up bisy the Freshman got away with a travel a suitcase violation they didnt call on the floor Tim got away with that one now he be shooting free throws right here right when he got I thought he shuffled those puffies just a tad didnt see it that way now he has a chance for two free throws wasnt until last year in college basketball you could wear that number number nine used to be not allowed first free throw rims out NCA is catching up number Z talked about Stanford schedule earlier for Denver this is the only Power four game theyll play theyll fly home after this one three non division one teams this is their longest road trip theyll play Portland State and Portland on the road Denver has never won an away game opener as a division one scool their 0 and nine maybe their biggest basketball alumnist Royce ONeal of the Phoenix Suns whove gotten off to a good start in the NBA oh free throws missed so a good foul for Stanford that one was against cam second and foul called there against Shaban I tell you what Tim when you miss two free throws although it doesnt show up as a turnover it is a turnover because now you dont have an opportunity to score empty possession Batson Jr inbounds it the alltime leading score at Notre Dame Prep in the Phoenix area hailes from Scottdale Stanford is very excited about this fan new class Akin all the way up a did a great job of reading that pass and shooting the lane for a flush this is Batsons first game as a collegiance a lot of players making their Deb Hughes Blakes slipped and he stepped out of bounds he was forced out by John Manny whos making his Collegian debut 66 freshman from Los Angeles see your nice outside hand technique I love that style points as Music well just talking vny making his debut heres the debut for Jaylen Thompson for the season played five games last year he hailes from Oakland went to Southern California Academy by the way Evan Stinson is out with a lower bot injur injury inde definitely we got word just before the game and Donovan young dayto day with a lower body injury those are the two players that did not dress for Stanford a legal screen called Den number 24 Isaiah car first isah car is called for the foul didnt get sick I tell you what Blakes was raising his hands to the Gods saying you know that that that was a foul talking briefly about John Manny who picks up geler in the backward hes the highest recruit in modern D1 area era for Denver top 25 player went to Beverly Hills High School I mentioned they have an Alist alumni list Nick Cage Jam Lee Curtis carry fiser Angelina joliee Akin trying to put in a Hollywood play Lil Romeo Betty White Lenny Kravitz at Beverly Hills High School the alumni you would expect to go there second opportunity Akens again shooting the lane anticipating the pass first one as you recall he had the Open Court dunk now he has a chance for a couple of free throws as well aens with his energy first free throw is good so far the second half is even 122 thats all you can ask for coming out of halftime trying to win each of the four to five minutes for the timeouts to get this game down to 10 about five minutes remaining its the goal the objective for Denver seven points for aens from one of one Academy in Charlotte North Carolina full court pressure Cardinal break it they got a threeonone Reno fakes the three Lefty finish count it whats so special about that is that raino has been taking a three ball you say you know what I havent had that much success shot Li put it on the deck get to the rim lefthanded over the right shoulder layup that is impressive for a sevenfooter showing his athleticism his patience as well not selling for the three ball so I would do one better the oldfashioned way yeah 78 at the line which is a very good rate for a 71 player makes the free throw averaged about 169 and two started every game but Senior Day last year caral up by 18 nice back door cut and Manny lost it for a moment man on the ground R agrawal hes just one of four known division one players of Indian descent he was a top 100 recruit freshman year played 17 games had about 45 from Deep he only played five games last year and used a medical red shirt Manny was fouled on his way up Manny got him B intentions trying to get to the rim there theyre very H very excited about John Manny as I mentioned top 25 recruit in the state of California in Denver theyre saying their highest rated recruit they have gotten since they went division one back in 1998 its all about culture for Jeff wbr ultimate goals make the NCAA tournament they were pick last in in the summit league but theres a lot of different players they expect to step up and replace Tommy Bruner who scored 25 a game last year for them that led the division one what what is that like coach youve had teams where you lose your leading score maybe you lose your they lost their top three leading scores how do you adjust from year to year well when I was coaching back in the stone Ages was a little bit different and for the record he said that not me so now in todays era I think you have to just make sure that you have some sort of continuity if you will the players are coming in make sure the players fit your offense and your defensive philosophy as well because if not that could be a long season for you st nitzki gets the rebounds long three for Akin hes kind of feeling it in the second half couldnt get it to go Lakes to sers lest lead for Stanford 19 led by double digits this entire second half Jaylen thomps top 100 recruit when he side with Stanford third here on the farm hasnt played much because of injury pullup sellers off sternitzky passed to Ain and a blocking foul against Blakes I think aens tried to avoid Blakes and Blakes was hoping maybe to draw a charge or maybe get a travel full contact here at Maples Pavilion Cardinal up by 18 on opening day in division one oh do Cardinal up by 18 and a big reason the USC transfer OAS sers yes sers is playing at three levels showing his athleticism playing behind from behind the arc playing at The Rim as well as his midrange game as well a high flyer Im sure hes excited to be home I love this behind the yard the three ball again so great debut for him on the farm sure his parents are happy to see him play at home as well 16 points leads all scores for sellers Reno is 12 12 for geler Blakes for seven Denvers leading score is Craig who has eight he had six early remember and Stanfords done a very nice job against him Craigs turned it over six times aens makes the the front ends of the one and one so Denver is in the bonus the final 12 minutes of this game and you can credit that to Blakes I mean his full court defense on Craig has kind of neutralized him B with nine thats now the Denver leader Stanfords lead 16 its been in the 12 to to to 19 range the entire second half sell slowly up the floor against Craig think about this Denver team they do play very physical and aggressive defense manto man Cardinal couldnt pass out of the double team aens tries to go down swatted Away by sellers well dbo just jumped up with the ball and caught it and the for bench was screaming travel yeah they got away with one there sternitzky Rhythm three back iron Carr looked like he knocked over maybe Music flakes little disjointed stanza since the mandatory yeah well Rena renaults not in the game so we see how Stanford can play without the big man Cams down there too with him so the two starting bigs are out for Stanford brakes attacks the Bracken gets fouled Jaylen Blakes Somerset New Jersey played 84 games at Duke so theres the block by sers Tracked it down and here is Blakes had a clear Lane his opportunity for two free throws as well but sellers did not quit on it blocked it and kept it in play that was a heady drive there from Blakes thats Akens playing his first Collegian game against Blakes in his so the experience T out Thompson out know reenter for the Cardinal not weird seeing the AC logo here at Maples thats the new reality for Stanford 20 games theyll play in the ACC they were picked 17th of 18 the top 15 teams make the ACC tournament for Kyle Smith and company that is a goal for this team to make the ACC tournament I think Stanford you talk to people around this program they cover this program and they kind of feel like they could surprise some teams this year Blake sers goodness thank you so sellers again showing his athleticism blak with a nice job lefthanded pass sers had a straight line drive theres a turn over as well see here nice lefthanded has sellers for the dunk and a great little screen down low from Renault as well just that basketball IQ we talked about with Rena Rena is his fourth year blaks is a grad student s is a third year player theres some experience on this team its kind of an interesting blend cuz came and came and that is this his first game as a Collegian went to Brewster Academy there were 10 division one players at Brewster hails from and over Massachusetts so Renault was telling Cayman to shoot the basketball wide open versus Eternal Lopez San vente has been quiet in the second half after he was excellent in the first Stanfords defense ramped up aens loses it and looks like a bailout foul two seconds left defensively St outstanding a walls called for his second heales from Cel Texas hes played Just 22 games in two years at Stanford he was a top 100 recruit on some services and he is an excellent shooter one and one here for aens and then for the rest of this uh game Denver will be in the double bonus Akens makes that front end so Akens com Off the Bench brought some in electricity to the game intensity coach wand telling me he makes everyone better its a great culture fit Denver very much about their culture and getting the right people 500 last year Music Rena helps Blakes beat the 5sec call Akins a freshman going up against Blakes not intimidated whatsoever Catching Fire short Hammond three on two Lopez San vente all the way to the hoop Pedro Lopez San vente time out Stanford score Stanford 56 now Smith frustrated with his team has cut it to 15 923 remaining in the game opening day in division one Stanford trying to hold on for a win it as e thats e for e Ill look at our upcoming schedule Stanford will uh play the next four games at home we can catch all those games on acc Network extra that game against Santa Clara that is their only true Road game of the nonconference schedule Stanford will play Oregon a neutral site theyll play a game in Palm Springs but mostly home and all but one game in the Bay Area for Stanford who has a lot of miles that theyre going to rack up in the AC see this Applause Music year com to the knock conference schedule some from the former staff some was set up by Kyle Smith Reno for two Reno did a great job with the Euro Step Inside again shows his ability you have to honor him from the from behind the AR because he will pull the trigger so he get opportunity to get downhill 14 for Reno Lopez San vente the Fatal sente like dir nisy on that shot cal Smith interview with Steve croner the chronicle was saying Max Reno he thinks could be maybe a potential Dirk nitzki once he goes Pro s was very happy to get him back had a lot of options to see why but Maxine had some options in the portal he he could have played professionally but he it was very important for him to come to Stanford finish up his fourth year he has soft hands as well able to make those catches in space and traffic able to finish nice touch around the rim Craig had eight points in the first half thats his first bucket of the second half though returning leading scor speaking of learning leading scor sers has got 20 that leads everybody yes sellers is playing outstanding transfer from USC average five points per game clearly exceeded that on the floor Lopez San vente a nice little Fade Away on one end for Denver but Stanford reopens up this lead to 17 the leading scorer tonight osiah sers hes got 20 and the Cardinal in control at the under eight we e e e well a reminder later on today Kate pay will make her debut as the head coach of the Stanford women theyre saying come back here 7 oclock thats what Courtney Ogden Elena biscan and Harper Peterson are saying as well have the broadcast for you on acc Network extra Stanford and Le Moine as uh Kate pay the new head coach the First new head coach at Stanford womens basketball since 1985 you know its rare when you have two programs with two new head coaches debuting on the same day and thats what we have here its the first time in Stanford history that they have a new mens basketball head coach and a new womens basketball head coach the same day so far so good for Kyle Smith car Vander the former womens basketball head coach was in attendance earlier had to leave alltime leader and wins in NCAA history hakara the all Ivy player Bank shots good for Chism didnt play much in the first half because of foul trouble and that is his first bucket at Stanford that was great basketball IQ by R know because at first they posted him up then he dribbled out he switched out the post players and then he gave the entry pass in to okara and he was able to finish John Manny thats his first bucket as a Collegian dare I say looking Manny fresh tell what they have to like Akens I mean he plays hard The Freshman gave him energy as hes coming to the game healer lifs it off for sers you just see sers hes on 65 but he just levitates as he goes up and hes playing at three levels nice pass by Akens to Craig extra pass Lopez San vente triples off great ball movement again Akens creating getting inside defense has to honor him find the Applause Music shooter its the biggest lead for Stanford and 19 they have really controlled this game its about Midway through the first quarter first half I should say theyve had a big lead double digits the entire time aaro was going up there it looked like he was trying to yak and just break the rim you know at first when you look at the play we talk about the nice pass the pocket pass Rena aaro but again what happened in that situation was akar was posting up and rno was in the corner then he exited out and then rno drove in the defense have to honor him because he so much gravity towards him went right in the short nice little pass knock down the first free throw chm very familiar with Stanford his sister chida plays for the womens tennis te team a shout out to new head coach Frankie Brennan talk about Tara vaner and the three national championships she won Lily farud won a bunch of national championships for the womens tennis program that Chism sisters on well thankfully my life just flashed before my eyes out anra did not die for the ball because if he did and made any type of contact with me well Keen youre going to do this game and the next game by yourself well I was I was you see my hand was there Tim I was trying to save you there right out there how our anchor goes 672 200 so I dont know if your hand was going to do too much no offense coach Wallace Manny really talented players gives it away Blakes and one and he didnt like that and Blakes is asking for a flavor as well another one of those live ball turnovers again you see Blakes in the open court was able to finish yeah I think blaks problem watch this with the back hand the the trailing hand yeah he kind of pulls his arm yeah theyre going to look at that as I said that look like that could be a flagrant because he went for the ball but his left hand kind of pulled him as well well take a look at that that could easily be called a flagrant one you can see right here the transition in the left arm kind of grabbed him here kind of turned him yeah Connor Mooney one of the officials just came over and told us theyre going to look to upgrade it to me thats a flakron foul you cant have your second arm just grab the other guys arm and and Blakes you saw his reaction he was immediately very angry about that yeah he was not a happy camper on that even though he finished but then once someone goes up in there it is fair game you can try to block the shot but you cant grab their arm yeah you have to go for the ball though in that situation there his left arm grabbed Blakes he kind of Twisted him and he was able to finish the concentration level as well BS well for Blakes opportunity here Stanford again one of those live ball turnovers theyve been able to execute those throughout the afternoon so Im sure coach Smith will be pleased looking at some tape telling his guys Hey listen we was able to get out and transition throughout the game pay dividends yeah basketball replay they have the head official Bill Covington Jr and what theyll do is it was Tyler Sandman with him first theyll look at it and talk then theyll switch and Conor Mooney who was talking to us earlier will go in and look its just always kind of a weird process to me because you have the head referee will look with the two assistant referees theyll talk about it independently then theyll come together and make a decision I dont I just dont understand the mechanics of it sometimes yeah thats an interesting way of doing things but as long as they get the call right thats all you can ask for so decision has been made the bucket counts now theyre going to tell Jeff walbrun the decision and by the looks of his his conversation it looks like it will be upgraded so I think the bucket will count Blakes should get a shot and then Stanford would get the ball so now let say that Blakes will get the free throw and then copy so its going to be a flagrant foul on Manny two shot and Stanford will get the ball so I just seen Manny just saying I went for the ball but his left arm kind of hooked Blakes of Twisted them in the air so theyre going to protect lakes in that situation there 22o lead for Stanford first one is in for Blakes mentioned a few times he played 84 games at Duke and that experience is so key especially at the point guard position defensively and in Tim you know defensively hes been outstanding Craig started off hot and he was put the clamps on him and pretty much have not heard from him since well this is already a fourpoint possession Jord has a chance to upgrade a little bit more lak zakara Agarwal raino and sers thats the five for Stanford agall makes it a sixpoint possession for the Cardinal and way to spin it off the glass as well sord now a two three zone defense G Denver a different look why do you think they changed it up well this is something you can work on as well too because in practice working against your own guys you want to work against some some some guys that you havent seen before so this is a great opportunity to look at stuff get get it on tape as well you can have some teaching points jaos scored six here in the second half Joo transfer and nice back Cuts agarwall backto back buckets and Reno another assist hes got six hes got 16 10 and six yeah we talked about the top of telecast he average 159 hes already equaled that first game of the season 19 assists on 29 makes for the Cardinal Stanford ball movement and man movement been outstanding coupled that with turnovers as well live ball turnovers I was going to say about to say coach you the 10 unassisted buckets and probably four or five of them were just steals or or wide openen layups or dunks absolutely and those count as well to as assists in the bonus now heres Ryan agall get two free throws he hopes one and one that was the ninth team foul against Denver was against ad anra and he misses the front ends Stafford was on a roll of eight for eight last eight field goals made agar wall kind of landed on the back of Craig doesnt matter if he was in shooting in the in the active shooting or not because it is two free throws other either way that was the 10th team foul against the Cardinal and Ryans third Im sure its just one thing that coach Smith and his staff Target on in terms of fouls you want to be aggressive but you dont want to foul as well give the team other opportunity to score but again this is their first time out as a team playing against competition so theyll look at tape and from your Years coaching up in San Francisco at SF State what are you looking at after game number one well you want to make sure that all the things that you in terms of your your identity you know who are we what do we do and in this case here they say they want to shoot a lot of Threes they want to play active get live ball turnover so theyve been able to do that so you want to look at the things that is emphasis for you are we getting R not the ball yes they are but one person that they probably didnt and anticipate to have a big game is sellers so say okay we got another guy that can go with sers weve seen what G was able to do as well but sers kind of came out of nowhere and now we see him as a as a viable option to score stol away on Q sellers another dunp a career high 24 and Stanford is cruising probably a career high and dunks as well five turn nitzki knocks down a three another steal and jam and we were just talking about 19 assists on 30 buckets and I think five or six of those buckets nobody could get an assist it was a steal and a dunk aara with contact couldnt get the call again they double Reno hes just been so good passing it out the post Max teams got six assists Ager wall no but he was fouled free throw line as well 32 rebounds for Stanford hes been controlling the glass and they have been turning over Denver 20 turnovers the last one ends up with oiah sers getting up Cardinal up by Music 23 added 190 additional e e e I agree good yeah good call yeah yeah yeah didnt couldnt hear a lot to smile about for the Cardinal transfer oiah sers 247 rebounds and 32 minutes is debut on the farm Id say its gone pretty well and that might be it for him today a great article and oziah was just talking about how excited he was to be home come back to the Bay Area grw up and Hayward just across the Sano Hayward bridge and was fired up to be back here at Stanford Jaylen Thompson was a high school teammate Jaylen from Oakland but they both went to Southern California Academy and whos excited to play with Jaylen again thats Ryan Aral whos got eight points in about the last three minutes of play as is the debut for Kyle Smith jayen Blakes as well its his debut is the undercut car but for Kyle Smith we talked this this week and one of the the the points he wanted to make was he wants the right people on the bus he wants the right people in this program from coaches video coordinators assistants strength coach obviously the players as as a former head coach at the Collegian level Dr Wallace what does that mean to you the right people on the bus you know everyones wanting the same thing obviously you want to win games but you want to win it the right way right it may not be your night that night but you have to be equally as positive for your teammate doing thing helping your guys up off the floor always encouraging your players whether youre playing or not having one goal and and if you have those type of players especially with coming in as a coach you want to build that culture and the day is a great start for this season Carr missed both free throws R Reno another great pass upar in front of the Stamford bench couldnt get it to go or loses it out of play Stanford has taking 23 of their 61 attempts I tell you what Ryo does a great job of seeing the open man he understands where the double team is coming from and he gets the ball to his teammates right in the shooting pocket saw coach Smith there in the numbers we mentioned hes a big fan of Ken pal you know the advaned metrics hes been doing it kind of his whole life he was a kid in El Paso reading Bill James in the historical baseball abstrack aara hes a big time scorer at 16 a game in the ivy league for Harvard double digits 24 of 26 games last year for Chisum oara this is his Stanford debut and I love the out of bounds play and ran a little Flex action to get a power of the basketball they ran it the first time it wasnt able to score they came right back to it again REO was ready to throw that ball through stord make a couple substitutions stford signed nine players including five high school players and they have 10 newcomers Anthony Batson Jr we saw him a bit 63 Guard from Scottdale Jaylen Thompson thirdyear sophomore from Oakland 68210 and then again we mentioned on the first half a little bit Talis té Talis T pardon me hes a 611 freshman from Roseville from the Sacramento area and they are very very excited about Applause him rebound there for another one of the three undergrad transfers Aon sarin whos a UC UC Irvine transfer from Istanbul Turkey scored 10 points a game 43 from Deep for Darren thats Akens again you know Tim I was in Istanbul this summer you were yeah I went to istan turkey absolutely BS on the floor such an interesting mix I mean someone likeall whos about to shoot its his third year at Stanford but hes only played 22 games because of injuries well he has the length from just north of DFW Airport Cel Texas so many things can happen him when you get to College you could be a standout athlete and you get to the Collegian level then injuries can kind of derail your career and hopefully hell be able to stay healthy this this upcoming season I mentioned it brief L earlier but uh Donovan young dayto day with a lower body body injury Evan Stinson out indefinitely with a lower body injury those are the two players that did not suit up for Stanford and the final piece of the puzzle Cole cner 67 grad student from Virginia threetime AllAmerican in Lacrosse has gotten off the bench might see a substitution timeout here from Kyle Smith dein Carney for the first time Josh picket for Denver 531 seconds left and here is the basketball debut for Cole cner he averaged 17 points 10 rebounds at Menlo school just a little bit north on El Camino roale won the 2021 National Championship in mens lacrosse with the Virginia Cavaliers and he was a fourth round pick by the California Redwoods in the Premier Lacrosse League mentioned it earlier that Co C talked with Pat Spencer whos a twoway player for the Golden State Warriors who was an alltime lacrosse player at lyola and Mar Maryland then went to Northwestern and played a year of basketball kick it his Collegiate debut its his first points at the line from just outside Chicago tell what if Im Im if Im the coaching staff at Denver would do I take away and take away aens Cameron Grant knocked down a three red shirted last year and thats his first Collegiate bucket and you you talking about being on the same bus you can see the team was so excited for him knock it down at three as well and thats what you want to see everyone excited for each player on the team pick it knocks it down Cameron red shirted last year Dad Chris Grant familiar name he was the the general manager for the Cleveland Cavaliers the referee kind of walked down the court with a shot clock off and you our our mics picked it up no one get hurt and thats understanding you have so much seas and L we dont want to get hurt on the last seconds of a game thatll do it a win of the books for Kyle Smiths debut at Stanford 8562 and a big reason why the USC trans for osiah C
