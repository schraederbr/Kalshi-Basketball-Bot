28 points 811 from the floor and made four threes in that one they must do a better job virginia keeping him under wraps this afternoon leshevsky and notre dame ready for the rematch the fighting irish in blue uva wearing white our officials jeff anderson clarence armstrong and earl walton and after two weeks for match it up in south bend we are underway in charlottesville virginia won that matchup 6657 jhop left open for three and he makes notre dame pay to open the scoring take a look at the fighting irish starting five dejuan durham and nate lechesky combined for 47 points in that loss to virginia two weeks ago only ten points from all other players the five guards for mike brays team apprentice hub on the drive hop after making the opening basket getting it done on the defensive end as well another game the key matchup kihey clark we spoke with mike bray he said look it starts with him we must do a good job keeping him out of the paint Music you take a look at the uva starting five of that le chefsky matchup jay is something that tony bennett talked about when we spoke with him yesterday he said look we have to give him different looks he really scored at all three levels in that last outing that time starting off down low in the block sam hauser pull up pop hits it sam hauser at j huff the two scorers today for virginia showing early just how difficult they are to guard well he has just been balling out for virginia hauser last three games averaging a double double and if it wasnt for a huge game by jay huff against boston college wed be talking about his 17 and 10 that he has had he has become a very difficult matchup for opposing teams virginia the way theyre made up this year offensively theyre a whole lot better than they were a year ago cavaliers have already scored more than 70 six times in just nine games they only scored more than 70 twice all of last season jay hoff called for an early foul hell check out this is mack ryan the transfer from stanford inside to durham whos fouled about the points per game uva as you said came into this one averaging 72 points a game of the highest into tony bennett era and a big reason is sam hauser his ability to knock the ball down and be a really difficult matchup i think a big reason why they are such a different team this year tony bennett talked about last years team could really beat you with their defense they can be off offensively i think this teams makeup is much different from last year big reason why of the production and also the offensive output that sam hauser gives them a lot of people point to sam hauser and jay hoff but tony bennett mentioned to us rhys beekman the talented freshman point guard at kihei clark on the court at the same time they played 37 minutes together in the win against boston college thats given them a different dynamic as well and if you look at their national championship team they basically at times have three point guards at multiple times out on the court so he definitely likes adam minimum having two point guards out on the court deep three lechesky cant connect great defense by durham read the pass the whole way to intercept pull up pop durham and it rattles home notre dame an early lead thats the one person mike gray said look when we went through him on our offensive side against virginia we had a lot of success in that first outing look for them to give him a heavy dose of touches in this game to go gone with nate liszewski trey murphy the answer he buries a triple Music five seconds to shoot cormac ryan has to hurry and in his face and he misses it jay that is typical virginia defense right there shut you down force you into a difficult contested shot and then they clean it up on the defensive glass hauser working on lejewski fades away and hits it sam hauser showing off early he is just again such a difficult matchup obviously can stretch the d with his threepoint shooting but then that time felt he had a size advantage or a matchup advantage in the post beautiful fade away jumper goodwin does a nice job getting into the lane misses the finish though virginias shooting four of five to start the game hot hands in the opening five minutes clark into the lane this is where hes trouble Applause bakeman lost a drive commits the foul virginia up 106 early as were just getting started in charlottesville when we come back find out who tony bennett says some are calling virginias mvp despite only playing five minutes this season get the answer up that line its a long story but its worth it and it is because the sophomore chase coleman he has emerged as a key factor for this cavaliers team all from the bench and malcolm without fans the energy the boost that coleman gives this cavaliers team has been huge it absolutely is its a great story but also a very important storyline for all of these teams when we speak with these coaches and talk about the differences that theyre dealing with all the kovitz protocols no fans obviously is a big issue you have to bring your own energy in coleman is that energy guy for virginia okay pulls the trigger from three no good and tony bennett told us coleman wants to be a coach one day and the communication skills he already has is just a sophomore will certainly serve him well as he is well on his way leski fouled inside and without that crowd teams have to create your own energy particularly for this virginia team you know they pride themselves on defense and tony bennett told us their defense gets a boost from this home crowd at john paul jones arena crowd they dont have and yet they still have to bring that energy on the defensive end or they simply wont be as effective as they normally are yeah one of the great venues and again all of these teams dealing with that but early on right now virginia although they have the lead but they have four fouls committed now again theyre one of the better teams like notre dame playing defense without fouling on that last possession they decided to double team uh durham so thats going to be another story line and i think an adjustment that tony bennett made from that first game anytime durham catches the ball and the post theyre going to try to double him get it out of his hands the irish shooting just two of nine from the floor to start this game cormac ryan trying to get hot too much on it so lets bring in the softboard chase coleman its tough with the mask to see the communication and that energy but tony bennett says if you just watch him not the action you can learn a valuable lesson just how to be a good teammate off lost it in the post there you see coleman springing to life as clark dashes into the lane theres only one second on the shot clock here for virginia what do you try and do here malcolm if youre the cavaliers only have one on the timer well if youre notre dame you dont want to give up a lob i think some type of quick hitter for hauser right there and thats a pretty good out of bounds underneath dont think he got it off in time it said there was one second it seemed like there was point one second with how quickly that buzzer sounded theyre gonna review this one but i think hauser still had the ball in his hands here as the shot clock hit zeroes that was the right play though with the transfer for marquette hit it but an easy call for this great officiating crew to make jeff anderson clarence armstrong pearl walton are referees today and i like that they did not take a lot of time sometimes these reviews seem like they can take forever take one quick look and then they realize yes he didnt get it off in time lets play ball excellent work by this crew virginias defense has forced five straight missed shots from notre dame havent scored in the last four minutes the other thing on those misses jay you dont have any notre dame players really crashing the offensive glass this hauser leshevsky matchup is a marquee one certain official clothes play dead tony bennett trying to get an explanation on the sidelines trying to reset that shot clock to ten seconds you mentioned the hauser le chesky matchup hauser won the game when they met two weeks ago in south bend 6657 but it was leske who had a careerhigh 28 points and really got the better of hauser on the offensive end only two points for the junior nate so far today yeah and again we talked with tony bennett yesterday he said look we must do a better job on the chevsky in particular when he gets the ball in the post right here now right on cue great defense by hauser forces of miss by leski thats now six straight misses for this notre dame team they are starting ice cold murphy hes the sharpshooter has a make today but misses that one goodwin thought about the three dribbles in fading away and it finally drops first basket in five minutes for the irish thats a nice little reverse pivot and thats what youre gonna have to do against this virginia team they rarely give you dribble drive and then kickouts for open threes they play the gaps and typically make you make a contested shot great contested three there from jay hop thats his second triple Music hub with eight on the shot clock has a step and uses it for two trey words the transfer from santa clara notre dame right now opting to go to a 23 zone i like that change by notre dame see if you can force virginia to turn into a perimeter jump shooting great team see casey marcel into the game off the bench and he hits a three out of the covet protocol he practiced monday ready to go today and the sophomore hits the first shot he takes Music decides his luck that rims out leski pulls down the offensive board could win a deep three too much on it and huff tracks down the rebound keeps his pivot foot and keeps possession alive for the cavaliers im not sure how he didnt travel on that one thats great body control by huff off the defensive rebound midway through this first half largest lead of the game for virginia 6 hauser looking to add to it draws the foul and hell head to the line when we come back casey morsell out of the virginia guard to the job that they are able to do on opposing guards but look if notre dame wants to pull off the upset against this virginia team theyre going to need the others besides durham and lazzewski theyre going to have to get involved offensively in particular knocking down shots from the perimeter that must happen and thats something coach bray talked with us about yesterday look hot guys simple they got to make some shots against this tough virginia d sam hauser makes both from the foul line and checks out of the game prentiss hub still scoreless he can be the goto guy for notre dame with it now passes off doubleteam comes in on durham lets see how this notre dame team fares without leski is hes on the bench didnt fare too well there jay huff blocked it out of bounds yeah hes laughing about it now again in the boston college game jay he was able to block shots and retain possession i think he was just trying to send a little message on that one right there punch it into the stands and let them know its going to be a long night if youre trying to drive in on me the hub fearless drives it again durham the unconventional alleyoop hit some iron but did go down for juwan durham and thats how you want to attack if youre durham try to draw him and then dont shy away from the shot blocker jayhawk trying to answer with a three he already has two made triples today trey wurtz on the drive straight into hoff this time didnt get a piece of it but did enough to alter the shot five on four the other way for the cavaliers open man easy slam trey murphy the third that is all set up by kihei clark like a quarterback looked off the defender and knew where he was going the whole time a little nolook pass for a wide open dunk thats unbelievable court awareness and vision by kihei clark clark all over prenticehub forces a deep three from trey words comes up with nothing but air were gonna take a look at two dunks right here again draw puff and then durham im gonna give him a dunk for that although it didnt go down on the first were gonna give him a dunk then right here this is just a beautiful pass by kihei clark look off for the dunk you know it was a slow start to the season for kiehy clark but the last four games he has been outstanding for this virginia team itll stay with the cavaliers underneath coming up next two more matchups for you triple header on the acc network nc state and florida state coming up after austin then its number 16 louisville whos won four straight taking on wake forest a great night of hoops on the acc network hump day hoops happy hour hoops whatever you want to call it we got great hoops on the acc network hauser left open for three usually hits that didnt come up with a make there the key thing for notre dame thats a contested three youll live with that you just want to limit the open looks that you give the shooters of virginia durham thought to have his pocket picked and he did he committed the foul after he lost the ball and virginia comfortably up 20 to 12 a little bit midway oh and hes a guy that i believe jay is going to contend for acc player of the year you look at his numbers 13 points a game seven rebounds and i think he just provides a different dimension for this virginia offense with his ability to go inside and outside and hes on that midseason top 25 wooden watch for good reason here he is now its going to work on durham three seconds to shoot lets see if he recognizes it he does lets it fly as the buzzer sounds a scoop to the hoop for two jay in the last game he had 17 and 10 and it seemed like a quiet 1710 against boston college only because jay huff had such a huge game 18 points and he had five blocks in a dominant performance but make no mistake he is the guy that is going to continue to cross matchup problems for opposing teams where would notre dame be without juwan durham he has eight of the irishs 14 not too big of a surprise he had a seasonhigh 19 against virginia in their last meeting two weeks ago kick to the corner beekman misfires from three trying to get it inside again to durham couldnt come up with the handle tomorrow we got womens basketball another triple header it starts at four eastern with wake forest taking on notre dame after that its virginia tech in north carolina the nightcap boston college against number two louisville great triple header tomorrow womens basketball on acc network Music malcolm we talked about sam hauser and his great start on the offensive end but on the defensive end he shut down nate luchetsky who had just two points in this match if he had 28 a career high in the game two weeks ago but hausers bowed up on the defensive end and its led to a 10point lead for the cavaliers largest of the game so far hub trying to cut into it comes up empty and another possession for notre dame again nobody on the offensive glass no ball swings and thats something mike ray talked about he said look we have to move them defensively be patient on offense and not settle for the first shot that we see irish shooting oh for nine from three that is not the formula to beat this virginia team durham tries a three not his shot but it goes everything going for the big man juwan durham has come alive he has 13 of notre dames 16 and thats a better offensive possession for notre dame ball went down into the post back out and then dribble drive for an open three key clark pull up pop off the front rail and they actually only ruled that a two for durham so notre dame still owe for nine from three toes on the line for the big man Music cormac ryan steps into this one no good leski there for the tap in finish and thats all set up by the ball movement jay again ball went from left to right theyre double teaming durham every time he touches the ball virginia so hes doing a nice job passing out of the double team and then theyre getting some high percentage shots that time dolozhevsky on the offensive glass great ball rotation key clark got baseline kick out j huff and thats his third three inside to durham hes doing it all right now leshesky with it in trouble passes out of it goodwin a deep three and now notre dame oh for 10 from three Applause huff tries another why not jay hoff is on fire jay hes a guy that talked to nba execs wasnt able to go and test but you can see why hes on the mpa scouts radar largest lead of the game for virginia four threes for the seven footer the acc network this friday night you dont want to miss north carolina virginia tech our friday night duel beginning at 6 eastern time right here on acc network malcolm huckabee j alter with your virginia largest lead of the game theyve ballooned it to 12 in large part to jay huff he is four of six for three and virginia j has turned into a team thats really difficult to match up because of these two guys ability to knock down threes hauser and huff you put a smaller player on them theyll take them down low in the post you put a slower player on them they can step out on the threepoint line its just really difficult to match up with if hauser and huff shoot like theyve shot in this first half virginia shows you why they will win the acc this season well certainly i would not bet against them there are some other teams out there i think personnel wise that match up with them but certainly youre going to need bigs that are mobile to get out on the perimeter with those two guys if they shoot it like this in check for jay huff doesnt fall notre dame meanwhile you talk about threepoint shooting they have struggle started the game 0 for 10 trey wurtz came off the bench hit it three so now one for 11 fouled and will head to the line sam hauser and j hough outscoring notre dame just the two of them you have hauser with 11 and jayhoff with 12 all from three well jay we knew coming into this game that notre dame was going to have to shoot a high percentage from the threepoint line they came into this game leading the acc shooting 37 percent from the threepoint line and you know right now they have a goose egg from beyond the arc obviously that number is going to have to change if they want to get back into this game jawan durham checks back into the game hes been the whole team today four for four from the floor the rest of the team just five of 22 he cant beat this virginia team being one dimensional off driving on durham this time cant get the low post move to fall thats a nice job defensively by durham great move from casey marcel thats a bigtime move little upfake dont settle for the three and then pull up right into your jumper on the other side jay notre dame continues to be impatient on offense again against virginia but you cant let it fly after your first pass who puts it in a quiet first half for nate leschewski only six points coming up on our state farm halftime report packer and durham not too early to talks of acc bracketology will break down the first half here in charlottesville good luck with them figuring out the bracketology this year yeah all the canceled games teams playing without full rosters i do not envy them this year obviously every year is difficult but this year they are going to earn their money trying to figure out this field sam hauser now up to 13 points and he and jf have combined for 25 in his first half after that missed three from prentice up only 25 points for notre dame the first half dominated by virginia seven first half threepointers four of them coming from jayhawk second half about to begin in charlottesville notre dame starts with the ball in blue trailing by 12 malcolm huckabee general to with you malcolm what adjustments do the irish need to make here in the second half offensively they must be more patient they had many possessions in the first half no passes a quick shot that plays right into this virginia d they need more of this right here get the ball down low and the post off of some swings now they didnt get the bucket there but that was a better offensive possession to start the second half juwan durhams been the bright spot for notre dame he has about half of the irishs points in this one mike bray said yesterday we have to move them offensive foul there but offensively we have to move the virginia d with some swings and obviously you dont want to turn it over yeah thats claires day right there again you get that arm out there thats an easy call for the reps to make heres sam hauser working on durham gets durham in the move beautiful up and under from sam hauser leads to an easy layup easier said than done but you must stay down on hausers head fakes but again because he can shoot the ball so well if youre not there on the catch and have a hand up he has the ability to raise up over you durham blocked by jay hoff went to juwan durham to try and answer and huff there to deny him take another look at this move from hauser and its all set up by the head fake again he gives you that head fake and hes stepping through both he and huff have excellent footwork but what you have to do is try to stay down i like though the changeup by mike gray again go to that matchup zone and see if you can force some perimeter jumpers by virginia because youve had no success when theyve gotten it into the paint five seconds to shoot wide open kihei clark buries it Music well so much for that plan i think hell live with some threes and that time kehe clark now the problem for notre dame is if this matchup zone is there to produce perimeter shots virginias shooting eight of 16 from three 50 from deep for the cavaliers today well the one that they dont probably mind having shooting jumpers is kihei clark but if hes starting to knock him down you got some really big problems obviously hauser and huff you want to get out on them out of the zone but the others you might live with them shooting some threes heres prentice hub working on clark drives it right in backtoback baskets for prentiss hub after a scoreless first half Music inside beekman just fell off the front rim no good if notre dame wants to come back in this game i think it all starts with the junior apprentice hub encouraging to see him get back to back buckets you know absolutely again we talked about the numbers in that first game really struggled and now look youre going to have to make contested shots against virginia thats a tough floater but again if you play against virginia youre going to have to make some individual plays comes huff and also hauser you must identify on the printer jay hopps monster night continues just backing down leski and letting them have it inside but well head to the line for two Music well step aside when we come back nate liszeski has grown on and off the court well tell you what that last outing against virginia really they had no answer for him 28 points 47 from the threepoint line and he got to the freethrow line 10 times against the virginia team that really puts guys on the freethrow line so tonight not the same production but lets see if he can get going in this last 16 minutes because theyre going to need his production against this tight virginia d yeah mike bray told us yeah hes added strength but with that has come confidence and that added confidence has come with a huge point production gain hes averaging 10 more points per game jay huff rocks the rim plus a foul Music what has red shirt senior having a monster game malcolm well what hasnt he done in this game 71 this is a beautiful find by beekman and that is huge and the bench is loving it and you know jay back to the conversation we had with tony bennett when he was unable to really go and test the waters with nba teams he had some zoom conferences but he is a guy that definitely will be playing at the next level can shoot threes excellent defenders and i think his mobility and footwork is what makes him a candidate to be a very good player at the next level well look hes a seven footer who can shoot i think the big question mark for j off in his five years in charlottesville has been the consistency but he comes off a careerhigh 18 points five blocks over the weekend and follows it up a couple of days later hes already up to 16 points and we still have 15 minutes to go if he can show this consistency the rest of the way thatll make nba teams really interested hes coming off screens like a two guard its just not fair as a 71 player playing like that coming up next after us our acc network triple header continues with nc state and florida state followed by number 16 louisville taking on wake forest hump day hoops on the acc network three great conference matchups for you we were talking about jay huff he has come out of the game with his third foul see how long tony bennett decides to leave jay hoff on the bench hes the hot hand for the cavaliers in this game with a gamehigh 16 well jay the good news for notre dame is theyre only down 13 and it feels like theyre down more than 20 but theyre still within striking distance in this game great feed kihei clark and one inside francisco cafaro subs in for jay hop takes a great feed from kihei clark and has a chance to make it a threepoint play from the line well clark hasnt put up big numbers in terms of points but his ability to shut down opposing guards and then run the offense thats another beautiful dime and finish inside durham and thats over the richard senior set thats a missed opportunity right there again that ball needs to be let go earlier lob it so he can at least catch it and come down with it certainly durham was not expecting to have the ball come up that high turnover and missed opportunity for notre dame we told you that mike bray was telling us the importance of confidence with nate liszeskis game but you look at the confidence of this notre dame team in general youre oh and four in the league three and seven overall youre getting beat up right now against virginia how does this irish team dig themselves out of the confidence hole to try and finish strong in acc play well i dont mean to sound simplistic but bray im going to steal a line from him look we have to make shots i mean weve had some open looks he said in games we just have to knock those down then defensively they have to do a better job against the big two of virginia huff and hauser really had a field day in that first half ea clark hes been the facilitator today for virginia making things happen pulling the strings morsell kick out three he hits it this is a casey marcel that virginia fans will get excited about hes been terrific on the offense event tonight well for a guy that really not known or the numbers dont say that hes a good threepoint shooter this is a nice pass out of the double team and that looks pretty good right there and look at the bench bringing that energy certainly they are loving the passing out of the double team and jay youre right casey marcel a guy that came back to practice was in covet protocol and thats a great sign him knocking down a three certainly right now this is danger zone for notre dame they are in desperate need of a bucket largest lead of the game for virginia ryan cormack trying to cut into it comes up empty the irish shooting one for 15 from three and that ones not a bad look again its off of out of bounds and you know you look at notre dame they average nine threes made per game and you know right now jay theyre at one and thats a big discrepancy when youre on the road trying to pull off an upset against the 18th ranked virginia team wide open beekman at three he hits it again off the feed from key hey clark the ball movements been tremendous tonight for the cavaliers malcolm and its little things that may not show up in the box fort but thats all set up by experience by virginia their ronnie clock unlike on the other end with notre dame theyre running clock being patient probing the d and then theyre getting high percentage looks at the end of the shot clock six assists for kihei clarke two and a half weeks and covet protocol how good has he been tonight well hes shown the whole game that time a little midrange game off the one bounce pull up into your jumper hes showing off hes had some range it was an 1100 run for the cavaliers who have made six of their last eight shots tries another triple cant hit it two for 18 from three that is not the formula to beat virginia on the road and that was again not another bad look mike gray said look we want to try to play a little bit faster especially against virginia see if we can get some early offense before they can get their d set up but theyre just not knocking down shots heres sam hauser hes gotten the better of luchenski today dumps it off for caffaro and a shot clock violation brings us to immediate timeout virginia tonight you gotta say theyre still the favorites like they were in the preseason right yeah i mean a few weeks back we had this virginia team and you know tony bennett said look our defense isnt where we wanted to be he said this teams makeup is much different from last years obviously d key day braxton key they can beat you with their defense he said this team obviously offensively is much better but yeah i might have to disagree with him a little bit this teams pretty daggone good defensively as well too as of late and obviously j huff provides that rim protection and their guards do an amazing job in terms of putting pressure on the opposing backwards you see what virginia tech did against duke yesterday closing out that win at home it could be setting up for virginia and virginia tech being the top two teams in this conference and what a fun thing that would be for virginia sports fans to see those two rivals go punch for punch down the stretch in the acc well if youre notre dame right now again you have to obviously get some stops and then see if you can get out in transition before they can get that d set up but its more of the same kihei clark now getting into the paint like you did in that first game and it almost plays like a post player from the point guard position when hes in there able to hit floaters and little jump hooks much needed three for notre dame there to cut it to 18 nate liszeski delivers his first triple the game 10 minutes to play and what allows clark to be in the post like he is now is the comfort of knowing rhys beekman can control the ball at the top right and theyre also a very good freethrow shooting team as casey marcel continues to show off the offense that time another midrange jumper again not bad defense by notre dame thats just a tough pullup jumper morsel up to 12 again after missing two and a half weeks in covit protocol this might be his best offensive game ive seen a good body good athlete a guy that i think could potentially be one of the another great defender for virginia but this offensive output we havent seen this in a while from casey marcel and its been a complete game threes but the midrange game has been pretty impressive hes a perfect five for five from boston notre dame followed by virginia tech in north carolina and it rounds out with boston college taking on number two louisville all right here on the acc network malcolm huckabee j alter with your virginia up a comfortable 17 points how have they built the lead malcolm well its been a balanced performance in that first half hauser and huff really uh notre dame had no answer for them and then in the second half the offensive output by casey marcel really has extended this lead and on the flip side defensively you talked about the threepoint shooting in that first half for notre dame they really did a good job limiting them to any quality looks and notre dames got their work cut out for them almost eight minutes to go in this second half theyre gonna start hitting some threes and then get some stops and try to speed virginia up foul inside called against reese beakman we were talking with mike bray and a team on a threegame losing streak that actually started against this virginia team two weeks ago in virginia and we said what does this team need to do and he said its really on the junior class this is their team they need to step up and start closing out and winning these games and its true you look at the production and its on guys like nate leschewski dane goodwin core mack ryan apprentice hub if theyre going to start winning games it falls on these guys shoulders and they played a lot you know they kind of were thrown into the fire as freshmen but theyve got to start playing like the junior class they are yeah they need more of that right there theyre backcourt apprentice hub will head to the line play mike bray said they could have won all of those games but they failed to finish them down the stretch in a three and seven record is what you get to show for yeah and obviously a little deceiving as you take a look at the rank of those opponents uh right there michigan state ohio state so all top 25 teams and you know also you know the disruptions we talked with mike ray about this and look there have been a lot of games lost for them six total uh because of covid and again all these teams dealing with being in and out of rhythm but certainly i think along with a lot of other acc teams we talked with tony bennett about this he said look their record is very deceiving theyre a very good team this game right here though they really have struggled in particular in the first half shooting the ball from beyond the ark not out of it yet though notre dame battling on the road a 144 run trying to claw their way back in it with 7 30 to play easy bucket there from prentiss hub will help the comeback need to string together a couple of stops here three trey murphy drills the transfer for bryce brought him to shoot does just that and thats a breakdown by notre dame again murphy leads them with threepoint field goals made and again hes a guy you have to be there on the catch if youre notre dame great patience by virginia but make no mistakes thats a breakdown by notre dame you have to be there on the catch with trey murphy just as notre dame was on the edge of getting it to single digits trey murphy the third buries a big time three to give virginia some more breathing room thats now 11 threes for the cavaliers and six of the seven players for virginias play today has recorded a three you mentioned tony bennetts only played seven players today hes tightening that bend shortening that rotation giving kihei clark and rhys beekman more time on the court together sam hauser and jay half hoffmore time on the court together in the last four or five games thats worked out really well for him yeah it really has and particularly though clark hes a guy that most games youll see him playing 40 minutes and doesnt look like hes fatigued for a lot of times out and right there though was the first missed free throw for notre dame in the game inside to huff dump off beekman denied by the rim but fouled so the freshman will head to the line for two mentioned foul shooting malcolm virginias only attempted four foul shots on the game struggled to get to the free throw line and yet they lead by 14 yeah and thats an interesting snap for virginia even in their first matchup they only took eight free throws in that game four of eight fifty percent four of the game against notre dame a game that they won but youre right uh really kind of an odd stat where they dont get to the free throw line often Applause deep three cormac ryan buries it much needed three from the stanford transfer i mean the quick release on that beautiful set play nice down screen but the quick release you cannot have better footwear coming off a down screen right there clark on the drive great ball rotation sam hauser steps into a three cant connect buckets and notre dame can cut it to 10 from the freethrow line excellent back door cut thats how you loosen up that d he showed off the three so now clark has to step up and play him a little back door cut beautiful offensive execution two possessions in a row for notre dame now just like that its a 10point game plenty of time 5 40 to play notre dame not going down easy on the road huff trying to put an end to this notre dame spurt and he does great low post move from jay huff and hes up to 18 points i mean his footwork jay really is just off the charts i mean thats a 71 guy showing off the footwork and again just how do you match up with that when youre giving up so much size Applause ryan gaining a lot of confidence in this game this right here is a guy thats shown off the threepoint range thats about four or five pivots and then go up that time with the left hand and really theres not many holes in his game weve talked about his shot blocking ability he showed off his footwork coming off screens and then obviously he has the low post game to go along with it friday night eight eastern time bald men on campus is back you got jay bilas lafonzo ellis seth greenberg previewing the great slate of acc games on the weekend to come theyll have the latest news from around the conference friday at eight right here on the hcc network Music ryan gets it back to a 10point game needing a stop though with five minutes to well i play great resiliency by notre dame hanging around in this game and like i said earlier it felt like they were down 30 but theyre still within striking distance big defensive stand right here see if they can get this thing to single digits clark into the lane denied by durham tries to keep it alive and does off the foot of trey wertz itll be virginia ball and the shot clock resets to 20 inside beekman and thats a jump ball possession arrow stays with virginia if youre notre dame youve stopped virginia twice but you gotta close out this possession without allowing any points yeah absolutely good individual play that time by jogo coming up with the block and youre right they must finish off the possession marcel pull up pop too much on it his first miss today irish still have three timeouts trailing by 10 durham pokes it up on kufara had to step on him but gives it away great defense from the cavaliers double team comes on great ball rotation marcel contested three he hits it casey marcel an explosion offensively for virginia best offensive game of his career that time a deep contested three with the shot clock winding down 15 points for morsel shades of that mohegan sun performance against arizona state but virginia fans were thinking where is that offense been now he might be back after two and a half weeks off clarks off the window that could be a back breaker delivered by kihei clark and then reece beekman there to really pour it on jay another player although he does not have a huge stat line i feel like Applause cafaro for virginia has given them a big boost off the bench filling in for huff tony bennetts team you talk about what theyve done on the offensive end this year they have now scored more than 70 points seven times in just 10 games they did that only twice twice all of last season and its balanced again its not just one guy weve talked about clark weve talked about hauser and huff but if they can get this type of production from horcell again a guy that really not known for his threepoint shooting but he came in and there was no question when he let them go really he adds another offensive player for them to go along with their excellent defense as you said earlier today theyre a very scary team in the acc well thats the thing just because youve got improved offense doesnt mean you dont have that hallmark defense that you always get from a tony bennett coach team and for notre dame this is just more of the same against this virginia team under mike bray it was kind of shocked when i read mike bray is one in 10 against virginia you know a guy whos been there 21 years has developed this program and done great things for the fighting irish he even told us he knows it he goes for whatever reason just havent had success against virginia cant close out games and hes on the brink of going to one and 11 against the cavaliers in his career i think the bigger issue for them playing against virginia he mentioned this look we have to be more patient and in that first half there were a lot of possessions where not many ball swings quick shots early in the shot clock and then you have nobody crashing the offensive glass and really they dug themselves a pretty big hole and then when you play against virginia there very difficult team to come back against yeah they dug themselves a 24point hole theyve cut that deficit in half but really never got into single digits in the second half its a great take from quarterback ryan hes been a bright spot in the second half malcolm he really has and you know for all weve talked about as well as virginia blade and i think this game is pretty well in hand but its still only a 11 point game and with a stop here for notre dame they have a chance to cut this thing to single digits now again i think its probably a little bit too late but just a weird field feels like virginias top five more and obviously the score does not show that its that out of reach for notre dame clark doing his thing a big bucket plus the foul he pulls the strings for the cavaliers offense oh this is the sign of a true point guard and leader again first half we looked at his stats really seemed like he was quiet but he was setting guys up this time here again we need to seal this game thats two possessions now hes been able to get into the paint that time though again finishing with the left hand and thats just a big time finish by kihei clark 126 assists for kihei clark in the last five games the junior point guard has been outstanding a slow start to the season but he is really finding his form jason thought i was crazy when i picked him i wouldnt say crazy but maybe raise some eyebrows and i said look i have him as preseason acc player of the year and again there might be guys with bigger stats more points in that type deal but what he does for this virginia team defensively probably not a youre not going to find too many guys better on the ball defensively than kihei clark but i think when it comes winning time in understanding time and possession he does a nice job making the right decision at the end of games Music Applause and thatll do it for virginia trey murphy the third seals it with a slam 16 points for cormac ryan which led notre dame came in this second half the second half serves it came up short virginia wins it 80 to 68 balanced scoring from the cavaliers malcolm got the job done yeah five players in double digits for this one and a really dominant performance by virginia 12 for 24 from three for virginia great offensive effort and a 12 point win when we come back
