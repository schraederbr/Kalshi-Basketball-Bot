Both could play themselves into a double by down the stretch See Ilu and Sedan Fu and Fu wins the tip for Louisville Thrown off by Bert Smith alongside Matt Potter and Eric Lewis our officials for the Saturday afternoon game And almost a brilliant start for Louisville as Ryan Conwell found an open couldnt convert at the rip Quick three SMU gets on the board with Giron Pierre Jr coming off an ACC high 28 in their win over Florida State Saturday A quick fourpoint swing the miss dunk and then you let Boopy Miller get to the nail before you pick him up in transition Thats going to be a long day for Louisville because SMUs coming downhill Heres Conwell into Fu who got fouled BJ Edwards reached in there the senior guard for SMU Its really a fivepoint swing Uh Kevin and here is the Louisville starting five Its Adrien Woolly who started eight games in place of Brown with that back injury who starts today with Conwell Isaac McNeely the sixyear Javon Hanley and through Good luck McNeely out of a timeout He misses a three He has not been the same threepoint shooter this year SMU with Edwards He gets bumped and fouled by Conwell Very briefly we saw the SMU starting five as Pierre knock down that three Miller Edwards and Pierre all averaging between 14 and 19 and a half points per game Cory Washington and Cement Eagle are also in double figures Quick and athletic on the perimeter as SMU and they will challenge Louisvilles closeouts on every movement of the basketball You cannot be late on a closeout against SMU Theyll blow by you Pierre one of the pure scorers in all of college basketball with four to shoot Hadleys all over him Washington a three Thats a great sign for a struggling Cory Washington And SMU has the first two triples Woolly motors down the lane and Adrien Woolly has the first Louisville bucket A great attack off the bounce after the ball gets through the net Nobody stops the basketball for SMU and he gets all the way to the rim SMU 4 and3 in the league They played a very difficult schedule They have Louisville again after this game as Pierres miss is grabbed by Hadley The Cardinals are the last ranked team remaining on SMU schedule So pretty manageable for the Mustangs over the final month plus of ACC play And to Hadley got deep post position on Miller Was almost out of bounds Fu squeals it out to McNeely and Fu cannot track down the rebound Its Boopy Miller for SMU Its amazing how well Boopy Miller does on a switch Hanging hanging on in there in the post until he gets help Another three for Pierre too deep and tapped around to Conwell flying down the floor for Pat Kelseys Cardinal Swooie Louisville team that is top 15 in the nation Offensive efficiency second in the ACC Great look here Conwell rims it out And the Cards have started 0 for three from deep PIERRE ON A HARD CHARGING DRIVE Gets fouled by Willie and scores it An early five and maybe one more for Geron Pierre Jr team As I mentioned there are a lot of athlet there is ath athleticism on the perimeter for SMU and you cannot be late or they can blow right by you And in transition Jeron Pierre Jr handles the contact to get to the line Michael Brown has checked in for the first time after 243 Replaces Woolly cheering Pierre a 76 free throw shooter misses Opier who had 28 on Saturday has five of the first eight Brown sets up through swings it kicked McNeely for Conwell of a very fastm moving possession and its a Brown three thats cleaned up for a moment by SMU and then saved by Miller It was Washington who fell out of bounds and Boopy gets the possession for the Mustangs Edwards in the paint High pointed by the 65 freshman Brown Conwell driving Drive and kick Hadley for Brown Off the shot fake That balls deflected and grabbed by BJ Edwards the ACC Steels leader The more passes you make on one side of the floor the easier it is for the defense to get a deflection Just a really good job by BJ Edwards SMUs gone to the freshman Jaden Tombs underneath He makes a great catch and then loses the ball to Fr The big man runs the floor and delivers a dime to Hadley cheering I think Javon Hadley just makes plays like that for Pat Kelseys team It may not always show up on the stat sheet Just makes winning plays by running the floor hard ahead of the ball cheering Edwards drains a triple in front of the Louisville bench BJ Edwards has been redhot from deep of late Threestraight games of three made threes or more A young man who used to be frightened to shoot Terrible turnover by Brown SMU with an early edge Miller all alone SMU has gone four for five from three to start the game And Pat Kelsey takes a timeout A redhot that hes played in a JHawk uniform And Im giving Saunders a shout out cuz hes already won in that building Peterson starting to get a little healthier in their recent NBA mock trap Projected number one Dansa 2 Ali Khalifa hits a threepointer for Louisville which has started 0 for four from deep Khalifa is a pick and pop guy and you have to be at the level of the screen with him Otherwise hes just going to float to the perimeter and knock down triples Typically not much of a score Thats seven straight with a three for Khalifa And how about Washington Cory Washington only one of his last six in double figures Has two early threes tonight Roots is off the bench with Khalifa and Brown for Louisville along with Conwell and Woolly And another turnover Thats three for Mike Kell Brown Inside Edwards draws a foul against three Cardinal defenders Three turnovers in three minutes Off the branch off the bench for the freshman Brown Its Pat Kelsey whose teams you know typically handle these kind of games Four and N against ranked opponents Theyve struggled against the good teams on the schedule this year of late including getting pummeled to Duke Monday against unranked teams 37 and four Now Deb is not your ordinary unranked team at SMU They are receiving a few votes and Joel Lennardi has them as a projected seven seed right now Andy Enfield who recently won his 300th game on the other sideline Two really good coaches two guys that came up through it from small level basketball Andy Enfield allAmerican academic allAmerican as well at Johns Hopkins One of the best free throw shooters youre going to see in any gym in America anywhere He was telling me last night that a couple of days ago he got some shots up with his son Markham He made 131 in a row free throws Well he was 431 for 466 careers That sounds about right I said How many is the most youve ever made in a row He said Uh 941 941 Brown will get to the line with a bucket First points for Mikel Brown Jr That might help settle that freshman down right here He just does a nice job A little hesitation You cant help off the strong side corner The lane opens up Really good finish First two games back from a back injury that cost him eight games in six weeks Heres what Brown did Really good at home against Virginia Tech Duke absolutely locked him down on Monday What did you see very physical at the impact on the ball Very physical at the point of screens and thats the way you got to shade him up the floor so he cant use his vision Duke has incredible length that bothers most point guards Now some pressure Miller got out of it cheering Edwards across the timeline for Pierre Pierre might have gotten grabbed there got the ball back and then stepped out of bounds SMU which didnt turn it over in the first half on Saturday at Florida State has its first turnover today You know I I like the change though for Pat Kelsey coming out with some fullcourt pressure You got to stimulate your offense sometimes in other ways and you can do that through your defense You have to always find ways to change the rhythm of the game Cant play the same way Heres Khalifa who is one of the gifted passers in all of college basketball 7 foot 250 And another turnover leads to a slam for Edwards And all of Mike Browns turnovers are live ball turnovers which is have resulted in easy baskets on the other end That is his fourth turnover in four minutes Brown Kobe Rogers getting his first minutes off the bench And thats going to stay with Louisville off of Yiglou All four turnovers for Louisville come from Brown Roots and Khalifa Both experienced players go over to Brown and say Come on man Lets you know youre good Conwell got a clean look off a timeout and a foul underneath Sam Walters who just came into the game was in the action for SMU Foul is against Boopy Miller Not Walters Boopys first as McNeely replaces Conwell for Louisville Boopys saying Was I even close to that play But he picks up his third foul Bert Smith Matt Potter Eric Lewis our officiating crew Now now Eric Lewis is talking to Bert Smith about it Maybe try to figure out who the foul was actually on You can go to the monitor to see and make sure you got the right guy Yeah that that looks like that might be on roots Well as Miller with the push and then Walters had his feet in the play down below So thats what will be reviewed here Curt Smith and Matt Potter You cant go back and look at the previous contact You got to correct this foul at the monitor Youre allowed to do that The last foul was on and that has been changed to Walters So erase the foul for Miller goes to the junior Walters instead 2110 start for SMU These teams played last year on January 21st at SMU Louisville never trailed in that game Won 9873 So far today Louisville has not led Brown around the big man Yugatu McNeely from Khalifa on a good looks for Louisville Rogers crashed the glass and he draws a foul Thats definitely on four and two quick ones on Walters will send Rogers to the line Great crash from the weak side Kobe Rogers hurt last year Hes a 50 40 90 guy Hes been fantastic off the bench with great efficiency for Kelsey Thats a 16 to 17 at the Lions Rogers played a season low 2 minutes 22 seconds at Duke Monday Hes gone scoreless three of Louisvilles last six He goes one for two here Just his second free throw miss of the year The SMU lead 10 Mustangs seven for 12 from the field and five for seven from three Its been a persistent issue for Louisville the second worst threepoint defense in conference games in the ACC this year Opponents are shooting 37 against him Miller with a step back two I mean he called for the clear out oneonone Poopy Miller usually starts the game getting everybody involved As the ACC assist leader hes really good at recognizing guys up the floor Hes got great vision to advance that time he just calls his own number and wipes everybody to the other side of the floor Hes got two assists today already Henny Infield told us a couple of weeks ago that he said to Boopy There are no 511 point guards that average four assists in the NBA You better be an elite distributor and he has been this year nearly seven a game Hadley shakes free inside for two Really nice back door cut So thats two buckets for Hadley cheering without them running a play for him He runs ahead of the ball in transition and this one right here back door cheering cheering Miller Germaine ONeal Jr No for three Rebound McNeely Hadley against a freshman sixth year super senior gives it up to Rogers Great find by Rogers McNeely hits it His first three and a timeout SMU as Louisvilles gotten hot Six straight for the Cardinals looking to bounce back This was exactly what you would think it would be after a butt kicking It was two days of what he called a rock fight He said we had guys lo losing teeth out there said it was like football practice for two days and theyve had a longer break now with a big Monday game Well you dont want anybody to question your toughness and Pat Kelsey felt like people questioned his teams toughness cheering Willie has ripped it away from Egllo His teams on a 60 run right now as Louisville Hadley set up left it short Two for 10 from three to start the game for Louisville Now 53 of their shots are going to come from outside the arc So were just getting started Its the highest rate of threepoint attempts in division one Yigolu finds Boopy Miller Miller floats it home Hes got five with a couple of assists Really nice job A short roll against that middle ball screen action and then looking immediately to attack the rim Conwell 0 for three start McNeely is one for four Cardinals are not getting shots to fall from their guards Woolly penetrates off the rim for Yugatola Theres a difference between contested and uncontested shots and some of the shots that Louisville has taken have been contested So youre going to make a couple of those tough ones but the defense is trying to make it as hard on you as they can Off the Miller three First offensive rebound for SMU Its Eatu the 72 sophore with a beautiful finish over Fr Its real estate for 7 foot2 when you can get over that left shoulder and just drop it in the bucket Conwell created space Scrab Edwards and he got fouled by Woolly whos picked up his third Just reached in there and Adrien Willie is going to have to take the bench for the rest of the half Watch this middle ball screen short roll and then Boopy Miller attacking the rim Theres a lot of ways that you can put pressure on the rim You dont have to just have this 7 foot2 on the offensive glass on the weak side Points in the paint will be important as the game goes on You can cut to the basket You can go off the bounce You can make a penetrating post feed Theres a lot of ways you can attack the rim And theyre just looking for Yugu to finish better Two for five in each of his last two games Just six points a piece Washington just muscles his way into McNeely and SMU has fought back with a 60 run of its own Yeah theres going to be some matchups on the floor that theyre going to challenge off the bounce just like MueL Brown is going to challenge in transition Second bucket five points for the freshman Edwards Edwards takes it to Vigella Sububris off the bench A pretty fadeaway for BJ Edwards Gives him a team high nine Its just a smart play You go naked side twoman game You play in that until you get the switch that you want Zugris got entangled with an SMU player BJ Davis Ray with a foul You know Kevin I would say Boops been their best player but BJ Edwards lately has been so impressive He gets the switch in a twoman game on one side of the floor and then gets to the middle and attacks the rim in the paint Hes coming off his third ACC player of the week win this year Only guy with more is Cameron Boozer with four Zugris good feed to Hley Yeah Davis Rice got to drop down and tag that take that back door cut Thats a great job playing in the middle third by Louisville cheering into the freshman tombs trying to feed Washington like that Hadley does his job right there Thats an excellent job dropping down on the weak side Zubris handling Conwell hasnt been able to shake free much in the game He does here with the off hand and Ryan Conwell finally gets on the board Bird Smiths going to stop the game for a wet spot on the court 2922 as Conwell picks up his first basket for Louisville Turn the corner right here And Pierre stands up out of his defensive stance right He gets caught a little off balance off the screen and Conwell just needs a half a second to drive that to the hole All right Conwell five games of 20 plus points five plus made threes 307 career made threes two and a half per game Now weve got another towel here along the sideline I dont know if uh some folks spilled a drink but this guy is really putting in some elbow grease Feels like a good time for a promo Debbie Tomorrow noon Eastern ESPN right here Womens College game day at the Moody Center in Austin Big game today is Oklahoma Texas on ABC at 3 Eastern had a really good game before that here on ESPN Baylor and West Virginia Big 12 SEC double header on ESPN and ABC Weve been talking about freshman

of the year for Vic Schaer in Texas Should be fun Oklahoma just took down South Carolina a couple of weeks ago ranked second They try to get Texas number four tomorrow cheering Sugar will be called for the foul here And a deep duck in by Tombs SMUs execution right now Debbie 11 for 19 five for nine from three three turnovers What are they doing to create good shots Theyre sharing the ball Theyre not taking contested shots Theyre attacking closeouts and theyre getting easy buckets off their defense Theyve had a couple of breakaways off their steals First miss by Washington Heres Brown Feeds Conwell Another missed three Zubris with the offensive rebound Brown looking for Conwells way again A LEFTHANDED FIREBALL and Conwell couldnt connect to it Third chance on THE POSSESSION BROWN misses a three Still up for grabs And heres SMU with a threeon two Miller drives it Tough angle shot Wont go And Zubris has the ball in his hands leading the break Rogers Conwell again FINALLY BREAKS the ice off an 0 for six start from three We told YOU IT WOULD BE ENTERTAINING cheering applause cheering Jaden Tombs quiets the crowd You talk about great freshman This kid doesnt get enough pub in the ACC He has been fantastic Missed the first couple of months with a wrist injury Missed the first seven games and hes just starting to find his groove He is a great compliment to Egatu on the inside threepoint defense at 38 So on paper its a real strength versus weakness and it has played out that way in front of our eyes SMU has led the entire way since the first bucket No ties no lead changes Sixpoint advantage for the Mustangs looking for their fourth quad one win already Yugato goes to work against Khalifa Another good finish for Cement Yugato This is a little bully ball on the block right there by Igatou Just backtoback buckets over that left shoulder for him For Louisville Conwell and McNeely are two for 11 from three combined And a kick ball will knock the shot clock back up a second Louisville hasnt been better in the paint It couldnt be any worse than they were on Monday Theyre outscored 4210 at Duke 1410 Louisville today But theyve struggled from deep going three for 15 and they just turned it over for the sixth time They stepped out of bounds three times in the Duke game and they werent on you know footwork at the break of the threepoint line It was plays like that Thats a fifth turnover for Brown Yep Hes got five of the six again Missed a couple of days of practice because he was sick during the week He has just not found the rhythm of the game at all today Pierre on a drive Pierre lost it on the way up Well defended by Cany Roots Conwell three OH WHAT A FOLLOW Can Roots flying high He missed their last four with illness What a burst off the bench hes providing applause Edwards rolls around and gets stripped Roots ahead to Rogers cheering looking for an open shooter Khalifa will find an open DUNKER and Kennai has uprooted cheering the middle of the Mustang D cheering Miller for Yiguto isolated with Khalifa Illuo with A LITTLE FOREARM SHOVE AND A LEFTHANDED FINISH When he catches it that deep its really hard to bring a double Brown sets up Roots way short He is not a threepoint shooter Miller flies the other way Boopy on the little blowby draws a foul against Conwell Thats the second on Ryan Conwell and free throws for Boopy upcoming You watch Canai Roots trail the play right here Number nine a contested three by Conwell And then Roots sends it in He took that three cuz he got a little excited Im sure you give him a free pass on that have a little grace on that for the last two buckets that he scored You think Pat Kelsey will have a little grace I think a little grace on that Foul by the way charged to Khalifa not Cowell So one on Khalifa Can I 610 sophomore again was ill Missed the last four games Last played against Boston College Rated a careerhigh 11 rebounds two blocks Not a great shooter Seven for 39 from three but a high energy athlete Louisville missed his kind of presence in the paint in their last four Free throws are good for Miller Its typically automatic from the line 3729 ESMU lead on the road Khalifa is always a pop to the perimeter He does not roll to the basket Hes a tremendous passer and you see IU putting a lot of pressure on him as a passer on top of the floor First foulings against Geron Pierre So six fouls a piece Itll be bonus the rest of the way Roots That was a mistake Brian Conwell with as easy a look as hell have all year Beer and Edwards confused and not communicating on that right there This can happen SMU is prone to these defensive lapses here and there Walters Rebounded by Brown Eyes up for the freshman who came off the bench today His third game back from missing six weeks with a back issue Brown in the lane An air ball off of the foot of Roose And thatll send us to the 4minute timeout Game has swung a little back and forth SMU has never trailed for SMU are 13 for 20 And a lot of that is because Boopy manages the game so well for head coach Andy Enfield Only two bench points for SMU They have five starters who average double figures Zone by Louisville out of the timeout Edwards penetrates it and Edwards calmly lofts it in Hes the first Mustang into double figures with 11 Pretty amazing run here for PJ Edwards I mean hes been terrific and and hes really good on the defensive end as well He can blow up ball screens He doesnt get clipped by screening action Pierre hard foul against Roots Thatll put Kennai Roots at the line for a oneonone And its Pierres second foul as well as Eigatollo tries to curb him away from Eric Lewis Yeah thats called going through the screen Thats a foul He had time and space to get around that or go under He chose the most direct path Hes still talking to Eric Lewis about it Hes been upset about a couple of calls that have not gone his way What did Andy Enfield tell us before the game He he said that the temperament of his team He asked his players So let me handle the officials Ill take care of it screaming Andy was just the silent mediator in the middle of that conversation Pierre to the bench Germaine ONeal Jr Back in Roots a 70 free throw shooter gets both One possession to zone Louisville back to the man Another 221 fullcourt press here Walters from the corner No good Heres Isaac McNeely Hes got a runner to his right Knocked away cheering by ONeal but he had a Louisville player flying down the court with him Looked like that was Roots Was searching for another highlight but they couldnt connect I mean just really good defense Look at the recovery on this Germaine ONeal Jr what a play in transition allows SMU to set their defense Son of the sixtime NBA AllStar Hatley gets deep and rattles it in back off the bench Immediately scores Hes got eight I always think hes one of their most consistent effort guys every game You know exactly what youre going to get from cheering Javon Hadley There was an all undervalued ACC team nationally Javon Hadley will be on it Igatolo again Hes three for three Put the ball on the ground and still scored it That time they bring a dig to the block but thats because he caught it in the middle of the floor in front of the rim BROWN PULL UP BROWN HITS IT First three for the freshman applause Miller on the drive TOUGH FINISH BY Boopy Miller Some extra English to whirl it home When youre a smaller guard you got to know how to have creative finishes at the rim HADLEY INSIDE DENIED BY YIGATU This has been some highlevel stuff Louisville five for its last eight SMU six of its last eight Edwards wants it back from Igatou in the corner Rainbow three will not go Rebounds and Fu Final 100 seconds of a highflying first half as expected Fu knocked away too easy by Eigu Fu is late to get back and Edwards just steps his way to the basket 13 points for the surging BJ Edwards Hes impressive Pat Kelsey asked Mike Kell Brown to take a timeout Even easy in transition Edwards with 13 Miller with nine Brown with eight Well check out of the game for the final minute 21 SMU throwing a zone here on a for a possession Conwell top the key three Rogers again Thats his second offensive rebound and he hit the ground hard Toby Rogers is up to shoot two tonight at 8 Eastern 7 central ABC and the ESPN Ernie Kenny Charles Shack and the Inside the NBA crew are back and theyll be back after the game to break down Mavericks Rockets Cooper flag must see TV in his rookie year had 49 music on Thursday night but lost to his old teammate Khan Canipo who cracked 30 for the Hornets So great NBA theater tonight on ABC in Houston These two coaches are happy not to deal with Cooper Flag this year to the ACC final four or Kadipple or anybody on that Duke team Of course Duke is now 10 and0 in the league with a whole complement of stars including Cameron Boozer Big win for the Blue Devils today at Virginia Tech Undefeated on the road in ACC play cheering Fivepoint lead for SMU Final minute of the half Tombs just picked up the foul Edwards driving and all kinds of traffic Fortunate that that ball went off of a Louisville player Poopy Miller looks at Andy Enfield and says what play he wants to run and and coach says yes You know youre in sync with your head coach when you know which plays you want Not that play through cheering Theyre going to honor the 1986 national championship team at halftime here in Louisville in the retro unis starting to channel the spirit of 86 They almost took it away again Miller of course answers with another bucket And SMU has had an answer just about every time cheering Final seconds of the half The shot clock has been terminated Zone Woolly A Rogers big part Rogers on a step through Rolls it home What an electric first half If you like defense this is SMU shot 59 from the field Second best in a first half this season but has gone 0 for seven after five for six start from three Louisville despite a rough defensive first half got 26 points in the paint Remember on Monday they were outscored in the paint by Duke 4210 Geron Pierre Jr had five of the first eight and this his first bucket since Thats a tough two Louisville with Hadley and Brown picking up eight points in the first half Conwell seven Booat six A balanced effort by the Cardinals who got 22 points off the bench Michael Brown does start the second half after coming off the bench to begin the game And Javon Hadley after you saw a couple of his highlights will try to get to double figures at the line Foul is on Cory Washington his second I just always believe Hadley is going to play every possession hard Hes going to be consistent in his effort Hes like that in practice too Hell shoot two Sixyear senior Northeastern Indian Hills Community College two years at Colorado and second at Louisville Theyve had to face a level of adversity they really didnt face much last year Obviously a much tougher ACC And Hadley has stepped forward even more as a leader Now a fouryear starter in college and backtoback years at Louisville Well 27 wins last year for ACC coach of the year Pat Kelsey You get theres a double team Conwell came in to rip it away Conwell McNeely had a cold first half and he runs right into Conwell Double corner McNeely is a catch and shoot and they do a really good job of closing OUT HIS SPACE BROWN WITH A THREE his second cheering And the Cardinals have cut the deficit all the way to a single point cheering Were down as many as 12 and they can take their first lead cheering and applause Hadley Haley has to dribble it here Back for Hadley for three and a grab by Edwards cheering And then a foul Eric Lewis all the way near midcourt Well get it with Bird Smith here Igato doesnt seem happy about this There might have been an elbow in there cheering The crowd is taking a look Egotu and through right in the middle of your screen got tangled up cheering You could tell it was looks like theyre you know we havent had the hook and hold call in a long time Weve sort of removed that from the game Fouls called number 24 Thats his first Here you see with the left hand previous play is under review for the action under the basket Fu is holding on to him on the opposite side Its good to review this one So for a hook and hold youd have to see Yugulu grasping F If Fu is coming in and holding on to him that changes the calculus Plus possible elbow here at the end So theres an elbow to the middle of the back from Yigolu Hes trying to get away from the contact Now thats a play that looks a lot worse in slow motion to be fair but it could be considered an act unnecessary to the game Well because they put a whistle on it they can upgrade it Um they could upgrade it anyway if they didnt have a whistle on it but it would have to be an F1 So its called the first foul on Cement Yigu As fast as the first half was do you have a feeling this games going to go possession for possession here in the second It seems to have that kind of making Werent a ton of free throws in the first half either but weve already seen a couple of free throws from Hatley in the second half for Louisville Might see some more here Bur Smith Matt Potter and Eric Lewis will deliberate once more Remember SMU took a two nothing lead Louisville never tied it after that Louisville has not had the lead SMU led by as many as 12 Cardinals are on the verge of taking over the lead early in the second half And whatever happens SMU has Egull out of the game and Jaden Tombs in whether this is a flagrant or not And heres our answer Maybe not quite yet So Bert Smith hasnt gone to the microphone yet Matt Potter did just come over to talk to Debbie So Matt Potter is going to come back again All right here comes the mic from Bert Smith after review of the previous play We had a common foul on the floor That foul has been upgraded to a flagrant one foul for unnecessary contact Louisville number 13 will shoot two free throws and then Louisville will get the ball out of bounds under the basket with 20 seconds on the shot clock Well done Exactly what Matt Patterson Thats the delivery of the year from B laughter Smith Every detail of there was in there that you could possibly ask for So Sander Fu is at the line 63 shooter And for the first time since we started the game we have a tie score Andy Anfield doesnt like it Annie Infield you could see just touched his arm arguing that Fu was impeding You could Louisville does not have its first lead at this point but they do have the ball You think the right call I do think its the right call and I think its the right tenor at this time of the game cheering Ends up as Is third turnover SMUs turned it over 10 times Conwell gets it back from Hadley A couple of screens Step back Tombs closed out on him Now Brown with a crossover Brown driving kicking Hatley off the top of the backboard and out of play Really nice job though by MueL Brown to get into the paint and try to make a play for someone else applause and cheering Now some pressure on Miller and Edwards Navigated nicely by the Mustangs three and four in quad one SMU looking for another major major resume building win cheering Heres Pierre around and out Good rebound in traffic by McNeely He goes flying down the floor Conwell for three is short and McNeely taps it out to keep the ball alive Conwell has it applause and Eric Lewis has a whistle from behind the play and an SMU foul How about the backtoback plays by McNeely He has to add value besides being a catch and shoot Twohanded rebound at the rim and immediately advances them into their transition game Then gets an offensive tap back right I mean those are two really good plays by him Washingtons picked up two quick fouls in the half Eight straight games hes had three fouls or more Hadley trying to bury his way in Got double team Conwell on the drive CONWELL LEANS IN AND GETS SMOTHERED by Tombs Noles had a free throw and two field goals to try to take its first lead And theyre going to have the ball again potentially And it spills out to Brown for the steal SMU playing Butterfingers basketball BROWN CATCH AND SHOOT NO GOOD See if Poopy Miller can be a settler into Tombs Point blank look out of bounds off a knee to Louisville This game has run absolutely ragged to start the second half And you get and Khalifa respective bigs are going to come in Well I think Khalifa gives him a different change right I mean hes not a post up guy He changes the space on the floor Pulls Egatillo away from the rim and opens up the basket for Louisville off the bounce and for cuts Louisvilles missed its last five SMU hadnt scored in three minutes is deadly silent in here as the Cardinal fans hope to cheer their first lead This could be it Another miss three Are they ever going to take the lead Miller back to Boopy Miller has been fighting through his recovery from a really tough flu bomb as he gets held by Khalifa and Anfield told us before the game that Ruby Miller who missed the Duke game a couple of weekends ago with the flu had lost 8 lbs and hes put most of it back But the last three games only shooting 35 12 and 11 points way below his average So he is still trying to find his strength and his assist numbers down as well which means he may not be getting to the paint as much You know the physicality of of playing with his size Edwards on a tough step back Rebound bounces to Tombs Miller passes up a three and banks in a difficult two to put SMU back in front So Andy Enfield counters with two bigs on the floor to change the rhythm for his team And then Conwells pass ping pongs out of bounds Its called SMU ball Thats changed Itll be Louisville basketball after Poopy Miller gave SMU the advantage One seed from Cholanardi Louisville and SMU six and seven seeds in the current brackettology projections Thats eight ACC teams A season athlete at four Kai Roots with a bucket And once again Louisville has a chance to take its first lead Play Andy Enfield with the two bigs Comes out of the timeout and zone And you get the ball exactly where youre supposed to around that ACC logo And Roots makes a great finish at the rim with contact The game second tie and Roots barely hit the iron Louisville has had six field goals and two free throws all in the year with a chance to take the lead They missed all eight 51 apiece 15 and a half to play Great game between SMU and number 20 Louisville Miller motors and puts it in Hes got 15 Such a good midrange He drives right into that post up and Tombs just hangs on to the post up to create space How about the back shot Khalifa to McNeely McNeely is playing like a big today YOU GOT TO RUN HIM OFF THE threepoint line but you got to expect help on the weak side on that Youre supposed to force some back door off the threepoint line Miller scored on the last two trips Gets rid of it to Edwards here Can SMU assert a little physicality Edwards Thats a tough shot defended by McNeely Grab by Roots DOWN THE FLOOR ROGERS AND FINALLY LOUISVILLE IS ON TOP cheering cheering IU TURNS IT OVER for the fourth time cheering Willie Roots Rogers McNeely Yes Without Mike Kell Brown on the floor McNeely with a couple of baskets and Kobe Rogers in 10 and a half minutes has a plus 18 Louisville plus 18 in Rogers minutes seven points three offensive rebounds four cheering assists and now a double team And McNeely knocks it away This this lineup McNeely Rogers Woots in there Brown back on the floor now has flipped the game Its a great change by Pat Kelsey because they go with a trap over midcourt One pass away Everybody denies a great trap with high hands cheering Heres a three for Washington Back on the floor Rebound to Roots Miss the last four Hes been an invaluable presence today Khalifa a little too greedy Pierre off the steel pushes for Edwards SMU hadnt got an easy look pretty much all half Edwards might have traveled Yeah he did before the shot Its the 11th SMU turnover Got to pass it There were guys open around the perimeter Decision making late Kevin You know we usually talk about game slippage when we get to the end of the game but every possession in this one right now Louisville 15 points on the first 10 turnovers and Khalifa will get tied up Edwards crashed out Hell flip the possession arrow Thats where Edwards defensive IQ comes into play That was a smart play right there Khalifa turned his head Go try to tie him up Edwards set an SMU record last year with 83 steals Got 26 per game lead the ACC Khalifa Shot clock is down to five McNeely deep one Clay short and then two Louisville players are down including Kobe Rogers who grabbed his head Rogers and Roots And theres a foul on there in there on Boopy Miller as well right here with a shove against Rogers And then roots went flying over Rogers Five fouls in the half Composure on the road right now for SMU Got to make the next play Theyve been pretty well composed on the road They lost to Clemson by four Had a great second half And Duke they were in the Duke game the whole game in Cameron without Poopy Miller Miller off a steel SMU has had a brutal second half and they turn it over again off the hands of Washington SMU is completely out of sorts And you do what a leader does in Boopy Miller You go right to Cory Washington say my bad Okay lets settle down My my fault Keeps everybody in it SMU in the second half Six points seven turnovers Brown into Edwards Brown with a foul Washington came over to crash as well Itll be Edwards second foul and a blow by Brown who shows you his immense burst Hell shoot two Thats 65 Hes got the size advantage Once you get your hips and shoulders past your primary and no one slips in to help this is the right read 82 at the line Browns got a dozen points Sam Walters Germaine ONeal in for SMU Kevin thats what makes Brown difficult off the bounce when he gets to the paint because for a young player he does see the second and to the third level So the second level would be the immediate help Third level would be to the other side of the floor If you can read all that and the best point guards see all nine players Boopy Miller sees all nine One for two for Brown Largest lead for Louisville today Edwards Walters A little slow pass Couldnt catch and shoot cheering The Louisville crowd loves his second half defensive intensity Walters does shake free for three this time Thats a big three under duress late in the clock Only his fifth of the year And now hes guarding Brown Brown will not try to take him Pru trying to find McNeely Couldnt do so Heres Willie whos been the man and he travels Louisville turns it over for the 10th time And that takes us to the 12minute timeout Seven to three Louisville eight points off seven turnovers SMU has not scored a single point off a turnover Mustangs in the game and theyre normally a great ball handling team Six assists and 13 turnovers Louisville has put them under duress all half Running jump in the back court Another change So remember what Louisville dealt with getting that butt kick in that Duke as Pat Kelsey said and the toughness that theyve had to deal with in practice They have been highly competitive especially here in the second half Their defense has been really good He said the word rockf fight or the the words rock fight six times in a row this morning about 935 in the morning Yelled it out You could probably hear in the whole practice facility They have made it a rock fight in the second half Igolu puts it up and in When hes not turning it over hes been brilliant Great set by Andy Enfield You go to Igotu get him with two feet in the paint in front of the rim where its really hard to bring a double Fu from Brown It wedges between the rim and the glass SMU has the arrow Backto back plays by Igolu Id go right back to him Hes got the four turnovers but hes five for five from the field for 10 points A block and a steal as well You got to be ready for the run and jump here The Louisville fans are seeing the last play They wanted a foul and they will not get one Onepoint Louisville lead Edwards Miller got grabbed there Or did he Miller was grabbed by Brown but theres a foul on Yigato An offensive foul that negates the grab basketball and Anfield and cement Yigutolo cannot believe this call cheering Little trip of Brown there Maybe a wide screen Wow thats a tough one for SMU cheering Quick screen Next play Kevin Got to play the next play which SMU has had some struggles with at times this year And the next play is a wideopen Brown three SMUs had very little in transition Mustangs down by one and now another foul This is turning into a rock foul when you go small and SMU does a really good job with Egatu running the floor hard and he runs to his spot and once he gets there its real estate for him in Andy Enfield If you can push him up the lane or off the block and make him hesitate hes a hes going to roll every time Thats a lot for Conwell to deal with Its his second Edwards got a little bump by Fu Igato was there Miller grabbed it Illu gets it after the Miller miss and SMU reclaims the lead Seven straight for the Mustangs Brown again with a switch on Walters and Brown just buries him Really nice job of recognizing a mismatch Miller coast to coast EIGATOLA WITH A PUT BACK and a foul What a rebound cheering Big man rebounding out of this area Running hard to the rim What a play Andy Anfield said Id like you to finish a little better at the rim Hows seven for seven for you coach What a board McNeely for There is so much skill so much potential in this kid 72270 out of Istanbul Only a 55 foul shooter He missed it Hes got 14 Hes too shy of a season high And SMU leads by one midway through the second half They have answered the rock fight with a couple of boulders of their own Conwell rolling in Conwell with a threepoint opportunity Rockom Sakum robots in the paint right now What a take right here Its because look at the activity on the opposite side of the floor It allows Conwell to have a oneonone which he recognizes He attacks that top foot No help on the baseline and just squares up his shoulders to the backboard to score Well done Has it been a shot to go from three Hes one for 10 So he takes it into the paint When you have all that misdirection going on on the opposite side of the floor you take help away at the midline Louisville does not stand around and the ball is not sticking They are moving it A threepoint play for Carwell Double figures in every game but one this year 6462 Number 20 Louisville projected six seed SMU a projected seven as we roll toward February Not tournament locks but these are resume building wins And forget about that Just a win to make you feel good These teams have been up and down in league play Edwards missed a three Heres Hadley He could take Miller here Hell try to came over to help Conwell Khalifa looking for Hatley Tough pass over the top Its back to Khalifa FOR THREE HE GOT IT EXACTLY HOW PAT Kelsece drew up the possession Every minute of it cheering Just let the ball pingpong around until the big guy fires it in from three And more contact under the basket after the play And another foul on SMU Good scramble and hustle Broken play and Khalifa makes a play SMU has settled for too many jump shots here in the second half They have not been to the free throw line yet music They have not put pressure on the rim with the exception of a couple of passes to the block And then Sam Walters pushed Kenny Roots under the basket So Roots banks in the free throw front of a one and one Watch the right side of your screen with a push So the basket was good then a foul which is essentially a turnover and three points for Louisville if Roots takes it He took the first in the one and one and he hits the second Its a fivepoint possession Louisville had a 70 run SMU a 70 run cheering Louisville with an eight nothing run Washington catch and shoot Missed it And a foul Go against Conwell his third And thank goodness BYU and Kansas starting at 430 and not 400 Really nice job by SMU You handle the double you get it to the middle you get a threeon two on the backside and then you get a break That Kelsey craning his neck to see that replay on the jumbotron 6962 His Cardinals who trailed most of the game lead by seven Pierre whistle Louisville foul Khalifa with his third Im cons when the whistle blows Im concerned were going to start picking up fouls over here at the table The next foul puts SMU in the bonus They have knocked out any free throws in the second half How many easy looks have they gotten in the half Miller ice skating Well I think the multiple looks defensively have forced those kind of shots Are you kidding me I think theyll take that all day if youre Louisville That is uh the first threepoint attempt of the year for cementu Khalifa He can shoot it Hell give it to McNeely Heres Khalifa Thats good Soft touch smooth delivery largest lead Thats just his third twopoint basket in ACC play Hes a threepoint threat and an incredible facilitator on top of the floor and their changeability on defense that has affected the rhythm of SMUs defense They havent really been able to get anything going but they have not gotten to the free throw line except for one attempt and they got to get to the line and here in the second half Now by the way defense and toughness those have not always been the calling cards for Louisville this year As Washington gets a really good look from three and hits it Good at again Piece of the paint spray to the threepoint line Its just SMUs second threepointer since the 1455 mark of the first half McNeely a three off the back rim Hadley slaps it out to Conwell whos fouled by Edwards Thats the fourth foul on Edwards and it is a twoshot foul as well Well coming up our triple header kicks off in Lawrence where AJ Debata and Darren Peterson freshman phenoms are getting ready BYU and Kansas game day crew is there Dan Shman Jay Bellis company Kentucky and Arkansas Coach Cal host is music old school and then Auburn Tennessee after that Four good SEC teams Loaded night of college basketball on our ESPN networks and particularly here on ESPN You can see Darius Auff for Arkansas All kinds of tremendous freshman Theres one of them Mike Brown Jr whos just checked back in for Louisville Conwell goes two for two The Louisville lead is eight at the under seven minute mark Ball pressure in the second half has been so much better for Louisville Millers got to get it across and does Pierre SMU with seven assists 14 turnovers and a really tough shot Washington does stick it back up and in Hes got 13 BROWN LAPS IT FOR ROOT OH HE STICKS IT HOME off the back of the rim Great vision to the rim by Brown An unorthodox alley Roos with a dozen His most points since the second game of the year cheering Theres Edwards 13 in the first half Scoreless in the second Edwards was open didnt take it Somebodys got to Its Pierre off the rim from the logo Nobody crashing the glass for SMU cheering You got to expect a long rebound on a Chuck like that Brown deflates the possession a little STEPS BACK THREE OH HE STICKS IT cheering cheering applause cheering Pierre into Khalifa and fouled Louisville has absolutely rocked SMU offensively and defensively all half long The vision by Brown and the athleticism by Roots What a play And then Brown right here off the ball screen action Gets some separation cheering Little float like a butterfly sting like a bee for Mike Brown Free throw good from Pierre He he shook off that really tough first half Debbie no assists five turnovers and hes been in complete control Hes played in the second half More efficient with his minutes growing up on the floor as we watch him as a point guard for Pat Kelsey Obviously the skill level is undeniable but missed the eight games with a back injury Really rough game against Duke Money An important game for Mike El Brown Jr especially coming off the bench and hes delivered and coming off a 1 for13 performance against Duke and SMU will slow it down with some zone Brown McNeely slow this down Smart play by Brown McNeely catch and shoot in the slot Cant lose him in the zone Kevin Edwards still scoreless in the half Igato is fouled crashing the glass If youre going to play zone you have to know where McNeely is They play through the short corner Great pass by Brown Cory Washington late on a closeout Third three for McNeely who had not been playing well in the last three games has 11 points three rebounds today You know I thought it was that sequence where the twohanded rebound and then the deflection on the other end to keep possession A couple of plays where McNeely was adding value that wasnt just a catch and cheering shoot And Yatlo misses the front end of the one and one Feels like Louisville needed this They havent closed it out yet of course but the way they got punched in the face repeatedly on Monday Was the kind of game that required this sort of response especially the way they played in the second half Yes McNeely again bangs it home And once again Mike Brown is THE PERFECT WINGMAN Smart play cheering feed the hot hands Three triples in the second half for McNeely This is what Bubbles supposed to look like Miller Top shot goes for Boopy And SMU doesnt want to pick up fullcourt press yet You open up the floor to Brown and Conwell and I think you youre asking for trouble You got to get it in your quarter court D right here cheering Brown is fouled Flurries outside and he clearly started slowly with the five first half turnovers He did start the second half on the floor and he has wrestled control of the game along with Cany and Kobe Rogers and Isaac McNeely and some Louisville players you expect to take control of a game and maybe some players you dont and you look at the bench right now and Mike El Brown is coming off the bench today so thats part of it Its 44 to5 Debbie Louisville is plus 39 in bench points I mean thats a connected group And remember theyve had extra days with an off week after the Duke game on Monday And they pounded it in practice They were pounding the rock for sure They looked like a much tougher team You ask a team to respond after that theyve responded Miller with a three Offensive rebound Washington and it will stay with SMU Tonight over on ACC Network and the ESPN at our Nothing But Net Crew breaks down another full day of ACC mens basketball Nine games on the schedule today including Dukes win at Virginia Tech Blue Devils start 10 and0 in the league And a look ahead to the coming week which will feature Duke Carolina on Saturday Also in the ACC today NC State with a big road win by 18 at Wake Forest Virginia won by seven at BC North Carolina by 16 at Georgia Tech Clemson beat Pit So no surprises so far Stanford Florida State Notre Dame Syracuse are the six Eastern games tonight Cal Miami just underway Brown left it short SMU has two assists in this second half as Conwell broke up that pass cheering Extra pep in the step of Louisvilles defense in this second half Its just a great job by Pat Kelsey and this staff cheering to get his team ready to go And the multiple looks defensively that they gave SMU did make them hesitate some and forced them into jump shots Washington clang We were at the Cardinals practice facility at 9 in the morning A lot of teams before a two oclock game would take it very easy Not Louisville It was vocal The players were challenged It took a little while but Pat Kelseys players responded Ive watched Pat Kelsey transform teams at the College of Charleston And what they did last year was certainly exceeded any expectation Hadley was fouled by Higato Pat Kelsey won 31 games at the College of Charleston with two D2 players an NIA guy a junior college guy and an Australian That sounds like the setup for a joke Those guys walk into a bar And its funny music how quickly things changed around here because two years ago as Louisville fans well know this program was basically in the Mariana Trench I it was as bad as can be in college basketball last year They go 182 in the ACC make the ACC title game They get knocked out in the first round by Kraton But it was all roses and then a lot of resources a lot of NIL money put into this team in the off season Lot of recruits transfers big players and all of a sudden the expectations are final for Louisville fans have gotten frustrated with the last couple of weeks And theyve got blown out twice by Duke Theyve lost to Virginia Theres been all of a sudden a sense of frustration It seems kind of silly 2 years after the 12 and 52 but you understand why because the expectations here are raise another banner Well when you watch the way they celebrate the 86 team being here which they celebrated at halftime the national champions of 1986 you understand it And this is one game Nothings won or lost today but this is the kind of game they needed for quality wins How concerned are you about the depth Obviously they dont play the bench much How much do they need to in the final month plus I think you need seven or eight guys and I think they have that I think Walters has to come along Certainly think Jaden Tombs is doing his job and Mitchell Holmes is getting some late action here His second appearance Miller puts in a three Another 20point game for Boopy Miller His 10th of the year Its a quiet 20 though today Mhm Three turnovers four assists Hes played 37 minutes but he didnt get a ton from his teammates especially in this second half into the final minute We will go here at the Young Center Brown for three Rebounded by Mitchell Holmes Dont forget Kansas BYU coming up at the bottom of the hour Showcase of the day If you havent seen AJ Debonso or Darren Peterson play youre in for a treat Some really good players around those two as well Two of the Big 12s best But this game is going to belong to Louisville to get to five and four in the ACC and shake off that thumping at Duke on Monday Theyve held the highest scoring team in the ACC right around 30 points here in the second half Its a remarkable defensive effort by Pat Kelseys team Got to stick with the process in P in practice Kevin cheering and they did this week Brown whips it across the way to Roots and Roots into traffic Lost the ball but Kairoots had a wonderful game Miller will feed Washington who misses a late three into the hands of Kairoots That completes a double double 12 and 10 for Roots And the Louisville Cardinals storm match
