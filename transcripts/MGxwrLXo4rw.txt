there is Leonard Hamilton who recently won his 400th game officially its really 4 22 here at Florida State and just recently won his 600th career really 6 22 and hes got his team 5 and 12 three and three in League Play and since getting into league play Jay they have played better and they have played really well here at home theyre 30 in the tuck and Owen three on the road in conference play and this is a big part of it Jalen Worley now the point guard and they have been shooting the basketball Distributing the basketball much better in recent weeks piping about look how active UVA is look at their hands hands are down hands are poking hands are proud and feet are sliding the communication level was at a very high one and just park and test at The Rim thats what you want defensively to set a tone Cleveland Mish fires being guarded by Ben vanderplas who gets the start along with Gardner Franklin and then that back force uh Beekman and Clark say Florida State switched all the action defensively communication is critical here is Clark the Leagues leader in assists at six per game Gardner blocked at The Rim but fouled and he will do what he does go to the free throw line nobody in college basketball Jay has gone to the line more than this young man I like the patience right there by Clark it looked like he was going to give a heavy pull she chose not to do that and I think a lot of times players offensively they want to come out and establish the pace by Im going to take shots right threepoint shots oh get the ball to the rim a the rim challenge the other team to put you on the freethrow line see the ball go in first build that lather up offensively and I hope she create a certain Pace meeting well over the course of the last five years with Kihei Clark at the point I have never seen Jay a team not panic ever with the shot clock winding down 543 they still have two or three passes left in him with no Panic good look inside and Warren Gets the Seminoles on the board Applause and here is Beekman back pretty much to full strength they say certainly looked it Applause and the win over North Carolina last time out Applause and when the team switches all the time giving the ball down low bander floss around and out so when a team switches all time youre going to get the matchup that you want you just have to isolate that much up once you get the switch Caleb Mills hes got four early points a great Patience by corn thus far catches that first pass in the post doesnt make a kneejerk move actually raise the defender sees their space opens up into a really good hook and then a basket cut imagine that Kihei Clark with the lefthanded finish Applause foreign green he was out early this morning doing just that hes got a sweet stroke I mean look at your Beekman got caught kind of ball watching gotta understand that green is always moving without the ball and that is what he does well there are NBA Scouts in the building primarily to see Baba Miller of Florida State but he is not going to play because of tonsillitis today but theyre also keeping their eye on Reese Beekman for UVA do you see Beekman number two in blue as a potential NBA player Jay I think there is Talent there but Ill give you a different assessment by the time we get to the second half because I watching him in person is very different than watching him on TV first missed from Corin gets it back from Vander flowers three minutes in Vander Falls lets fly and hes got it what a worldclass Mustangs its on a different level you combine that with the threepoint ability upon us I mean thats what he does what a guy to have offensively that can space the floor Out steal number one of the afternoon for Clark Applause Armon Franklin to back triples for the whos Applause the intensity the hands and the IQ of Clark is tremendous I know people will always talk about what he needs to do offensively but he is just such a playmaker on the court hes the quarterback of this team a little thought about it drives over clark too hard off the window tracks it down to the corner Applause Mills again trying to take advantage of his size that time hes able to that always seems to be somewhat of the challenge of Florida State you know sometimes the office becomes a little bit stagnant and having a player that could put the ball down on the ground and create plays not only for himself but other teammates I think its really critical for them to find ways to score easy vanderplas stays hot 149 Virginia Applause heres that match up again from the left side Mills averaging over 13 points per game trying to go to work and does gets himself a good look everything but the Finish Clark off the bounce out of bounds Virginia will keep it when we come back yeah Virginia with a great start and it all starts on the defensive end for the hoos and look at kid Clark with a high basketball IQ play right there getting the steal and then once again getting into the lane being able to knock it down the outside working inside out and then Vander blast right here doing what he does that mustache this isnt the only thing that looks good so does that I get a chance to put things in the most simplistic form there is possible which is good for me exactly so lets talk about this because versus Wake Forest in the game that Florida State lost they give up nine threes in the first half 14 for the game off penetration and kicks losing your men defensively not communicating not seeing ban you man you ball right so you think about now so far in the first half for the whos they made threes they made three threes three or four so and once again another wide open look into a threepoint shot we talk about this is your young basketball team for Florida State I recognize that but you have to play with some energy and you have to be precise defensively with what the scattering report is and thats active hands and deterring vision to the bucket its like right even now look hands down wire hands down Florida State Wire hands down when youre pressuring you can pressure with your hands active poking prodding at least keeping the offense on their toes three speaking bottled up you know we saw the uh assist statistic coming out where all but one of Virginias made field goals have come on an assist in their game against Syracuse a couple of weeks ago they made 23 field goals 22 of them were assisted this is a connected Virginia team long two off the mark from a man whos played on a lot of basketball teams its rare that you find teams who are unselfish I think fans hear the word unselfish and they think that oh well our team seems unselfish but no the ball needs to move everybody needs to get a touch people need to cut hard people need to communicate all these are the little nuances that sometimes you dont see but you hear when you get a chance to sit on the court foul on the penetration by warley but were gonna go back to this one play on the inbound pass and this is what Im talking about just pay attention to the bottom right hand corner wheres the communication so nobody communicates wide open once again for the fourth three thus far in the first seven minutes of the game you know one thousand percent that Leonard Hamilton went crazy in the locker room after wake mate nine threes you think that would be a major point of emphasis for the Seminoles so far in the first half but it has not and with that shot Franklin picks up where he left off in the win over Carolina where he went for 12 points had a careerhigh nine rebounds theres one of the other weapons who has played so well in ACC play coming off the bench Isaac McNeely Shedrick has also come into the game knocks away that pass whos take it and will dribble up leading by eight so when you have a young team like this for Florida State when you have a lack of guys that can penetrate off the dribble dog its imperative that you create offense off your defense one of the things I told our stats guy today to track is pointing transition off defense because for Florida State the way you have to open up the floor is by actually creating turnovers and getting steals playing passing Lanes but when you get down like this youre not create it makes it challenging once again another the fifth three so far in the first eight minutes of the game and so coach Hamilton calls time out after the 2019 Mac freshman of the year at Ohio Ben vanderplas nailed his third three already in the early going here in Tallahassee I Was a Fool to let you allows you as a team to come together collectively and youre able to bring those experiences to the table the following year and I think thats where college basketball and this one and done ERA this era with overtime Elite with the G League they allow teams who are better in teams whove been together through the gauntlet through the trenches to actually flourish because when things get challenging they know where they can go to theres a trust Factor thats different than having a younger team or even a more talented team the dunk by nahim McLeod breaks the Virginia run whos with it up by nine Vander fluff probing right down the lane nobody picks him up and he finger rolls it in already 11 points for Vander plas and Doug Dustin Johnson we have McLeod in the game and thats going to be something that litter Hamilton is going to face as a coach each and every possession because youre going to try to switch everything with him but whoever he switches towards is going to be a mismatch on the perimeter not something you have to worry about when you have Cameron Fletcher when he got hurt before because he gave you that versatility defensively being 67 and can move so quick laterally thats a really tough shot Clevelands second shot attempt catches the front iron and Coach Hamilton was also lamenting the fact that Jalen Gainey the transfer from Brown University you know in September he suffered a knee injury thats costing him the year he was the other big piece who was going to be able to switch everything the way coach Hamilton always has done it Tom house no long rebound to Kihei Clark and the 510 grad student from Woodland Hills California will walk it up Applause thats the challenge right there like I dont think you should switch that action no and I know theyre going to naturally and thats a walk on keyway Park but those are things where there actually has to be a screen for you to hit you know to actually switch Timeout on the floor vanderplas playing like the veteran that he is 11 points already pretend whenever you play McLeod he brings shot blocking ability to the table he brings rebounding but there is somewhat of a liability with the defensive scheme that he also brings and Jay isnt that an NBA thing that has trickled down to college basketball looking to attack the weak link defensively I mean look the the NBA is very simple a lot of times its find the player that you can get in the right action and if they miscommunicate or if they dont actually execute whats on the scattering report they want to switch then you isolate that match up each and every time and if anything it creates dribble Drive situations where you force the defense to collapse and you have guys in a perimeter who are ready to shoot and thats what Virginias been doing so far in the first time and everybody out there wants to get to the league and a big part of the selling of UVA from coach Bennett and his staff to Ben vanderplas with Sam Hauser and how Sam developed and now hes in the league I mean look Charles Barkley was saying to people all the time do what you do do what you I mean Ben Watson great example of this song called thrown it down and those are the shots you win those are the shots that you win if youre Virginia two seconds on the shot clock taking a contested three you dont lean over you keep your hands vertical you get a contested shot Ben Wallace used to say this to me all the time we will run pick and roll in USA basketball practice and itll be wide opening and I would say shoot it and he would say thats not what I do if I give you two rebounds hustle rebounds per quarter Im gonna have eight rebounds if I give you four points per quarter Im gonna have 16 Im gonna have 16 to 8 Jay well 168 gives me paid 100 million dollars Im like I never thought about that way he said exactly keep it simple do what you do Cleveland to the corner for Darren Greene Applause you asked him this morning whats the the hardest thing in basketball for you whats the easiest thing and he said shooting is the easiest hes got a beautiful stroke although we didnt see at that time well we did see it when he beat me out of best of five contest he went for after five I went four for five I didnt want to bring that up but Im glad you did I mean I Im still salty about it frankly I mean you barely beat a couple of TV guys yesterday in a shoot around here now that really pisses me off that really makes me angry now I mean its one thing for green to beat me but now youre youre hitting below the belt but you won yesterday doesnt that make you feel better I did win yeah but you still The Narrative is floating out there but it was close I dont like clothes it shouldnt be close no it shouldnt should it be yeah you know this is a setup this is a setup see Clark finally able to get it in Gardners pass little awry Franklin able to get it back to Clark just over nine minutes remaining in the first half look at this so Kihei Clark is allowed to make a pass on a perimeter with nothing distracting tough shot by Armand Franklin theyre going to have to eventually for Florida State basketball pressure Im like well youre not pressuring me when your hands are down and I can see over the top of the defense its not pressure pressure is having hands that are deterring my vision youre making it difficult youre forcing me to play with my back to the basket is that something you did in high school before you got to Duke or was that something Coach K and his staff impressed upon you to make sure you had your hands up defensively I had no idea what the hell pressure even meant right I know I did I I no idea about look thats what Im talking about look so youre playing off of him which I I cant because he can beat you off the dribble you have the size you have the length especially there if youre Cleveland but at the same time you have to speed these guards up UVA plays at one of the slowest Paces in the country so if anything if youre a six seven guard and youre Gardener likes a p a car who is 5 10 5 11 Im gonna get up in your pocket Im gonna force you to play faster Im gonna force you to try to make plays at The Rim because I get you out of your Rhythm offensively and for an offense that is very patient youre getting them playing contrast to the way that they would like to play but as of right now UVA has controlled the pace offensively and theyve been dictating what Florida state does defensively look hes just able to bring the ball up the court Im just trying to tell you that back in the day Florida State teams like I I would get turned three or four times before I even got to the Half Point but historically coach Hamiltons been able to go 1011 deep cant do that anymore and so youve got to appreciate right the fact that players cant play that style for 40 minutes we were talking about Terence Mann when he played here and obviously one heck of NBA player Maxi would play on certain nights 26 27 minutes and now you have guys like Cleveland now you have guys like green hair playing 35 36 minutes per night due to the lack of depth so thats a challenge that Leonard Hamilton actually spoke to us about about guys conserving their energy and their offensive end because theyre literally expounding so much on the defensive foreign Applause and this small ball lineup for Virginia was so good against Carolina were seeing so much of it again here today in they go Gardner gets the defender in the air cant finish though love the move love the patience by Gardner catch and shoot green got it nothing but net for number 22 thank you Ill tell you something right now about real Shooters recognize real Shooters I mean green is a real shooter he is a lethal threat just look at the rotation on the ball when it comes off his index finger Im still trying to figure out why you challenged him this morning because Im a real shooter and thats what real Shooters do Doug Timeout on the floor and when we come back well talk about Leonard Hamilton and his unique perspective as we celebrate the Martin Luther King holiday to you it may just be an element um from other people who are black to be frank with your dog like how do you feel a lot of times about being the only black person in the room a lot of events I go to Im the only black person there and theres this need where you almost feel like you have to then represent an entire race right and obviously were all part of the human race and I had a chance to ask Leonard that before and hes like you know Jay my representation always came down to a standard of just being the best I could be I felt if I could be the best I could be in my knowledge my personality and how I fought for young people would inevitably translate to people seeing that Id care about who these people are and that is who Leonard Hamilton is hes a guy whos passionate who cares about the game of basketball and also cares about what the game of basketball can provide people from different socioeconomic backgrounds and that traces back to his parents Benny Ruth his mom had a seventh grade education she was a sharecropper his dad Big John only was educated through the 9 upgrade but his parents insisted on Leonard as the oldest of the family to get an education and Leonard took that ran with it and made sure that each of his younger siblings followed Sue and thats what family is and I thats really translated to how hes built the culture of Florida State and being here for 20 years as a player I never saw a color I only saw my teammates but when situations of race came up my other teammates that didnt look like me they supported me and because we were all part of the same family unit and thats what hes been able to establish that trust doesnt happen overnight that happens with telling people the hard truths and having nonnegotiables and Im not sure every kid in college basketball still wants to be coached in a hardlike way and still wants to have nonnegotiables but Ill tell you one thing these are the principles that help you win at the game of life and basketball seems like its something that helps young men understand what they can be Ryan Dunn on third effort able to lay it in blocked twice but the Freshman just kept coming Applause Cleveland has to be ready to shoot and drive this whole game seems to be off today he catches the ball and he looks the pass instead of being in attack mode once again I know hes trying to set up the play but he got to look to attack after five minutes remaining in the half shot clock down to seven Cleveland off the bounce its a foul on Kihei Clark from the weak side but I mean look hes going to get the bow but thats the stunt and this is the f foreign the shot gets blocked two times but the play is not over and that consistent Persistence of the ball is what led to the play ER Music so Cleveland will shoot two well weve got a great womens college basketball doubleheader on deck for you tomorrow on ESPN First Missouri takes on top ranked and undefeated South Carolina at one Eastern and then 11th ranked NC State looking to bounce back from losing in this building earlier this week well battle 22nd ranked UNC 3 30 Eastern both games on ESPN and the ESPN app Clark with that quick First Step left it out of bounds but Florida state was the last to touch the whos will keep it underneath someone I think corn will recognize more as he matures in this game is that if youre on a guy like Kihei Clark you can still apply pressure but do it from a distance because of his blazing speed he can get low to the ground and get around you play off with him and still keep that arm extended or he can use it to contest the shot the problem is with that Clark has turned himself not into just an okay shooter hes a very good shooter so youve got to honor that hes at 40 percent this year Jay but you can if youre a guy like Corner if youre six eight six nine you can contest late and you can still have an opportunity a pretty high probability of blocking that shot come on poorly inside coron out to the perimeter see really is going to have to be the guy this evening earlier Cleveland are going to have to be the guys to get into those gaps to force upas defense to collapse to get some shots either for themselves or teammates but doing it off the dribble is what those two will have to do now Cleveland was the accs Sixth Man of the Year last year and he has really taken a step this year his usage is up Jake and his efficiency is up as well hand down man down Franklin into double figures tell you that Ray Allen would laugh at people whoever guarded him with his hands down right you leave a left he would say oh Jay Im gonna get 30 in this game because their hands are down that its gonna allow me to shoot it every single time long range green no one and done for FSU Virginia with it theyve been in control pretty much from the opening tip what happened Applause and how does that NBA like bounce to him though yeah you know he has that those quick twitch fibers he can get from point A to point B pretty efficiently theres not a lot of wasted Motion in his action and his defense to me is going to translate Cleveland being much more assertive coming out of the last timeout he is working on a great streak of six consecutive double doubles the last 70 with seven in a row Reggie Royals 51 years ago there goes Beekman gotta step on Mills uses the window nicely Applause and Beekman much like Clark they dont have to score a ton to beat you they both average double figures but they can beach in so many ways Van Der floss whistled for the foul this is what I was talking about with Reese Speakman this is why I think he has a chance to be a pro look how he uses his right shoulder leads into you bounces off you stay walking Ive ever seen I mean you talk about you put him on the court full of Brothers Doug you would have thought he was the brother he was the one and I would put it the other way around more swag than shoot you know what I mean yes and he had that Moxie with him and I often feel I would love to hear John and down and talk about this sometimes you know in college I dont see as many kids have that bravado right and I see it a little bit with Kihei Clark when hes on the court when he when he gets into his back defensively and when possessions are going uh Hauser definitely has it over at Houston like certain guys that when theyre on the court you know what time it is because they know what time it is and that stuff translates to the rest of your team Worleys first basket Florida state is now made five of its last six after an extended drought good penetration by Beekman but the air ball by Franklin ball bounces around still loose and Florida State secures it a minute Applause the last five minutes or so Jay Florida States look much better at this end Clevelands been a lot more aggressive and thats what you want we want him to get in operating positions on the floor and I dont believe him being on the perimeter trying to utilize the dribble Drive is the most optimal operating position for him I do believe if they switch any action a smaller player take him to the block a bigger player take him to the pinch Wing take him to the freethrow line extended those Opera operating spaces for two guards lock him because of his size he can shoot over smaller opponents final minute of the half heres Kihei Clark after their shoot around last night you had an extended conversation with Kihei can you share any of that with us Jay just about how he needs to create more space so he can operate offensively especially in his half court scenarios because they will need him to get a bucket down the stretch that pass goes untouched out of bounds Virginia turns it over plus I really wanted to stand next to him to see if he was really six foot tall you know the program look man the program got you I was six three and a half in the program okay no yeah Im six four exactly in real life they actually got like six one and a half Ki Hayes listed at 5 10 yeah thats maybe there Im not sure he plays like hes six five though Ill tell you that but you know guys like him you know Tony Bennett played three years in the NBA with the Charlotte Hornets having to deal with Mugsy Bogues every day in practice the short guy who can get get underneath you is a huge champ I mean that Virginia Defense is overwhelming did you see that hedge my vanderplas he jumped out so far on the screen they communicated they got over the top they stayed connected I mean damn that is beautiful to watch a team that connected on the defensive Hill Florida open three no Applause Buzzard but did not go Virginia if youre Florida State youre thinking okay were were down eight and we didnt play well in the first half at all we got no points in transition we got nothing easy weve reached halftime now lets send it to John Crispin and The Bigs but Virginia is shooting 46 from the threepoint line thus far in the first half six May threes the Seminoles did make a push late in the first half to get it back to single digits what more do they need to do if theyre going to come back all the way and pull the upset of the who Ill take one thing you need Matt Cleveland to be way more aggressive and whenever Virginia switches if Matt Cleveland is being guarded by Kihei Clark they need to start playing Bully ball and you put Kihei Clark on the Block and you make him work for it offensive foul here using that shoulder and forearm yeah when that when that forearm extends like that Doug you got to keep that form in tight use the shoulder not to form because when the form extends its going to be called an offensive foul every time yeah that was beekmans first personal foul no Virginia player no Florida State player has more than one foul there were only six combined turnovers in that first half three for each side good looking move for Jalen Worley the sophomore from Mount Airy Pennsylvania warlia 66 has a size in the frame that he should be getting into the paint all day long I mean hes one of the few guys that can put the ball down on the ground but him being aggressive and assertive I think is critical because hes one of the few guys that can actually get to the paint Kihei Clark with the crafty reverse 3527 Virginia Music look at the slip look at the slip I missed him Caleb Mills had a quiet first half he averages over 13 points per game Orland trying to drive Baseline on Franklin spins back to the middle and missed the turnaround Applause offensive glass Applause so in the first half UVA out rebounded at Florida State Applause if youre having a hard time making shots you need to be all over the glass if youre Florida State they should be dominating the glass and they should be getting transition points off their defense thats the charge thats a great play thats a great play and great footwork by Worley to beat him to the spot and to take it directly into chess thats what you want by War like I said that six six frame to finish over the top of the player and get into the Gap and tough shot but then some Mills coming from the weak side for the offensive reround once again Kihei Clark being smaller lets see once again post work post work take them to the block foreign by Franklin Florida state gets back okay dont talk about TJ Clark he might be 510 but he is built his upper body is built so Mills doesnt have that size or that strength even though he has the length over the top but he couldnt get to his position because Clark fought him the whole way there three ball by Beekman makes it 3829 Virginia Cavaliers right now are in a log Jam for second place in the Lost column in the ACC good looking drive and finish with the left hand by cam foreign freshman from Allen Texas is putting together a solid first year pass comes to Beekman try to make it two in a row vanderplas crashing the glass and hes called for the offensive foul thats the third offensive foul of the second half against Virginia thank you heres the pick and Roll by Florida State right here and the agility right there by corny its really talented because most players when Kihei Clark rotate over the weak side it would have drawn a charge by a traditional big but the agilities by corn to move his feet into sidestep laterally is what created that bucket for him you know his dad played at Georgia back in the early mid 80s for Florida State Hall of Famers you Durham and Warrens dad played with Dominique Wilkins Fleming a lot of talent napping George at that point theres the quickness of Kihei Clark hell head to the line for a chance lightning bolt with a basketball when youre 510 look how he changes speeds young kids out there did you see how he slowed up before he put his head down and then attacked the outside leg and then once again keeping the ball extended most players when they get to the paint they gather the ball with two hands and they rock it to gain momentum not Kihei Clark he recognizes that this is about a game of inches he keeps the ball in his right hand without connecting it with his left extends it and lays it in quickly see a lot of guys in the NBA do that all the time and you know what after Virginia lost to Houston in a game that the Cougars really out virginiaed Virginia with their defense and physicality I love the quote from cougars head coach Calvin Sampson about Kihei Clark he said he may not be an NBA player but he might be an NBA coach one day hes not just a tremendous player but as you talked to him yesterday and you have gotten that sense watching to him hes the game at a different level than most I think the next step and challenge for Kihei this year is the need to not feel everything right like you could tell their times when he starts going offensively where he might force it but the game reveals so much to you if youre aware of it and I think for Kihei recognizing those opportunities with his speed and with his IQ will ultimately determine whether he can play at the next level or not because he has a quickness he has a speed he doesnt have the height but he has the the basketball IQ and I still think theres a chance for him well he wasnt sure if he was going to go back to Charlottesville after last year he went through the senior day ceremonies and it took a little bit after the season was over but he finally determined that coach Bennett I want to come back this weeks super Tuesday doubleheader features a huge big 12 Showdown as second ranked Kansas takes on 11th right Kansas State in Manhattan at 7 pm Eastern and then its an SEC battle between Georgia and Kentucky at Rough at nine Eastern both games Kentucky with a huge win today in Knoxville they took down the volunteers so still think theyre calling for Cals job you know they are you know big two Nation if you if you fire Cal who are you gonna get thats going to recruit right now he knew what he was signing up for though Jay Applause he hey Clark everything but the Finish couldnt get the bounce vanderplas got a piece of it and green the ball handler landed with it and hes called for traveling well the ball gets hit you got to let it go hit the ground get it back this is what I love about cars doesnt matter what your size is I got different ways to finish around the basket Im gonna get to wherever I want whenever I want games thats perfectly set up for Dallas to lose it really does Dan Quinn on the sideline Mike McCarthy job on the line you got guys like Sean Payton rumors circulating around whether hes gonna take the Chargers job or will he be there in Dallas because of his relationship with Jerry Jones it doesnt get any better than him I feel like Keyshawn right now listen to you this is what happens its what happens when you talk all sports all day long this is what we do vanderplan around and out he was three of four in the first half thats his first three ball attempt here in the second all right so whats about to happen now ladies and gentlemen Im about to start yelling at the game like I would as if I were sitting at home on my couch having a drink is that okay yep can we get Matt Cleveland the ball on the Block right on cue he puts up a three around and out Im not talking about a three Im talking about getting him the ball on the block or getting him the ball on the pinch post where it can turn he can face he can see which leg of the defender is up and drives the daggone ball I dont want to see him settle hes too talented of a player to settle big rejection by Darren Greene heres green at the other end Gotta Move orally to pull up from the freethrow line its an air ball theres Cleveland inside had his pocket picked and the ball comes to Isaac McNeely thats where I feel like this team is missing a floor General right and obviously Mills is trying to be that not on the floor right now so that responsibility goes to Worley but in that situation thats a broken play all right so if theres nothing there in transition Dont Force It pull it back out actually run a set like thats what makes UVA so good in secondhand transition if theres nothing there theyre disciplined enough to say okay pull it out lets get it set lets get a high quality shot Armand Franklin leads all scores now with 15 points lead back to double figures for UVA Mills keeps the pivot foot and was fouled on the way up Applause and see watch Franklin and watch how UVA actually operates here turn Face drives and then I you see kids doing this more and more kids these guys are grown man let me say grown men but from Europe Im still young dont do that to me um driving left inside right hand English off the glass yep you seen Kihei Clark the right side driving right inside left hand and you think about why players do that because if you have taller Wings on the perimeter just because you beat them it doesnt mean that theyre out of the play they can use that length to block your shot from behind so you use that strong hand like Keya clock on the right hand side use that strong hand and then you go to the inside left hand just to extend the ball a little bit to get it up on the glass quicker so the defender doesnt have a chance to block it and youre right we see that more and more frequently but are you saying Jay you didnt have that shot in Your Arsenal is that something that people didnt do 20 years ago not as much it was more the the power twostep you come to a jump stop you jump back into the player you kind of gain your balance off jumping off them uh that thats more like Kyrie Irving type dexterity around the rim with those englishes off the glass Vander Falls turned down the three Beekman wide open from the wings what patience so once again if youre floor state are you blitzing off the ball screen or you switching so if youre switching theres no need to double the ball screen miscommunication once again thank you see look look everybodys stacking it look at everybody before to say everybodys standing around and thats the thing like so pass cut pass move its easy for the defense to actually acknowledge whats going on when nobodys passing or nobodys moving so heres the patience right here screen what are you doing there is really no screen there is no communication by McLeod he didnt yell out switch or trap and thats what led to the bucket by Beekman oh right to the bucket one more time Kihei Clark sized up his Defender Chandler Jackson and with no Health defense wide open right to the baskets hey some people out west got it nine and a half I just dont I dont see what Florida state is bringing offensively it just talks about a complex IQ head fake Defender comes in a weak side kick up vanderplas bucket defensively you lose were tracking where I am I get to steal in transition I make something happen I dont see help from the weak side oh theres an open isolated Lane Im gonna get there Im Gonna Get Low to the ground but more importantly what people at home dont see this young dude is always talking and I think thats something that Leonard Hamilton was talking about with his team and huddles hes an active talker on the court hes an active talker defensively hes constantly communicating to The Bigs and hes a floor General and thats what teams need in order to win championships you need somebody that when things become a little bit chaotic no calm down its fine lets get into a set Im gonna get the person the ball at the right time so they dont have to think and they can react and be aggressive Caleb Miller why cant he needs to do that more he needs to do that more he has the talent he has to pick the spots and has to understand that he has the size and the length to attack the basket when he chooses and I was going to add to Kihei Clark you know our colleague Corey Alexander is one of the alltime great guards point guards in Virginia history he says Kihei is the best in whose history he says hes number one of course hes got the national championship and he made the biggest pass the biggest play in program history and you know the role that you talk about Jay that he has grown into that vocal leader again hes seen it all done at all unable to stop the turnaround shot by Chandler Jackson there but he is so valuable to this program and to coach Bennett what did he say Douglas Florida State and if he hates Clark is on the floor yes hes a poor General hes super dynamic but whoever hes guarding you take him right to the block and thats exactly what Jackson did in that last place before the state look out John protti he is coming theres another assist on the three ball from Armon Franklin theyre missing the roller every time every time a clouds hits a screen the guy from the weak side from Virginia stunts to try to get over there but hes open if they just throw the ball high every time Jackson was fouled from behind by Armond Franklin time out on the floor and when we come back well take a trip down memory lane for my partner who actually has a couple of nightmares whenever he comes back into this building sorry jay why do we have to talk about its coming why is the camera on me what are you guys doing to me who go to Florida State who attend well know what Im talking about as a young adolescent man was challenging to get around so all that fun you may have had here in Tallahassee allegedly allegedly how on Earth does that impact you 12 hours later when youre standing at the free throw line nobodys defending you why couldnt you just do what hes doing there Jackson has no problem making a free throw lets just say it was blurry still recovering so thats not just I give you Insight thats not just allegedly then thats allegedly allegedly at threewar recovery were trying to stay hydrated Michael Jordan said it correctly we all had the flu it was our flu game every game down here interesting thats how we looked at it next time I see Coach K Im going to ask him about it oh hes retired now so you dont think he doesnt remember that game Id rather not talk about it to Coach K we could talk about with John Shire he wasnt even alive hardly back then 21 years later here you said welcome back again to college basketball its so good to have you and we look forward to having you join us on game broadcast for the rest of the season weve got so much to offer former National Player of the Year at Duke lets dont see it two times really its a caveat really no what I dont eat do you want Im afraid to say any bio stuff because youre going to correct me that I didnt you know pump you up enough well we talked about this yesterday we said two is more than one so if I called you a first round pick youd correct me and say actually I was second overall yeah because you dont want to confuse me for the 24th overall exactly thats great Details Matter interesting I mean were both married we know this so now weve taken that step McNeely with the three ball and Ill tell you what Virginia J is using the three ball to great effect as good or better than they have at all this season theyre also getting wide open looks I mean McNeely right there in that last play is a wide open look and look thats what Im talking about digging down from the weak side and thats what you teach your players thats why uba is so good defensively when you drive theyre stunting in those gaps theyre digging in and they have active hands that was freshman to freshman McNeely to Dunn who now has four points after the dunk the timeout is called by the Seminoles I mean in an age where we live with analytics and scoring buckets and its about the threepoint shots the fact that I am down here watching tactical skills put on the defensive end Im Applause to Tony Bennett just make a free throw team about the midpoint of this second half Reese Beekman doing Reese Beekman things all right pick me getting in the lane that little Showcase of the ball defense collapses loses track at McNeely and thats what Im talking about getting in those gaps him being on the strong side gets his hands in there creates an easy Basket in transition and uba just playing at the top of their game I mean defensively their sound offensively when theyre knocking down shots and theyre getting highly efficient shots thats why at the beginning of the broadcast I said they have intentful offense based off their deliberate defense like when your defense is executing and youre being disruptive and youre forcing your opponent to do things youre uncomfortable doing that leads to great offensive possessions Corin nice looking stroke the young man putting together a solid gain hes into double figures for Florida State I love the upside for corn I think theres a lot there great feet great hands has a shooting touch extended to 15 20 feet defensively hes active just needs more reps he doesnt look like a freshman either at 6 10 225 out of bounds along the Baseline all turned over by Jalen Worley orleys dad played at St Joes up in Philadelphia you know who his fathers Godfather is oh Will Chamberlain wow because Jalens grandfather Ben played in the NBA and was his teammate with the Philadelphia 76ers back in the 60s one of the greatest to ever do it I always throws MJ LeBron Im like and you guys just forget about wilt hard to forget about him and Russ too I mean between winning what 11 championships we in this day and age count everything by championships well if thats your litmus test how do you not make Russ the alltime greatest player Im not advocating for that is that what youre saying I am not um but there are a lot of people who say well MJs better than LeBron because he has six championships and LeBron is not Robert has yes 910 champion at least there you go Darren Green with another three ball the UCF transfer trying to draw Florida State back into it theyre down 11 one more time here goes Clark to work right by warley collapse the defense find an open teammate and get another three ball Virginia with 11 made threes today that matches their Baylor game for most in a single game this season and I like what Ive seen out of the Freshman from Freeport New York M1 and one thats an easy animal as he picks up the personal foul there thank you okay Clark is getting in those gaps like he always does look at that transitions the ball from his right to his left finds an open teammate thats something pretty am I thats where you get my best stuff I have some of my best performances when Im not clear on it you got a good nights sleep last night oh which is a good thing oh you were wiped out last night I mean I get up every morning at 3 AM every morning for my show I know yeah this morning I woke up at six you would have thought I was at Mardi Gras I mean pizza boxes everywhere the unhealthy eating I mean it was just classic it was incredible welcome back to the world of college basketball thank you my man thank you Caleb will uh Mills with a couple of free throws and you know what the Knowles just like in the game last month up in Charlottesville hanging around and hanging around not allowing Virginia to pull away Striking Distance youre only down 12 its one possession at a time God I hate when I say that sound like an old coach you do but it really is get a stop and then execute see thats missed it those are little things for corn you have to see from the weak side that theres a drive coming through but towards the Baseline thats being a younger player but look at this situation right here Im gonna draw yeah Im using a telestrator look at this look at whirlys leg as soon as that left leg opens up just because they have a play theres no need for Kia Clark to even look at it he just drives that Gap you really got to get up there and keep him on the left side of the Court as soon as Kihei sees that left leg swing open a little bit hes attacked in the middle of the paint so Kihei is Beekman misfires Kihei with the basketball he is paying attention to that he is waiting for the moment where his Defender gets in a certain position and thats the moment he goes Im always looking at your feet if Im in the center of the Court which way are you shading you say to me to my right or to my left that high point Im gonna attack every single time whats the weak side doing is he denied on the passing lane or is he in gaps Florida State denies on the passing link to a degree so it allows gaps and a lot of times you see it like even watching Mills Mills wasnt paying attention to the ball when his man was cutting away so these defensive principles that Florida state has had before in the past we have better players they always see man you ball whereas these players a little bit younger they take their eye off the ball that allows gaps to thrive and now after the Miss three as always Virginia not in a hurry our inside boy youll hurry to that if somebodys that wide open vanderplas with the easiest points hell have today once again Doug if youre on the perimeter if your Mills and if youre guarding key hey why arent your hands active why am I able to make a pass and blow it right by your ear because your hands are down by your knees for a lot of times I think people think in that situation but right here youre gonna see look youre going to see Banner plus right here number five you cant even see where the play is going but no communication they have no idea because theres no communication like the first thing youre taught as you mature in the game of basketball is as you cross over half court Doug you got here Jay what you got here communicate to all your players about who you have so there isnt that lack of communication I think if they had better perimeter defense they could cover up some of that stuff right that happens with reps you know that happens with the more time you spend together and you know we live in an age dog where people want results yesterday of course right youre not allowed to have time to grow together and to go through battles and right now as youre watching a team that there are a lot of pieces missing from this team from Florida State we have a lot of guys playing 35 36 minutes thats not something that Leonard Hamilton has traditionally done hes used to having a deeper bench so now it requires guys to be sharper on both sides of the ball and the energy that they sustain defensively and offensively is extremely tiring so youre seeing a lot of mishaps and that eventually got a little bit longer on Wednesday and Wake Forest got a little bit shorter with the loss of Baba Miller who is not flying he came back to play 17 minutes against the Demon Deacons again hes the highly rated freshman who was deemed ineligible for the first half of the Season by the NCAA so hes been practicing with the team working out with the team and that allowed 611 hes showing up on draft boards as a possible first round pick he would have helped immeasurably for Coach Hamilton here today but a case of tonsillitis cropped up the last three days he told me this morning hes feeling better than he has in the last three days hes got a stronger antibiotic now and hes hoping not to be out for too much longer but the the bench woes the lack of depth is a very real thing for the Knowles this year Cameron Fletcher whos a six seven versatile big he can guard anybody on the court you have Barbara Miller whos out now and hes another big that obviously can shoot the ball well can extend the defense missed 16 games and then you get consolidas I mean are you kidding me but coach says he is a very mature young man as mature as he has had Ryan Dunn with nine points Off the Bench a couple of slams here in the second half and he had nothing but glowing things to say about the character of Baba Miller and again in chatting with him after he finished his yogurt this morning that was one guy dribbling the ball down the court playing 101 with a guard that beat him to three four five seven look at this on the weak side thats where if youre green you got to step in take off the Baseline and take a charge like green you are not blocking anybodys shot at six three and a half when Vander plus whos six eight six nine is coming towards the rim you put one foot on the Baseline the other foot you put In Harms Way you can take a charge like those are simple principles that I think at times when youre a young team youre tired youre on the court youre not thinking thoroughly and thats a mischarge opportunity for green will stay with some cotton stuffed up his right nostril to keep the blood from coming down youre a jersey guy you know who the Bayonne bleeder no Ive never who is the Bayon leader that just sounds like a look it up see a cereal I mean it doesnt sound like hes a good person no he was a boxer oh 70s when I wasnt born yet oh come on we just saw the video of you in in standard death it was basically black and it was VHS okay foreign Applause youre going to allow Kihei Clark to walk the ball at the court its just little questions that you end up asking yourself in you know conditioning is so critical when you have to play at the speed and the intensity that Leonard Hamilton wants you to play locked in on the mustache since we got here yesterday I mean its a this guy is like like a Jimmy Garoppolo of college basketball I mean its if you know the Jimmy G reference you know what Im talking about Ill leave it at that of course the Gamecocks 170 number one in the country 50 in SEC play in Lee and Boston as always leading the way averaging nearly a double double for South Carolina is a machine you take me over no no okay whenever Virginia is involved you always say uh I thought differently before this game well their offense is better this year theyre scoring more points than they have in previous years but still their pace of play makes me think yeah I want to take the under its just they make when UVA gets going offensively I I kind of reminds me a little bit of that Ty Jerome Kyle guy a little bit so now we Circle back to what I asked you off the top is this Virginia team worthy of getting to the final four National Championship you just said they make you think of those teams or that team and those guys well so much of that has to do with seating so much of has to do with region who gets put in your bracket I mean thats the way Ive always look at college basketball people out ask me questions well who are the favorites Im like I have to see the bracket to tell you who I think their true favorites are because the the path matters no question your path especially this year with the quote unquote word that we hated in college basketball parody right where theyre not being that much separation and thats what I mean Tony Bennett and I were talking yesterday talking about them playing Houston and youre like all right well their dogs are a little bit older you know they have a little bit of extra gear but is the gap that wide it doesnt doesnt feel like its that wide no so any given day in college basketball team can win right especially if youre a team full of veterans that understands how to take advantage of those moments all right so Virginia has it in them if they are seated in a favorable bracket yes okay I agree like Im not going to underestimate beekmans maturation process and who he could become like uh like vanderplas is a guy that can knock down shots on the outside theres a physicality with him down low on the Block I mean you have done there for length you have a lot of the pieces of guys that can get the job done and I think Ill tell you this Jay the loss to Houston earlier this regular season will do Virginia good when they get to the tournament face some of those tougher teams Van Der Kloss able to keep that left foot in place coming down knock it out of bounds Cleveland and so Virginia will keep it see thats smart basketball right and I I say punish him shot clock went out I think it was a shot clock violation well see what they come back with but once again if Florida States going to switch all to action having the situational awareness to recognize who mills is in guarding and if hes on vanderplas then fine like bring vanderplas down to the block give him the ball and thats what we call punish him in basketball right if a guy whos six two if hes only you if youre six nine six ten youre gonna punish him every time its not even a thought well it looks like after that blocked shot Cleveland is coming away with a little bit of a limp able to get back to the uh the Huddle by himself and what the officials are looking at there is zero on the shot clock but the horn didnt go off which tells me there are tenths of a second left and so Teddy Valentine and Company gonna figure out how much time should be on that shot clock will it be enough for them to inbound it and get a shot well find out when is Teddy Valentine going to age he looks exactly the same as he did when he refereed me I mean what the hell is going on well hes yeah hes leading leading a good life living a good life living a good life and he is working out I mean these guys work how many games a week from November through March hes running up and down the court keeping himself in great shape like all of the officials so one second Music its when the ball hits the floor out of bounds is when it should be stopped so they should put a second on the clock yep and that is the verdict from the officials I swear youre gonna look for some action at The Rim a lob to the rim I think enough time to actually get a shot off this Lobster room and you know what Cleveland is still grimacing he is the defender along the Baseline you give up nothing middle here Doug nothing middle fans are cheering about something on the Jumbotron as the game goes on and somehow Virginia Im not sure he got that off if theres there was less than one second on the clock he couldnt have got that off there because it was a wind up too so zero boom no you cant get that off thats why it has to be a lob at The Rim the only thing that works with less than a second is a tip play so yeah thats obviously a shot clock violation they tried to get Banner Plus at The Rim but I mean Cleveland was so tall and used that wingspan oh while guarding the inbound pass that he couldnt get over the top and Kihei being 510 couldnt see over the topping well we made it through the better part of the first 35 minutes of this game without mentioning Teddy Valentine now hes got to get his airtime so they wave it off Kihei is like come on man I mean less than a second is not enough time to get a full shot off so its the right call but still come on man come on man yeah I asked Tony Bennett last night about what has been my favorite sequence of the year for Kihei Clark it came last month in a game against Albany where on consecutive possession my ticket my ticket three you got a guy up in there drive to the rim Applause those are the possessions where for corn you pop out you get vanderplas in the air he flies out of bounds and then you take a step back to shoot a three when the entire Lane on the Baseline is hoping for you to finish out the rims and you get this to a 10point game and then you get to stop Franklin turned the corner laid it in off the window for two more hes put together a very nice ball game here today I mean the size on Franklin he looks like a running back first off 64 200 hes a senior from Indianapolis who last year in his first year as a Who struggled but its all coming together this year but see when the principles are you dont want to allow middle drives if Im defending you theres no way youre going middle one like I know the one way you cant go on me is middle so to me thats just a sign of endurance the conditioning not being at the level needs to be because when youre conditioning isnt at that standard of Excellence then you have a tendency not to think and you have a lot of miscares and thats what were seeing about Florida State well what did Coach ham say his usual theory for optimum number of minutes low 20s yeah we talk about Terence man playing 25 26 minutes per night I mean and thats your lead dog so you got guys now playing 34 35 minutes per night and youre not going to get the same kind of execution in the same sustained intensity and when youre playing Virginia youre going to have to defend 30 seconds every time the whos have the ball theyre gonna make you work at both ends all right I guess we had some blood on one of the players well Circle back I asked you off the top of Rhys Beekman in your eyes has NBA potential here he is with the basketball what do you think now after watching nearly a full game Jay has the frame has the sides I definitely like his ability to attack off the dribble the jump shot is pure I think theres sometimes its its like guys like Kaiser Rowe or guys like Joe Harris theyre so sound defensively I think its something that a lot of fans Overlook because that translates to a lot of NBA teams youd be surprised at how many NBA coaches value people that defensively have the principles that know where to be and when to be right and are never a liability on the court and you get that by being groomed by Tony Bennett and what this defense is yes so I think Beekman has a chance well there are nine Cavaliers currently in the NBA eight current seminar of former Seminoles currently in the NBA Cleveland Banks it in Vegas always does this they always do it they always do it every time they know every time its a hook oh oh are they in the bonus where nope not a bonus oh people are cringing right now biting your nails tell you what Cleveland has now gotten a double double for his seventh straight game Jay 10 points 10 rebounds first time in 50 years the Seminole has done that congratulations to that young man but its going to come in a loss to the 13th ranked team in the country good win for UVA on the road set the pace within the ACC Florida State a learning opportunity and a lot of people are angry because nine and hook all of a sudden became nine and thats how it happened thats how it happens unbelievable the turnaround fade by Cleveland will be the answer Armond Franklin 20 points Ben vanderfloss 15 points Kihei Clark 96 assists five rebounds solid
