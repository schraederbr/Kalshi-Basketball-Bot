69 a huge free throw discrepancy Corey in that game Carolina was 36 of 39 if theres a repeat of that here today Tar Heels gonna head back to Chapel Hill with a win its the wolf pack with the basketball first as we are underway at PNC Arena and this Dynamic backcourt to quavion Smith second in the league in scoring jarkpel Joyner 10th in the league and as a matter of fact Corey in this game weve got five of the top 10 scorers individually in the ACC Ashley three of those guys for North Carolina two for to NC State and one of those guys darkell Joyner gets started off the right way knocking down a big bucket here is todays starting lineup brought to you by Kay Jewelers Huber Davis talked about some changes perhaps after the loss on Monday with a starting lineup at least Remains the Same for now Corey it Remains the Same but pay attention to the rotations and guys coming in as we get opportunity to look at the wolf pack starting lineup jarkel Joyner leading it off a guy who went out and got a triple double against your alma mater last time but in a loss to Syracuse earlier this week wolf pack lost at the dome last time out Tuesday 7572 for Joyner 15 points 11 and 10 Corey Alexander I can buy you to watch DJ Burns play basketball and not smile well you have to smile then because hes smiling half the time DJ Burns enjoys himself on the floor loves this matchup but first Armando baycott of course who is the standard in the ACC at the five position and right now NC State off to a great start with Joyner and burns getting an early bucket and you saw Greg gants getting the start again today we will see Jack Clark come off that bench now that Kevin Keiths team is a little more whole Clark played so well on Tuesday 31 minutes for the Wolfpack heres the matchup Music matchups for number five in Carolina blue and NC state has one of the few teams that can afford to guard Armando baycott oneonone because they have so many guys that they can throw at him at that position the bounce sir quavion Smith has his first two nikori in the loss Monday to Miami North Carolina fell into habits that they have had all too often this year not getting the ball to bake out he played 33 minutes took only six shots as Davis connects how do you consistently get that message through to the Tar Heels that bacon has to be more involved well I believe that they know that one of the issues against the game against Miami was the fact that oftentimes he was going up against North Shadowmere who would not allow him to get the post position as to quavion Smith knocks down his second straight bucket and again one of the things we also have to remember about the first matchup between these two teams taquavion Smith left the floor on a stretcher he did not finish that game and of course without him on the floor it changes everything for the World Cup he dance being hounded leaky black turns down the shot inside it goes to bake out with five in the shot clock the double team gives him trouble back out front Blacks gonna have to shoot it hes got it first three for leaky black and once and when you look at these Tar Heels theyre no stranger to a Rowdy environment here coming to PNC Arena they know that they are the hated rival when these two teams get together DJ Burns tonight Baker and then weve got a little extra curricular perhaps weve got a traveling violation called on vacant as Burns went down and these two guys have had a mix up before as you see Armando baycott with the great defense to block the shot unable to keep the basketball inbounds to travel the turnover but at that point for Mondo it was more important to allow DJ Burns to know youre not getting that off on me DJ Burns in his third Collegiate stop spent a year as a red shirt at Tennessee here he is off the pass I asked Kevin Keats this morning before the game how do you describe that shot leaky black on the leak out with the slam hes got five now see what you did there and I also see what Caleb love did the nice kick a half pass running more thats what Huber Davis wants to see he wants for the Tar Heels to play faster feels like theyre walking the ball up the floor too often not getting any easy shots burn sets the rescreen for Joyner these are two of the three highest scoring teams in the league behind only Miami they love to get up and down if they can although the Tar Heels havent done as much running as perhaps they would like this year our view Casey Marcel going end to end Applause Caleb love with the shot clock of fact youre able to score in the paint and I know I sound like a broken record but when you think about Caleb love when hes attacking getting downhill he is a different player puts a different level of pressure on the opposing defense oftentimes setting up the threepoint Shooters making those better shots each team with four scorers already in the first five minutes heres to quavion Smith sophomore from Greenville North Carolina averaging over 18 points per game pulls the trigger a high volume and highly effective threepoint shooter Miss fires and the person who goes against DJ Burns time out here at a sold out PNC Arena coming to PNC taking on the Rival wolf pack for coach Bob of course Kevin Keats whove done a tremendous job this season at Canada for ACC coach of the year but only a 29 record against the Rival Tar Heels all time well state has lost two of its last three having attempted a total of just 17 free throws so much like in the first matchup in Chapel Hill the Tar Heels have been getting to the line much more than NC State lately Seth Trimble Puck Johnson have come into the game for Carolina and we also get a first look at the aforementioned Jack Clark the six foot eight inch grad transfer from LaSalle number five in white for State more Sal and he gets his own Miss shot clock down to 18 working on Trimble hes got a height Advantage shoots over top of the Freshman who grabs the rebound that suck trumbulls benefit he is a tremendous Defender a guy that Hubert Davis can rely on to go out and I wont call him a stopper but yet make things difficult for the opponents on the other end of the floor Davis with a long two high rebound bounces up on the top of the backboard weve got a tremendous officiating crew here this afternoon Ted Valentine Pat Driscoll and Clarence Armstrong who makes the call theres Teddy B and off the foul full court pressure by North Carolina and that is a wrinkle that youre seeing from North Carolina you talked about Hubert Davis talk about mixing it up thats not something theyve done much this season especially trapping on the inbounds pass and I believe one of the reasons why coach Davis is doing that is to try to create some turnovers and be able to get this North Carolina State team to play a little bit uncharacteristically five to shoot no problem for jarkel Joyner but its an air ball quickly up ahead heres Armando Baker beating everyone bound down the floor when your point guard takes a shot there has to be defensive balance someone else your wings have to be able to get back Armando baycott contested the shot which was an air ball by Joyner leaky black keeping his head up with the kick ahead pass for the easy two Armando with four early points he had a big game in the first matchup against state right on you jack Clark off the Applause bench yeah welcome addition getting Jack Clark back into the lineup this young man was a starter for the majority of the beginning of the Season until his injury December the 30th missed 10 games and Kevin Keys is happy to have him back in the lineup he returned against Boston College last Saturday seems to be full strength off of that groin injury fourth turnover by North Carolina Marcel trying to make him pay foreign and he was fouled much to the Chagrin of turquavion Smith the rescreen RJ Davis getting to a spot difficult to see if theres contact with the hand on that one but RJ Davis the azcs leader free throw shooting getting an opportunity to put two on the board he scored 26 in the six and things for 14 from the line coming up next at three Eastern here on ESPN Marcus Sasser in number two Houston host Kendrick Davis in Memphis the tigers are on Joe Bernardis bubble another big game with two weeks left in the regular season selection Sunday Corey three weeks from today going to be an exciting finish for many many teams many many conferences over these next three weeks going to be an exciting finish for the North Carolina Tar Heels to see if they will be a part of the big dance election Sunday right now hard to believe those words come out of your mouth it really is hard to believe the preseason number one team nationally but this team has not gelled defensively which is the reason why they were able to get all the way to the title game a year ago everyone wants to talk about the threepoint shooting in this is what North Carolinas still averaging close to 80 points per game its not about the offense about that defense especially during those 10 losses Tyler Nichol has come out number 24 for North Carolina into the paint brings it back out Clark finds an opening in the defense missed the shot though Pete Nance with a defensive rebound Trimble off the Nance screen gives it back to the Northwestern grad transfer and weve got a traveling violation apparently he didnt put it on the deck before moving his feet well Mondo baycott didnt have to put it on the deck getting out on the fast break the kick ahead pass from leaky black finds baycott for the easy dunk but not to be outdone the wolf pack moving the ball Well Jack Clark finds Casey Marcel in the corner and his three is this was the actual rival where you talk now about Duke and North Carolina being the biggest rivalry in basketball this was the Rivalry first and the opportunity to play some great basketball between these two traditionally story programs that carry a number of national championships for their credit how do you describe the two fan bases how are they different Corey between Carolina and state well when you think about NC State the first thing that comes to mind is the word passion they are the most passionate fans in the ACC and again thats one of the areas of when you come into this building youve got to be prepared to take on that crowd as well as DJ burns with the beautiful move against Newton Mass to spin and to finish much to the Delight of a rowdy crowd here at PNC Arena well I asked coach Keats before the game do you call that when he posts up 25 feet from the basket and backs his man down he goes I do it but I want to be able to get credit because Im a guard coach so I want him to have the ball out there I called that club fair enough if Pete Nash goes right back at DJ burns with the jump hook and nice play by Nance right there winning that battle and really more importantly giving Armando baycott some value rest time not having to battle with DJ burns the entire game here we go again can Nance keep him out of the lane Nance wins that battle but as you see those plays as RJ Davis attacked the basket unable to get the Finish Huber Davis will be fine with DJ Burns making one out of every two shots because if that happens one of the things you do is you limit to play Beyond Smith and jaquel joyners opportunities from Beyond the threepointer Joyner takes a seat on the North Carolina State bench LJ Thomas is in the game out there with Marcel Burns Clark and with the basketball preseason first team allconference to quavion Smith who for just the third time this season fourth time in his two years wearing some custom shoes that hes had designed and painted by NC State Art and Design major will Whitley turquavion wears them only for special opponents like North Carolina and Duke and those two schools by the way didnt recruit him and so thats part of it he wore it once for his college debut last year and doing it again today for just the third time this is a big game for him absolutely a big game and of course you grew up in the state of North Carolina you want to be recruited by Duke by North Carolina by NC State Wake Forest by all the big schools it is of course the favion has mentioned not recruited by Duke not recruited by North Carolina but clearly good enough to play in those at those both those schools found a perfect home here at NC State and is the fastest player to a thousand points in the past 15 seasons in the ACC and he was honored pregame for that before this partisan crowd for North Carolina State cop faces up a little strong on that jumper Nance with a weak side rebound gives to Leaky black who has it poked out of bounds by Thomas Carolina will keep with 17 to shoot do you understand the reasoning behind why is the past 15 Seasons you know whats whats so significant 15 years ago the expansion no um I dont implementing the one and done so therefore very few guys stick around to score their thousand points in their sophomore season because theyre gone as fresh yep Kevin Keach is happy to have to quavion Smith back for a second season here with the pack and he said when terquavion put his name into the draft last spring it was 50 50 whether he was going to come back or not but he took to heart the things the NBA folks told him how to expand his game and those things have shown out this season well I can tell you I was actually at the NBA Combine with the Cleveland Smith in his first game knocked down six threepointers and we had Kevin Keats on air after that game and I looked at Kevin keetson basically you know with with a little bit of eye contact saying hes not coming back just so you know but of course those who guys have a great relationship they had more than enough conversations into Cleveland decided to come back and I believe its going to benefit him doing so and hes one of those guys hes got to foul on the perimeter to favion is who seems to me to genuinely enjoy the college experience and he wanted to stay at NC State hes a loyal guy stayed at the same small high school for four years he wanted to come back work on his game and be a member of the wolf pack at least one more year and he also wanted to win and theyve done much more of that this season the same reason why Armando baycott came back to North Davis gets his own Miss and burns picks up the personal foul his second Applause and those are the things that frustrate coach Keats and on that play it was simply DJ Burns being in the wrong place at the wrong time nothing he truly did to earn that foul other than try to box out Armando Baker someone else allowed RJ Davis to come in and get that rebound but the contact from DJ picks up that second foul most likely we may not see him for the remaining 833 of this first half and that means Ebenezer dewana comes in the 611 Junior from Ghana for some extended minutes in this big game in dushan is out indefinitely with that knee injury and that has been part of why Burns has been able to play more offensive foul the Tar Heels turn it over personal number one on Pete dance and this is a smart play by LJ Thomas recognizing that he was not going to be to contend with Pete Nance if he shoots that basketball but smart enough to get his body in the right position absorb that contact pick up the offensive foul and maintain possession for his team Applause Joyner brings it up played a couple of years of Cal State Bakersfield then went home to Oxford Mississippi and played with the rebels before transferring here as a graduate thats Way Beyond going to work challenging the big man but he couldnt finish here come the Tar Heels the other way leaky black with his head on a swivel had it poked away Smith with Joyner to his left he soars to the rim for two largest lead of the ball game so far five for NC State Caleb love off the nice fake able to finish in the lane but thats what North Carolina can get when you choose to double team Armando baycott hes a willing passer gets it out and now Kayla basketball is playing for Caleb loves playing four on three on the other side gave us up on Joyner held by puff Johnson who goes down Clark with that puts up the three and its way off the mark Applause a lot of talk in these parts about how the Tar Heels are on that bubble headline in this game at the moment Joey brackets is Carolina where do they stand and what do they need to do today and going forward to get into the field of 68 who would have thought when the season started Doug that wed be talking about North Carolina as a bubble team but here they sit as the very first team out of the field uh certainly an unusual position and even worse than they were a year ago when they got hot late became an eight and of course went all the way to the national championship game this game is a must for the Tar Heels and then theyve got to finish strong of course and make sure they suffer no bad losses to stay on the right side of the bubble and thats not been easy for UNC thus far and Joey brackets of course youve been doing this much earlier this year you know you started in January normally you start get this going late January mid February early January you were already added you send us emails all hours of the night and we thank you for those resources could you allow us to keep up with how for the importance of many of these games and I ask you when you look at North Carolina and their schedule and their wins versus or lack of wins versus quad ones is that the main area of concern for you as to why theyre in your first floor out right now its not just an absence in Quad one zero and eight all of their best wins have been uh home or neutral theyve not won a game against a tournament team other than NC State at home that really causes you to jump up and say hey this is the tournament team I I have to think that if we werent talking about North Carolina and I try and take off bias out of this but you know Im human too just like the committee members and I know what Carolina was supposed to be uh I wonder if theyd even be this close oh and eight is almost an unthinkable number and their other metrics dont add up to that I mean its not a great offensive team or a great defensive team but its better than Owen Eight in Quad one and certainly better than a 500 ACC team which is what theyll be if they lose today well Joe for the wolf pack youve got them on the eight line right now what do you think the ceiling is for this NC State team theyve gotten as high as a seven and certainly with a Deep Run in the ACC tournament they could be a six but lets not kid ourselves this is not a great ACC this year the coattails of the league arent very long and theyre not going to elevate teams very high on the seed List look at all those huge win opportunities in a league like the Big 12 right and they got five of the top 12 teams in the committees reveal yesterday nothing like that is going to happen with the ACC and I know they overcame it and put two teams in the final four but when youre getting eight seeds in the final four that is really a hard way to make a living this is a conference that hasnt had a one seed since 2019 when it had three its been a lot of downward trending since then enjoy brackets of course you know Im an ACC guy so when I hear you know the words this is not a strong ACC season but there are eight teams and then were nine now eight teams ranked in the top 70 in the net in the ACC when you look at that how has that not taken into consideration when you talk about the strength of a conference when the NCAA net looks at this conference and having eight to nine teams who are in their top 70 Applause Im still seeing a lot of mediocrity Corey uh maybe its the lack of elite teams at the top and the lack of quad one opportunities relative to a regular ACC season but this is really the second year in a row that this has happened and if anything the bounce back that we all expected simply hasnt occurred you know if I had said in October Virginia Duke Carolina they could all be one seeds no one would have batted an eye but now none of them are going to be close to the Top Line so again I think its the lack of elite teams at the top that is causing the rest of the league to not have the great opportunities they normally do and Joe Coreys beloved alma mater Virginia youve got him on the three line now and I heard you say about a week ago that you didnt think they could go any higher is that still the case yeah theres a pretty big gap between uh every number three seed right now except for Tennessee from 10 on down theres a top nine if you will and the Cavs fall just on the other side of that and I would say again uh I think theyre dangerous and certainly in the tournament theyve proven how dangerous they can be in terms of both talent and style but I dont think theres anybody out there going Im afraid to play UVA as they were several years ago well when you look at the different conferences and of course youve mentioned the Big 12 and then you talk Tennessee who I believe have lost now four out of their last five games I know theyve struggled down the stretch here recently is the SEC that far ahead of the ACC to where you look at that way because in your Bracketology the SEC doesnt have as many teams as the ACC does in the mix correct no the SEC has eight teams in the field now that Kentucky has played its way back in and look about the nicest way I can say it is the team that was leading the ACC for the bulk of the season was Clemson and they still have a great ACC record and theyre out of the field like thats never happened with the ACC like we can talk around it and I could try to sugarcoat it but power rating wise this league right now is behind the Mountain West and that has never happened in all the years Ive been doing Bracketology Uber Dave is not happy with something going on right now I believe it was a foul on RJ Davis stepping in he felt like that was should have been a offensive foul Applause continues to have conversation with Pat Driscoll on the sideline of course thats never going to be welcome here at PNC and you see RJ Davis still moving towards his left on that position we get a great angle at it but I believe thats the right call but of course Huber Davis wants no explanation on that right now no but we are thrilled to be here in this building sold out crowd in uh Raleigh North Carolina and so glad to have Joe linardi in his bunker do you ever get out of the bunker this time of year Joe yeah I get to go to Bristol this week for a few days so were going to call that a vacation in Butte College Connecticut and I realize some of the comments about the ACC are are likely to never get me invited to be on an ACC game again but its not personal Im just the messenger of what the committee is going to tell us three weeks from today yeah Joy brackets and again I hope no one takes it as though youre saying it personally youve been doing this and of course you have a tremendous amount of credibility which is why we all look to you as that resource and as an ACC guy I asked the question simply because I want to know does it mean that I disagree I just look at this league and talk about the fact that hey when you play in this league and you play against the body programs and the coaching that you go up against on a daily basis I believe that that should be something that should be considered much higher than a nonconference schedule especially when you look back and you see the Big Ten where they are but yet the ACC beat the Big Ten in the ACC big and challenge the final one for this season those are the things that often confuse me but I agree with you 100 and I always go to you as a resource my man thanks Corey Im not jumping up and down for the Big Ten either they havent won a title since the Year 2000 Joe thank you so much and again keep those emails coming we will talk to you a lot of John said eight turnovers committed by Carolina so far none for the wolf pack they saw him at a great point you know this when you come into this building you know exactly what North Carolina state is trying to do its been the case ever since Kevin Keith stepped foot into this building and took over this program they want to turn you over and you come into this game recognizing that you have to be strong with the basketball and make plays that benefit your team in comparison to benefiting the other team right now and thats the case for North Carolina 12 points off of those eight turnovers for NC State couple of free throws for leaky black hes got seven and before the break dewana picked up his second foul so weve got to monitor that both he and DJ burns with two as the two primary bigs for state and right now Kevin Keys going to have Greg Gantt stepping in at the Five Spot guarding Armando baycott but we talked earlier they have a number of guys that they can put out there to try to defend bacon because when its all said and done twos dont kill you threes crushing and I tell you what Jack Clark is an excellent rebounder you saw him fly in there its six foot eight from the perimeter to keep the play alive and pick up the assist and offensive rebounding and thats the staple of North Carolina that we also havent seen this year theyve always been one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the league but you see its NC State coming up getting the second chance points love pulls the trigger around and out Baker had it poked away Applause Marcel tries for a second in a row and its way off the mark and you talked about Jack Clark coming in covering a lot of ground but keeping his head up finding Casey Marcel shoots 43 from Beyond The Arc at the top of the key knocking down a big three to extend the lead to five for the wolf pack thats already six rebounds for Clark Corey coming off the bench yeah coach Keats is happy to have him back in the lineup but look at NC State whenever they get the basketball off the defensive rebound theyre keeping their head up looking to push and whatever Smith gets a good look hes taking it unable to knock that one down second in the league and scoring eighth in assists fourth and steals eighth in threepoint shooting percentage and he shoots them in volume I think its easy to say hes having his first team all ACC season question Applause black off the shot fake dumps it off bacon with a chance for three nice play by leaky black right there the head fake to get to quavion Smith to fly by and then playing two on one basketball putting Grant Gantt in a tough spot and Clark coming over no match with baycott when he catches the basketball that deep in the painted area leaky black continues to play impressive basketball on both ends of the floor for the Tar Heels and Corey thats number two as well on Jack Clark thats another thing that Armando baycott does very well his draw fouls get himself to the line and get his opposing big man in some foul trouble but you mentioned early North Carolina shot 39 free throws in the first matchup between these two teams 3639 and it was a huge discrepancy between both groups and right now North Carolina doing a great job getting to the freethrow line as well thats whats kept them in this game Applause Music Smith found the step back by my count that might be the fourth air ball of the game by state morsel off the front iron all the things you have to do over here now youre counting air balls theres been so many when was the last time you saw four and a half by one team on their home floor Ive been talking to Joy brackets I really havent seen for us though but must not have been paying attention during this trip love stroke and he looks and gets 18 he thought that cat Driscoll should have called a foul cat thought otherwise in a technical against Caleb love but the technical was not just from that play alone its been from a number of conversations throughout this game Caleb loves stepping out feels like his contact we dont get a chance to see it from that angle here well see is there contact on the arm regardless it wasnt enough for Pat Driscoll to make the call but there have been a number of conversations between Caleb love and the officials throughout this game that Pat Driscoll simply said Ive had enough and I dont think there was enough contact there to have one today five Applause and so Caleb love will take a seat at the end of the Tar Heels bench Applause Tyler Nichol has returned for Carolina nickels out there with black Davis Trimble and bacon see that technical foul is actually the second foul on Caleb love so hes going to take the seat and miss the remainder of this first half so make sure he doesnt pick up one here on the defensive end talking dewana back out theyre both playing with two fouls for state nice rebound by RJ Davis in North Carolina with all the turnovers they havent played well but one point away and the opportunity to take a lead here possibly to get into the halftime locker room they caught from the high post brings it back out Davis Trimble for three long rebound to the corner goes out of bounds untouched heres our next ACC Big 12 Monday doubleheader its seven Eastern Kyle filipowski and Duke host L Ellison Louisville to Cameron Indoor and then Jalen Wilson in number five Kansas take on number 22 TCU both games are right here on ESPN and the app timeout North Carolina state will take it with him good ball game with 18 seconds remaining in the half the big stories here in the first half and its going to stay full of North Carolina State basketball ever since Kevin took over here Jack Clark did nice find to Casey Macau in the corner and then turning defense into offense Casey Marcel getting out on the break taking himself for the easy bucket and North Carolina just hasnt been strong with the basketball which is allowed NC State to be able to create offense off of that defense and those transition points have been all in favor of the wolf pack here at PNC Arena this afternoon 12 points for the wolf pack off of eight Carolina turnovers thats one more turnover than the Tar Heels committed the entire game first time they played at the dean Dome Applause shot clock off final 12 seconds ball in the hands of jarkel Joyner now to Smith with lockdown leaky defending here they go to burns with one second he shoots it Off the Mark and that ends the first 20 minutes theyre the turnovers youre talking about Corey thats been the difference in this game however North Carolina has survived by getting to the freethrow line 911 at the stripe and has allowed them to stick around only trailing by one point even though North Carolina state has not turned the basketball over once impact players including basically their front line DJ Burns Jack Clark and Ebenezer dewana all three with two fouls going up against Armando baycotton company and thats one of the areas where Bay cop puts so much pressure on opposing defenses hes priority number one to stop him first as we see I like this matchup for Hubert Davis going into the post of leaky black to take advantage of his size but jaquavion Smith able to hold his ground nice play by uh at the end of the Carolina bench as the ball goes out of bounds 20 seconds into the second half with Corey Alexander Im Doug Sherman Dougie presser got a chance to hang out with two ACC Legends at halftime okay other than you one Chris cortiani of course fired from Fire and Ice and then my big fella Chris Washburn in the building today so getting the opportunity to hang out with some ACC royalty here coming to check out a huge rivalry game I love it and Ive heard David Thompsons in the building Derek wittenbergs in the building they took part in theres your guy theres my man and he makes sure hes got his name on the back of his Tshirt so everybody knows whos in the building just in case you couldnt figure it out Caleb love attacks ball tipped up Casey Marcel rips it away for State great job by DJ Burns just staying vertical on that possession the contact but still staying vertical means theres no foul heres DJ Burns sizing up the defense now going to work against bacon a couple of big boys going at it this time number 30 and white gets the better of bacon and DJ did really just displacing Armando Bangkok putting the body on him and then moving him back far enough for him to be able to get the jump shot off last years Big South Conference Player of the Year at Winthrop spent three years there going back home hes a South Carolina product and everyone thought Kevin Keats was crazy that DJ Burns didnt fit his style of play et cetera but theyre all happy that he brought him in now they got no leaky black keeps it alive Nance has it able to bring it back out and they go back inside to Nance working on Clark Applause the turnaround and Clarks going to be called for his third personal foul well we meant youre in Raleigh no no let me just say this you said now heres Whit with a lot of excitement and then you said and David Thompson did you got that confused buddy David Thompson may be the greatest ACC basketball player of all time you need to have a little more voice reflection when you talk about David Thompson and with my guy love him but when you talk about David Thompson you got to put a little more voice inflection on that you was too casual with that my friend agree an explanation I know Derek I dont know David so thats where that came from it was not a slide out you do that you do not have to know David Thompson to speak in a certain manner when you mentioned his name Mr Thompson is in the building there you go jarkel Joyner fouled by RJ Davis going after his miss or will it go the other way no our gobliners Charles was able to slam in on the alley oops Yeah and then of course David Thompson played in what is considered to be of course the greatest game of all time the 1974 ACC tournament championship against Maryland and of course went on to be number one pick and everything else that you can have for and his teammate at that time Tom Burleson is sitting just a couple of rows behind us here at Center Court of course they won that National Title under Norm Sloan in 74 all sorts of History here it really is something to dive into the Wolf Pack basketball lore Caleb love no bacon after the rebound count the basket in one and most likely the third foul on DJ Burns and North Carolinas had a number of opportunities on the offensive glass here to start the second half but unable to take advantage of them this time Armando baycott gets the rebound and then gathers himself goes up strong able to finish with the left hand get the hoop and contact an opportunity for the M1 no sign yet from the wolf pack bench that burns would come out at this point Aycock completes the threepoint play hes got 11 points to lead the Tar Heels in North Carolina awful made free throws you see them picking up in that full court pressure to see if they could find a way to get the basketball out of the hands of Joyner which didnt work on that Possession looks like its going to end up being a foul on baycot that is his first thats not where you want bacon picking up a foul 20something feet from the basket trying to intercept the pass but again its just his first Burns and Clark stay in the game for NC State each playing with three fouls and the crowd starts to come to life for the Peoples Choice DJ Burns backing down Davis the rebound hell dribble up once again I believe Huber Davis will live with DJ Burns making one out of every two post opportunities in comparison to double teaming and leaving the shooters wide open that pass was kicked by Clark shot block moved to 20 seconds foreign this is our third tie of the ball game Corey 36 a piece wolf pack led by a point at the half its only been a two possession game right from the start it really has and again its been the points off turnovers for NC State its been the free throws from North Carolina which was a huge discrepancy in the first game between the two but the Tar Heels have done a great job getting back to the free throw line here today black driving gets his own Miss goes up strong for two our seventh lead change has the Tar Heels back on top and everyone thinks that its just Armando baycott that does the job offensively on the glass rebounding but its more than bacon its Pete Nance is leaky black they have a number of guys that get in the mix when it comes to offensive rebounding and black averages 62 per game while Nance is right at six per game its a quavion Smith wants a wants a foul on that play but Ted Valentine saying that leaky black got his hands on the basketball on that one so NC State will maintain possession Applause Joyner into dewana who gives it back to the Ole Miss grad transfer who glances at the shot clock which is now down to five Joyner puts up a tough shot and buries it it does a smart play by darkell Joyner making sure he kept RJ Davis on his back and getting to his spot for the midrange pullup thats 11 for Joyner he leads the wolf back Ian Smith both in double figures Applause out to love Applause Caleb love beautiful shot 4038 Carolina Caleb love attacking the basket getting downhill not settling for the jump shot a much better player when hes not settling Joyner pulls out thank you five minutes gone here in the second half Carolina with the ball in a twopoint lead love with a bad pass Casey Marcel the takeaway and he makes him pay at the other end is a great individual effort by Casey Marcel to come up with the steal in that possession Bangkok through contact now has 13 points and hes got that off the dribble when you have someone like ebenezuelan trying to guard him who he knows is going to go for the pump fakes once he gets that spin move hes got a number of options in his bag right there Smith nicely done off the window tarkwavian now with 12 points Applause love to the corner black good shot fake and now they clear out give bake out some room against dewana stays on the floor and gets the rebound great job defensively by dewana on that possession allowing making baycot shoot over the top Corner three by Marcel a little strong here come the Tar Heels the other way Caleb love has it taken away but he was fouled in the active shooting Jack Clark we will talk Family Ties what his grandfather did that was so noteworthy as well a Hall of Fame player at NAIA Millersville University averaged 1917 rebounds for his career Mr Parker died in 2018 but his grandson Im sure knows all the stories about what his granddad did back in the day Im sure he does and he also knows not to argue with the officials throughout this game Im sure thats one of the things his grandfather left with them make sure you keep your mouth closed and go out there play hard but dont need a distraction especially talking to the official no doubt Corey and for more black history storytelling and coverage stream the black history always collection on ESPN Plus 1322 remaining second half in this rivalry game number 23 North Carolina State trailing by a point to North Carolina Pete Nance has just picked up his second foul for the Tar Heels and here we go again Burns working against namps hes Nimble hes got good hands Good Feet he can score he absolutely is has such a soft touch you know of course DJ was a guy that reclass up skip this in your high school went to Tennessee didnt work out for him there and if you talk about him being Player of the Year Ed Winthrop a season ago as Pete Nash steps up and knocks down they three for the Tar Heels which have been few and far between throughout this game but you know DJ Burns was in Knoxville and on the team with Grant Williams Admiral Schofield and Company they spent a few weeks at number one in the country so this young man just never had the opportunity to get on the floor but he was a big time recruit coming out of high school in Rock Hill South Carolina Caleb love for three and a great job by Pete ned setting the screen in the back court Casey Marcel DJ Burns having a conversation thats DJ Burns responsibility to let his guard know that its a screen there otherwise its going to be difficult for Casey Marcel to pressure 94 feet against the guy with the basketball Applause not this time for burns love with his head up watching to see if leaky black came free instead he throws it out of bounds into the Carolina bench 10th turnover for UNC eight minutes gone in the second half the Tar Heels holding on to a threepoint lead CJ Burns starting to establish himself on the Block taking his time going to his moves and getting buckets six points for him here in the second half but as Burns is running down the floor he doesnt call out the screen and Pete Nance gets a body on Casey Marcel knocking him down and Cave of love was able to step up and knock down the three and then Pete Nash knocking down the three of his own North Carolina able to take this lead from Beyond The Arc Joyner and Smith in the backcourt along with more cell and then Burns and Clark in there both playing with three personal fouls Clark off the catch and shoot nothing but net but it was the outside of the net great job by puck Johnson Smith is down Applause you have to remember Smith left the first game between these two teams on a stretcher that was on a flagrant foul in transition on leaky black I asked her quavion this morning about that and he said he was okay and said that he was at the hospital deep into the night but was back home in his own bed by the end of the night good to see him back up Applause Im not sure to clavion can stay in the game at this point after the stopping to action watch the left side of your screen there he is going down but we didnt see what occurred into now Pat Driscoll one of the three officials along with Clarence Armstrong will go over and see if they can find what happened on video not sure if the officials have a different look at it but very difficult the best we look at the best look that we had you cant see anything in that one not certain as Applause if they have a different View of any contact there was contact would ever happen on that possession with the Cleveland Smith Applause it looks like the quavion Smith on that possession I actually tried to really put a body on Pete Nance Nance is running down the floor foreign here once again you see Pete Nash running down the center of the floor taquavion Smith is back defensively Applause and really steps into the path wait a minute now does Pete Nance lower that hand on that boy I cant tell its hard to see from that angle but you do see Pete Nances arm come down and if his arm comes down and hits the quavion in the area that very sensitive area that would be bad that would be bad but that would be enough to take someone to their knees in the reaction that taquavion had on that possession right well based on the reaction you would think that or something similar occurred but if you cant actually see the action can you penalize him for the reaction well if you watch once again and again its not the greatest quality but as you see as they you see the two players in the midst but as the contact happens you see the right arm of Pete Nance I dont know your eyes would be better than mine and again I thought turquavion came away from it holding more of his stomach or midsection above the waist and that very well could be the case so the officials are going to come over and tell Corey what they have determined or not been able to determine where they want to look at our video so Teddy Valentine and Clarence Armstrong join us here Quartzsite so we get an opportunity to look at it and because of the quality Applause is difficult to see anything on that and now as we slow it down and look at it Nances arm does not look like it is down during the contact his arm does come back up and too difficult to determine anything from the officials and with that theyre going to walk away from this with nothing and again just not just not enough video evidence to be able to support anything happening and so in the meantime turquavion comes out of the ball game as you mentioned he sits at least for the moment with 11 35 remaining Carolina 49 state 46 Tar Heels have made their last couple of threepoint shots as you see Nance going inside challenging Burns and on the second effort its Puck Johnson big bucket from Polk Johnson pug Johnson had a very good game here a season to go leaky black was injured and puff Johnson came in and gave North Carolina a big effort Off the Bench and to start the second half of that game and which tournament it came out to be a win yeah that was his career high still his career high 16 points for Johnson against the wolf pack here a year ago this by the way the largest lead of the afternoon for Carolina it goes Burns Davis defending down helping Nance no stopping that though the Peoples Choice here in Raleigh scores again hes got a dozen I like that name I like the name youre giving my guy DJ Burns right there the Peoples Choice I can respect that I like it every time he touches the ball is Joyner trips Davis you can just feel energy in the building picking up its like a crescendo heres our next ACC Big 12 Monday doubleheader seven Eastern Kyle filofowski and Duke host L Ellis and Louisville and Cameron Indoor and then Jalen Wilson in number five Kansas take on number 22 TCU weve also got womens college basketball for you tomorrow night two of the top teams in the Pack 12 will square off over on ESPN2 number three Stanford hosting number 16 UCLA thatll begin at nine oclock Eastern time six local RJ Davis for three and now North Carolina starting to find some Rhythm from Beyond the threepoint Arc the first three RJ Davis has made in this game at 26 in the matchup between these two teams back in January Applause loose ball here come the Tar Heels love crosses over Smith misses the shot and a foul on the rebound goes against Armando Baker that is personal number two on Baker he and the Tar Heels have controlled the glass here today but not on his sequence in the strong take by Caleb love looks like it slipped out of his hand unable to be able to finish that but they caught with two hands in the back of Jack Clark picking up the foul lets see if they go to Burns again I told you in the first half Cory I dont think you can watch him play basketball without smiling yourself but hes absolutely fun to watch and of course very productive when hes been for Kevin Keats especially all the 2023 a nice find from Kayla love but North Carolina wastes an opportunity on the break uh you know turkuevion wanted to shoot that Davis closed out nicely and after Smith killed his dribble he couldnt get the shot off first turnover of the ball game for the wolf pack I believe after that possession thats enough evidence for me to go as far as to say leaky black is the ACC defensive player of the year yeah I mean after what we saw happen with he and Hunter Tyson he held Hunter Tyson just two field goal of attempts and then Isaiah wonged only eight points last time out and plays like that and tupacion Smith is five of 16 from the field in this game with leaky black defending a tough shot against the big by jarkel Joyner but thats been the issue for North Carolina who else is going to step up and defend leaky black can win his match up defensively but its normally someone else that hurts the Tar Heels bacon gathers goes around Burns missed it burns saves it here comes turquavion Smith Applause and now the other two will pack get to the front Court with eight and a half on the clock Joyner from the foul line good looking stroke for the grad transfer out of Abbeville Mississippi Davis wide open Wisconsin fights for it but Clark takes it away state with a chance to tie or take the lead its a quavion Smith wanting to get the basketball into the hot hands of jarkel Joyner encouraging his teammate to get going down the floor Jack Clark makes it seven unanswered points for state love fouled on the shot and he will shoot three and our Wendys wooden watch not the only player in this game we should be talking about here absolutely not to quavion Smith also a candidate for the wooden award this season and also a candidate for ACC Player of the Year as we see its been jarkel Joyner The quavion Smiths teammate has really been the guy that stepped up here as of late the 70 Run which has now been answered with free throws by Caleb love who was fouled on a threepoint shot going into the timeout love knocks down all three to take a twopoint lead and hes got 16 or 16 points now to lead all scorers a junior from St Louis weve got a whistle and a foul off the ball and its against bacon much to the Delight of the folks here in Raleigh and I believe thats thats only going to be three on baycott I thought he picked up his third with the hands in the back of Jack Clark but good thing for North Carolina allowing while Armando baycat to be able to stay on the floor during this stretch Applause but of course going to have to be very careful especially defending DJ Byrne Burns through bacocks chest for two but the big difference playing with three fouls and playing with two fouls because you can be much more aggressive especially at this part of the game when you have two Armando Baker probably could have stood his ground even more once DJ Burns turned into him but cannot risk picking up that fourth foul and having to go sit down still with close to seven minutes remaining Ernest Ross into the game for state number 24 in white trying to defend puff Johnson who knocks down the shot right in front of him buff Johnson has given North Carolina great minisphere especially in the second half coming off the bench seven points off the bench for the Junior from Moon Township Pennsylvania Joyner quick First Step hangs in the air finishes and draws the foul man the quickness in this backcourt for state will take your breath away absolutely jarkel Joyner has the ability to go to go from zero to 100 real quick and he shows it off on that possession beating RJ Davis to the spot getting into the air and of course concentrating on finishing off the bucket you might wonder why a kid from Mississippi started his college career Cal State Bakersfield it was his first offer and jarkels father Stacy is a barber and for years he had cut the hair of Bakersfields head coach Rod Burns I read the rod Barnes former Ole Miss player and coach and that was the connection that got him to the West Coast hes got State back in front by a point love against Marcel able to lose him but lost the ball and was foul Applause Caleb love had a little something to say to the partisans behind us well I would agree that hes probably had a lot said to him throughout this game no question it was not a coincidence that he and RJ and who wasnt leaky the three of them came out with their beats on for pregame warmups thats a veteran smart move in this building for atario absolutely well we just made three in a row Missy on the front end this afternoon over on acc Network the Tarheel women square off against Wake Forest and Carmichael Arena they look to bounce back from Thursdays lost NC State coverage at four Eastern its getting loud in here oh well you know theres always something on the line again two missed free throws in the second half theres always going to be something on the line not sure what it is here at PNC Arena I can remember back in the day I maybe some type of chicken sandwich or a biscuit not sure what it is today this is our 10th tie of the ball game just what you would expect with these two Rivals playing with so much on the line baycott goes down Burns attacks and backs it in I asked DJ Burns pregame are you ready he just looked at me he flashed that big smile said you already know Im ready especially for this one Davis no Nance crashing the glass big rebound for Ernest Ross the sophomore Off the Bench it leads to a run out and a reverse jarkell Joyner with 20 lost the block Here Comes Morrison big sequence for the pack three more Im out Carolina 6760 as the place goes nuts the wolf pack are eight of their last eight field goals and jockel Joyner coming over to let me know I told you I told you and what he told me was he and sequavion Smith are the best backcourt in the ACC this young man has a tremendous amount of confidence and hes playing with it right now yeah joyners got 23 points to lead all scores hes now 71 points shy of 2 000 for his career and a wolf pack of really been knocking down shots for you theyve made their last eight attempts from the floor shooting better than 60 percent Davis block Burns got a piece bacon trying to clean it up but a whistle before the putback Applause the foul is on Ernest Ross and the seventh team foul against North Carolina State Music coming up next with three Eastern here on ESPN Marcus Sasser in number two Houston host Kendrick Davis in Memphis who are on Joe Bernardis bubble another big game with two weeks left in the regular season ChickfilA chicken sandwich on the line right here on this free throw and the crowd will get the chicken sandwich Armando Bay pack missing back to back free throws in the second half and more importantly NC State an opportunity to increase their lead after making their last eighth field goal and Corey this is the largest lead of the afternoon for either team Joyner who again with that quick first step and the step back for two more a ninenothing run for state RJ Davis kicks it out to Black five to shoot black over Smith puff Johnson no baycott yes and a foul against Burns that is number four on NC State Center thatll take him to obey Canada the free throw line but a 90 state run over the last few minutes Corey has given them a little separation and they caught answering with the threepoint play allowing North Carolina to set up their full court pressure Applause enforcing the timeout darkell Joyner well take a break as well State holding on to a sixpoint lead CC and more importantly they would be 09 versus quad one and thats going to be the biggest kicker for the Tar Heels moving forward as Joey brackets told us earlier all of their wins quality wins have been either at home on a neutral site none on the road gotta get it across and that they do State for the basketball and Ross missed the Duncan then hung on the rim and you cant do that but Hubert Davis wants a technical foul on that and not just the Miss as our officials will gather and talk about it but it will not be a technical foul it will simply just be offensive goaltending but Huber Davis was adamant on the sideline regarding that being a technical foul for hanging on the rims Mack McClung wouldnt have missed that dunk no he would not Casey Marcel the best perimeter Defender for state uh hes the best guy to guard Caleb love because of Caleb loves size but its hard to say that they have a better perimeter Defender than jarkel Joyner Davis no Marcel secures the rebound and now state in no hurry but the reality behind it is they have three Elite guards in the backcourt for NC State on both ends of the floor the reason why this team has excelled since the turn of the Year 2023 even though theyve lost two of their last three still playing great basketball Applause DJ Burns love gets a step on more cell Burns comes over to help forces the miss Smith with numbers throws it up slammed by Joyner 18 of his 27 points coming in the second half poked Away by Burns Ross can he track it down he does two more south everything going NC States way right now it has been a Pack Attack darkell Joyner from the beautiful five from his backcourt running mate so Craven Smith lobbing it up and the point guard going way up high and then Smith once again finding Ross who tracks the basketball down back to Casey Marcel for the layup and it has been a 153 run for the wolf pack since 5 36 remaining in this second half spanning over four minutes and the wolf pack has truly shown why theyve had success in the ACC this season and why they will be a scary team in March the last time out jarkel Joyner against Syracuse became just the fourth wolf pack player with a triple double hes been even better here this afternoon he absolutely has been even better not just offensively either defensively hes done the job on RJ Davis RJ Davis who had 26 in the first time out has not been able to get off against darkell Joyner but then offensively jarco Joyner has taken over this game out of the timeout they get a decent look for love but he couldnt make it held ball and the possession arrow goes to state the game was tied at 60 with just over six minutes on the clock and in the last four minutes and 50 seconds its been a 153 run by the wolf pack Ive been coming to this building for 14 years I have never seen it like this really and coming in of course we saw the line wrapped around the corner we knew how big of a game it was but to be in here and here the decibel level that they are getting to in this building especially off to the jointer dunk its been amazing a great college basketball environment and on a Sunday not sharing the stage with any other college basketball in the ACC RJ Davis gives the foul Corey that is his fourth in an effort to send Ernest Ross just a 61 percent foul shooter to the line Applause all smiles for the wolf pack at the moment with 587 left on the clock Applause Davis think the defender may have gotten a piece that was Casey Marcel with a block 104 players on this wolf pack Squad that have 20 blocks on their season Casey Marcel a guard with over 20 blocks on the season its something that they are second in the ACC behind only Syracuse without that dominant rim protector but even though a doubledigit lead Casey Marcel continues to get the job done less than 50 seconds on the clock but not giving anything to North Carolina playing this one out all the way through the final buzzer so Ross back at the line misses the front end again guitar heels cannot waste any time the Longs three by love Miss fires bacon tracks it down Buck Johnson for three love ties up Smith and itll stay at this end of the floor North Carolina State came into this game as an eight seed according to Joe linardi as Caleb love hits the three and we get a timeout called love now has 20 points while the Tar Heels were on the wrong side of the bubble coming into the day so much importance on this rivalry game and heres what Carolinas looking at right now Corey well this was a great opportunity for North Carolina to get a quality win to get some something going on there quad one unable to be able to make that happen today here in Raleigh but a statement game for the wolf pack letting everyone in the agency know that they are here to stay it has not been a fluke it is real and you look at North Carolinas remaining schedule at Notre Dame Wednesday of course Virginia coming to the dean Dome on Saturday at Florida State and ending the season with Duke at home but not many opportunities for those quality wins remaining for the heels yeah youre almost getting the sense that unless the Tar Heels make a lot of noise in Greensboro theyre going to miss the field I believe thats going to be the case theyre going to have to make a Deep Run in the ACC tournament in Greensboro to get back to where they would be in uh at large bit if theyre unable to win the ACC tournament well it doesnt happen very often where the preseason AP number one team misses the NCAA tournament field and each of those three occurrences were before the field expanded to what it is now Carolina possibly could not be one of the 68 dancing next month but you see the top team on that list NC State 197475 a year after winning the National Championship in 1974 and if theres anyone that would love to put a nail in that coffin for the Tar Heels theres no one that would love that more than the wolf pack Joey Brackett said coming into this Carolina was going to need to win four of its last five in the regular season to feel comfortable going into the ACC tournament and if that is indeed the case theyre going to have to run the table now to have any sort of comfort before they get to Greensboro they absolutely will have to and again and their cable was not as though this team is not capable but coming into this building in this environment today youve got to give a lot of credit to the wolf pack faithful of course the team the guys that got the job done on the court Kevin Keats and his staff but this crowd was amazing here this afternoon Ross and Johnson got tied up on the free throw Applause it almost looked like a possible hook and hold Ted Valentine over to the scores table its got double technical fouls on Ross and Johnson on this play they will be offsetting final 20 seconds love with another three pressure broken morsel holds on to the basketball and will the Tar Heels let it run out he is triple team and Kevin Keith was actually trying to call the Timeout on that one but thatll do it North Carolina State takes down UNC North Carolina 09 versus quad one teams on the season NC State four and five NC State in the field right now the Tar Heels are not final score 7769 next
