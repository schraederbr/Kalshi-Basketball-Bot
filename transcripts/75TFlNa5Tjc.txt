theyre not scared theyre not intimidated theyre coming in here to win and theyve done it Music before and the opening tip controlled by Florida State their point guard Jaylen warley Junior from Mount Ary Pennsylvania just outside of Philadelphia jir Watkins two for Florida state is the teams leading score the VCU Applause transfer and we get an early foul on UNF you know N I did the game against SMU the other night and one thing I noticed in the very first possession is Florida state is sharing the ball the balls moving to and fro it felt like the seminal were trying to score 15 points in one possession against SMU a lot better offensive flow early in this game for the Music seminal its a team that had Georgia on the ropes in the ACC SEC challenge had UNCC on the ropes in Chapel Hill just couldnt finish it down low Deontay green blocked and it comes to Nate litus a really good offensive possession from Florida State Chaz lanir who picked up that first foul for North Florida is the teams leading score Barry and litus can both knock it down from the outside James the kg vet in his sixth season they call him Grandpa 24 years old litus sh the drive and he ran into the trees starting five for Florida Darren Green today closing in on 1500 career points needs nine to get there Baba Miller had a double double two games ago against USF he oozes potential the sophomore from Applause mayorca thats green no good and we get a held ball you know Anish I know it looks ugly early here but Florida state is moving the basketball looking for open players and Matt Driscoll he just wants one thing get the ball down and shoot it knock down a three ball if youre open make it North Florida averages 123 a game and now some fullcourt pressure by Florida Music State yeah over 53 of their total shots from the floor come from behind the ark a lot of small lineups theyll spread you out James passed on a three drisol is not going to like that Barry has his shot blocked Florida State solid on ball defense early in this game thats critical for them not to give up dribble penetration nice pass out of the post by Green on the reversal its Darren Green now Baba Miller from the corner air ball and so far neither team has scored and Florida state has gotten a good look at the basket every time down just not making shots this is amitri moss the Joo transfer he turns it over here comes Watkins off the window and weve got our first points of the game Jamir Watkins averaging a team High 13 for FSU yeah hes the most consistent player on the seminal team Music Applause one thing Florida State you know theyre ranging they like to get out in the open floor right there jir Watkins he sees Defender doesnt engage him so he goes right to the rim right there good strong move by jir Music Applause Watkins came over from BCU Leonard Hamilton has said hes kind of been able to do it all he can play the point he can get get his own he can get his teammates involved hes been simply put through nine games the teams best Music Applause player both free throws good for Chaz lanir jir Watkins had a big game in that upset win over Colorado earlier this season 18 and Applause 11 11 is State coaching staff Season 22 Mark and this guy deserves a place in the Pro Basketball Hall of Fame no question had a tremendous career and really challenged his team this week to come up big defensively they want to take away dribble penetration so far theyve done that offensively they need to share the ball and move the ball theyve done that these first several possessions I think Florida state has had really good practice for last couple days and Leonard Hamilton hes not afraid of any moments hes been around for a long long time hes mentored guys like like Bill self Andy Enfield at USC Dennis Gates now at Missouri hes mentored some of the greatest coaches in the game and he is a Hall of Fame coach no question about it and he was telling us earlier today the challenge now before conference play they have so many pieces theres Talent on this roster its getting the jigsaw puzzle to fit getting the parts to mesh so you have a set rotation youve got more defined roles when you get into conference yeah theyve played like a bunch of dispar parts versus a puzzle that fits together and and thats just a fact I like what they did against Colorado they really trusted each other they played well together but since that game this team has fractured a little bit along the way and those chips they got to pick up those chips put them back together and come back together as a team thats the challenge tonight against North Florida ler who is North Floridas leading scorer now here comes James the sixthe senior backing down Watkins tough angle does not get the bounce but gets two free Applause throws North Florida is a team that if they can get by you and you start chasing the ball Matt Driscolls bunch is going to bang three balls all night long so far Florida state has been really really good of deflecting the dribbler and keeping a Defender between the dribbler and the basket Well Done by Florida State early in this Applause game Mark you did the Florida state SMU game over the weekend seal in that game didnt shoot it well didnt shoot it well from three they only scored 18 points in the first half and early on some of that offensive malaise from Florida state has carried over go go go there was a lot of one pass shot though in that game they were never in sync they never played together throughout that 40minute segment and with any consistency at all so far earlier in the game and these even though theyre not making shots theyre moving the ball two and throw I like what theyre doing offensively theyre just not making shots right now Watkins kicks to Miller got clock down to 10 warley inside this is Jaylen gainy and the brown transfer muscles in time iy League Defensive Player of the Year with Ura major now the Press creates the turnover heres green Dead Applause Eye lot of energy from Florida State early in this game and that press is bothering North Florida as is the ball pressure but we get another tie up possession arrow Florida State seminal hit their last three it was very effective against SMU with their fullcourt pressure we asked Leonard Hamilton today if he would go to it at some point in this game we see it early here good aggressive defense by Florida state Florida State on Saturday night they allowed their lack of offense to affect their defense tonight their defense is lending itself to good offense I like the way this teams coming out they were challenged by their coaching staff to have more energy to play together and defend better and Florida state is doing exactly that early in this game theyve been disruptive 9 and 1 12 steals per game tops in the ACC and their height is going to be a challenge not just for North Florida tonight but for most teams yeah their length and these its just like a bunch of condors out there half the time but thats a Leonard Hamilton team theres another one Baba Miller who stands at 6 11 I thought you were going to go with wandering albatross but you went Condor on me I went Condor could have gone pterodactyl too but I decid to stay more current jiah Mills miles The Freshman who was seven for seven with three threes in his last game knocks down the triple and that is North Floridas first field goal theres the follow by jir Watkins yeah jir Watkins really aggressive off the bounce tonight he can take a hit and finish MRI Moss the Joo transfer out to lir and now the threes are falling that spacing of North Florida can be deadly when they can get the gaps and find open teammates green can be a microwave you had two guys on them the Ospreys know The Scouting Report Miller big size Advantage turns it over Applause Wing three back iron rebound Applause Watkins out of bounds to Applause FSU well jir Watkins he is hunting for his shot right now and there you see the numbers from behind the arc for for North Florida look this is a team that really wants to get up and down they want the three ball they need the three ball to win this game tonight Matt Driscoll telling us its the way our offense works its usually the best shot we can get and if its there and its open you better take it he keeps it very Green from 18 watch the spacing of the of the black jerseys they really space the floor well when you can get into a gap off Dr penetration youll find open teammates thats why they space they want the three ball there it is and it grazes the front rib thats Jake vanderhyde in the Bucknell transfer new 20 off the offensive rebound n they love long rebounds they go shag them well you want long rebounds you got to contend with long arms thats Taylor B Bowen just another 61 Postman that Leonard Hamilton can roll out yeah bull Bowen just is one of those long Defenders again Florida State Leonard Hamilton known for 610 611 guys with long Wing spans they can devour shots they get deflections and that lead the money on the opposite end here we go on Q Here Comes Josh nickelberry B Bowen little tear drop all right Mark you promised you said were going to get pictures of bubo and skiing thats what he did Growing Up in Vermont you made the promise on Saturday do we have the picture promise has been kept in is thanks for watching the other night too by the way our ratings just went up yeah I dont see too many 610 guys skiing in Vermont the picture is coming we promise theres Primo Spears in the game he turns it over he debuted in the SMU game over the weekend two for 14 from the field in that game and no assists yeah he really struggled really tried to force his game hes got to learn to play with his teammates period the ball movement here by North Florida that one does not go for miles and here comes Spears lead Jord down in scoring and assists last year this is green hes out of position right now playing the fiveman with the injury to cam Cory yeah cam corn coming back will be a big plus for Florida State they hope to have him back in the next couple of weeks at worst early January Applause Music Med time out on Music the Taylor B Bowen we promised you we would bring a 610 skier on the on the slopes of Vermont there he is the big fella watch three has two wins against Power five teams they beat Purdue in 2014 Illinois in 2015 this year they play five power conference teams in all already lost to LSU and Iowa Florida State tonight and then they still have Georgia and Miami and Mark um this was the shirt that Mark Driscoll was wearing when we talked to him this morning yeah Matt Driscoll it aint rocket science and its not all he wants his team to do dont do more do less just do what you can do dont try to do too much shoot the three ball then offensively go get the rebound thats what he tries to preach every day today thats what his teams do and thats why theyre dangerous in these games when they play against big money opponents Chandler Jackson Off the Bench sophomore point guard from Memphis now we asked him hey how do you match up against Florida State size and he didnt really deflect the question so much as to say if we start worrying about their length and where the Angles and the lanes might be we get away from what we do our Focus has to be on playing our brand of basketball as you saw there jayen Smith The Freshman cans another three yeah thats a classic example of what North Florida does and Matt gets frustrated when guys turn down to three he wants them to shoot the ball Id want to play for him thats a good recruiting pitch right there second chance here for Florida State Spears down low green good position and hes able to draw the fou watch how North quter they get into dribble penetration gaps theyve always got vision and they always have spacing thats why theyre good at what they do they keep it simple they keep it spaced and they share the basketball I like what coach Driscoll said he said if the threes arent falling its not the end of the world the end of the world is us not taking Music threes and anise the reason why is because he believes those long rebounds are rebounds that you dont have to be big to go get hes not worried about the size of his team hes worried about the fight and the quickness to get to a to get to a basketball long rebound fivepoint game coming up on the halfway points of this first half J enzi into the painted area kicks it back out vanderhyde in three so early on nine of the 12 field goal attempts are threes and all four makes from the field are from distance for UNF boy are they fun to watch if Im Florida State right now Im looking at every make one of my full court pressure Packers that was effective for about a two or three minute segment Id like to see the seminal go back to it out of their makes Here Comes Spears his second game with the team down the lane Nifty move and one for the myor Baba Miller but what an athletic long move by Baba Miller he took one step to the rim that took about a city blocks worth of space Miller has had his struggles from the free throw line this season in the south Florida game 4 for 13 from the stripe and he is now 6 for 19 on the season when you shoot it that that bad I think you go underhanded what they call gr Barry and well get the foul on Florida state eny with the drive to the basket Music 11d go you know Leonard Hamilton and talking to him today and an weve watched him for years now hes just a legend in the coaching profession he does such a good job of helping his players to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations hes not a yeller hes not a screamer hes more of a guy thats going to put his arm around a player but we saw a a different Leonard Hamilton today that he wanted to challenge his team he knew his team wasnt playing well he knew his team wasnt playing together and so hes really challenged his team to come out With Better Effort and its one thing to try hard its another thing to play hard his team tried hard the other night but they tried so hard they tried to do it all by themselves you got to play hard Music together yeah inconsistency has been the early season plague for Florida State and well get a reach in foul on Applause Music Smith a mark you think of it now with Jim beheim retiring with Mike Bray out at Notre Dame Leonard Hamilton is now the longest tene head coach in the ACC yeah Mike shashy now of course retired as well lot of legendary coaches have left the Music game Roy Williams the year before and obviously Rick patino at Louisville hes still coaching at St jobs but not in the ACC anymore right from Jen G a lot of changes Anish you got to you got to be willing to change with the Music times rebound by gainy poked away stays with it here comes Spears gives it up nickelberry threepointer not there Florida State struggling from the field Spears from the outside thats true I love what Spears did on that possession he passed up a shot for a better shot and then got it back off the offensive glass and was balanced to knock it down the game came to him on that possession he didnt force it s the big Easter assists LED Georgetown in scoring made his debut Saturday after the NCAA Grant at all twotime transfers immediate eligibility whats the difference for Primo Mark Adams tonight versus his FSU debut well his first game and even the first possession of this game he forced a pass but this last possession he gave up a good shot to give it to a teammate then he decided okay going to get here wait for the ball and the game came to him thats the biggest key for Primo Spears look this is a kid that got up at 600 am as a threeyearold every day with his dad Amir III and they would go to the basketball gym and work on his game and he had huge goals no one offered him a scholarship out of high school he went to prep school eventually went to Duan and then georget toown is to reading score and now here at Florida State perseverance patience thats what he needs tonight patience as a player yeah his dad was originally nicknamed primo and Amir was called L primo and now hes grown up and he gets to wear the Primo Music moniker and this team believes in Primo Spirits I talked to Darren Green a couple of days ago Darren Green Jr and and he talked about how Primo even when he wasnt playing in practice he was preparing like he was going to play the next day Darren Green also shared with me that Primo would watch him during the game and make suggestions as to how he could get open cuz Darren Green is known as a threepoint shooter hes add layers to his game but sometimes another set of eyes besides the coaching staff and thats what prbo Spears did for Darren Green and Darren Green has been playing really Applause well here is Spears at the controls using the pick from gainy now Music green shot clock at 10 spears the set back and it doesnt go the rebound grabbed by enzi thats a good shot he was matched up oneonone on the backside and they were Exposed on that side and so he decided to take him oneonone good decision J Enz no good gainy there for the Applause board Miller off the bounce his pass intercepted thats just careless lanir open for three and the battle for the board we will get a foul on lus good Music fou second foul on litus Florida State up by 8 North Florida without a field goal for almost 3 minutes yesterday we lost a true Giant in the ACC former North Carolina Center Eric montros passed away from cancer at the age of 52 he was the man of the middle on that 1993 NCAA Championship team he had been doing the games on the radio for several years at UNC and if you ever met him and I had multiple times covering UNC over the years about as nice a human being as youll find a lot of people have used the phrase gentle giant it could not be more apt and um all the best to the montros family in this time um just one of the alltime greats of this league a great player and a better human being his Tar Heel teammate Hubert Davis now the head coach of North Carolina said this I am devastated Eric was my friend he was my teammate Eric loved being a husband loveed being a dad he loved being a tarel he loved Carolina basketball I miss him on behalf of the ACC Network and all of us at the ESPN we send our condolences to Erics family and to the entire at the University of North Carolina and across the ACC Music landscape big size Advantage here for Baba Miller but he traveled yeah thats a force right there Baba Miller look he was looking over his shoulder he saw the second Defender coming when you see the second Defender that means you pass at that point theres somebody open on the backside get North Florida in a rotation forc that that play he came to Florida State last year remember he was suspended those first 16 games then missed his second game back he had tons solitis but the hype the hoop loss surrounding Baba Miller last year was on the level of a guy who could be a top five pick in the NBA draft production hasnt yet match typ but hes a guy when that light switch goes off and he figures it out I mean youre youre getting an all conference allamerican type of player potentially yeah from my Orca Spain look this is a guy that played on an international stage in a big stage with the 9 Spanish national team they won the FIFA 9 basketball World Cup in Hungary in 2023 and and he was a stud on that team this kid has not reached his potential yet I hate to use that word potential but he needs to slow down a little bit and read things take his time read it and make better decisions warley gets the two and the foul when you say slow down what does that entail so a lot of guys get sped up when you like for example as we take a look at warley going to the basket right here but if you think about the last possession of the when Boba Miller had the ball down the left hand block and he saw the defender coming to double team him thats when you make a pass thats not when you speed up thats when you slow down you read the defender and then you pass the ball and so he has to let again let the game come to him a little bit not Force action as much Leonard Hamilton echoed some of those sentiments he says when were playing as a team when the system as a whole is working Baba Miller will thrive and that could be for about everybody right now in the Florida State jersey and theyre showing that tonight huge Improvement in the way that they played not with each other on Saturday night against SMU they was played against each other offensively it seemed like at times another threepoint attempt and a foul as weve got a battle for the rebound and theyre going to get litus and that is number three no more B 11 L 63 teams n Friday night more mens basketball on accn PJ Hall and number 13 Clemson hosting Queens University Queens based in Charlotte then Notre Dame who was thumped by The Citadel tonight theyll host the Marist red foxes Mark youll be doing that Clemson Queens game on Friday I cant wait to see PJ Hall in person hes one of two players in the country to average over 20 points and Lead his team in Steel and block shots this kids a stud I love watching him against Memphis Clemson was undefeated going to Memphis lost a heartbreaker there bouncing back tonight and have Queens on stay now up to a terrific start under Brad Brownell Brads a great coach I love him I watched his teams at right state Im telling you he can take yours and beat his and take his and beat yours thats how good he is Mark that is the first twopoint field goal of the half of the game for North Florida and Anish were not surprised thats how they play here we go lanir from the outside six field goals five threes 15 of the 20 shots are threepoint attempts green for the answer its good and if he gets going Applause anywhere North Florida is like a Mike Leech Air Raid Offense when they run it youre surprised when they shoot it two youre Applause shocked 30 second timeout 30 second timeout well take one too with 459 left in the first half SS by Music 11 some people just know that the best rate for you is a rate based on you not one based on whatever this person is doing get a rate based on you with DriveWise in the allate Music app yum chil chil chilly chil though yum po Mel chili pour on Music is not for Florida State yep he is not happy Anish because the defensive transition of North Florida that last possession they were not getting back they were not covering Shooters theyre jogging across half court and Matt Driscoll used that timeout look at the black CH heres getting back settling in nobodys talking nobodys guarding wide open for the shot nobody in a stance thats why mat Driscolls upset Mark we mentioned how much they like to shoot the three they defend the three pretty well opponents under 30 from Beyond The Arc and how about the Baseline Drive and finish by lanir theres a deuce for you thats their birthday by the way Chaz ler yeah Darren Green one point away from 1500 for his career hes got the ball now a about it dumps it inside too easy for Miller

kick warley is not taking a three this season hes basically bagged the shot instead the Up and Under with the layup tough angle with the right hand yeah you do not have to guard him from the threepoint line but hes good enough to get into a gap and make a play 30 career threepoint shooter hes just said nope I want to be a slasher as lenir continues with a nice first half hes got 14 well Chaz lir we saw the dunk we saw the screen to get a shooter open and that time saw the three Applause ball Chaz lanir is dominating this game right now and bringing the ospre back twopoint shot yeah

the dunk for two B Bowen looked like he was sliding down the slopes right there to the rim I couldnt help myself an Applause isue how is he a just a skare or can he snowboard too have we established that we have not yet well see what we can find out foul for ju jayley ladies and gentlemen with his latest threepoint warley picks up his first foul 16th foul on FSU so one more and North Florida is in the bonus Leonard Hamilton has to feel good about the first half his team has responded offensively theyve shared the ball defensively theyve been downright stingy at times Applause lener again a game high 17 I love this kid holy cow can he play its been a breakout season for him he never even averaged Five Points a game in his career prior to this season came in averaging more than 15 and a half we get a foul 10th team foul and two shots on the way little step back right there totally balanced Pogo into his jump shot waves goodbye just fluid from chazin near hard to Basketball family Mark both parents played college basketball dad at lip scoop mom in Born State yeah lip Lenny aov and the a sun so will be playing against lipom this Music Applause Applause year ler picked up by B Bowen on the switch fla State on a stance already to help great Applause job Catch and Release not there save out of bounds to Florida State well and when Florida State when theyre in a stance and theyre engaged defensively their length is a real problem and itll be a problem in the ACC as well and Matt Driscoll and his North Florida team theyre figuring that out right now consistency is the key for Florida State they got to do that every possession theyve got the pieces its about figuring out how they fit here is Spears rainbow but no pot of gold and that takes us to Half Time 70 five of 11 from three a game high 17 for lanir four for n from Deep five of 10 from the field eight of the 10 field goals made by North Florida threepointers in that first half and how about lanir flip it reverse it give him 19 and that kid is a nightmare to defend this is against a long athletic Florida State Defense thats focused on him he is absolutely faying this defense theres green the answer do we know how to pick him an at halftime that is what you call strong strong producing by Shawn Jackson in the control room out of boys Shawn and team you guys Music rock off the shot fake Music litus lir again shot clock down to four forced that one good defense by FSU yeah if that went down Im running out of the Hoops cabin Applause screaming Baba Miller shot fake Drive dish watet lines it up and knocks it down well Florida state is in sync tonight shooting 57 from the floor sharing the ball a totally different team than the one that lost SMU a few nights ago boss cant finish theyre connected theres chemistry theres ball movement unselfishness again the extra pass warley the jumper left it short and the rebound to Barry Oscar Barrys brother Jordan is an NFL punter was with Pittsburgh last year both Australians theres the three from the outside by litus and Chaz lanir made it happen by driving along the Baseline TRW on two Defenders and all of a sudden Florida state was chasing the ball that was a hockey assist they need to count those basketball dont they that one they should have hes the one that created that opportunity for the Music shot almost another turnover for Baba Miller watch Chaz lanir in this hockey assist right here so its its his move right on the Baseline he finds the open man now Florida State cant catch up with the ball I like the way you thinking N I think we should count that as an assist now a lot of coaching staffs they will chart those plays internally yep great Point heres green I just think we need to bring that to the to the people I think we are right now thats how much pull We Have Tonight another three to go for Applause enie how about Dorian James Grandpa Applause James Ill tell you North Florida is fun to watch they were picked near the very bottom of the a sun 13th out of 14th theyre not finishing that low gaining finishing up high Baba Miller with the sweep pass inside Mark got to remember he was a guard for most of his career 62 at the age of 14 and then y shot up to 611 at 19 had that late growth spurt so hes kind of what you see in a lot of these European big men that have made a big mark on the NBA of late its a big body but with guard skills you know an Once Upon a Time America was more influential on the European game as we take a look at Barry just going right to the rim But as time has gone by over the last 20 years I think the European game has had more influence on the American game the way that its played the way that its spaced the way that theres a positionist offense big guys can handle they can pass they can shoot they can rebound little guys can do all the same things as well basketball has changed because of the European influence on American basketball thats a great Point especially when you look at some of the biggest stars in the NBA today yic Music donic got Giannis with Milwaukee yeah Yannis went for what 64 the other night yeah he wanted that ball tooer rejected warley fighting and hes got two shots yeah Giannis wanted the ball and then he said he won it for D Lillard who became like the fifth alltime greatest threepoint shooter or something like that I think he wanted it for himself initially thats just my guess cross 60 points thats a Keepsake oh Id keep it yeah I have 60 career warley is going to be interesting when we get into conference play hes a point guard hes what Leonard Hamilton likes 67 classic big guard at Florida State but with Primo Spears now becoming a factor and warley again has basically shelved the threepoint shot this season you wonder if there may be a different role for him in conference as a guy off the bench who can guard multiple positions who can maybe even be a small forward who can push your break handle the ball get you in transition versus kind of what he is now as you know your traditional starting point guard yeah and and you know the good news for him is that Leonard Hamilton plays a lot of guys and Id like to see Jaylen Wen be the guy that really gives you Pace that gets the ball up and down the floor that gives you pressure on the point of attack defensively thats where he fits hes never going to be an offensive Juggernaut but he can be a good distributor an uptempo guy and a hard pressure guy at the point of attack green too much dribbling and time out on Bo lets go ahead and have some fun here gy goes up strong this is NBA type play no boys allowed inside gy dunks it on heads well Leonard Hamilton after last season changed his approach on the transfer portal Florida state had taken transfers in before but they had never gone with the intention of going to go get four or five guys plug them in in Big Time rolls well well things started to change the last couple of years when the landscape of college basketball started to change Jaylen gainy was with Florida State last year he didnt play he was out all of last year but he gives you size on the inside they went and got Primo Spears they went and got jir Watkins and I go back to my ninth grade science teacher Miss Zach she had a sign in her classroom mark it said adapt migrate or perish and in college basketball youve coached you got to adapt yeah and all the old school guys that that dont like the transfer portal and even the fans that dont look its real and its going to stay and so you better adapt and one of those adaptations is that on your staff most schools now while they may not phrase it as a general manager most schools have a coach or multiple coaches who are on their staff that have one job be a general manager find the players that fit our style in advance dont wait to see whos in the transfer portal look at who fits your style the best look the other thing is Im sure there are Communications that are going on to certain players as to who fits where Im not naive that way and dont like it particularly but thats the way this thing works now and thats what youve got to do as a coach youve got to have a a great general manager that stays on top of every player at every division its not just division one guys theres division two and three guys could play as well yeah not to mention junior college is still a pipeline I I think thats where you get some of the consternation with fans though too lets say youre a team and you bring in a heralded recruiting class in the past you could as a fan dream on that recruiting class hey okay this guy might be a oneandone but if this guys here for 2 or three years if this guys here for four years imagine what we can be now the odds are maybe one guy in a four five man recruiting class finishes his career with the same team you cant have a spreadsheet if youre a coach three four years out youre basically season to season and really semester to semester well andise you take a look at a guy like Matt Driscoll he lost four players to the transfer portal that moved on to other schools that were really good players would have been back with him this year he says it was a lefthanded ACC that my players are that good and we develop them that well and they move on and thats one of the difficult situations for do more with less teams teams that dont have a lot of money or a lot of nil money and they cant keep their players because they cant pay him as much as everybody else does and thats a fact is the way that it goes you have been one of the biggest proponents of mid major since youve been doing this for ESPN theres got to be yes our guys are moving on but theres also got to be some helium coming out of the balloon when you go and find The unpolished Gem the diamond in the rough you develop him you polish him you turn him into a good player only to see the fruits of that labor be for somebody else well it is frustrating but it also works the other way where a guy thats a a fourstar festar recruit that washes out at an ACC school and then goes and plays you know at a different level at a what would be considered maybe a lesser level by some in college basketball so it does go both ways in that way litus hits the three to beat the shot Applause clock one more layer of this one more layer of this you can get better high school players at the mid majer level now because a lot of a lot of the bigger schools are going to you know that transfer portal now well you understand why right instead of backing on a high school kid youve got actual tape on a college Prospect against College competition Im a college baseball coach you know what my roster is 22 freshman and one softball you know why because theres a lot of really good baseball players that get passed over by division one teams I went the opposite of everybody else and we went 12 and five in the fall we have good players good freshman players I hope they stay with me hows your nil budget does that answer your question yeah it matters more than than you think these days even if you think it matters a lot it matters Applause more Mitri Moss had that shot altered by B Bowen Spears accelerating and its tapped back in by Deontay Green Well Florida state is so good when they get up and down and they they get pace and they are selfless with the basketball enzs three not there battle for the board and we get a jump ball b b in tied up with jide Applause Music Miles you just never feel like North for is out of this thing the way that they can just get three balls going theyll hit some spurts where they dont make anything and then theyll just start banging balls along the way that Driscoll team is never out of the game you almost expect them to take a three on every possession and you knock down three in a row in a game like this thats a thats a 90 run and maybe a span of a minute and change and now all of a sudden youre back into the game theyve taken 31 threes 11 twopoint field goals today heres Green from the outside that rolls out there it is and that is lir he wants someone shooting its him yeah and they know hes good and they give him the basketball every opportunity they can they space so well in their secondary break thats what I like them they spread the floor they put pressure on the defense right away nickelberry open for three cannot answer B Bowen offensive rebound and a foul on the floor its going to be on UNF bull Bowen right there with just a little subtle shove to go get the offense bless that shows the maturity of his game how hes getting better learning how to play physical and not get caught on the foul green with a Applause thunder all right so you just got dunked on can you run your offense keep your Poise and get a good shot nope inste a turnover loose ball on the floor comes back to Florida State of nickelberry Deontay green setting the screen Spears old Bowen is giving this team some good minutes tonight rain again got the dunk just grazed The Rim Yeah he felt that dunk he felt obligated to shoot that one thats when youre allowed you can just tell he wanted the Music ball and well get a reach in foul on the litus drive the Florida seminal when they see a lane they attacking Deontay green 69 210 from Asheville North Carolina slamming at Music home and the college football playoff selection committee did not care Florida State didnt get one of the four spots in the playoff despite being undefeated and a power five conference Champion will play Georgia in the orange bll those were the first two teams left out I find it interesting mark because the Allure of college basketball and especially March is that anything can happen when you play the games Florida State played the games and I get it Jordan Travis their quarterback got hurt theyre not the same offense without him but we saw pretty darn good defense in the ACC championship against Louisville and oh by the way the secs best do Conference win as a league was kys win over Louisville thats League wide different issue there but the point Im trying to make Mark is if you look at the final four in basketball last year and you had a selection committee that was tasked with picking who they thought could win a game youre telling me that fa you would have been in youre telling me San Diego State would have got the benefit of the doubt even Yukon in Miami a four seed two fives and a nine got to the final four its what makes college basketball great you get the opportunity to play the games you get Villanova over Georgetown you get Jimmy V in NC State you get Butler and backto back championship games thats what makes this fun all Florida State football did was win every single game and we were told no theres a group of people who just dont think youre qualified enough because we dont think youre one of the best four because your quarterback got hurt and theres no other way to win a football game well and look what Florida state did after that injury as we take take a look at Primo Spears going right to the rim and finishing up right there but this is a team that won without their quarterback they changed they morphed they were well coach they figured it out and they won big games in order to stay undefeated I I dont understand in college basketball theres brand bias thats just a fact theres brand bias and there are so many teams at the mid major level who have been left out of the NCA tournament now Florida state is not mid major they won three national championships uh with their football program theyve been dominating other sports like womens soccer for example seems to Wi National Championship all the time at Forida State this is a this is a school and a program thats Elite in every way and they lose a quarterback and dont make the final four Ill tell you why its because of brand FS because the brand because Talking Heads like us talk more about Alabama and how great they are versus how Florida State deserves to be in and thats an opinion thats a fact and it was an Alabama team that while yes they did go and beat Georgia in the SEC champ ship it was an Alabama team that lost at home to Texas they nearly were upset by USF South Florida and then needed a miracle fourth and 31 play to beat an Auburn team who the week before had lost to New Mexico state and if were going to have the argument right oh its the four best teams I think by most of objective measures Georgia is one of the four best teams arent they so it almost feels sometimes we move the goal post and I feel for Florida State they did everything they were supposed to do you cant control injuries and I get it that injury Cory is part of the selection committees process where they can dock a team if a key player is injured but when you watch Florida State football it wasnt just one guy it wasnt just Jordan Travis they had a defense they had other players um other teams got the benefit of the doubt they did not we see it all the time in the NCA tournament look when you have a net process where nobody knows how it works but thats one of the one of the key tools is how we determine get the NCA tournament give me a break give me a break I dont even know I dont know what the algorithm I dont even know what an algorithm is and I have no idea how you get the NCA tournament based upon that but anyway well get back to the basketball game here as FL state is starting to get things going Music offensively largest lead of the game for the seals theyre starting to pull Applause away here comes Spears kick to B Bowen another rainbow back iron rebound to James Florida State they have shown that explosiveness tonight this is the team that we saw beat Colorado this is team that had double digit leads on the road against Georgia and North Carolina and then really fell upon some hard times look lard Hamilton needed to do brain surgery this week he was more psychiatrist than he was basketball coach and this team has responded toight and he told us those games against UNC into Georgia against North Carolina up by 14 in the second half again against Georgia up by 17 in the second half even though the final result in those games was an L it also shows you what this team can be now you got to put it together for 40 minutes thats the second part of the equation heres the lob down low beonce green ran out of real estate comes back to Jackson his three hits the back iron but thats beautiful basketball right there Primo Spears makes the simple pass and then theres the extra pass the open shooter thats where Florida state was not playing together just about 72 hours ago theyre playing together Applause tonight he can make a big difference Primo Spears can make a big difference for this team weve seen how warley is is willing to accept his role now if Primo Spears can keep the game simple do what he did as a threeyearold kid with his dad the gym just fundamentally make smart basketball plays hes grown up that way now he needs to play that way way and he is tonight I know he got fouled there but thats not what lonard Hamilton wants to see from Spears you mentioned it earlier if hes a guy with his skill set that can get everybody else involved then he becomes the Difference Maker that Florida State needs yeah look theres three players around him Anish look three guys in dark jerseys surround him what does that mean somebodys open pass the ball right here but he can make a difference cuz he can get by Defenders hes really lightning quick in the open court situations hell figure it out I mean he had to carry a crappy Georgetown team a year ago hes probably not over that Applause yet time out osr could not get it inbounds 74 to 49 its the largest lead of the game an Mark Adams Mark you called Florida States game Saturday against SMU whats the difference between Saturday and tonight Leonard Hamilton talked about that this team needs to utilize their system to Sprint the spots check to attack more but attack together check and then to get in sync by being unselfish check Darren Green Jr is a really good offensive threat for Leonard Hamilton and he has sprinted the floor and found his spots and knock down shots look this is a head coach that likes to put his arm around his players and tell them how good they are and how much they can they can give to the team etc etc but this coaching staff had to challenge this team this week over the last couple of days since that lost snu and this team has responded perfectly tonight two more tuneups after this before Florida state gets into league play they had the game against UNC but league play in Earnest starts January 3rd at home against Georgia Tech and the good news for the nolles first three ACC games all at the Tucker center part of a seven game home stand this is just game two of that homeand in Florida State on its way to a w up comfortably on the Music ospr Florida state at 51 from the field 41 from three 11 different players have scored and the nlls on the verge of ending this four game losing streak up by 25 on the ospray of North Florida Leonard Hamilton along with Stan the Man Stan Jones who coaches up the big men and he got winth you got lipam couple of games to work on the chemistry the continuity mesh together and then league play starts Georgia Tech weve seen theyre going to be a tough out Virginia Tech another one and Wake Forest since they got their big guy eligible hit from Gonzaga that looks like a different team Wake Forest is a team that could play to the second weekend of the NCAA tournament theyre rolling right now Anish one of the hardest things to do in coaching is to come back off your Christmas break after the 22nd and not look past lipin Lenny aov can coach Darren Boyd L can can score a lot like what were seeing tonight from this North Florida team and then youve got that Gauntlet heading into the Music ACC Aton Reed is the big Center for Gonzaga he was granted eligibility about four or five games ago came back against ruers as Primo Spears coasts in and he has changed the calculus for Steve Forbes they finally have a big theyve got great guards and great perimeter players around him Steve Forbes was an assistant witch to State back in the day when wit state was was dominating everybody with Greg Marshall the head coach at that time and then Forbes goes on to East Tennessee State built that that program into a perennial winner and now working his magic at Wake Forest as well really good coach Steve Music Forest its been really interesting watching Florida State now attacking the zone you know when you play for what will be a Hall of Fame coach good ball movement right here you got to trust the system and their system works unselfishness move the ball hit the offensive glass communicate as a team were seeing that tonight another offensive rebound for Florida State simplify less is more just do what you do go out and get the offensive rebounds like they just did and then the coaches were firm they didnt put their arms around anybody sometimes players got to hear the truth and Florida State needed to hear the truth after the SMU game and that truth has registered with them tonight Deontay green called for the travel and Leonard Hamiltons been successful he along with all the things you said part of the formula is have tall players have size have length and have depth now his best teams they routinely played 9 10 11 guys and almost Hockey style line changes its a formula thats worked well last year the injury bug really hit the team hard especially early in the year when they went 1 n but this is a team when you look at what they did before the last two seasons when they missed the NCAA tournament 2021 they won the ACC reached the sweet 16 no NCAA tournament 2020 that was a really good FSU team sweet 16 in 2019 Elite 8 in 2018 he didnt forget how a coach2 time out Florida State no hes a Hall of Fame coach and hes had such an influence on so many coaches across the landscape of college basketball you can call him anytime and he will answer the phone young coaches he ran into Rob laner of SMU at a junior college back when they were when Rob was just starting off and lard Hamilton saw this young coach in Rob lir and walked over to him and said do you want to be a head coach someday and Rob ler said yes and he gave Rob the keys of the castle was to how to do it to not just be a recruiter to be a guy that that Scouts that schedules that does all the things that a head coach does dont just be a recruiter that goes on the road and finds guys and Leonard Hamilton has mentored so many young coaches theyre head coaches today Dennis gates at Missouri extremely influencer a mentor to Dennis Gates including Bill s Andy Enfield I could go on and on and on as to how Leonard Hamilton has impacted the game of basketball to the relationships that hes created and fostered and mentored young coaches into head coaches hes paid it forward a Pioneer in many ways as well warley machetes through the defense Watkins down low too strong B Bowen the follow B B has had a really nice night hes been really active really engaged really athletic now when he goes home for Christmas dont go skiing do not go skiing no not in not in season in the off seon if you can if you can find uh some slopes in the summer I dont know how cold it gets up there in Vermont if if theyre open over in hillington or wherever it is they go go to Switzerland in April you have a Music Applause chance oh back door cut and a foul and two shots for enzy Music Applause Music second we we were also mentioning how influential Leonard has been really on so many levels for college basketball he was the first black basketball coach in the SEC worked for joob beh Hall Kentucky he started his career in 1971 as an assistant coach of Austin P State he recruited the great fly Williams back then yeah and he was so devastated when Lake Kelly the Austin P School president passed him up for the head coaching job when that opened up he said Im done with this went and became a Salesman for down chemical that lasted about one week Joe B Hall Came Calling and then he became that first black assistant coach of Kentucky and you got to remember the time that was only about five years after Kentucky had integrated yeah yep Tom Payne Tom Payne was the first black player to play at Kentucky he was 7 feet Applause tall yeah Leonard Hamilton has impacted this game in so many ways and Mark I know you remember this because he was at Kentucky for a decade which is probably about twice as long as he should have been there and he was passed up for a lot of openings finally Oklahoma State Came Calling he got that program turned around got Miami turned around in the 90s had the oneear stint with the Wizards and then it has been a remarkable two decade plus run in Tallahassee well look n theres the reason why Leonard Hamilton mentors young coaches today to do everything that that you need to do to be a head coach if you look at a strong move to the rim right there and some contact back into the line but really what happened was is that most AfricanAmerican coaches in the 70s and 80s were basically pigeon hold into being recruiters only they werent given the opportunities to coach on the floor in many cases I I saw it myself and over the course of time finally guys like Leonard Hamilton would break through and prove themselves and it took way too long for it to happen but Leonard Hamilton is one of the guys that that the John mclenon of the world for example and now the Leonard Hamilton of the world that have carried on that Legacy from coach mclenon theres a reason why basketball is better today than it was back then and its because of the Leonard Hamiltons world that now are head coaches and should be head coaches and its getting better every Music year again good ball movement extra pass Watkins is fires but Florida state will take the process of get getting that shot heres Moss through the trees and he gets the two Demitri Moss taking it strong to the rim right there G point guards 55 G attitude we get a timeout 323 to go in regulation theres a little more to Leonard Hamiltons lets call it secret sauce more on that when we come Music back and theres Deontay green who might have learned a few recipes from his head coach this is a guy that learned his passion for food from his father D green whos been a renowned Chef for over 20 years the first dish he learned how to cook chicken parmesan he says a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered with tomato sauce and mozzarella was 13 when he started to follow his dads Footsteps in the kitchen look I dont know whats going to be like around Christmas for the Florida state seminal but with Coach ham and with Deontay green Id like to be invited Tommy DeVitos ears just perked up on chicken Applause farm do you cook Anish um boy I use that word Loosey I I try but I I would not be a what you would call anything close to a good cook to be honest my wife would probably tell you Im a fire hazard in the kitchen Music Applause yeah Im just the grill guy around here its an important role it is I I can make a decent omelet pancakes theres some breakfast food but once you start getting into stuff where youre measuring it out and you got steps yeah and well call in Deontay green then if uh if we have a problem its like playing with a point guard with no handle green for three Darren Green has had a big game hes got 254 6 threp pointers how about this that is the 15th game in his career with five or more threes yeah I started following him at at UCF and as a freshman just saw a special young talent that understood how to get open and man what a quick draw from threepoint L and and he has perfected that quick draw over the course of his career there he seemed just stepping right with his jump shot knocking it down the guys really worked hard at his craft and a really good person as well hes also a guy that during his career at UCF hes started his own clothing line during that time and he actually sent me some Tshirts and some shirts and things I wore them I still wear them I got Darren Green tshirts I wear around springb a youre get me one of your own Branch off brants now see if you can get maybe a CO license from Darren Green I love gear Im all about gear most coaches are love gear and hes another guy too Mark once Florida State figures out Rhythm and flow and can harness the talent on this offense green is as good of a shooter as youll find in the ACCC when the ball is moving and hes getting open looks look out yeah he and hes a gamewinner guy too Anish hes not afraid of the big spot I saw that early on in his career as a freshman hes not afraid to take and make big shots regardless of who hes playing against I just love his demeanor and when he gets into an offensive flow it really flows through the Music basket North Florida about to see its modest threegame win streak come to an end theyve had some bright spots Jaylen Smith a freshman hes had bright spots this year had 15 in the game against Iowa 13 against LSU and certainly Chaz laner 22 points tonight he has opened some eyes with the way hes played against this Florida State Defense with all the Sid and athleticism Baba Miller rolls in for two yeah Chaz number two for North Florida at 64 about 200 lb boy if he continues to develop I like his future Beyond college basketball this kid has wow some serious skill in athleticism mil launches and hits oh Mark youve coached in the mid major ranks when you play an nonconference schedule like the ospre do with LSU and Iowa and Florida State Georgia and Miami still to come it highlights your weaknesses but it also tells you where youre good especially if you can have those moments against quality teams that you know have access to better players how do these games help you when get into conference you know they only help you if you can stay uh mentally and psychologically positive sometimes you get beat down so bad that its its hard to come back from it you got to convince your players theyre better than they think they are and that thats where these games especially when you play multiple bu games in a row it can really affect your team psychologically and it could take you weeks to get them back to where you want them to be so theres the pluses of getting challenged and find out what your weaknesses are but theres also the minuses of getting challenged and find and finding out what your weaknesses are the old Winnie the pool line right youre braver than you believe youre stronger than you seem smarter than you think and Matt Risco will tell them more love than you know final seconds take off Florida state with a 9175 win against North Florida the seminal sna their four game losing streak and they still have five more games to go on this hom stand
