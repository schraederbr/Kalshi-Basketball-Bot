competitor and good uh Challenge on their hands a series that dates back to 1977 Mustangs got that first one its been all Stanford since they renew the engagement here in the 2425 campaign and we are underway with the Cardinal controlling the opening tip a run through Reno he has been first class this season getting better and better culminating in this senior campaign heres a look at the starters for Stanford well talk a lot about Rau of course but a lot of other Talent here Jaylen Blakes has been a welcome addition the transfer from duke heres the give to camon at the shot clock buzzer and Aiden camman able to hit and all set up by the drive by uh Jaylen Blakes quick movement calply wasting no time loaded up three ball back iron and Reno is there for the rebound Stanford now looking to push in transition sellers good battle getting after that basketball Ryan agarwall and will stay down this end well theres the one challenge to another challenge that if youre Cal PA youve got to keep the taller Cardinal off the glass they keep a lot of balls alive good height out there 71 Reno thought about the triple camman goes 610 some big bodies down low looking in for Reno hell draw a lot of attention a double maybe a triple team little save there shot clock to five double clutch and and drawing the foul that was oiah sers the USC transfer now good second effort uh Greg you can see Maxim R gets inside loses control of the ball but what a great save in there uh underneath and so uh you know to get rewarded from that save its just if you can get extra possessions in a game like this its going to make a difference first free throw rattles in for sellers Nor Cal guy from Hayward making the move over from USC he had 12 points last time out that lost to Grand Canyon 78 71 down in Palm Springs first loss of the year for the Stanford now six And1 but hes an unselfish player hes put up some numbers but he hasnt put up big numbers but he can War nothing start little pick and roll nice dump to the hoop and C is there now they attack the rim youd think theyre just a threepoint shooting team but theyre really Adept of getting inside of the basket to the rim bles REO the hook on the turn rebound Coral there by C little trouble getting out to the back court now the Mustangs on the Move theyre four and four on the year coming off Wi over Grambling and letting it go from Deep their Mantra Let it Fly well and they did that because again theres really no point guard designated point guard whoevers got the ball will lead the break and so now defensively in transition youve got to get back and get the ball stopped and match up the players just that fast 54 now there in front Stanford staff Kyle Smith well aware of the challenge this calp team will present not taking them lightly at all Oh shot clock winding down to six Blakes back iron on the threepointer calp now in transition this is where they can be absolutely deadly drawing a crowd good pressure there from the Stanford Cardinal and they force the turnover yeah an extra dribble thats you know obviously cause a tri cause a turnover but thats the basket inside uh Greg and what you find again is a team that can go inside outside just when you think youre solving this team they they give you the inside out side attack its its not its its not just one or the other its both theres a look at head coach Kyle Smith year one leading the Stanford Cardinal Lakes now as Reno looks to set up shop instead theyll swing it Benny Gills come on Little Euro through the lane the kick to agar wall thats pure well great setup by Benny giler the Euro created the threepoint shot nice job by Giller coming off the bench 75 lead two team te that can get up into the 80s so we could see a flurry of offense here tonight as a whistle there sell is on the bump well heres the three and you can see how its set up Greg you know you got you got the penetration Benny geler gets by his guy with the with the Euro Step three guys Converge on the ball and he finds the open guy and you know Benny giler was a starting point guard in the first several games and there he goes on a steel the takeaway by Giller to the Hoops scooping and hitting instant impact Off the Bench well yeah I was just going to say you stole my words how about this impact on the game but you know so far thats pretty quick again intensity pressure on the defensive end a tie up and the AR will keep things down this way well another Benny giler uh tie up at least the one that he cause he put his hands on the ball you know I I love his attitude hes you know he had such big games early in the year now hes coming off the bench but you dont see a drop off in his effort thats what you look for at Players no matter what your stats are if youre struggling give beard hes doing that challenge here on the Baseline and they have to call for time believe a timeout was called and not a 5second viation as we look at the calply starting lineup Jared Haider well traveled in his six season of basketball one of the key holdovers but three of the four that came from Colorado Mesa in the starting lineup for calal they bring a winning culture from that division they do they do and Mike de George is no stranger to success and Im talking about big success Greg hes hes won on a national level level and hes got guys that understand a winning formula that theres something to be said about that I dont care what division youre in I coached division 2 and my best players division 2 could play division one I promise you that and I had some guys that played in the NBA from division 2 so that that doesnt make any difference and then theyve got Jared Haider who is a veteran we talked about that coach to George and the staff uh you know were able to to secure Jared Haider who was just never really healthy but when he was healthy at Cal he was a good basketball player but and hes healthy now so look at the stats look what hes done for his team it was able to get back in the lineup on a regular basis last year after battling through those injuries Fresno State then Cal and on to Cal ply year one for Mike de George so a couple of coaches in their first season with new programs having to retool those rosters three ball on the way here and REO there to control that board on the Isaac Jessup try now giler looking to go coast to coast sers is going Baseline good kick close out there from calp now left alone triple just circling around the rim good fight there from sers officials will check with each other well stay down this end our crew Bert Smith Jeff Pon Clare Aubry on this Saturday night 95 Stanford veteran officials uh but theyre doing a good job and you know again speaking of a good job C if you look at the Stanford uh Team you know theyre doing a good job Greg of keeping the ball alive there three possessions now that theyve just you know theyve extended the possessions and thats huge and just about a near line change for calp as off the Baseline there on the inbound giler cant connect from downtown calp they want to run and Gun theyll keep the bodies Applause fresh heres haer draws a crowd and now bondle to the basket off the window tough finish inside for Peter bondle I dont know how he got that up off the glass he like a pinball machine he knocked off he knocked around and off three Stanford Defenders before he finally got that shot off M bumping into his own guy on the way down as well sellers now probing that defense everyone Fades away just coming up short I think he was surprised to find himself that open youre right Greg cuz he was wide open heres Bond The Freshman from Slovenia giving off now Ma rener thought about that step back three shot clock to 15 the dive once again to the basket up fake and finishing around the hoop its Ethan men I like their ability you know Cal the must to be able to go up and finish around the basket theyre really clever inside 99 score now men is a guy that has battled through a variety of injuries missed two full seasons essentially good to see him back health the Reno top of the perimeter all net Maxim Reno drills it Greg how about no hesitation out of your sevenfooter I mean he gets it there its automatic hes going to put it up if you give him an inch 40 from downtown coming in but on the other end the Mustangs and M rener wasting no time well they must as a staff and program spend a lot of time on those block areas just working on footwork because theyre so good down there all of their players know how to finish around the rim this is a veteran group a couple of guys in their sixth year they have been been around Reno meanwhile just too big well if you dont know this many you know he likes to go up that left right shoulder with the left hand hes so good with his left Elliot now little oneonone going up against Sellers and didnt have enough there and thatll bring us to the under 16 Reno the man theyve come to see one of the best in the country floating at home with the Music left for e e e e and welcome back to Maples Pavilion calply and Stanford and we look at the Mustangs last year these are some tough numbers coach four and 280 and 20 in the big West and no surprise there change at the top yeah and you know what when you have those that kind of year you know you only got one place to go Greg thats up and I think theyre on an upward uh spiral here uh coach did George again has been very successful hes brought in the veteran coaching staff around him Jesse through it one of the coaching members who was sat on that Stanford bench for a number of years so theyve got some guys that that can coach and they AB absolutely have some guys that can play uh who are experienced so I think youre going to see those numbers go way up six seasons the Colorado Mesa five straight NCA attorneys The Last 5 Years two sweet 16s and last year 29 and five and matter of the level as you said thats still winning basketball it Music translates shot clock to 10 Blakes fading and get the rattle yeah he gets inside the paint hes pretty tough to to guard kick and well keep it down here as Stanford getting to their bench Chisum akara has come on as we get a second look watch watch how easily Blakes gets into the basket freezes you goes up over the top hes really adapted doing that thats one of his signature moves had a breakout performance against Grand Canyon career high 22 points in the loss good swing driving Baseline and trying to stuff off the mark that was Luca tarat coming up just short now Blakes in transition trailer loaded up from three and thats off the side Rim as Anthony Batson has come Applause on moving back door and a whistle this Cal Poly team coach they do not stop moving no how about the back cut I mean thats a give and a go you want to see textbook back basketball but watch this heres the Miss dunk and actually a little bit of blocked ball there but theres the give and the go and the foul they had to take a foul otherwise it was going to be two but thats one of the hardest things in basketball uh Greg is when you pass and now the balls move now your man man act Cuts in front and behind you you got to lose you lose sight of your man and thats how you get beat free throws good there for Owen C first year here with calply three seasons with Colorado Mesa he was an all conference performer there you see the little things the Mustangs are doing going back door trying to dunk sending little messages here theyre going to bring that intensity well the other thing theyre doing is theyre outscoring stand for 8 to four in the paint and and really I would have count that as two thats almost thats 10 to four because theyve got the ability to attack the basket you know thats an advantage for them against a lot of teams Giller left alone all net from threepoint land Benny Giller knocks it down a huge shot from Benny quickly the other way and a takeaway the rip akara now and he loses the handle trying to save that ball keeps it in bounds and calpol able to recover coming up on the 12 minute Mark here first half akara now he draws the crowd top of the perimeter three the height there for the moment pay dividends but calply hustling coming up with that board Jessup the give to the basket what a stuff rebound controlled there by tarat skip it to the corner ends up being an alleyoop and tarl after he was denied just stuck with the play well and and Stanford can never quite get catch up with the ball Greg I mean now we have an over and back call kind of a careless play but you know Stanfords just scrambling on defense and you kind of have to do that against this calp team it just seemed like they were always one pass behind and then you gave up the uh actually the air ball on the tip you dont expect that you got to play every ball like a Miss whether youre on offense or defense but you know you see Stanford going back to their original guys you got Max Reno back in the game um a little bit of a fall off when he goes out you dont have that threat inside so hes back here and he doesnt just give you the the offensive end he gives you the defensive end as well and hes such a focal point he opens up avenues for other guys on on the court he draws the crowd gets everyone else involved if hes not the one scoring well Stanfords in the zone now Greg they going out to the Zone theyre playing the two3 good move actually good call by Cal Smith I like it Jessup tries to shoot over it dangerous pass there Reno quickly moving towards the bucket with the left well you know they couldnt get the ball inside enough to Maxim Reno you know and they did Theres Benny geler getting out in the passing Lane but wow you you got to like maxing raino but what about Benny giler lets take a look at Benny hes been a little bit out with a cold streak hes back hes hot he measures and hes on Music fire e e e e e welcome back and you wont be surprised to know Maxim Reno part of a stellar list of nominees for the Kareem Abdul Jabar award the watch list revealed heres the ACC contingent and look at his numbers well Greg hes got my vote if thats you know if those stats hold up I mean and so far they have but that look at hes double up on everybody and those are some good players in Lampton Reed you know I mean those guys can play um so if he can he can continue with this pace which is going to be difficult because going into every game hes at the top of the Scouting Report hes at Stanford back in the zone again Greg nobody get out to the corner got a little bit fortunate there calpal will take that all day a airball from tarat from downtown left all alone looking to roll and a little misc connection there between agar wall and REO you know its interesting in Maxim Reno he said I you know he took responsibility like hey my hands werent up you look for me and I should have been been ready I I like that the 7ot leader I mean whether it was his fault or not I like anybody that takes responsibility Zone still there hder going to move around this Zone see if they cant maybe shoot over it or drive through it spinning and a shuffle a couple of minutes here for car yeah and Greg if you look carefully there are times when Stanford will go through with Cutters and other times they wont so its very confusing Kyle Smith has always had that in his bag of tricks its a matchup Zone and it starts in a two three uh turns into a manto man after a pass or two or depending on where the ball is on the floor uh that defense has always been good for him K Smith coming over after an excellent run with Washington state knows how to build a program geler thought about that step back instead Ray no not shy can it speaking of not being shy a sevenfooter that never hesitates when hes got the ball up there he tees it up and lets it go he had 29 and 11 as we showed you earlier against Grand Canyon can absolutely fill it up for the Stanford team and his growth from his freshman season till now so so impressive sh clock to eight timer out of five little post up down low Lefty jump hook ma rener Cool C collect well he was cool com the student section trying to give him a little early count he wasnt he wasnt buying a Greg he said no I got more time giler not wasting any time back rim and rener with the board hder in transition from three off the back iron so calp struggling to get locked in from downtown now one for seven from Beyond The Arc Reno draws a crowd giler the dish agarwall top of the perimeter that one looked to be good just rattling out yeah hes been a little streaky lately he can shoot it though Ed wall on the other end going hard off the window that was Bond trying to make something happen again a frantic ftic Pace calp totally comfortable with this no and I like Stanford theyre looking for opportunities if they have some I like that selective way of going cant leave him alone and Reno goes long on the three Applause ball well get a whistle down here watch uh Maxim REO Greg he I mean you know youve got to get up there and honor that its just not its just not your nature your human nature rather to just rush out to a sevenfooter but if you hes on the floor youve got to get out on him because he has shot from the floor 40 from three and thats not a fluke of a number hes hes nailed the shots before on the cut beautiful dish excellent score from oziah sers love his ability to slash oai oiah sers Greg can really get to the rim and contort his body but he gets there six starts last year for the Trojans on this end three balls continue to struggle sellers now on the move going oneonone just off the side Rim had a chance to get that off the glass amongst the trees with Reno tough sledding hes still there they have to kick it out and a foul yeah I love it Greg hes still there youre right the sevenfooter is not disappearing hes not going to fall down hes not going to get subed out hes there you got to deal with it and go over the top they didnt want to do that I mean thats the thats the presence of Maxim REO hes and I I really think this is significant they have only blocked a shot but theyve affected at least four or five and so theyve taken a team that shot 62 the first timeout down to 46 and theyve done it by affecting the shot and challenging when you have someone whos 71 standing down low it makes you think two times three times before you put that ball up were seeing that here for the Mustangs drive and kick open look on the corner and ball shot clock did not reset heres the kick from three that is what Cs trying to do Owen C on the second effort no he can hes hes bottoms I mean you give him a look up there 90 from the line and he can knock down threes averaging 14 points per game coming in Blakes again Reno being fronted draws a quadruple team just about everyone showed up for calply yeah he he hesitated he brought the ball down and big guys when they bring it down bad things happen under eight to play first half little back door dish around the way and able to hit Co sliding in behind Reno the quick ball movement for the Mustangs paying dividends 2622 Stanford leading Mustangs hanging tough chipping away theyre down four e e e e e well you know you might not outs score this calpo team theyre averaging 80 but youve got to do it with your defense watch the Stanford defense Greg thats that theyre just getting out in the passing Lanes theyre getting some easy baskets theyre making it tough getting their hands on a lot of balls I mean theyre coming up with opportunities here and with block shots uh denying passing Lanes I mean theyre just doing it by making it difficult on the defensive end and you know again you you know you just youre going to have a tough time outscoring them but youre going have to play defense and Stanfords doing that and as those highlights showed you Stanford eight points off turnover so making something out of those takeaways in front 2622 coming out of the timeout heres Blakes he draws a crowd see Jaylen Thompson has come on shot clocked to eight kick agarwall for three all net for Ryan agall the rich sophomore from CLE Texas oh and a nice look from Cayman to get him the basketball out of a double great job Stanford pushes in front now 2922 the drive here little contact and cant get it to go but free throws coming the bump there from sers heres heres you know the the dribble out there ready to double team he dribbles out on the floor camman does and he just finds his teammate behind a screen two things going on there the pass and the screen allowed Agarwal to get the look if you let Ryan agal get some open looks hes going to knock him down Greg hes very capable threepoint shooter he you know his percentages hasnt been great on the year but hes been kind of streaky but when he gets it going hes bottoms beer returns as Kieran Elliot to the line knocks down the first Elliot also a transfer hes an interesting story from West Texas AM the team that eliminated Colorado Mesa last year enjoyed what he s of Mesa so much and their staff and Coach to George he was on board to come to calal when they got the job how about this relationships relationships relationships they pay off giler now facing a double Blake spinning scooping and hitting how about the contact he hit hard and he spun off cant relax or celebrate a score not when theyre moving the ball this fast from Beyond The Arc cant hit second opportunity coming rer down low take it off the rim big block from Thompson coach to George cannot believe there was not a Goen on that play seemed go eligible thats for sure well he said look that ball was up and coming down Blakes again turning the corner now stepping back and hitting picking up where he left off against Grand Canyon first the drive now the step back looking down low they love to work under the basket those Baseline back door cuts and you got to come away with something there you cant come away empty he could have drawn a foul just hurried it giler coming up on six minutes to play first half Blakes foul line jump just curls off the rim hustle there from cam and then a whistle looks like he was pushed trying to get past the defense but you want to talk about a really tough move watch the spin by Blakes to the rim hang time I mean thats just splitting two Defenders and going up he is so dangerous in the lane youre guarding him you need one you dont need one you need a man and a half maybe two that is a move that I like to try and break out every now and again at the YMCA well if you can do that Greg im youll be my my dra draft pick youre going to be on my my my top pick if I you can give me that look that results in a couple of turned ankles my own we get back to it here 3324 giler now back to Blakes the man of the moment right now Blakes timer to seven now from long range little bit of a heat check there couldnt get that one to go and now the Mustangs on the move again pushing the tempo right to the basket stripped Blake comes up with it agarwall thought about a three takes it down the lane the kick all day rattles around and gets the maples Bounce aara from distance well he needed that hes been knocking on the door with the three this year but he nailed that one friendly bounce I might D two years at Harvard first year at Stanford answering here Usman vasilich now Stanfords now in the Run and Gun Game and not sure that they want to be doing this up and down like this but Cal prob sure doesnt mind they love the action of getting up and down and different guys in there oh they had a back door cut didnt see it fighting for the ball its Blakes to the hoop able to put it home what hustle well they didnt pay attention to Jaylen Blakes because hes sneaky hes sneaky fast and he was able to keep it alive uh when nobody else thought he was there talked about the effort against Grant Canon had the game winner against Santa claraa he has been a huge ad back iron there on the finger roll from Elliot giler now end to end fading and youre right Stanford theyre being drawn into this frantic Style by calp but its paying off in some respects because theyre getting a rips like this Blakes now takes the bump and theyll get a blocking foul against calply well I dont know about you Greg but the fans like it I mean theyre getting their moneys worth I mean who doesnt like to watch an up and down transition fill game uh but love it watch the action here just a lot of loose balls a lot of teams getting out on the break leading break fast breaks one onone one on two you know and its so hard to get back in transition and stop the ball because again youre just backpedaling or sprinting back just to cover ground the guy with the ball always has the advantage a he knows where hes going and hes got to head of steam youre just trying to fight get your body balanced enough to get your feet in front of people so a smart play there to draw the foul by Jaylen Blake and you saw that change before last year in college basketball that emphasis on drawing charges out in the open floor and really trying to make it so that it was a true charge too many people trying to just get in front of players it was too dangerous people could get hurt that way and so thats been a point of emphasis for the officials as out of the inbound as a travel now good point uh re and I think the officials have cleaned it up I think its been good for the game but you know now you got to really be solid be set um now interestingly Stanfords going back uh you know full CT press to two 2 two one back to two and then they match out of it back to their man Isaac Spears has come on originally from Montana State Long Range triple and thats an airball and that attempt from Logan mcglaughlin and with that were to the under four timeout Stanford finding their stroke from downtown it helps when youre in your home gym you get the friendly roll and then Blakes a little bit of everything for the card yeah e e e e Music welcome back here to Stanford where the Cardinal using their hustle using one of their new additions Jaylen Blakes coming over from duke highly tatt recruit a fourstar top 100 recruit out of Blair Academy originally from Somerset New Jersey coach you know how it is at a place like Duke a lot of talent can be tough to get on the court now hes getting a big opportunity and making the most of it than youre exactly right Greg and you know theres an old saying and you give somebody an opportunity and you you had preparation guess what you got success and thats what this young guys done hes taken advantage of his opportunity he has prepared and he stepped it up I mean hes having a great first start uh first start of the year for for himself oh beautiful back door look to raino who does not miss from there 40 to 27 well interestingly that was the first time theyve got the ball to him Point Blank at the basket and like you say he knows what to do now looking to go up against the Big Man Down Low they again move that basketball around because he provides such a daunting presence down low they have to get rid of it shot clock to seven haer on the drive the kick fading and unable to hit off the back rim there that was bondle again looking for the three ball its been a struggle here for calp now three for 14 from downtown coming up just short there was Reno and out the Mustangs switching hands an airball there kick out and the three ball rattles in scor for Owen C and again they will be unconscious shooting the basketball just continuing to put it up no there you know you cant relax Ive seen this team a couple times this year now as I mentioned cover and theyve been down double digits and theyve come back because of the three bow hpar under two a half now first half giler Reno into deep but Off the Mark hes at a couple of close ones that he normally puts down unable to convert it didnt go didnt go up to the basket like he normally does tie up and the arrow will send things the other way well I tell you when you do get the ball and I always say two feet in the paint he knows what to do a lot of times hes away from the basket but if he can get two feet in the paint Greg I mean hes a hes a threat if you front him its lights out hes going to dunk it if you play behind him goes over either shoulder but hes got to get his balance I thought the time before he avoided contact to get a shot up if he just stayed with it they were going to have to foul him so hes done that this year when hes needed a basket he hasnt been afraid he has not been afraid to to give up his body and get to get hit going up to the shot 12 points two boards for Reno heres Blakes now looking to go back to the big man draws a double immediately timer to 10 Reno with four his shot and is well off the glass does not draw Iron and thats good defense by calp and it just you can tell that the Standford a little out of sink there you need some guys that can get to the rim I think they were content a little bit to be a little bit too much on the perimeter um but you know its easy when youre struggling and maybe a teams playing pretty good defense two things you can do one you can get the ball inside make them collapse and you now you got offside shots if they if they double you in two you can get to the rim get to the foul line if youre Stanford you want to get there more than two times theyve only been there twice brether now for R now hes playing a lot of minutes averaging north of 35 minutes a game thus far meanwhile Co the Catalyst on offense here for calp hes in double figures and Counting he went up over the top he got some vertical Greg 14 points now for C aara good kick there camon looking to power inside looks to step through and nothing doing for Stanford here theyll get camon for an offensive saying he tried to hook to get around the defender going up well cal Smith trying to make the point that he got pushed theres a reason why he kind of was awkward I mean and and and hes bleeding his case with the officials but look at Benny Keeler with the steal ker the takeaway Stanford will get it right back Cardinal fans thinking ball dont lie they wanted that call anyway into akara quickly moving Baseline got that first step and hes fouled yeah you know its interesting Greg thats a couple times now that Stanfords gotten the ball inside at the rim and and AAR is a little unselfish trying to get it out of there but youre all the way to the rim hes a little stronger maybe than he thinks and and you you got to go up there and try to get that foul foul call if you can its you its not being self off the inbound haer in feeding C and hes blocked cman comes over to take it away Giller now the Cardinal breakout under a minute to play here in the first half agar wall too long and camon able to hold position and grab that rebound yeah sord is a little quick on the trigger and and you know k reminding his guys guys I like numbers I like transition but you know lets first talk about the defensive block look at the extension of Aiden camman I mean when he does that for his team hes really given his team a lift now you got Stanford they you know they theyve got some time they can get two for one but Im sorry they can get a quick one here aara double clutch and one Greg I love the ability now aaro thats he from that last possession to this look at the difference heres the is the drive the swing step and he goes up hes now not trying to avoid contact thats the completely different from the the last time where he turned it over so you know sometimes players can make strides even in a game from possession to possession uh thats a lesson learned I love that and weve talked about him you know the chisa mpar has transferred from played at Harvard from from New York rosville New York hes a strong player when he takes his time or he puts his mind to it he can get get to the rim and and he can do some damage his named Harvards most improved player 162 points per game five rebounds so he can be a goto on offense they know the ceiling is much higher for him here at Stanford about a 1 second difference shot and game clock the play for the last they do not want to give Stanford a last look theyre going to see if they can get this down to single digits uh going into halftime Ider looking to set the table here clock to six with five Back Door Co Applause again and running out of time Oar wont get it off before the horn and calp the final word in this first half its Owen Co 16 points to lead everybody hes kept the Mustangs in the mix yeah I can promise you what they have have done is double team in theres a look at our big scores through 20 minutes Reno and coun as were back to it here heres Jared Haider one of the veterans on this squad just lost the handle a scrum for the basketball a tie up and the hustle there Chism oara gets the start here in this second half getting on the floor and out the swing the three ball is all net for agar wall he can do that Greg he can score it his third triple and then just looking to bully his way past agar wall that was rener well watch the penetration the dish and the fine by Blakes over toag I mean just the heat you know he hes a guy that can get it going hes very streaky shooter but if he finds his his rhythm he is tough and seeing his opportunity really expand this year limited time came off the bench last year now being asked to do more in the starting lineup scoring more meeting that challenge he can do more than score as well hes actually a pretty good Defender he get up a rebound for his team you know interesting this half we talked about guys stepping up you know Jared haiders capable I think hes a guy thats got to be aggressive for his team if he can get aggressive get some scores on the board tough drive and one rener to the bucket well dont go to sleep if youre Stanford at all on Mt rer cuz thats what he does he is strong hes 65 hes a veteran hes a senior he goes up takes some contact on the arm and finishes off the glass he can play I mean hes double figures on the year but he can knock down threepoint shots hes very tough player defense has been a bit of his calling card as well he was the Rocky Mount Athletic Conference defensive player of the year last year so youre seeing him blend the defensive prowess with the offense well hes done it twice too Greg I think hes won that award twice so he can really play both ends of the floor swing here looking for sellers Giller and now Blakes and Blakes tripped as he makes his way down the lane and bondle no complaint there raising his hand now if youre you know youre opponent of Stanford one thing their guards can do in Blakes and in giler uh sers those guys are all capable of breaking you down off the dribble one guy cant keep those guys at Bay I mean they can penetrate so youre going to have to get a second Defender to help against them just about a minute gone by a little more here in this second half aara fires that pass gay loses the defense but cant hit the three Reno just sticks that long arm in there to keep it alive Blakes off balance and a block and Coach to George cant believe it well hes saying that that we were look we were set it was Blakes that was initiating the contact and I dont know maybe he has an argument Greg you can see it here hes you know as you come in theres a tap out and obviously there is the you know got penetration and I think I think if anything the defenders arms were out and not up so there was not verticality so if thats the call I I can see that the the the body position was good he took it and I think the officials now are Bert Smith explaining that the the defender has to not only be set but hes got to be vertical and I not quite sure he was vertical the George pleading his case there one of two from the line for Blakes 10point lead for Stanford rener again drawing contact same result a chance at a threepoint play once more for M rener you might want to force M rer to his left hes been scoring to his right and hes very comfortable going to his right look at the finish I mean high up over the glass absorbing the contact players are I mean thats their natural hand very few guys can do that going left so if youre going to play a guy in the middle of the floor if you had a choice might want to some left rer makes it 4740 hes got 10 points now hes got a double figure effort once again six of the last seven games rer has scored double figures staying consistent here so really trying to get the ball inside to Reno hes been open a couple times they just a little bit late trying to find him Blakes probing that defense now gets it into Reno he draws a crowd put it on the floor and a reach in and a foul now ply looking for a jump ball well you know Greg thats thats kind of the point were talking about if you get the ball in Maxim reos hand hes not a selfish guy now hes going to find people but it starts by getting the ball and getting some touches and K Smith has got a lot of ways he can get it there but give the defense credit theyre just swarming him theres not one one two guys on him theres three and four sometimes I mean that hes commanding a lot of attention Giller out of the corner there Blakes the hustle akara left alone spinning down low he draws a little contact no call but able to finish in traffic yeah he just found a way to get to the rim we talked about that in the first half hes really executed in that play nothing there back door for calply Jessup now coun spinning at the line thats pure cant leave him Greg I mean you think hes exhausted his possibility he takes you one weight takes the other and you cut him off then he comes back and just puts it over your face I mean hes a player 18 points for C really confident player at that I really really uh impressed with his confidence Jesse pu told us pregame those four guys that came from Colorado Mesa that winning culture that continuity that they have as a unit bringing that to calp here akara takes the bump as he tried to go up and over Aaron Price well look again we we talked about you know chisara and when hes strong and theres Co over the top I mean hes just he you know thats not thats not bothering him putting a hand out got to put it up but look at how par operate inside he doesnt mind the contact hes really good when when he gets sped but he did a good job as you mentioned Greg when he was played at at at Harvard he was pretty good at getting to the free throw line thats what this Cardinal team needs him to do if he can is use his body hes gifted hes strong get to the line and give your team some easy ones Coons finger roll good to go off the window with they scoring about a second and a half well and how about this the give the go how many give and goes has he been involved in I mean I dont think theres a better guy Ive seen all year that can pass it by giving it and go and get to get back again akara put it on the floor once more another bucket there for Chism akpar he went one of two from the line then came back with the floater well these two guys are giving their teams a lift theyre theyre really producing 2 44 here in the second where do the Mustangs now go for offense well again theyve got to try to generate something off the drive go needed a little daylight thats all it takes what a night so far for Owen C well and then when you try to take away a drive thats what happens certainly you cant go underneath screens and you got to get over the top I mean and Stanford didnt either and so they paid the price Co has going on again 23 points for Co hes cut it down to five Cardinal answering they do sellers buying from the corner you know hes hit so many big shots for his team this year and again hes been quiet this game but very capable Bond he cant respond C with the rebound and tipped out by Blakes with that we go to the under 16 time out Owen Cs on a heater right now 23 points he is keeping the Mustangs alive on the road e e e for Owen Coons feeling it here tonight at Stanford 23 points hes already surpassed his calp career high he had 19 against Eastern Washington his overall career high he had 27 against Simon Frasier when he was with Colorado Mesa he is very close to that getting a welldeserved breather right now well hes a veteran player I mean the grad player who Jared Haider missed his teammate was wide open under the basket riners back in Haider left alone able to hit hes been quiet thus far his first made bucket of the night no he must have hurt us I I I mean hes too good a player for him to be scoreless and if youre Standford watch out cuz he can get it going too averaging over 14 points per game his first point of the evening and then that attempt from the corner bounces out of play for Makara and calp within five and I think calp will allow him to shoot that versus do what hes done the last several possessions and thats taken to the scene right to the basket they came in just two of 10 from downtown theyll sign for that threepoint attempt r now back door in traffic in trouble the hustle the scrum and its taken away by killer that was a scrum I think three or four kick balls in there too not sure skip pass here sers cant get the roll this time weve seen this Maples hoop reward the Cardinal a couple of times Stanford now relying on the three maybe a little too much because youre you they were struggling trying to guard uh I mean guarding the Stanford team in the rim Stanford now 8 for 24 from downtown on the evening heres sers on the run out to the hoop two hand slam well thankfully for Stanford theyve done a good job defensively theyve gotten out theyve gotten some steals as you mentioned Greg theyve gotten some scores but we had injury on the floor now but sers in the open court he knows what to do thats Jared Haider Whos down under the basket its unfortunate you hope that Jared Haider can pop up he just hit a three a big three and he doesnt look comfortable on the floor its you know hes been through injuries thats why we mentioned it Greg its were not speculating on any injury he has now but hes fought back his whole career from injuries so at least hes on his feet thats a good sign see if he can walk this one off he was holding that right ankle there momentarily three years with the Bears in Berkeley that last season seon was a medical red shirt at Cal before then coming over to Cal P this is his second season his sixth overall year of college hoops and training staff will help him off gingerly so well keep an eye see if he can return as you mentioned a guy that can be so important to what they do well you know hes hes not only been their leading scorer I mean what hes done is he you know hes also assisting at almost two to four to two ratio 15 steals 84 from the line and then he just hit the big three so uh but you dont want to lose Jared Haider even though he hasnt had as big a game as hes capable Co is back in spinning still in the paint and just taking it old school little YMCA action from Jessup waiting everyone out and goes with the hook R I want to know who their their post pivot play coach is cuz he he deserves a race the footwork has been excellent meanwhile through the five hole for Reno and here come the Mustangs I dont like the post entry at his feet like its something up top Bond vasel Le has returned hes going to the basket that double clutch these guys are so steady fundamental going to the hoop waiting off that defense Sanford was worried about this team coming in it didnt matter that they had double digits lead cal Smith talked to us before the game hes concerned the staff was concerned they knew this team is capable they have been knocking on the door all season long and had some teams in trouble they saw the results against Arizona State against St Marys USF San Francisco they start the season yeah double digit lead big shot clock to five giler time winding down raino battling fighting bondal there first and the Mustangs have it back theyre down three Bondo Coast to Coast with the left cant finish but hes fouled free throws coming for the Freshman well if youre Stanford again we got to go back to what got you the lead you can see theyre allowing the ball now in the paint let just you got to stay gr grounded theyre really good at getting you up and under but theyre getting the basket now and theyre driving you know some bigger def Defenders and then theres a foul inside so you know Stanford its they made their run in this game uh Greg off their defense and you know so many people worry about the offense with with a team like calp you maybe arent going to trade baskets what you have to do is get stops and when Stanford got stops they were rewarded they built a big leag Blakes akara return so Kyle Smith reloading here with some key pieces Off the Bench as bundle hes been solid from the line thus far this year knocks down both 85 coming in and its a onepoint game yeah you forget about any double digits we we talked about this its its now anybodys game is Stanfords got to really dig down and dig deep Blakes into raino and a strip and a foul and and Maxine Reno is saying its about time and Im not say sure if he saying its about time that I got the ball or its about time I posted up and got the ball either way uh thats where he wants the ball he can do damage he can attract double teams he needs to get to the foul line and he is Maro 12 points three rebounds he has been a double double machine coming into the Night hits on the first you know Greg I I say this kind of jokingly obviously but Ive had a lot of players that I always thought suffered from Amnesia I I used to send them to our team position say can you check to see if theyve got a case of Amnesia players would always get mad at me but you sometimes you forget what got you there and you go away and start to do something else reinvent things just go back to what got you the lead Al Smith saying please get it inside lets get some stops that that formula was working pretty darn well go draws a crowd step back triple work tied Jessup from long range uh you cant challenge out Greg that was a challenge out you have to challenge up big difference 59 all Giller he leave him free make some pay Bennys back in business I love it I love it Greg you got that right calp they dont Dole to the hoop again drawing a crowd drawing a foul and more free throws coming this time for vasilich yeah its a very good call by the officials uh they caught the body bump nothing uh with the hands but the body uh big strong Bump by okara and and uh referees all on top of that but Benny giler the time before on a big shot hes got to knock those shots down he was so lethal in the first few games of the Season he couldnt miss and hes had good looks he just hasnt knocked him down but you know one thing about Benny giler hes a confident player and hell continue to shoot but look at this calp team I mean theyve got a chance now you know uh they theyve tied the game but they theyre within the Striking Distance of taking the lead on Stanford Fel h0 for two very limited experience to the line just his second and third attempts yeah in this freshman season heres a double screen up top its called a double drag screen Blakes on the drive raino a little foul line jumpers all good one in doubt go to your star well they missed him he was open early he had to go back on the floor to get the ball back hes being aggressive now rener floats that one up and a good rebound there controlled by Ager wall Blakes now directing traffic I like it maxing raino did a rim run he was right at The Rim Point Blank Blakes the pullup tipped around the hustle there from Jessup pushing ahead now theyre looking for that three ball couldnt find it this time around vas El on the drive he stripped giler with the rip giler now one on two Up and Under rejected but a foul great defense watch this watch the step back shot by caly but now its its stand for with their ability and Benny geler is saying look dont forget about me Ive been quiet but Im back lets stop in the Bennys back open for open for businessed missed hes open they just Music first we got you we got you much k e couple of firste coaches but been No Lack of experience veterans now these guys have coached to combine over 30 years and what I like and also combined about 600 wins Greg but they you know these two guys are taking over a program and they will be successful they you know they will because they theyve had success in their careers theyre theyre both really U have been building programs wherever theyve gone uh you know Kyle Smith coach of the year in the Pack 12 last year uh phenomenal job and hes done it at Columbia hes done it you know at other schools as well and un University of San Francisco and Mike the George just a division 2 Powerhouse so um you know when you start a new program you got to do it your way and you got to get your players but you dont have that luxury sometimes sometimes your first year these guys are doing just a whale of a job in their very first year and really without having the ability to do a lot of recruiting you had to get into the portal get some guys in Stanfords case one of the biggest portal moves was not letting Maxim Reno leave he took a look at the landscape decided to stay really likes the experience here thats good recr huge huge save exactly Hiers back in thats a good sign a bad sign he stripped Benny Benny gilers been a pest today hes had his hands on a lot of balls sers now for trying to ward off this latest run here by calply sers right down Main Street able to hit well hes hit some big baskets for his team and Ive said this earlier thats a big basket because calp is getting too close for comfort tip away there will stay down this end yeah thats a br I mean the game was tied GRE and now look at but heres the drive by sers as hes really look at his hang time I mean he just says Im going up youre going up but youre coming down first Im going to stay up a little longer and I am going to kiss it off the glass the windows my friend 90 Run for the cardinal to break this tie and surge back in front Jessup fading buries it tough stuff from Isaac Jessup now thats just a big time basket I mean Benny geler was all over Jessup and it didnt make a difference Jessup just outlasted him and scored it zers raino was on his way to the rim they couldnt find him now they show up three are there to strip it away Haider comes up with the basketball Jessup now thought about a very deep three in said tries to Euro around Reno sevenfooter out to cover shot clock to 15 Co on the Move able to hit and the foul a great finish by c and a great call by the officials I mean the official she the official there was right on it but heres the drive and the the the you know in inside of the arc thats a foul and you know I think again youre showing calp showing the ability just to move without the ball Greg this team moves without the ball as well as any team Ive seen all year and Ive seen a lot of teams good on the threepoint play we talked about the coaching lineage of these two and you look at Mike de George Once Upon a Time part of grenell they ran the system that super highscoring offense what they do here isnt exactly that but you see the way they move the basketball the way they attack Now grenell teams through the years if you dont know about him look it up theyve had teams scoring in the 150s 160s I mean thats lore over there I Ive played that team for now when I was coaching it in nii look at that move a thats just a a a taught move a smart veteran move by Maxim Reno he knew the defender was hugging him he brought the ball right across his body and Drew the foul I love that play by Max Maro and when theyre you know when youre getting double and triple team you got to sometimes invent and find ways to score because theyre not making it easy on you your oppon he knows the collapse is coming a little rip through there draws the foul thats the seventh team foul so over the limit here one and one well people dont know this I mean we came to at the gym today Greg and we were there a good couple hours before the game as we like to get here early I dont know why were not playing but were here I got to get loose you got to get loose and of course you were here doing volleyball so you had a double duty but let me tell you this uh Maxim Reno was was in the gym and he was the Lone guy on the floor and nobody else was in the gym so if you think that that theres a nice offensive rebound by Jaylen Blakes my point though about Maxim Reno is heres a guy you know on everybodys watch list for player of the Week player of the year and you know theres a reason hes in the gym hes in here early and hes just all he wants to do is get better and dont think the NBA Scouts have noticed that and havent taken note of that particular attribute it brings that professional approach to the game as Blakes rebound draws the foul again with calp being over the limit of one and one but cant hit on the first so quickly the other way Co maybe got away with a shuffle we play on approaching the 9 Minute Mark here in the second half carlat posting now against giler draws everybody the kick from three all net rattle it home for Peter bondle well thats a tough play cuz raino came up and really challenged but Greg dont look now its a twopoint basketball game a 90 run by Stanford the Mustangs weathering that storm and now charging back giler has had the answer all night long what did you say Greg Bennys open for business back bus business and hes not afraid to take big shots I got to give him credit thats a huge shot his team only up by two make it 7267 now giler 13 points three triples Co midrange is there Greg once you let a player get get going and and what I mean by that isoun gets it going uh its hard to stop players once they feeling it and hes feeling it and just putting whatever he wants to do given the Stanford the business Lakes the foul line pull up coming right back this like an NBA game Greg this is I mean you know both teams just showing their ability to score on each other Mustangs move that basketball threepointer not there oara able to control the board we expected that to go down him its just been both teams you mentioned both teams going on huge runs but now its Stanford with a chance to open up which could be a little bit of a cushion Blakes put it on the floor and cant finish at The Rim but free throws coming for Jaylen Blakes now watch this I mean look at you want to challenge with your sevenfooter no problem you think but no now its Benny giler is saying look youre not going to guard me I got something for you a threepointer in your face e e e e right before the break this was blaks on the way but check out on the replay here in inverted conduct or contact rather conduct to I guess if youre tar latch your teammate bondle hit you in the face there drawing blood so training staff tending to him they had to clean up the court a little bit but see if he can make his way back the Junior from Belgrade Serbia after two years with Utah yeah hes a tough kid but he took a pretty tough one hes going to have to kind of stop the bleeding and inadvertent obviously but uh big play by Blakes to get to the free throw line you know its interesting uh two guys that we need to mention Greg in my opinion uh Stanford scored 24 Off the Bench and its been giler and oakar that have scored those 24 points where would they be without those two guys in the floor tonight thats a question Kyle Smith does not want to ponder for all that long well theyre on the floor now I can tell you that Cal Poly turning to Aaron Price hes come back in facing a lot of pressure here just gets rid of that basketball finds coun shot clock to 12 in the corner timer now to eight looking for help with two fading from three and just drawing iron there it was the attempt from vasel Le itll stay here and so the shot clock back to 20 calply outscoring Stanford in the second half now 3533 as theyve gone back and forth Cardinal now reasserting themselves here theyve made three of their last three shots to go back and front here with a bit of a cushion well youd like to get that rebound that could have really sealed it a little bit giving him a little bit of a cushion but now they got a Reload k p with his second chance opportunity clock to 10 mondle weaving through traffic Baseline Drive here and theyll get a foul on Reno as vasel Le tried to turn the corner against the big man and well he disagrees he didnt try to turn the corner he did he did turn it and there was a foul with the off hand the officials doing a really good job Ive been impressed with Claire Aubry Im going to say that uh because shes been out there uh making some pretty tough calls I mean shes gotten it right and uh when youre a coach you dont always think that when youre on the sideline for any but shes done a great job and Im going to got to give praise when I see it but shes had some tough calls and shes made them and shes with a veteran crew B Smith obviously and you know and Jeff Pond and those those officials have uh its not been an easy game to call and theyve done a good job I think keeping law in order as they say meanwhile Stanford now at the seven team foul Mark so that was ruled on the floor a one and one they convert on both but free throws the rest of the way on both sides here nine fouls for calp seven for the Cardinal Blakes Reno the fake and then they got their wires crossed looking for oara he zigged when he should have zagged yeah well and and and also you know again Maxim R Ive said this before hes an unselfish player but he had a lane Greg and and hes got to go until somebody stops him I dont think anybody was going to get in his way to the rim and weve seen him throw some tomahawks down this year so um you know uh but again hes unselfish you cant you cant fault somebody for being a good teammate but now if youre Standford guess what you get to play defense that this this is going to come down to stops and this is the way Kyle Smith coaches his team he challenges his team if you get stops you youre rewarded if not now we got a basketball game Jessup the give to co to the bucket hammer down well there wasnt a stop there because Co had his hands in the ball and they have done everything but stop stop him theyve slowed him down at times today tonight Greg but they have not stopped him hes been a real real pest 30 for Owen c 7673 a really heads up play by jayen Blakes but look at the slam jam thank you maam thats just getting it done with a lot of Music aggression e e e e e the Pack 12 most improved player of the year season ago Maxim Rau taking it up a level here are his stats just out of this world leading the country in double doubles hes been a machine near 24 points per game we say all this to say coach they could use more out of him tonight well hes got 17 but for maxim Reno thats not enough I mean and and believe me hes not done hes only got one personal foul he can get aggressive he can get to the foul line and do some things for his team now Giller off the screen back iron on that triple Hider hunts it down that was a good look now they got to get back in transition rener the kick Jessup for the top all Applause that well throughout the first 30 35 minutes of this game cuz now we got a tie game 76 all ninth triple for the Mustangs akara navigating and good off the glass huge basket how fast are the Mustangs look to respond as we near the 5 minute Mark Co the man of the match thus far 30 to lead everybody shot clock to 10 Jessup step back feeling it thats pure you know if youre Stanford you cant act surprised when calp hits these shots thats what they do what can you do come down and get a basket of your own an easy one and then get some stops calply has taken the lead but how they done that lets look theres a spot up nobody to be found you cant leave Jessup and then its the same thing on this other end I mean youre going to you think youve got him guarded youve got to challenge up and not just out Ive said that before Ill say it again its a its a challenge theres a way to challenge Greg and uh good Shooters dont care about if hand down in their chin they need to have it up and over your head so you have to shoot up over them Giller ties things at 79 calply LED 54 and they just went in run 7978 and these teams talk about their scoring averages coming in yeah about po a team that can deliver about 80 Stanford in that neighborhood as well what they going to do now is theyre going to go a little smaller uh Maxim Rs going to get a rest till an under four minute timeout and theyre going to see if they can guard with a little bit smaller lineup and see if they cant keep people in front of them and and get some challenges under shots Jessup this guy cooking and hitting well thats again you you you get put on roller skates because youre trying to get out and guard the three and then all of a sudden the stutter dribble goes Isaac Jessup now 19 points 5 threes Blakes agar wall thought about it and theyll regroup shot clock to 12 akara so tough battling down low good back tap but just out of play well lets look at the threepoint shot theres just a step back and again youre so concerned about the threepoint shot you get out and you lunge and all it was was just a quick crossover and a shot its tough guarding a threepoint shooter you have to be disciplined you have to be grounded Greg and with this team and calply they know how to get their threepoint shots up their attempts camon out raino return so they dont wait till that under four timeout as we hit the 4minute mark Jessup hes open heat check off the front rim well you right that was a heat check but hed earned the right to shoot that shot I mean hes been on fire agarwall steps through blocked from behind excellent Help From vasilich Here Comes vasel now the kick Hider left alone Wing three rattles out rebounds there for agarwall here come the card that would have put him up by five Greg if that shot goes down and did everything but go down sers big fake Oar and the rebounds there for Jessup I didnt think that the Stanford staff lik that selection rener now and hes bumped by agar wal free throws are coming here for M rener as we arrive at the under four timeout Mustangs undaunted the three ball first Coons now Jessup theyre back in front Val Music for e e this kpali team 0 and 20 in League Play last year picked 11 dead last in the big West coming into this year they didnt account for the likes of Isaac Jessup now theyve got a whole new basketball team Greg and this when I say team these are guys that have played together and and they just theyre feeling it here um and Veterans theyre absolutely a veteran basketball team you see a tape job there uh that couldnt happen fast enough I think theres a you know adjustment thats got to be made but now if youre if youre Cal good fight for the basketball that was all Co in there to bat that one around yeah Im going say if youre Co you know youre youre youre guarding Co you have to make sure you know where hes at but you you cant give up a tip on your own defensive free throw you dont tip the ball defensively you go up and grab it with two and then hopefully have somebody call you for going over the back thats just a mental mistake and what youve done is put Cal P right back on the line Greg and theyre a pretty good free throw shooting team thats the fourth foul on agar wall ninth team foul on Stanford still a one and one and this one is good to go from bondle so weve got a lot of basketball left but you you dont want to dig a hole here against this team uh and give their confidence theyre pretty confident right now second one is good a fourpoint lead largest lead of the night for Cal ply yeah thats like a fourpoint play GRE you just cant give that up they got the win over Grambling to snap a two game losing skid last time out Reno on the tip not there after the Blakes Missi Co now leading the charge he draws a crowd takes it himself and Ros skying for that rebound able to rip it away there huge rebound by Maxim Reno they needed that geler hes come up with some big baskets nearing two and a half to play in this one Blakes to the hoop gets the roll well they needed that Greg I mean now they still got to come down and get stops its going to come down to stops for Stanford twopoint game yeah they cant exchange baskets when youre behind Jessup back with his shoe on approaching the scores table we see when and if he returns Bond yeah theyre probing every opportunity seeing what the defense they can get off the defense they draw Reno out the step back off The Mark agarwall with the rebound and the card can tie or take the lead as Jessup makes his way over to the scores table to return under two to play second half Blakes spinning Reno steps through and finishes were tied at 84 well they found something something there you know Greg you just hope if youre Stanford its not too late but Jaylen Blakes getting to the rim thats what he does but he also can get to the rim and he can distribute watch this looked in the raino they there theres no answer for that uh if they can continue to do that but theyve got only a little over a little under a minute to go and now if youre Stanford youre saying hey lets get some more of that if youre calp theyre going to start coming with some double teams I dont believe theyre going to let Maxim Reno just get to the rim like that theyre going to talk about it Cal Ps gone a little cold here no field goals over the last 246 theyve missed their last four as Stanford down four theyve come back to tie well interestingly theyve CH theyve chosen to go with a smaller lineup with agall at the four sellers at the three Blakes at the two and Benny Giller at the one obviously Maxim at the five so theyre this could be their best offensive lineup uh because they still need to score but this is a pretty capable defensive team too at Ager wall is pretty uh you know pretty rangy sers pretty rangy Benny giler a pest on the ball and Blakes is really a really a staunch Defender and of course Maxim Renos got some fouls he can give so hes got to be aggressive but you know they desperately they need to stop you dont want to give the Cal py team an opportunity Greg to maybe have the last shot Jessup back in the ball game free throws the rest of the way each side over the limit foul trouble not that big Agra wall with four rer with four for calp everyone else in good shape Jessup Off the Bench pump fake step back they give to C the drop nothing there they work it around the perimeter Haider from three how big a shot was that from Jared Haider he was injured didnt hear much for him he got hit the big three before he got injured now he hits a big time three Reno thought about it agarwall Blakes now battling to the basket the k k out agarwall Corner three not there rebound controlled by rener threepoint Edge for calply they havent beaten Stanford since 1976 the first time they met rener uncontested in for Applause two huge basket by calp just cant foring to score in a Timeout sellers cant respond and now calp doesnt have to go so quick and theyll take the foul free throws for Isaac Jessup watch the ball movement here thats penetration everybody collapses and Jared Haider I mean thats just a huge shot youre talking about off of a you know pretty bad uh you know looked like was in a pretty bad injury he just was able to go up and steady himself you know thats what a veteran does but huge shot huge make by Jared Hider meanwhile Jessup to the line good on the first he loves these Bay Area AC squads dropped 20 on Cal now 20 against Stanford no they were in position against both Cal and and they played UCF University of San Francisco and they were in a position to beat them it wasnt for a Tyrone Riley performance a career high uh this teams been knocking on the door sevenpoint lead their largest of the night killer free throws coming good idea by Benny giler to push the tempo and stop the clock no thats a smart play by Benny giler I mean he didnt waste any time if youre calp youre better off getting out of the way dont let the clock stop dont foul now Stanford can get some points and set up a press or decide who they want to foul um you know this this games not over but if youre calp uh youre going to have to make some free throws and youre going to have to not turn the ball over if youre Stanford youre going to have to score and set up your press and probably go for a quick steal or trap and then youre going to have to play the foul game because theres just not a lot of time left in the game youre going to be down by at least double uh I mean two possessions the stoppage here as mck rener fouls out finishes with 12 points six rebounds four assists well they put uh theyve made a substitution Stanford has theyre putting Anthony Batson in the game defensively hes been a really good player for for him defensively this year had that big shot block in the first Applause half just three minutes played thus far so an energy infusion Off the Bench here as giler huge free throws its the Applause first another one Music coming elert good on both 9186 fivepoint game and they a Mustangs mistake and they call for time well thats the pressure that Stanford needs to put on calp you know they cant hurt you 96 feet 94 ft I should say from the basket but you still got to make them work and no time off the clock Greg thats significant and they burned the timeout um nobody was open and so if youre calpal youre going to talk about creating a you know an Avenue to the ball if youre Stanford you dont want a foul unless the ball comes in Greg you dont want to pick up a foul and I think you know uh Kyle Smiths telling his team that look guys be aggressive but lets not foul unless we have to lets let them get it in and if we have to get a quick trap and maybe then foul theres still time left in this game I mean its a twopossession game there theres time left to come back Stanford digging in defensively here I like this aggressive player on the ball and trying to take his vision full cor pressure Giller right there inches away from a steel they go ahead to Haider and give the foul and free throws coming for Jared Haider and you mentioned it Greg I mean Benny giler I think did everything but is get his hand on that ball and control it he was so close thats great pressure if youre Stanford now if youre calp youve got to make free throws and maybe ones not enough you you got to kind of make them both because Danford can come come back and and beat you with the three ball and cut this even closer Ider 84 on the year coming in and all net on the first his first free throw of the evening R know and agar wall return Stanford they knew how difficult this could be against a really good calply team Hider good on both cply big tuneup here theyve got conference play coming up as Blakes is on the move right down the lane and a late whistle as he made his way to the basket so free throws coming for Jaylen Blakes well thats what you have to do if youre Stanford you you know youve got to get to the rim you cant just count on uh jacking up threes hoping they go down you miss a three and they get a rebound now the games probably over so I like Jaylen Brown the quick two or at least the two free throws again stop the clock you were so close on the steal but youre going to have to make your your free throws and youre going to have to get a steal or hope that calp misses their free throws look at the numbers here for Stanford as Blakes its on the first right now short under his average is a little bit 19 points five rebounds but youve got five guys in double figures youve scored 87 points youd imagine Kyle Smith thinks on most night that should be enough now a tie up here looking for it Hider in trouble and just getting a timeout well he he avoided getting the ball tied up K Smith was pleading for the tie up but I dont think that they ever tied him up which was you know K Stanford looking not foul but you know Greg if you want to look at Stats and were you know Im a coach so I look at Stats you know that um I I look at the paint and its its hard to Fathom that calp is outscoring Stanford 30 to 26 in the paint and you just didnt see that coming in today and think about all the baskets polygon you you talked about the threes obviously everybodys impressed with the threes but theyve scored a good portion of their points in the paint and theyve outscored Stanford in the paint youd think Stanford would have had the advantage there and I know that was what Kyle Smith had planned coming in that we got an advantage lets try to score there Maxim Reno hasnt had those opportunities like he normally has had this year calply everything trending up in this second half 70 from the field 57 from downtown 13 of 16 from the line and all the those metrics have pointed them towards a fivepoint lead here trying to hold off one last push from Stanford well if again your calp two things you have to get it in cant turn it over and two you got to make your free throws if youre Stanford you cant let a lot of time go off the clock try to get the denial five count or steal on a trap and then its got to be an immediate foul vasel Le to inbound lots of pressure here from Stanford they get it in trying for the tie up still battling for that ball Co comes up with it throw ahead now into the front court and theres a whistle with 217 left in the half and the game and credit the Mustangs for navigating a tough situation well again a lot of time went off the clock um steal doesnt take it doesnt happen now you got to make a quick foul you you you dont want 10 more seconds or eight more seconds go off the clock but you know give calp credit Greg they played just a whale of a game down double digit and look at the Poise theyve come back with that Poise comes from somewhere and where it comes from is experience of your veteran players older players that have played not only a lot of games under their belt Greg lets you mentioned this earlier you alluded to it this team has played together four guys have played together during their career so they know how to play the chemistry is already there Bondo good on both and then guys like this a freshman but hes played in FEA competition high stakes Junior national team competitions Reno from the corner they got to have it its an airball Giller now racing back to the threepoint line fading front rim C comes up with it the throw ahead Hider all alone for an easy2 hell put a bow on this one just six seconds left Reno to the basket the finger roll is there not enough for the Cardinal 11 left and C ply is going to take the trip to Stanford and come away winners they surpass all of last years
