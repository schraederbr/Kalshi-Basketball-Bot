the season ready to go here and Alabama wins the tip and Sears gives off to Fon Alabama without Latrell rightel who had surgery today in the T ailles kick out Nelson who puts it on the floor and the key from North Carol is to get off to good starts each game in Mai they find themselves down double digits having to claw back in each bom a lot of defensively F on shot clock winding down Nelson Hees It Up Off the Mark Trimble absorbs the bump at the basket and its blocked but they get the foul the majority of Blows the Whistle there its so loud in here that nobody hurt it look the majority of North Carolina shots will come within the first 10 seconds of the shot clock youre talking about a fast pace Al abama has a high assisted ratio on all their shots they knocked down and Carolina just plays with a blazing speed transition defense will be imperative for Alabama and Nate o shares that same philosophy he likes to get a shot up inside the first 10 12 seconds Oaks and Alabama here in Chapel Hill and a good one here tonight Trimble look at Z Trimble and the step forward that he has taken especially those threepoint numbers and now well into double Music figures three guards or at least hes basically playing a small forward spot so they under siiz can well hes a good Defender also he a guy knocking down the shot from the outside and all those guards to RJ Davis Ellie Kad and SE tribo account for 50 of the team score great intensity and defense by North Carolina to start this game and the crowd is fired up Sears looking for some help Pyon thats off the mark Thats tipped away shot clock winding down and itll be a shot clock violation listen to this place Hubert Davis in his fourth year as the head man of course was an outstanding player here and last year the AC Player of the Year let him to the one seed in a regular season conference title SEC has had the better of this challenge thus far having won nine of 10 over the ACC hard to Applause believe loose ball and eventually omore picks it up out of the other way Stevenson the kid from Chapel Hill backs down has it not win a great job by North Carolina to hold their ground on ISO play Davis good Fe Washington had it spotted away Sears up ahead Nelson and thats off the side of the back four up and down we go but only two points and coming from the free throw line remember last time these teams played Grant Nelson had 24 points its really when his uh NBA comp really Skyrocket as a player really showed you his versatility all over the court had a pretty monstrous game to Le this team to their Elite eight Davis that threepoint attempt missed by a lot Nate oats what a job hes done since coming from Buffalo six season as the Alabama head coach took him to their first final four in program history and the Bal linic as they like to talk about started way back in his first year but the emphasis on the stats that really matter and all the good information and Nate Oaks has done a wonderful job for the Crimson tie threes layups and free throws sounds like the NBA Sears inside off the glass and good nice job by Mark Sears Who season is off to a slow start yeah hasnt been shooting the ball that well like I said an open 28 from the threepoint line has to find find his rhythm but I like the body control and the fact that a guard with his upper body frame can initiate contact which allows himself to kind of recount to rebalance off the big Mor the hand off to Stevenson and now the lob and thats off the mark and V Allen Luben comes up with a rebound now Trimble the other end and Nelson pulls down the rebound look at the big guy going spinning into the lane off the glass and Nelson will shoot two and when we were talking about Mark here before just off of dho you got to get out there and hedge at him if you give him that space thats what North Carolina talked about today in shoot around he just gobbles up all that open space you have to be physical get in his way and initiate the contact fad Seth Trimble his first and heres Nelson at the line you mentioned in the sweet 16 Nelson went for 24 and 12 and five blocks I mean he leades a team wi 15 offensive rebounds versus Oregon had a tough shooting night only seven points you know him and Mark Sears need to be explosive in a game like this considering right cell is not on the court your best players need to have their best games in order for your team to get roow Applause wins Alabama coming off a long L to Music Oregon and for North Carolina theyve dropped two in a row last time out to Michigan State at overtime prior to that against Auburn just 15 turnovers for Alabama and that game against Auburn and against Oregon excuse me Oregon had 18 points off those turnovers pick up ahead Sears in transition of three that one fall picks it up kick up ahead heres Jackson the jet throws it down back at the other end and Daren Reed The Freshman with the Applause triple Elliot CAD handling hesitates and left hand little too strong Sears unimpeded right to the rim what a change of speed on Mark Sears this miscommunication by North Carolina somebody has to take the Applause Music ball D this carries it J Davis so far this season just 27 from three but preseason ACC Player of the Year preseason First Team all America SE into the paint Scoops it in Applause Withers gets inside hesitates and he travel here the early going Alabama with an 117 lead up and down we go ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Continental Tire the smart CH in Applause Music tires that helps save lives so you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate and remember 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research so many F memories of Stuart Scott as a a player and as a colleague and also of Jimmy V hearing Coach K stories and the way other coaches have spoken about him you know book for you and I today just looking for a good couple Joe also all the people that work in the field as well to help all these people just want to give a shout out to Amanda couch director of radiation at oncology uh for all the hard work that her and her crew continue to do here but all the people across the country and the world that put in the time and effort to help people great work inside as Reed finds his way to the bask again we were looking for a cup of coffee and we ended up wandering into the North Carolina B last night cancer hospital and Amanda was nice enough to show us around a little bit and we got to talk to to their group heres Sears into the paint kick out Holloway and the rebound pulled down by Ian Jackson Captain Jack Euro Step Mar the BLS and tell you between Drake pal and Ian Jackson two of the best wings in college basketball ball and theyre both coming into their own offensively and defensively Luben able to pull it down both guys may be one and done well see Davis to Jackson Hubert Davis talks about getting a text every night at the end of the day from Ian Jackson and he simply texts coach Davis and Hubbert responds whats up and he says how can I improve my basketball game and Hubert will let him know or sometimes hell say go to bed well hes just an absolute competitor not sure if I like that shot of nor North Carolina plays fast but the last threepoint shot he got was in the rhythm of the offense and hes so good at attacking and getting to positions on the floor Holloway now knocks it down Aiden Applause Holloway Alabama the early lead 1812 and without one of their top players players for the rest of the year Latrell ritel was out after suffering that Achilles injury they should be getting back Chris Young Blood coming off of September ankle surgery theyre hoping maybe for the kraton game oh bunny missed by VIN Allen Luben Point Blank he couldnt hit and back the other way for the tie H away and that three wouldnt go and Luben pulls it down Davis into the paint Scoops it home with a left hand well the big thing for RJ Davis is hes going to have to find ways to get into those gaps and get some easy ones we talked last year about the sides of Alabama defending him theyre going to try to blow up screens on side pick and rolls and theyre going to switch you saw Cheryl guarding him before cant settle for Long Shots over that length able to knock that one down bit a slow start for him just 29 Points 29 from three hes got 11 points in this game so hes off to a good start but a guy who normally knocks down a lot of Threes been sluggish from Beyond The Arc thus far this year Withers and Reed comes flying in and Alabama the other way they dont have Applause Music numbers good drive and K that one to the corner and that one throw away I mean right after well we said before this was a battle for poundforpound the best guard in the country Mark Sears just having too much space to operate Luben has to crowd that space and probing and transition nobody takes the ball and once again off a pick and roll the biger North Carolina just need to have more Awareness on where Marx is Mark Sears is on the court at all times hes Absol absolutely feeling it with 11 points so far and the opening 5 minutes of this ball game yeah you compare Sears to Carolina up and down we go I was saying as we went to the break and that affects everybody yeah the players the broadcasters even the officials Sears off to a good start I was talking with Roger SS one of the officials here tonight and there he is and R said yeah I probably could run here tonight more than any game this season thats the potential and that shot kned out of bounds Roger did mention to me though he said that is why I use the extra hair gel I mean theyre sweating profusely out here already my gosh weve had so many possessions in this game and thats what this whole game is going to be its a war retri a team thats in the best condition and a team that can play Fast think slow down the stretch will win this game Trimble a little strong you see whos checked into the game for Alabama the pepp transfer Houston M transition defense is going to be critical for North Carolina Alabama averages 10 May threes per game they get the majority of those threes in transition so getting back and protecting the paint but also pointing towards where Shooters are and good recognition is critical when do you remember the transition three starting to become such a focal part of offense in basketball oh its baltics right I mean thats how the NBA plays especially when you start playing teams that have four out five out uh young players are flaring towards the threepoint line instead of going for easier tws Nelson pushes it up ahead Aiden Holloway hesitating took it out back towards the basket and then its knocked out of bounds Roger with a good hands Roger SS Alabama with a 2114 lead and again this part one of our double headers Jimmy V week continues Mark Sears off to a fast start Duke and Auburn still to come somebody will be shooting a free throw at halime of that game in h more on that coming up somebody from Elliot fdau Im going to get more ball screens with army Yuri just cuz hes playing in drop coverage hes going to get shots he just needs to pick his spots and make plays Washington and that one wouldnt fall but pow the rebound Drake pow likely their best Pro Prospect tough s that one taken away mlet up ahead tosses it back the left hand wouldnt fall and the put back goes for philon thearon philon after the Miss and its a ninepoint Advantage under 10 to go here first half Alabama on top John chabi and J Williams with you youre going to get shots you can get to that elbow spot I mean Yu so far back hes at the ACC Logan and they get Sears on the foul and folks a reminder of the SEC ACC womens challenge continues tomorrow night number 18 Old Miss squares off against NC State thats at s Eastern at ESPN 2 and our ESPN double header has fourth ranked Texas going up against 10th ranked Notre Dame and thatll be followed by number eight Duke and number three South Carolina Music I said earlier that RJ Davis aliot Kau and Seth Trimble account for 50 of their team scoring those guys have to find a way to get it going offensively I dont like settling that one deep and Off the Mark A P back from T CLA now one of the things that Hubert Davis talked about they need to offensive rebound and they got a big one there to the corner and molette knocks it Down Right hell out Houston mlet was red shirting and he got his number called NATO talked about it today its like hey look we need him to play at a higher level we need more bodies until theyre able to get Chris Young Blood back thats a good dribble Baseline Corner drift mallettes hands are ready for that the whole time got Houston mlet coming in tonight hadnt played cuz they were going to red shirt him last year at pepperine 147 points per game on 42 from three they were going to red shirt him at least in part because of some knee issues that he was having but now a little bit more thin with rightel out Davis weaves through traffic and then it hits the back iron and kicks Applause out F line left hand its good and thats where it gets tough with Alabamas offense playing Five out it doesnt leave anybody underneath the basket to be a rim protector and thats what Nate oats thats what they do Davis cuts to the B and find him and he puts it in for the deuce these are two of the top scoring teams in the country oh and a deep deep threee from Aiden Holloway and in terms of adjusted offensive efficiency both teams are in the top 10 well Ty Claud if the way Aiden Holloway the Auburn transfer which still blows my mind that Im saying out loud to Alabama but you got to get up on those ball screens these guys theyre trigger ready all the time ready to catch shoot and release Trimble absorbs the contact here in the early going its number 10 Alabama wants to show something off here tonight he was 0 for nine from three in that game yeah but this is a different North Carolina team obviously no Armond Bott no Harrison Ingram you know you talk about the the presence that those two had defensively and also in the post and its a different North Carolina team without having a rim protector so a lot of their offensive production needs to come from their guards but the last two matchups these two teams have have have been exhilarating we talked about the game before that was the four overtime game at the Phil night invitation pound now hesitates puts it on the floor the smaller Sears was on him cadel from way down off the glass no good look North Carolina has to draw a line in the sand defensively Alabama shooting 50 from the field 42 from the threepoint line and I know this game is going to have a fast pace but North Carolina has to start digging in and we talked about early game deficits this is what theyve done in their last three games in a row got double figure deficits for the Tar Heels they had that epic comeback against date Reed kicks out H gives off to Sears hes got Trimble on him now its Davis while Americans squaring off Reed to the corner and Hollow away that wouldnt fall loose ball and an offensive rebound from bti and eventually Carolina comes away with a Davis right at Sears Up and Under scor and hell go to the line Alabama just everywhere on the offensive glass but multiple white jerseys on the ground diving for those 5050 balls and RJ Davis is doing what he does dont know really where the fou was oh he right towards the end so RJ thats what he needs to do get it going and transition and thats where North Carolina is at their best off defensive rebounding and pushing the ball youber Davis fired Applause up Hubert Davis pregame that he was mentioning that he could relate a little bit to RJ Davis being kind of the Lone Rangers Huber talked about when his roommates all left King rice and Rick Fox and Pete cut and it was like Hey where everybody go and its an adjustment Beed inside shot contested Jackson had it lost it and now its Kad into the front Court Carolina looking to chip away at an eight deficit Lu and it blocks but they get the foul you just feel a different sense of urgency from North Carolina and a defensive end a ton of deflections theyre getting those hands in those gaps people are communicating more the energy is just different in the building and Elliot CAU just doing so good has a 3 to1 assisted turnover ratio changing speeds getting in those gaps and making a play at the rim for Luben the abachi charges with the foul B all and Luben will go to the line you talked about lack of post up for North Carolina just start with lack of size in the rotation Alabama has four guys 610 are bigger and for North Carolina they basically play one jayen Washington we also talked about the staple for North Carolina used to be on the offensive glass and a guy like Luben leads the team in offensive rebounding and plays the eighth most minutes on the squad so it it gives you insight to thats not their strength this year but theres still a ton of room for improvement with some of these players have on a roster down low on the Block its a 70 North Carolina run and the crowd getting into it here at the Dean Smith sent foul on the floor and that last foul on Kad now book we talked about these early game deficits for North Carolina where their slow starts have hurt them 21 points down versus Dayton 19 points down versus Auburn 14 points down versus Michigan State have to find a way to come out of the gate and start executing defensively and connecting on offensive earlier pal swooping in for the rebound now its D miss the other Applause way Drake pal gets into the paint kicks out RJ Davis Carolina down by Applause six Jackson The Freshman HS cant hit a loose ball and eventually Grant Nelson picks it up thats what arm does he leads this team in Block shots let Ruckers in Block shots before he trans for just that solid Rim def finger that went it Music Applause vertical on good feed inside and the throw down there for Mor such a good Applause feed feel like Charles Bary havt G him on the yard you have even conr with me whats going on Davis turns the corter gets inside HS cant hit and a rebound Reed kadell back the other way kadell tried to go up and under and he got fouled Alabama I dont know about that last call Alabama so good at spacing out the floor good pass right there and amori just sliping the screen Luben goes out nobody rotates over from the weak side Strong finish tried to break the rim how you going to let me have Charles Barkley moments on national TV bro come on man no I love you set me up they calling him that name all day long and Im from Jersey disappointed in myself nothing from you I got nothing I mean I I was I feel bad because I was aggressive with you today extremely because of the the really the lack of GPS I mean you you as our driver today well you know Ive been in a motorcycle ACD I should be driving anybody I mean you should be driving I thought you just oh p with the steel finds Jackson collects and puts it in and its a fivepoint game under four and a half to go good def oh boy can I see that replay I am not sure and Jackson is so good defensively hes so quick look like Aiden Holloway kind of shot that ball out there lets see here good in and out yeah all right yeah thats a foul thats a foul but you still like the intensity under 420 to go 33 28 Alabama with the lead John shabby Jay Applause Williams Fon gets a piece of the paint kick out and thatll go for Aiden Hollow just a different player I feel like Im watching Aiden Holloway perform than he was last year Auburn just playing with so much more confidence offensively and not overthinking the game Trimble offensive rebound but it wouldnt fall and then Nelson had it knocked away couple good looks at it right Applause there Fon High arching shot and that falls he is so good at dple Drive situations so Shifty to chain speed to get some those gaps left hand wouldnt fall for Jackson tipped out of bounds with North Carolina when we come back who are some of the greatest players in Alabama history phon Fon Fon Fon Fon if you dont get the reference look it Music up Kentucky thats a travel and the other Applause way Sears with 11 Davis with 10 well like I said before for North Carolina just needs to be more physicality on the perimeter and set set it straight line drives guys like Mark Sears Trine has been able to get to the rim at Will Davis kick up ahead Tre off his hands out of bounds turnover and also here for North Carolina eight turnovers so far in this first half and theyve been unforced errors they just a little bit sloppy with the basketall ball not being sharp and precise yeah nether team shooting it exceptionally well Alabama at 46 pretty good but not certainly not Sears turns that one over thats one of the areas where NS wants to see them get better just too many turnovers at 15 versus Oregon like I said Oregon went for 18 points off those turnovers but thats more the style of defense that you want to see from North Carolinas guards in South trible push up body a guy like Mark Sears make life uncomfortable last two games Alabama minus 18 and turnover margin against Oregon and against Ruckers Davis to strong Nelson to rebound and he got hit in the face Applause and that one is out of bounds another Applause turnover watch Nelson Withers right there yeah raking up for the ball coming right across the face should have been a foul but as they used to say no blood no Applause Music call Carolina in a drought closing in on 2 and 12 minutes without a score and what Withers ends that Dr just because hes going to have the shot on the perimeter doesnt mean that he has to take it he can Goble up that space and drive the ball and try to get Grant Nelson in foul trouble he has the ability to put the ball on the ground and attack the rim that last foul on SE Trimble see before earlier he was settled and take that shot but no attack Grant Nelson put the refs in a position to try to make a call but thats where North Carolina can start getting more production from their bigs attacking with points in the paint vion Davis picks it up toss up ahead Jackson and the K from the Brooks with the throw in and itll Alabama basketball 129 to go here the first half a great look ahead byj Davis Jackson the McDonalds allamerican bring in the energy to this team thats where him at d p could be game changers for them from an energy perspective defensively on the perimeter and pushing the ball transition just electric to watch good back cut Nelson and use the rim to protect himself from Withers who was trying to contest Applause CLA Cel finds Davis and its rejected out of bounds 16 on the shot clock this M is so good coming from the weak side LED Ruckers in Block shots each and every season and he was a hot commodity this off season a lot of teams you know you hear a lot of assistant coaches talk about the transfer portal or as I like to call it free agency and some of the prices that guys drive for their ability and thats what you get when you get a guy like him Carolina was in on him Georgetown Kansas State Withers cant hit Claude and its knocked out of bounds itll be Alabama basketball 104 to go here in the first half from B thats a problem for a lot of these teams you know when you have returning first team AllAmerican players when you have McDonalds allamericans like everybody wants to get paid so like what is your cap you know how much can you afford realistically with some of these prices its one of my themes I I have a theme this year for college basketball and one of the five is bad Investments I think a lot of coaches like I should not have paid this amount of money for this player now thats not applicable here for NATO and his roster but its a common thing out here amongst coaches in college basketball a hollow knocks it down straight on three and the lead backed up to 11 Davis Eyes CLA with a good rebound Back Up and Under And it runes Home Alabama leading by nine its been a fast first half hasnt it step back Nelson and its short Jackson the rebound and well go to the break with Alabama on top 43 Music 34 yeah just talked about the importance of whats efficient and how they track all their different shot types Etc youre seeing it more and more in the college game yeah but also you know Nate o has higher go from the n as you see the great pass right there by pal for a strong slam but I mean natos has brought on guys like Ryan pen assistant with the New Orleans Pelicans Brian Adams higher from the Detroit Pistons hes more like the defensive coordinator uh they play an NBA Style system through and through sevenpoint game Sears got a text my guy jayen Maru shout out to you inside that one would go down for a Mor and Trimble hits the de so B back in the playoffs huh for football that way 4336 as we get going here in the second half all right a couple of notes first half Trimble with Just Four Points he averages 16 for the heels Elliot Kad with one point average is 14 so theyre going to need more production from those two guys Davis inside off balance shot was short and out of bounds which way which way and Brian okono said North Carolina Applause basketball also Seth Trimble a guy one of six from the field hes been averaging 16 points like you said before but I think he needs to get a lot more things in transition attacking and finding a way to get to the free throw line he was two of two in the first half but hes a guy with his upper body frame he should be averaging eight to nine free throw attempts per game easily Davis knocks that one down RJ got to heat it up in the second half and they get the foul on Drake pow so the Freshman fouling Grant Nelson Drake pal The Freshman from North Carolina hes actually Hubert Daviss cousin the 14th overall recruit in the ESPN Music 100 had his best game against Michigan State 18 points in that Applause one Stevenson kicks it out to Sears good ball movement thats a really good look just didnt go down Sears offensive rebound hangs couldnt hit and Sears will go to the line and he will shoot two hes just so strong with the ball we said earlier that Alabama averages around 15 offensive rebounds per game thats where theyre didly from the threepoint line but also on dribble drives and Sears with that larger upper body can just absorb contact and averages eight free throw attempts per game a master of getting to the free throw line thats a spot though Sears gets a good look doesnt knock it down North Carolina has to collect the defensive rebound Sirus has 20 more free throw attempts than anybody else on their roster its how good he is at getting to the free throw line great job by Stevenson staying on top top blocking that ball screen he is making life difficult for RJ Davis Hoy and k h and then underneath there was Jaylen Washington getting shoved and the foul will be on Le Baron fylon and so phon picks up the personal I but look at that size difference right there between Stevenson and RJ its a guy whos 69 610 hes shooting over that long extended even that shot right there the degree of difficulty so hard its like a 10 because the guy Stevensons behind you but has that wingspan he can block your shot from behind Nelson hand off to Sears whos got pal on him and now its Trimble on Sears Applause shot clock under 10 I dont know that Ive said that very much here in this game and Stevenson knocks down to three the kid from Chapel Hill whose mom Nicole played here at North Carolina hes been in this building a ton back cut Trimble wers back into the paint and Up and Under was short offensive rebound there from Washington back out Carolina sets it back up down by 10 Washington that one off the mark and here comes Applause Alabama Sears feeds Nelson puts it it this caress turnovers byon we even working shot beautiful Lear Fon hes got eight this this is the second time that La C just telegraphed the pass even on the transition pass he looked exactly where he wanted to pass the ball Fon saw intercepted it and then laid it in he talked about the young man from Chapel Hill that wanted to show you what he could do Stevenson knocking down the three and Alabama doing it on the defensive end causing Havoc fire line you got the reference in the first half is doing his thing floater a billis Chris Buon will have the call right here 5238 biggest lead of the game for Alabama our Starwatch Jedi broom and Cooper flag broom is a handful I said I I I know picking your National player of the year before you to get to Christmas is similar to choosing the Heisman in August but as of right now Janai broom is National player of the year I hes averaging a double double on 60 shooting from the field the wins that Auburn has had against top tier competition theres nobody playing better in the country than J Bama on a 90 run and the lead is 14 Davis hesitates the feed and the pass intercepted by fon careless turnovers Telegraph passes from North Carolina SP law short and that one tipped out Kad those are the passes that are hard for RJ Davis last year thats a dunk by Harrison Ingram or Rando bot Davis just could not get it to fall North Carolina in this one now two for 16 from the threepoint line and to me itd be hard to imagine Hubert Daviss group pulling off another amazing comeback without the a of the three theyre going to have to start to heat up from there yeah I mean its going to start with a sense of urgency on the defensive end creating some turnovers Alabama could be careless with the ball at times weve seen that in the game against Oregon but they need pressure to be applied Jackson and one and the Freshman Jackson will go to the line foul on Sears thats his third so that bears watching its little things like that from ttic perspective that I would try to attack whoever Mark Sears was guarding obviously with LR whell out he really took care of the ball for them he was their best threepoint shooter now Aiden Holloway has to play a lot more minutes Aiden Holloway can get going sometimes offensively but he can also get into a rhythm where he can take bad shots and shoot you out of games so attacking Mark Sears should be part of the game plan for North Carolina to get him off the court thats Nate o so so rils out what does that do he said somebodys going to have to step up and make shots and plus rightel was one of the guys that was taking care of the ball Fong into the paint kick out wide open Stevenson got how about Von just driving getting to the paint staying under control ball fakes he is looking at me he just winked at me oh my Applause goodness inside hangs it hits NBA athleticism and Applause talent oh look at Nelson inside and the blush might have been an an one Applause Music there cadell little pocket pass and he turns it over under 16 timeout and Alabama with the lead Jared Stevenson his last three games seven for nine from three hes been outstanding and into your living room Grant Nelson to me shows how good of a team Alabama is and look I I know theres a lot of talk about Cooper flag Dylan Harper might be the best freshman in the country uh hes been going off but that game they had against Houston was a dog fight uh they were emotionally drained the fact that they were able to come back and beat Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey its a really good Steve pel team and then lose to Oregon the way they did this is the Alabama team thats going to contend for a national title they get Chris Young bug black obviously have right so out hurts him but they are as talented as any team in the country then Allen Luben with the bucket and Carolina within 13 you know B we talked about this some of the caress turnovers for North Carolina its like that continuity some of the passes that Kad or RJ Davis have thrown typically guys like Armando Bott Harrison Ingram on pick and rolls like they roll very quick or they understand how to slip it still feels like theyre trying to build out their continuity their Rhythm their chemistry as a team Applause offensively Nelson with lu it on his hit hard contact Davis got P steps in the passing Lane grabs it up ahead Davis and the flush from Len and North Carolina put together a string of stops Nelson puts it on the floor Carolina back the other way pow puts it in up ahead and Nelson just waiting at the other end wheres the offsides call I mean where everybody from North Carolina was just trotting down the court I dont think anybody had any awareness that Nelson was down there by himself that one rejected by Stevenson and then Fon a foul on the floor and that foul will be on Drake Powell if any team in the country should be aware of transition defense after a May bucket it should be North Carolina thats what they do so exceptionally well you know Alabama plays the same way yeah yep a tough one for Elliot kdo just one point for the sophomore from New Jersey averages 14 Barett p on here turns the corner on Luben at the basket uses the left hand and puts it home another layup we we talked about the fact that Elliot cadoo self trembled and RJ Davis combin for over half of the teams points as of right now theyre six of 26 from the field Sears with the feed and amore with the deuce hes got four tell Fon has been impressive just a a freshman Davis and he gets fouled hard hell go to the line and shoot Applause two 15point Alabama Advantage a reminder weve got four conference championships on ABC this weekend as a college football playoff picture takes shape Friday night tan takes on number 24 Army for the American Title then Saturday at at noon the Big 12 Championship features Arizona State and Iowa State at 400 pm top five matchup Texas and Georgia for the SEC crown and we cap tonight the ACC championship between SMU and Clemson Drake May Pats QB in the house and thought about guy doing a lot with last huh oh RJ Davis knocking down the first hes got 13 but again the issue has been from Deep hes just one of seven from three and North Carolina two for 16 from Beyond the AR Davis gets him both and the lead is at 13 still to come Duke and Auburn from Cameron Indoor Stadium a pressure from North Carolina Dr pal should have came there when Pon turned his back he had him in the corner of the Court thats a dep trap position Applause Sears Fong and Jackson the rebound Jackson The Freshman lost the handle but it kicks out to fellow freshman Drake pal pal with the size advantage over Sears too strong and Houston malette now Sears at the basket hes fouled on the floor a one of the things thats been hard we saw Carolina put a little pressure on Alabama a couple possessions ago but if youre not getting makes its hard to set up that type of pressure in Carolina shooting under 40 so far in this game yeah and also you you have to force them into turnovers right I mean thats where you have to create points off your turnovers and I I think thats what youve seen consistently from North Carolina over the last four games its just you know Michigan state had 50 points in the paint and there was no answer for it and as youre seeing here just offensive rebound after offensive rebound theyre not being met with any physicality and theyre getting dunk after dunk after layup Dar and Reed able to find a Mor whos got Applause six Trimble fires and that wont go a tough night for SE Trimble Applause fre cant hit rebound and a Mor is Music Applause foul Alabama up 15 and just dominating the paint just get a shut up on the rim and well get the offensive rebound get their hands on things and this game feels like its starting to get away from North Carolina we Applause yes the bad investment thing is a real thing bro so now I hear you I would I would tug on the other end of the Rope a tiny bit when there used to be quote unquote investments in the past that we maybe didnt hear about them there were bad Investments then too werent there very true I I didnt say there was a time span on bad Investments maybe its a consistent theme yeah I mean I just I think I was a great investment person still to this day 17point Advantage biggest of the game for Alabama as we close in on 11 to go here in the second half two and Auburn coming up at the conclusion of our game as Davis knocks it down at two hes got Applause 16 RJ Davis struggling but he he feels like hes a guy that can turn it on and this is a North Carolina team that can get hot we watch them battle back being down double digits in multiple games Sears in close but couldnt finish North Carolina trying to chip away at a 15point Applause deficit Davis step back and that GRS out and eventually its Holloway with it good Applause swing oh that knocks it down well we told you getting a chance to play tonight for the first time hes knocked down a couple of Threes the transfer from pepperine and you see right now why Alabama has an assist rate of 61 Sears lost the handle Jackson head up Davis a three got to make that treble tried to put it back in one F swoop couldnt do it folks this weeks NBA Friday double header it starts in Boston where Jason Tatum in the Celtics post Yannis in the Bucks and then Anthony Edwards leads the twolves out west to take on Steph in the Warriors coverage begins s Eastern on ESPN with NBA Countdown thats coming up on Friday that last foul on Mohamad diaba now speaking of the Boston Celtics Nate oats talked a lot today about the time he spent up there in Boston spending some time with Joe missou and his staff really paying attention to some of the sets they run how they defend defensively him and Brian Adams have really made that a point of emphasis the assistant coach that they were able to acquire from the Detroit Pistons and that is how Nat runs his Applause system will check back in Trimble will take a seat a 17point Advantage Alabama on the road the number 10 team of the country leading the heels here in Chapel Music Hill B attempt and over shot Applause pow Jackson spinning pow will try cant hit Davis ball fake gets inside off the GLS and in 18 for RJ Caroline is two for 20 three nobody talking man re I mean thats just too good a look I mean theyre just getting wide open looks just rotating the ball it nobody questions whether North Carolina can score now RJ Davis is one of the best to is not only in ACC but in the country at getting to a spots and cting off the dribble like once again like the sense of urgency by everybody defensively to get back and tag men and to rotate with a sense of urgency is where you see them struggling K Tyson the Belmont transfer checked in for the darar Applause heels well you talked about wanting to see them run the ball through the post a little bit more but who do they do that through how do they do that well I dont think its running through the post I think a guy like Withers can put the ball on the ground and attack certain matchups right but its about getting them in operational positions on the court and thats why I think those guys have to play he they have to play through that to a degree cuz right now all of your shot dependency is off the dribble for guys like Davis C Po and tremble and Alabama has the size they have the length and thats been proven time and time again defensively when theyve G against the likes of the guards of North Carolina see thats unacceptable right there right re able to put it in man that was easy and back the other way Jackson answers with two of his own hes got seven fin L off the glass in it makes you feel like youre at an aou game doesnt it a little bit the baron Fon with a dozen Applause down Jackson knocks it down hes got 18 and got his season and career high from the corner Applause Stevenson kadell and Nelson getting tangled up 7460 Alabama on top well baltics threes twos and layups layups could be done in a variety of ways high and soft off the glass thats unacceptable you got to pick a side cant Cav shirt at North Carolina says Alina what are we doing I mean I now for one night take aide there we go was talking about this it feels like North Carolina is down 20 points they were only down 14 Now its 12 and 744 is a lot of time to get back in this game Stevenson the foul claw the the Georgia Tech grag transfer 24 years old one of the things youre seeing more and more in college basketball some of these older Applause guys brt Nelson leaving with his fourth foul Claude not able to make the free throw closing in on seven and a half to go Applause here Sears Daren Reed and Davis ends up with it Kad to the corner and Applause Jackson you could just feel this crowd wanting North Carolina to make a run yeah theyre ready Sears probing and that one taken away Jackson The Freshman up ahead P it air Jackson is playing like a boss hes got 20 and now the dean D coming to life the Freshman Dar and re throws it down with one hand he has nine probably their top Pro Prospect talk about athleticism careless pass there Fon lob and Amore hell go to the line with 625 to go and North Carolina in their press Mark here with his head up the whole time finding re with the wrong finish its almost like you dont want to see North Carolina press you want to see them go back to like almost like a quarter containment just to rush to get everybody back to protect the rim Roger AES Dr the basketball Music dont know whether thats perspiration or maybe some Rs hair gel on air but the hair never moves it just Ive been seeing this since I was a player its incredible hes got a great sense of humor one of the top reps out there and all right a reminder this saturday an ACC Network triple header BC takes on Wake Forest at noon Eastern then number 20 North Carolina hosting Georgia Tech we cap the afternoon with Stanford and Cal in a rivalry game thats right in the ACC its weird to hear right its taken a while for me to adjust to Applause yes now Elliot cadoo is a guy thats worked a lot in this game this offseason worked with Marcus pige one of the greatest players to play here one of the best guards to play here on his shot and hes made improvements thus far in this game only has four shot attempts Elliot cadell has to be more aggressive offensively and see right there like thats a midrange shot for him I know he can kick it back for the three but he has to start operating in that elbow range free throw extended line hes going to get a lot of midrange shots Sears is fouled they get Kate Tyson with the sh Applause and for Tyson his first personal foul itll be a one inone spot and Mark Sears will go to the line Sears excellent free throw shooter career 86 on the season 80 its really incredible when you think about the career that Mark Sears has had getting Alabama to their first final four in school history with some of the players that Nate oats has had on his roster six draft picks in the first round for Nate oats the style is something that has lured a lot of top tier talent and as much as people dont want to see the college game change uh what hes been on to with analytics in the NBA a lot of people are finding it attracted and as for Sears the kid from muscle schs Alabama started career at Ohio scoop is good for Trimble so Seth Trimble with the deuce Sears being harassed now Stevenson kicks it up ahead phon at the basket left hand and one 14 points for Le Barett fyon Jay will he has been a huge factor in this game ell Ellie Kad reaches right there I dont know why you reach right when you overextend yourself then you allow there to be a two1 situ I mean great finish by Fon I understand that super talented as freshman Ill Rave about him a second but that little overextension by cadoo you dont need to do that just stay disciplined right they beat the Trap they beat the Press just get back and get in quarter containment defense I hear your grumpy is it grumpiness Von back the other way L Fon by the way does not have a turnover in almost 30 minutes in this game the balls been his hand a lot and back in his hands so like I said before now its time to ra about fing right like its hes so poised for somebody is AG you see why he scored over 2330 points in three years in high school thank about that for a second plays like a veteran Fins an interesting story grew up an Alabama fan he originally committed to Auburn and then eventually he actually backed out of a pledge to Kansas ended Applause up well Ryan Griffin went to Kansas the guy that was on the final four team last year playing for Bill self and you look there theres so much change its hard for analysts yet alone people who are at home to keep up with how much Movement we have in college basketball and the coaches to integrate them into you know some type of a culture where theres chemistry and togetherness in a season or two you know its like a guy for RJ Davis you know now they they have new players on their roster and not having the continuity of Harrison Ingram or Armond Bott hes not a extremely vocal guy but now he has to do more of that and I I I get a lot of that struggle and the challenges that come along with that especially for the year that RJ Davis had last year theres a lot of him wanting to find a way to do that again so they puts more pressure on himself up and under and a foul as Washington will go to the line and shoot two 427 to go this one has been Alabama most of the way charged with that last foul his second 16point Advantage for the Crimson tied Ive been impressed me and look both these teams have played a good schedule Alabamas played a phenomenal schedule thats been a staple under Nate o since coming from Buffalo they play as tough a schedule as anybody in the country and in the middle of this seven game Gauntlet that still has Craton to come but yeah youre reading that correctly 11 one1 yeah best I mean do your homework early right I mean thats what theyre doing right now now talk about going against Houston going against Oregon going against Ruckers some of their really big wins playing in the players era which is a huge tournament know for eight figures um its been interesting hearing a lot of coaches talk around not wanting to be part of mte multiple team events playing three hard opponents in three days Im all for that book I I like challenges and you know I know its a lot but we used to play three games in one day as aou players back in the day right so obviously I know a is very different than college basketball and obviously what it does to coaches in their resumes uh but where you do that how far that is away from your home is dependent upon it as well well Danny Hurley was the one that really made the statement that hed never do it again that one were looking for a foul to Carolina Music bench Sears back the other way the lead is 13 you think Danny Hurley makes that same comment if they win all three games no exactly out of bounds itll stay Alabama basketball with 10 to go 826 again youre youre looking at one of the Premier talents in college basketball but again still learning right well I I think they have I I said it earlier I think they have the most talent and the most depth out of any du team in a long time now whether that talent in depth translate towards him winning another National Championship is a completely different story I think the concern I have about Duke is just their ability to have a playmaker that makes the game easy for everybody else and what Ive seen with Cooper flag and kiple they they get involved in ball screens but I dont think you can do that consistently I think you have to do that in doses so lets see how those other guards step up as they continue to mature and crystallize as a team Mory the easy flush North Carolina looking for a three here three for 25 from Beyond The Arc and theres Seth TR knocking one down hes got a dozen points they set up the pressure Sears being trapped steps through finds Nelson up to Holloway Alabamas been in control in this Applause one have executed the Nate Os plan to Perfection making life very difficult for RJ Davis and Company theyve been going under ball screens on Alex of Trimble and Koo they been knocking down shots at a high clip man Aiden Hollow with 15 and again Latrell ritel suffering to have Achilles injury good players averaging 11 and a half points a game and I me think about what this team Brook could have been if righto didnt get hurt and they also have Chris Young coming back hes a transfer from USF he provides physicality and Elite shooting they are loaded with Firepower 8974 back in 30 seconds Applause trips to the Sweet 16 programs first ever appearance in the final four and 117 wins in Five Seasons most wins in a 5year span in program history yeah I mean hes taken this program when you talk about the power of the SEC right now it starts with Nate o and Alabama yeah travel Roger and Brian Applause oconnell discussing wasnt able to move there and so a turnover Jackson it down him and power been super impressive I mean Ive theyre long theyre engaged they attack theyre not afraid the future is bright for those young Music Applause team the 120 to go the lead is a dozen for Applause Alabama its going up deep has to Sears and that wouldnt fall and theyll go possession arrow and it belongs to North Carolina obviously a disappointing loss for North Carolina wanted to get that sense for them coming off some of those tough losses in Maui but just going against a team that is just loaded offensively just has so many weapons left Music this has been dominance by the theyre going to improve to 10 and one in this Challenge and Duke is a good basketball team but I do believe that Auburn is playing the best basketball in the country they have the talent they have the depth and they have the experience most importantly I beg your pardon it will be 11 and one as Florida beat Virginia theres Sears with the icing on the cake as he knocks down to triple and has 20 Jackson stuffed by the Applause Music Applause rim Im okay with that thats your leader nothing easy obviously frustrated by this whole situation look this North Carolina team has talent obviously from their low post perspective they need Rim protection that thats going to be an ongoing challenge for them they cant allow a team to shoot the percentage of Alabama Michigan State and Kansas have shot in the paint but they can do it collectively they come together they learn how to fight together they just need to keep competing and playing for Hubert Applause Davis now some of the Alabama fans that are left as a Carolina fans make their way out yelling roll Applause tied Applause 9479 Davis over seers and thatll do it 9479 the final as
