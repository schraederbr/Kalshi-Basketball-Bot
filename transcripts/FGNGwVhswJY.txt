and i believe that caleb love is turning the corner hes shooting the basketball much better as his field goal percentage comes up but the important thing for caleb love is to be able to handle the basketball four turnovers in the first matchup versus nc state in 28 minutes three turnovers against wake forest on wednesday so hes going to have to keep that number down to make sure his team gets a great opportunity each time down the floor and we are underway a win today for nc state would give the wolf pack its first season sweep against north carolina corey in 18 years its never happened on roy williams watch and roy williams has been very adamant about the fact that he does not want that to happen so again this is not just another game for roy williams and hes hoping that his team reflects that in their energy and caleb gets off to a great start getting to the basket for an easy one and weve seen caleb love do that on a number of games and had two turnovers to start off the wake forest game however honed it down only had three for the entire game three at the other end for nc state you see the wolf pack starters carolina starting the same five as it has in recent weeks the one big name that were not sure if were going to see and if we do how much we will see is manny bates the terrific shot blocking center for nc state who corey was so good in the first meeting in raleigh yeah manny bakes blocked five shots in that game but also was effective on the offensive end seven for 11 field goals and put a tremendous amount of pressure on this dominant front line for the north carolina tar heels as we see garrison bruce get an easy basket and north carolina has the advantage in the post area garrison brooks getting that one but we also saw jericho helens knocked down a threepointer earlier for nc states only bass in this game and thats where the difference is the style of play where north carolina plays two bigs more traditional style nc state plays a four out one in and helms can be a matchup problem for the big guys in white drive to the bucket thomas allen getting the start tonight and off the turnover a chance for three more dodging a bullet on that possession a wide open look for allen whos led nc state in their last two games in scoring but we also have to mention that this is the first game in 10 days for the wolf pack who are on covet pause as kevin keats shows off his ball handling skills on the sideline as allen gets to the rim hes able to make the layup but then an immediate turnover gave allen a wide open three in the corner he was unable to knock down but 16 points for him four for five was really the only bright spot for the wolf pack when they made the trip to tallahassee against the nolt and allens been terrific coming off the bench the last two games four for five from beyond the arc in both those two games score yet they have him back in the starting lineup here this afternoon see the emphasis of north carolina to go inside armando baycard whos coming off a 18point performance on wednesday night against wake forest and getting the basketball inside early and often is going to be a point of emphasis for roy williams teams especially when you consider you want to try to see if you can get thunderbird in foul trouble and were not were not certain if were going to see manny bates in this game dealing with the ankle sprain and were not sure if well see bates in this one he missed the florida state game even though they had 10 days off kevin keats uncertain yesterday when we talked to him on zoom if bates would be able to participate in this game or not heres devin daniels draws two defenders gives it to helens who is fouled what do the wolf pack need out of devin daniels each night cory well devin daniels gives them one hes a very good rebounder but hes also their leading assist man so when you think about it hes not only scores but he has to make plays for his teammates but he is the leader of this team devin daniels a fifth year senior who transferred to nc state and when you look at devin daniels and having to play of course with shaquille moore the freshman cam hayes a freshman devin daniels really is the guy with the majority of the experience for nc state in the backcourt he averages 157 points per game tops for nc state 12th in the acc at this point this year Applause coach keats says that daniels really started to turn that corner for him midseason last year when he started being much more aggressive kind of take no prisoners and go into attack mode not settling all the time around the perimeter shot clock violation gives it back to north carolina Applause braxton beverly who coach keith talked to us about as well who have been battling a number of injuries but he loves braxton beverly and the warrior mentality for him getting out in the court we look at kevin keats in this fourth season at nc state hes won on this court in chapel hill his first year came in and got a big win but north has won the last two in this building but you know not every coach can say that they were able to come in and their debut at chapel hill walk away with the win erwin walton off the mark on his first shot braxton beverly quickly up ahead allen lays it in transition defense when you think about is the way that north carolina runs offensively you would imagine that they should never have a problem getting back on defense because they practice it so much armando baicot with his first two the tar heels leading scorer on the year makes it 76 state right now north carolina averaging almost 18 points a game on second chance points and ahead of their national championship pace in 20162017 and which would be the most for north carolina ever if they keep the 179 pace alone with the left hand this is braxton beverly who his coach kevin keats said yesterday affectionately thinks hes going on 36 years of age dealing with an ankle hes played a lot of basketball and when you play a lot of basketballs you deal with a lot of injuries i can attest to that firsthand account nc state comes up with the offensive board but trying to get it over that front line of north carolinas armando baycock comes up with the big block shot and because of his efforts four points already for baicot he gets a bit of a breather as deron sharp checks into the game and theres no breather for nc state when you consider you go out with bakehot and deron sharp comes in no drop off between these two dominant north carolina big and man bates has come in replacing jericho hellums four minutes in again manny bates missed the florida state game with an ankle injury that was 10 days ago the last time state played and well see how much he can go he only went for 30 minutes in practice yesterday and thats the first time hes practiced in almost two weeks one of the areas when you look at nc state right now playing the two bigs together and thunderberg is skilled enough to be a four so its not an issue offensively but it has a lot more to do with trying to keep north carolina off of that offensive glass kevin keats said himself their best offense is once they miss a shot caleb love with a wild bank shot hes got four the lead is three but you can watch caleb love play doug and see that hes playing with so much more confidence as of late as we compared to what we saw from him earlier in the season getting the job done defensively great defensive stand there by caleb love his nc state now only has 10 seconds to try to get a quality look tough runner by daniels garrison brooks feeds the post today ron sharp quick move no and that was over manny bates out of bounds off of the tar heels so the wolf pack will have it when we come back great action early for both teams nc state getting out in transition an easy bucket well joe linardi this morning calls this game quote an enormous acc bubble matchup saying the tar heels will have a hard time staying in the field of 68 with a loss this afternoon but one thing we can expect corey is this is going to be a close game based on the way the heels have been going this year yeah this is the first time that north carolina has played seven consecutive games where its been decided by seven points or less and considering that theyre all acc games roy williams still dealing with a very young team trying to figure out the best rotation the best way for this group to play and he says that they still need to make some strides defensively but he has to be happy with the start here the one point lead more importantly very few turnovers only one turner turnover to their credit yet to see rj davis or andrew playtech come into the game to play in the backcourt for carolina same starting lineup again for unc this afternoon step back by cam hayes a good looking freshman for state off the mark up by a point carolina with the basketball one of the things that really isnt talked about as much when you hear you know everyone talks about north carolina and their freshman and day ron sharp of course right on cue you should be talking about but kevin keats actually has five freshmen in this lineup as well and were starting a freshman backcourt in their last game out against florida state people dont necessarily talk about the youth of this florida sorry of this nc state team but hes playing a number of young guys as well has some veterans to go along with it but still some growing pains for the wolf pack turning defense into offense boy i tell you what as caleb love now has six points corey i love what ive seen out of the tar heels at the defensive end so far well theyve done the job defensively and it seems as though early in this game the tar heels have gotten the message from roy williams that this is not just another game and when you look at its a 102 run right now for the tar heels but roy williams made it very clear nc state is a rival and you know and you mentioned to me before the game that anyone under the age of 40 probably doesnt recognize how significant this rivalry is but those of us who have been around the game long enough you understand how big of a rivalry the nc state north carolina rivalry is as you and i were talking about before the broadcast late 60s early 70s when roy was an undergrad he played on the jv team as a freshman and then worked on the staff as a student assistant under dean smith for three years it was state that was uncs big rivalry when you look back at the series history between these two schools and you talk about at that time that was also when nc state went backtoback undefeated teams 1973 and then winning a national championship in 1974 but this is the 240th meeting all time north carolina has won twice as many games as has nc state in this rivalry but when you think about to the last one you know everybody only talks about you your last games the only one that matters and it was the wolf pack coming up with a big win on their home court on december 22nd daniels with a nice turnaround rj davis now into the game for carolina with playtech whose pass is deflected out of bounds by the freshman shaquille moore carolina will keep doug when i watch this game i look at the the first year guards they secure more checks out but youve got your kill more cam haze for nc state then youve got rj davis and caleb love playing together before playtech came in and thats something that hasnt happened much but i watched these four guys go at it over in winstonsalem at the cp3 elite point guard academy is thunderbird is able to finish up the missed attempts but when you when you think about these two teams and these freshman point guard going at it hopefully this is something we can see moving forward for a while bacon answers the follow slam from bates 1613 north carolina when they cut off to a quick start you see six points today at 116 points per game corey he leads carolina in scoring and not since the 194647 season when dr jim hamilton led the tar heels at 114 points per game has a unc team had its leading scorer under 12 points per game well under 12 points per game because unc not scoring nearly what theyre used to but armando bacon getting off to a great start in this one and you know mondos heard all the talk about manny bates and all the talk about thunderbird and how good the front line is and hes coming out today showing that hes just good or better than everyone on the front line and he took that game personally i actually spoke with him after the nc state loss and he took that game personally and hes come out showing that its personal for him trying to get a win devin daniels ties the game at 18 maybe the best passer on this carolina team feeds the post it comes to bacon just like that cory hes got double figures yeah hes got half of north carolinas points already 10 points for amanda baicot on the interior and when you look at now nc state going back to just the one big with bates on the floor thunderbird checking out its going to be difficult to try to defend north carolina in the painted area but devin daniels knocking down another midrange jumper trying to keep his team at bay lets see if they go to bacon again posting up baits instead sharp connects from 16 feet deron sharp may be the most dangerous of all the interior players and thats saying a lot because bacon is special as well but deron sharp and his mother are on a different level roy williams talks about his ability to rebound the basketball where north carolina is so special if hes able to consistently knock down the 1520 foot jump shot he becomes even more dangerous corey dont forget about garrison brooks who put 30 on nc state here at the dean dome a year ago bates gets the blocked shot its a hell ball and that takes us to our under 12 media timeout nc state turning defense into offense great hustle by devin daniels as helens is able to get out in transition doesnt finish but bates is there to clean it up xander he came into this game making 64 of his shots from the floor that number is only going up today you know i was happy to see armando the first person on the floor today warming up bringing his shoes out not wearing his shoes on the floor but bringing them out then lacing them up kind of getting a feel for the for this home gym of chapel hill and he so made himself at home early in this game coming out to a great start went 811 on on wednesday night versus wake forest on the field and five for six right now so you have to say hes shooting the ball very well but roy williams says that when armando keeps it simple hes very effective when he starts to doing too much theres too much spinning too much showing off his fancy footwork where he often gets himself in trouble he finishes that thought coach williams by saying just shoot the dang ball thats not something i ever heard from a coach by the way doug no i dont imagine including coach williams walker kessler in the game and on the scoresheet another offensive rebound when you think about north carolina kevin keats said it best oftentimes their best offense who comes after a missed shot when you think about baicot garrison brooks davon shaw walker kessler they are going to have a size advantage at most times on the glass and theyre turning them to normally about 18 second chance points per game as devin daniels has to make a great individual move over a strong defender garrison brooks to get an easy two while shouldnt say easy but to get the two for nc state yeah wolfpack picking it up from the floor now six of its last eight two point ball game just over eight minutes remaining in the half caleb love finds some space and buries the pullup but caleb love is playing you can see the confidence growing in him and roy williams hasnt played he and rj davis as much together but right now both those guys on the floor alongside anthony harris whos just returning in the florida state game and harris gives them an element especially on the defensive end that theyve been lacking but also a playmaker came in and making plays for himself and teammates in that florida state game and earning himself more and more minutes for coach williams harris has been used in short bursts the last two games since coming back from the knee injury eight minutes and then six minutes dont expect him to get extended run today but he is a valuable piece for roy williams that one north carolina concerned it may have been on the rim but you know very few whistles only two fouls caught in this game thus far so you gotta like the pace and you know both these coaches want to see a score in the 80s well preferably they could keep their team the opponent under 80 but they would love to see their team scoring 80s normally find success around that number love finds harris and he connects and harris can do that as well he has the ability to stretch the floor heres whos missed you know the majority of his last two seasons tore his acl during his senior year of high school and then played in five games last season and then tore the opposite leg ac on the opposite leg so ann harris has missed a lot of time but right now he is giving carolina a big lift especially knocking down the three off the bench but caleb love trying to get into class with armando baycott right now its been those two hills getting off to a great offensive start duke and louisville at 4 eastern then lsu second in the sec taking on kentucky the wildcats looking to turn things around still both games around espn and the app and corey this is the first time since 1995 duke is absent from joe linardis bracketology i can remember that team in 95 that was the year that coach k actually had to take a leave of absence due to a medical issue and missed really twothirds of the season at the end it was a struggle for duke that year but different this year because the freshman for duke are good but theyre not the same freshman that theyre used to having over the past few years that have allowed them to be elite and they also dont have the veteran presence to help them over the hump jordan goldwire who is a veteran wendell moore jr matthew hurt sophomores have not really been able to influence those younger guys in helping them lead them to victories right now and you look at the bracketology the acc with only six schools in but there are a number of teams floating around the first four out pittsburgh who is playing much better basketball jeff caple has his group playing well after their covet pause and then duke and syracuse in that next four out and when you look at it right now and you know and doug early in the season the acc was still and everybody talked about it being a down year the acc was still considered to have possibly nine to ten teams getting into the tournament so this is different from what we were expecting early in the year well corey with 50 days until selection sunday who of those acc teams who joey brackets has on the outside looking in who of those do you think is most likely to work its way into the field of 68 well i can tell you you know i had syracuse on tuesday and the way they shot the basketball they looked like a team that could definitely get in the mix and then the win for them today a big win over virginia tech definitely helps theyve got virginia coming in monday and so another opportunity to take on a ranked opponent but you know one thing thats hurting the acc is the fact that even your big wins arent as big because the teams arent ranked as high and so that is playing against something that weve never really seen in the acc but this has been an unprecedented year no question about him date with the basketball down three just over five minutes remaining in the half thomas allen picks up his dribble im sure youre shocked that i said syracuse on that one i appreciate that mentioning the big 78 to 60 win over virginia tech at the dome this afternoon by the way i think duke will get in as well so well jalen johnson it looks like hes getting back to it you know he does and armando looks like hes picking up where he left off before he took a break and went to the bench knocking down the jumper right now we saw mondo working on that in the pregame you know looking at the pass into the post no one there or playing off of him and daring him to take that jumper and there he steps up and knocks it down the young man who can shoot the basketball you havent seen much of it at north carolina because he plays so much with his back to the basket but has a nice touch from beyond stepping away from the basket team rebound back to the wolf pack i mentioned earlier baicot came into this game shooting 64 percent from the floor that would be good enough for second in the league behind notre dames nate liszeski but he is only averaging about 43 makes per game to to qualify for that stat youve got to make five per game and ill let the ratings go and he might get there today that may be the most disappointing stat ive heard all year long youre talking about a young man who ive worked with since the seventh grade and hes not taking enough shots thats a problem im sure youll talk to him about it oh i already have please believe weve got a text thread talking about that all the time its braxton beverly and coach keats happy to see him back in action and knocking down the three he has shot 55 from three against north carolina in seven games throughout his career and gets off to a great start from beyond the arc in this one thunderbirds got to step up for nc state because hes the one guy that can compete on the back well see you on the jeep halftime report a bit deron Music 3531 north carolina with the lead three and a half minutes remaining in the first beverly driving ditch we didnt get to hear a whole lot of what was going on in the studio but i did hear alfonso ellas talking about armando baycos performance so far thus far in the first half and of course fonz is always cheering on the bigs as deron sharp gives finds a little more to cheer about on the followup but you know when you think about it armando baicot davron sharp youre talking about two young men who most likely be playing in the nba relatively soon but they are traditional bigs in this north carolina system both have made a jump shot in this game doug but you dont see a lot of that from north carolinas biggs they do the majority of their damage at the rim and roy williams preaches to his team to make hard plays look easy keep it simple he talked about hank aaron and why hank aaron was one of his favorites because he made hard players our plays look easy and this is a hard play but it looks easy today ron sharp simply because huge has more effort more energy going after the basketball on that offensive board than did his opponent sharp with eight points four rebounds coming off the bench today he and the tar heels up by six and doug well go ahead corey north carolinas shooting 545 from the field right now nc state is allowing opponents in acc play to shoot over 50 so when the wolfpack are unable to turn teams over they struggle defending in the half court and right now north carolina is firing on all cylinders now up to 559 from the field you said about field goal defense next to last in the acc for the wolf pack wolf back turnover and kevin keats watching what was a tight game for the first 15 16 minutes get a little separation here only three turnovers from north carolina thus far in the first 18 minutes of this game and you compare that to 18 total turnovers where they le where they trail by 17 and north carolina has only had a halftime lead four games this season so theyre used to trailing at the half and having to come back theyve been outscored about 29 points on the season in first half of games combined this year so going to be a little different roy williams in his halftime speech talking to his team about what they need to do in the second half going in in the next two minutes roy williams has never had a team in carolina that finished the season with more turnovers like that one than assists but this team is on that pace right now the third turnover of the game and you see how frustrating that is to roy williams however you know and hell never be comfortable but hes feeling much better about things right now with the eightpoint lead with 154 remaining than he would be shaquille moore off the mark another rebound for armando bacon Applause walton feeds the post facade faces up and now goes to work blocked by bates out of bounds carolina will keep manny bates is a special defender when you consider averaging three blocks a game one of the tops in the ncaa and leads the acc right now but he is the third fastest player to 100 block shots as far as games in the acc since 198586 would you happen to know who those other two guys would be top of my head no i am surprised at you dougie fresh but one is simple i mean one is pretty easy i mean if you think acc shot blocks over the last 30 years youve got to thank tim duncan lets start there yeah then alvin jones at georgia tech actually was second fastest to get to 100 block shot so manny bates putting himself in some great company along the shot block leaders in acc history and you know mannys on pace to wind up alongside thorough bailey and bj anya as the greatest shot blockers in program history but right now north carolina trying to bring manny away from the basket on the defensive end offensively he continues to excel catching the basketball but right there deyron sharp with an opportunity to post up against jericho hellums will hell have the size advantage over manny bates not able to get over in time to block that shot so its a good buck and an opportunity for the and one for dayron sharp carolina on a 102 run state calls timeout well take a break and be back to the dean dome in 30 seconds with miami and wake forest followed by florida state georgia tech then number 13 virginia and number 16 virginia tech and finally its pitt hosting notre dame dont have acc network well go to getaccncom for instance access with corey alexander im doug sherman glad youre with us for the final seconds of this first half between state and carolina in whats been a cleanly played first half theyve not heard much at all from the officials roger aires pat driscoll tony henderson only six combined fouls now seven combined fouls in this half corey great defensive effort there by caleb love rotating out to hellums and then moving his feet switching on secure war taking that offensive foul and right now caleb you can see you know just his energy is different you start making shots it changes everything about you and right now caleb loved putting together a great first half for north carolina along with baycott and davron sharp theyve had their way on the offensive end of the floor and is creeping over into that defense as well shot clock off tar heels holding for a final shot has deflected away goes out of bounds wolf pack basketball my fault caleb thats on me ill take that turnover i talk too great about how hes been playing thats on me ill take that one well call that announcers jinx but right now 63 seconds roy williams wont be as upset about that turnover theyre able to get a stop beverly with a foul to give carolina gives it with two seconds to go so just the third team foul against the tar heels do you expect another one here on this inbounds i do not because one thing you dont want to do is continue to add up fouls especially on guys like garrison brooks you never know how this thing turns out it may be a close game at the end and you dont want to continue to add fouls to his tag daniel tough shot at the buzzer doesnt go armando bacon heads to the locker room with the tar heels up by 10 head their way both guys with matching six for eights from the field right now for 12 points and shooting the basketball extremely well more importantly rebounding and thats where north carolina makes a statement always won the best in the country doing so and theyve done that in this game as well now rebounding state 19 to 14 and corey 28 of those 43 points for carolina have come in the paint walton way off the mark on his first shot of the second half here comes north carolina state Music devin daniels with a basketball he leads nc state with 11 points nice pick and roll to thunderberg to get him going Music nc states going to need thunderberg to be able to give them points on the offensive end but also theyre going to have to trust him defensively to keep bay cotton sharp off the glass and just like that another turnover that turns into a bucket for nc state and just like that a 40 run to start the half for the wolf pack to make this a sixpoint game and im sure roy williams not happy to see his team turning the basketball over to start the second half walton forces his way to the bucket and banks it in kerber walton known as a shooter but going off the bounce recognizing there that he feels that he can win his match up doing a great job putting points on the board for carolina especially after a rough start offensively tar heels trying to run off the long rebound now hes set up same starting five in the second half for north carolina youve got to recognize that armando bacon has jericho helens on his back jericho helens is a very good basketball player but he is undersized to have to defend the bigs from north carolina if youre kerber walton on that possession youve got to give baycod an opportunity to be able to get over there and get his post position get the ball inside if nc state is going to double team then somebodys going to get an open one but that was a mismatch that north carolina missed out on love gets the roll 4737 the lead back to 10 to start the second half kevin keith going with a more veteran backcourt he talked to us yesterday corey about just how challenging it is for any team but especially in this season with the odd offseason in preseason to play freshman guards and win basketball games in the acc well doug you missed the entire summer where you know now college basketball programs practice in the summertime and thats really where you learn your system and when you miss an entire summer of getting guys acclimated to the way that college basketball has to be played where they find their spots for you and then you also consider the fact that theyve had four canceled games three post post games already on this season two separate times nc state has had to pause basketball activities because of cobra related issues so its hard to do that especially with younger players and younger guards because theres so much responsibility putting those guys but devin daniels who was a fifth year senior recognized that responsibility one of the reasons why hes leading this team of scoring at 157 points per game and knocks down a big three after two backtoback basses from north carolina two more big man from richmond yeah it does when you see that baicot if if helens is going to guard baycod he has to get the ball in every possession now thunderbird thats different you know theres a theres a more of a size comparison between the two of them but against helens hes got to be able to take it Music great set up by daniels now the takeaway by beverly hes got his second layup of the second half and a nice interception right there by beverly what would have probably been the transition bucket for north carolina ends up being a turnover an opportunity on the other end authentic opportunity missed you see brooks looking ahead but a great job right there braxton beverly playing free safety on that one coming up with the pick and coach keith referenced you know turned over some touchdowns yesterday in our conversation with him talking about as we see another turnover from north carolina is this a touchdown where he says his team needs those caleb love does a great job getting back defensively blocking the shot and shaquille moore not recognizing where he was touches that out of bounds well its in the dna of nc state especially under kevin keats to turn you over and thats a big part of why they won the first game between these two teams back in december in raleigh they forced the tar heels into 18 turnovers but maybe caleb loved and rj davis for more apt to turn it over a month ago than they are now i believe so doug and i think that both these guys have grown as basketball players you know during that time but nothing can beat experience and when you have to go through these battles in the acc and you have getting consistent minutes and opportunities to continue to do it over and over again you find ways to be successful weve seen that with caleb love whos now taking a seat as rj davis has stepped onto the court to take over the point guard responsibilities for north carolina meanwhile shaquille moore who was so good in that first game scored 17 to help the wolfpack beat the the tar heels by three he has yet to score in this game and has played limited minutes and the other freshman guard was so good cam hayes has yet to score this afternoon for state daniels in trouble hes tied up and the possession era will stay with nc state great play there by leaky black just getting his hands on the basketball devin daniels recognizing what doesnt recognize nikki black helping thats an easy driving kick youve got to get that to your teammate in that possession fouled by brooks off the inbounds pass well corey weve been talking about how tough it is for freshmen especially in the acc to acclimate and get up to speed its been a few years since you were a freshman point guard in the acc but if you can remember what was the single most difficult transition from high school to the acc for you for me it was the fact that i had brian stith who i needed to get the basketball to and of course my senior year at oak hill i had both junior borough and ben davis to you know elite level big men to throw the basketball inside too so i didnt wasnt always the first optional offensive end of the floor but when i got to virginia it was get brian sniff the ball everybody else ate second brian stiff ate first and so that was different from me having to recognize there was someone else that needed opportunities you know from before i did and again that was a learning curve for me but yet it helped me become a better basketball player and it also helped the fact that brian stiff was so good that it was easy to get into basketball garrison brooks by the way out of the game with three personal fouls that uh bucket by rj davis his first of the day lead back to 10 for carolina daniel says it knocked away it goes right to thunderberg who lays it in Music feeds sharp on the post in spite of the double team missed the shot long but what has happened doug youve seen kevin keats have to go get both of his big guys in the game as they share the basketball well but coming up with a huge block going all manny bates on manny bates and as you said when state goes big bates will play the five thunderbird plays the four but its fake hot on both ends of the floor doing it for carolina and manny bates had five blocked shots in the first matchup between mondo on some get back and you know a message on both ends so far today well i believe so he probably told him to go block manny baits shot as mondo base get abundant bacon gets back in transition and comes up with a huge block for manny bates in that possession but mondo off to a great start in the second half as well seven for nine from the field now as north carolina is shooting 58 percent from the field only one for six from beyond the threepoint arc but in this game it doesnt matter how well theyve shot from outside because theyve gotten the basketball inside as much as theyve wanted to and armando bacon deron sharp have been awesome on the interior and armando had a good freshman year i mean he had 11 double doubles his numbers were pretty good but he is so much better so far as a sophomore well and that comes with consistency hes much more consistent this year you know mondo had big games a year ago double doubles as you mentioned 23 points versus oregon and but yet the next game he may have two points for not score this year roy williams has been able to rely on him and his consistency hes been the most consistent player for the hills this season and leading them in scoring under 12 points per game but that will go up after this one already 14 in this contest cam hayes with the basketball for nc state the freshman from greensboro he finds thunderbird a little bit strong sharp picks the rebound away and hands it off to davis rj davis behind the back the pullup nothing but net under control beautiful play and recognition by rj davis roy williams wants to play fast rj does a great job pushing the basketball but more importantly recognizing theres nothing there in the paint but no one guarding you know who could very well be the best shooter on this north carolina team when he knocks down the ease it certainly seems like the first several weeks of this season both davis and love were pressing and hunting for shots which they dont seem to do that much anymore well rj davis is a knockdown hes a scorer so hes always going to look for his shot but as he learns how to play the position and uh but i grew up in the area of mickey mantle and hank aaron and willie mays and uh i loved watching those guys and and hank aaron was just one of the best of all time and of course cameron hank passed away yesterday morning and so unfortunately weve lost yet another baseball hall of famer but hamrin hank is somebody who can you can certainly look up to regardless of the sport right corey absolutely and again you know im not as uh seasoned as you so i dont remember watching henry aaron play herron hank but i do remember him as a civil rights activist and again you know one of the things that i take most from hank aaron is when he spoke out about if his legacy is only that he hit 755 home runs and batted 305 for his lifetime he hasnt done a good enough job he had to have done something that helped mankind and to me he definitely did that and you know i know you had an opportunity to actually meet him i never got a chance to meet him but i know you actually got a chance to meet the legendary about 20 years ago and i had a chance to chat with him oneonone for a few minutes and like youve seen everybody say the last two days theres not a classier man that youll ever come across and you treated everybody like gold and as though you were long friends one of my early memories was seeing him pass babe ruth on monday night baseball with his 715th home run and i did get a chance to see him play one time when i was a small child so yeah hammer and hank has has reached lots of people and as you alluded to corey for black folks and for the black community he meant even that much more agreed you know you mentioned that hitting 7 15 and of course as everything went down yesterday im just going back over everything i possibly can hang out related i had no idea that craig sager was the reporter that met him at whole plate like its his team and then all of a sudden its craig sager why is sage right there meeting him but he actually said after that craig sager met me at home plate and weve been friends for 41 years after that which is amazing yeah and so when you see that the next time look for the radio reporter in the tan trench coat thats craig sager no flashy jackets back then Applause 6151 nearly eight minutes gone here on roy williams court hey he told a good story about his signature on the the floor that they light our full day of hoops across all our networks and tonight on espn plus ufc 257 conor mcgregor is back squaring off against dustin poirier the number two lightweight contender in the main event seven years after mcgregor tko poirier they are back for the rematch thats a look at tomorrows and todays big lineup i would have to say that ufc is a lot more interesting when conor mcgregor is involved again i mean you know ufc is always going to be interesting but when you have a superstar like conor mcgregor it just raises the level of interest from everyone it has nothing to do with this fighting is solely about personality and again you know i would watch just to see him walk in the room he has a very distinctive walk when he steps into the ring to let you know i am here and i mean business the only way to see that fight espn plus payperview 11 25 remaining second half carolina with a 12 point lead they lit by 10 at the break leaky black the rebound here come the tar heels danny bates with another block shot i tell you what you have to know where he is at all times because there are very few shots that youre going to get away from the outstretched arm of manny bates and just like that it starts an opportunity on the other end of the floor and base unable to do it does a good job there defensively keeping davon sharp from being able to score in the post well bates was a game time decision coming off an ankle injury that cost him nc states last game and uh he practiced he returned to practice yesterday and uh from the time we saw him come out on the floor today looked like hes been moving pretty good and back in the day you know you know im not a fan of floaters but back in the day we used to shoot what was called giant killers those shots were made specifically for guys like manny bates where instead of trying to put that at the square you pretty much throw that shot to the top of the backboard and then dare manny to go get it now whether you make it or not thats different but at least hes not embarrassing you by blasting your shot across the glass and with no fans in the stands us getting an opportunity to hear what he has to say to you after he smashes your shot on the glass now ralph sampson to me was that guy back in the early 80s and you you guys did not overlap at uva but have you ever attacked him in that manner driven the lane and try to get that shot up over somebody as tall and long as ralph um yes not as tall and long as ralph but dikembe mutombo and i can remember my coach at the time during my rookie year in san antonio bob hill actually told our team not just me after he threw my shot at his third roller stand but our entire team stopped taking the ball to paint it was that bad he blocked every shot on the reverse another layup for anthony harris whos been quite a spark off the bench this afternoon Applause you know anthony harris back in the lineup and playing and ive talked to his father a number of times about hey have him redshirt sit out but with the new ruling of the ncaa where no one loses a year of eligibility this season good to see anthony harris back on the court and playing well of course hes clearly healthy enough to be effective and he is helping this north carolina team and you see playing in short stretch as he comes back out of the game but driving and the opportunity to finish on the other side of the basket and right now anthony harris really has been a spark plug for this north carolina team five points for him in the game against florida state didnt score against wake forest but he makes plays for his teammates as well its not only about him scoring its about his playmaking ability on the court foul on brooks and thats his fourth and those seven points scored so far today quarry by anthony harris part of a seasonhigh 31 bench points up to this point for the heels and normally thats something were seeing from nc state you know during kevin keatss tenure over the four years nc state they averaged 24 points per game off the bench so thats something that hes normally giving his teams are normally giving but right now only six bench points for nc state in this game so carolina has been definitely dominant in that area as well as scoring points in the bank caleb love end to end for two i more seeing this caleb love to be complete im a big fan of caleb known caleb for a long time watching him play and seeing him play really without you know his his level of confidence early in the season was discouraging but i like the fact that hes continued to stay at work hes well documented how much extra work hes putting in on his own late at night getting shots up in the gym and you can see his confidence growing you know by each and every game that time though blocked by bates the health defender you got to stop talking good about caleb every time i say something good about caleb he does something one you cannot square up manny bates and think youre going to get a shot off okay that does not happen you see him dont shoot it drive past to do something different because that is just adding to the tab of manny bates as he comes up with two blocks alone on the last two possessions and we spoke to roy roy williams probably telling caleb love the same thing hey caleb respect what that man does he is a shot blocker just like bob hill told us stop taking it in there at you know weve talked about the knee injuries that harris has had to come back from and how much time away from the game he has had same is true for manny bates he had multiple shoulder surgeries coming out of high school where he missed 985 days between games he missed his whole senior year as well as you know red shirted his first year at nc state missing that year so but came back strong as a freshman as you saw earlier most blocked shots 83 most blocked shots by a freshman in nc state history and he continues to impress now in his sophomore season he got the sophomore year underway with a big win at st louis where he had 20 points in a careerhigh eight block shots against the billikens long rebound out of bounds back to the wolf pack trailing 6755 under eight minutes remaining at the dean dome checking in on baylor and oklahoma state the cow pokes playing without their star freshman kate cunningham matthew meyer there to clean up the follow theyve been going back and forth that shot actually gave baylor the lead but oklahoma state has regained the lead right now 49 48 13 minutes to go less than a half hour away into jalen johnson and duke take on the bill thank you reese back in chapel hill north carolina has led pretty much the second half by double figures with corey alexander im doug sherman and you see that roy williams court signature there i mentioned it a few minutes ago roy said that when they asked him in 2018 first he was humble and he was honored but he said i want to make sure that my autograph is legible he learned that from both dean smith his mentor and also arnold palmer if somebodys going to take the time cory to ask you for your autograph the least i can do is take my time and make it legible why are you telling me that damn i mean ive been saying autographs for the last you know 40 years since i was seven and now you tell me that because your mind is not very legible ill be completely honest but my mother probably saved the phone book that i outside practice my autograph on from the time i was seven all the way through high school i dont have one of your autographs no no i dont give autographs to family you see so family doesnt get autographs thats been a rule for you know since high school gotcha well when i heard coach williams tell that story about his signature that you see there on the floor it didnt surprise me that sounds like its right on point for coach williams so does that mean that his normal autograph slash signature does it look like that yeah i dont know if hes got a gamer and hes got a private one i dont know right now hes loving the ball movement from his team walton who was a knock down shooter getting attention and because of that theres no help with the easy dish in debaco whos able to finish it off armando bancott with 16 points slowed down as far as his field goal percentage but you see right there roy williams loving what he sees from his team on the offensive end of the floor right now it has to be loving what hes seeing defensively as well as theyve done its got a very good job you know limiting nc state nc state right now only four for 13 from beyond the threepoint arc theyre shooting 463 from the field which isnt you know you wont say great defensively but when youre shooting 55 for the game youll take your chances when you make more shots than your opponent walker kessler back out there for unc on the screen and roll gets it blocked by bates tries again and draws the foul heres our big monday games on espn and the app number 13 virginia sits atop the acc and hosts syracuse at 7 eastern then we head to the big 12 for the matchup of the night number 12 texas tech takes on number 14 west virginia in morgantown the whos play georgia tech tonight 8 oclock on acc network in a big game both those two teams are the hottest in the league right now both riding fivegame winning streaks but uh your whos i think corey are going to be up against it on monday as a part of big monday oh so you you think that you think that theyre up against a monday versus syracuse but not necessarily as much you know tonight versus georgia tech is that what youre trying to say even though georgia tech is five and one in the acc right now youre understanding me perfectly i like this partnership weve got going here well i can tell you right now you know things are starting to settle out what we thought would be the case in the acc where the university of virginia is the best team in the conference right now when you look at the three teams ranked in in week 9 now there is a possibility that your orange may have knocked out virginia tech from the rankings come monday virginia tech ranked number 16 this week but they did not have a game earlier in the week and losing at syracuse could have possibly knocked them out clemson florida state at abc today and well see will florida state be ranked next week and clemson im not sure if theyll be if they win they may be able to get back into the rankings but i doubt we see them in the rankings next week because florida state looking for some get back against the tigers who were able to beat them earlier this year manny bates another block shot how many blocks does he have right now i ive got to look im not sure that manny bates is getting the credit for every block weve got seven so far so one of the career high he is getting them because because im trying to figure out why they keep shooting in front of him i mean if im sure you know north carolinas had six different leading scorers in their last six games theyve also had seven different players get their shot blocked by manny bates in this game when you think about i mean hes not discriminating hes blocking everybodys shot i meant to ask you when we were talking about dikembe mutumbo getting your shots i assume you got the finger wag um no i did not i dont think i was at a level there to where he felt it was necessary i mean you know you got a sixmonth point guard rookie coming in here trying to lay the ball up against you now my my boy good friend antonio mcdice volleyball spiked my shot into the into the stands you know the next time we played there and and that one was more so of a conversation afterwards because thats my point you dont you dont you know what i wanted to share something that we talked to coach williams earlier today i thought theres a neat stat for carolina in their last six games they have had six different high scorers and in their last five games they have had five different defensive players of the game and i asked him which of those two he preferred and without hesitating corey he said the defense well he wants it to be a competition amongst his team as far as who wins the defensive player of the year game play of the game after every game he wants them to battle and compete for that and right now with the 14 turnovers for north carolina youve seen nc state find their way back into this game its now a sixpoint game after braxton beverly continues to do what he does against unc which is knocked down three walton tries to answer and does back to a ninepoint game and thats a big bucket by walton to keep nc state at bay just a bit simply because you can feel some momentum momentum building up for the wolf pack is another momentum shot devin daniels knocking down the three to top the key and its a two possession game right now as we go to our under four timeout nc state starting to find their way here in chapel hill with no fans theyre starting to feel comfortable Music espns exclusive presentation of college basketball see mj walker in the knolls laying it on clemson early yeah improved every his game his ability to get to the basket known as a threepoint shooter but you cant turn it over against this florida state team 3318 to score 19 minutes well tip it off now underneath that matthew hurts second in the acc in scoring put on 25 pounds and a terrific player so far for the blue devils duke and louisville coming up now matthew hurt among those many players cory right now who are in the mix for possibly being first team all acc i would say theres two guys who are locks right now and then there are maybe 10 others including matthew hurt who could give first team all league well who who are the locks again justin champagne agreed wow okay i i love i love mj im not going to say that hes a lot right now i mean so youre stepping out on them there more so than i am regarding lock i dont think that theyre other than championing there probably arent any locks to me simply because theres so much more basketball that has to be played but think about what colleague jones has done for louisville right i mean you know he hes been special sam houser has been special as has jay huff from virginia you know its going to be a very difficult decision this year but mj walker of course i think he will end up being a first teamer because florida state will be at the top of the league but i think that you have to say hey who had more impact on winning i think thats going to be a more important factor this year as you look at virginia 50 florida state 41 in the league most likely going to be 51 after today justin champion as you mentioned pittsburgh has had a revitalization under jeff caple and right now playing very good basketball but as you move forward what about kevin luma from virginia tech i mean its been so many players this year in the acc that have had success you know and its going to be an interesting voting by the end of this season to try to figure out who those all acc teams are well after my two locks i had carly jones next as you mentioned then cavia luma fourth quincy guerrier xavier johnson matthew hurt but then that doesnt even take into account as youve mentioned the uva guys and if theyre in first place one of those guys is going to make it then how about georgia tech moses wright jose alvarado i mean those guys are very much in the mix i agree which which is why when you said that mj walker and justin champagne were locked i was a bit shocked but i mean justin champagne is playing in my opinion heads over hills better than anyone in the league right now i mean when you consider it seems to be every time you turn around hes putting up like a 3015 game he has just been a monster all season long and also being very efficient going about his work carolina up eight under three minutes remaining step back three for love is an air ball but there to clean it up man and harris is just continuing to make winning play after winning play and again you know just being in the right place at the right time gives north carolina a 10point lead once again off of what would have been a bad offensive possession and a shot clock violation and a derek wittenberg assist for caleb love Music the put back by thunderbird this is love with a basketball out there with harris in the back door leaky black whos been quiet today coming off a sensational eight assist one turnover game harrison brooks has been saddled with foul foul trouble most of the afternoon you were saying cory well if youve watched a lot of north carolina basketball this year youve noticed you know who does roy williams choose to end games when you consider his big men and oftentimes is this lineup with garrison brooks and davon sharp but with as well as armando baycott has played but also the fact that kevin keats has two bigs on the floor i would have probably thought that you may go with bacon sharp in this one to finish the game simply because you have the ability to rebound the basketball even better we saw in the previous possession where thunderberg was able to go over the top of garrison brooks for the put back and thats a possession where normally armando baicot would have come away with that defensive rebound so interesting to see the lineup that coach williams is finishing with here in this one coach williams typically starts the season in november and december using an 1112 a 13man rotation and by this time of the year hes got it down to his 9 or 10 and we seem to be finding that pattern a little bit more weve not seen puff johnson so far this would be the first game he has not played walker kessler has only had a couple of minutes andrew playtex minutes are way down the last couple of games so i think roy is starting to figure out where he wants people to be and what rotations and combinations he wants over the next six weeks until well selection sundays only 50 days away well roys had some assistance with that by the fact that caleb love and rj davis have been playing better and see you know it was andrew playtech who made the gamewinning shot versus miami but you also had to think about the fact that the two freshman point guards were not playing well you had to have one of them on the floor but definitely not both of them but coming down the stretch here tonight you have both of those guys on the floor as thunderbird continues to have an effect on this game especially on the offensive end of the floor devin daniels losing the basketball but fun to work thunderbird not giving up on the possession and because of that comes up with the m1 opportunity Music so that fouled garrison brooks out and gives dj thunderberg 14 points and hes got a chance to once again make it a two possession game doug do you remember back in the first half at the end of the half when you asked if they would take another foul when they had fouls to give and i said you dont want to put garrison brooks in a situation where hes in foul trouble at the end well garrison brooks just fouled out of the game and so you know when everybody talks about what youve got fouls to give but you have to be very careful is who you want giving those fouls because youve got your best you know interior defender fouling out of the game right now now of course baicot and sharp have probably played the best in this game so therefore im sure roy williams is comfortable with both those guys on the floor but he theres no one that he has more of a comfort level on the defensive end of the floor than he does with garrison brooks well corey coming up next our full day of great college basketball games rolls on with a big game between duke and louisville 4 eastern followed by lsu and kentucky in the sec both games are on espn and the app we also saw devin daniels took a shot to his left cheek and required a little bit of treatment from the training staff he stays in the game foul given with a minute 13 remaining regulation well a lot has been made about the fact that duke carolina and kentucky have all been to the tournament every year since 61 and these are some of the things that were going on in the world of sports and around the country back in 61 the packers of course won an nfl championship without the big o the cincinnati bearcats won the national championship you saw mickey mantle sign for 75 thousand but this is to illustrate it was dean smiths first year back in 61 the last time the tar heels were on the outside looking in at the same time both duke and kentucky missed out last time they were all unranked i should say theres so many firsts this year corey between the blue bloods that it can be confusing but the reality is its just a different kind of year all the way around i agree wholeheartedly and when you look at this year and you talk about the three teams between duke north carolina and kentucky the one common denominator between them you have young backcourts and again when you have young back courts it is difficult to win in college basketball especially when you consider the fact that they did not have the traditional summer preparation that they would have had in a normal year and i think that has been the biggest kicker as to why the three bluegrass programs have not had their level of success that they normally havent simply because theyve got younger players in the backcourt that are having to try to find their way on the fly veteran players to really help them figure it out first time in 60 years had an ap poll without duke carolina and kentucky haycott was fouled by thunderberg and well head back to the free throw line to shoot two but offensive rebound on a freethrow miss in a you know in a 10point game youre trying to come back and beat your rival that is really where kevin keats has to have a level of disappointment with his team and you cant blame it on the fact that they dont have the size right now because youve got bates as well as funderburg on the you know checking out underneath but yet and another opportunity right there they come away with it but north carolina was close to picking up another offensive board uniform carolina has controlled the glass this afternoon they came into this one plus 114 in rebound margin per game fourth in the country tops of the acc and well if you look at the box score right now its 44 to 30 carolina overstate north carolina is going to get 40 rebounds you can put that in the book when the game starts everything that they do beyond 40 is is you know pretty much a bonus but when you look at what theyve been able to do on the offensive end of the floor armando baycock coming up with 17 points davon sharp 16 caleb love 14 rj davis and harris both with 10 but the fact that you have five players in double figures a balanced scoring effort for north carolina and coming into shooting 544 versus nc state roy williams has to be happy with that and when you get to 80 points for a roy williams team he is winning close to 90 percent of his game so 80 is the magic number for carolina blue theyve achieved that here today gotten it from the starters theyve gotten it from the reserves 38 to 10 in bench points in favor of north carolina and uh i dont know if coach williams will admit it afterward but you really do feel much better about the prospects of this team especially after their last two games corey but you do and this win will put north carolina at five and three in the acc and for all the documentation about how theyre you know not as good as they have been theyre not the traditional power whatever may be that puts them in the upper tier of the acc and when you consider every win in acc play is significant you continue to get better and better and i think thats something that north carolina is doing on a daily basis theyre getting better at each and every game you see what caleb love was able to do today limiting his turnover shooting the ball at a much better percentage but getting the ball inside to both baycod as well as davron sharp north carolina flexing his muscle on the interior and this is the way that roy williams wants to play he wants to be able to score 86 points in the game he wants to make sure his big guys are getting touches but also wants to make sure he has a point guard leading the way that he can rely on to knock down occasional jump shots and not turn the basketball over and four of the five players in double figures are freshman corey fraction beverly in amongst the trees dumps it off and bakes throws it down Music and again the assisted turnover very good for carolina 18 assists 13 turnovers so that ratio is trending in the right direction for the tar heels and they will knock off their rivals from raleigh 8676 to earn a split of the regular season series Music a strong performance for roy williams group today especially armando baicot dayron shaw caleb love all getting involved in the in the first half early in north carolina undefeated at home on the season at 60 where roy williams and i both
