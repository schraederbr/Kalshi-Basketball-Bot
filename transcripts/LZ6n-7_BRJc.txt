got behind 20 points at home you know that would frustrate any coach but most importantly its nothing they didnt play well Jim was mad about the effort he was very upset his team didnt come out of the gates ready and the lack of rebounding has been a seasonlong concern so the Eagles of the away maroon the orange and the home whites it will be TJ Bickerstaff to jump for BC against Jesse Edwards we are off and running Applause 82nd meeting between BC and Syracuse Eagles starting five Jaden Zachary and Makai Ashton Langford and Demar Langford in their back court with kicker staff and Prince Elite Bay up front in just 64 points per game Victor staff in the post and he puts one up and in and TJ Pickers have any offense he adds as a bonus well you can see early what Earl Grant wants to do against his Zone hes going to try to attack the middle and see if we could bring Jesse Edwards up and then go back down to the Baseline thats exactly what they did Applause focal point for Syracuse and a steal by The Eagles Here Comes Akai Master Lake for admits and Gerard and bell and Williams part of that starting five Elite Bay Sean is off the line Jesse Edwards and Kennedy for Accu Player of the Year in his first 13 games have been fantastic uh BC is trying to find themselves and they were gritty in that win over Virginia Tech and thats the key to them theyve got to be tough on the defensive end punched away again by BC their second turnover gov foreign he throws it away is this indicative of a 10day layoff for both teams well I think so but its more about just understanding how to attack the zone and for Syracuse they want to run but the important part of running obviously the first thing I do is you get to get the ball off the glass thats been an issue no secret that BC has to slow down mints and Edwards and theres our first foul of the game called against the Freshman Prince Elite Bay out of Minneapolis Felipe had 169 in their opening game win against Cornell at County forum in Chestnut Hill a guy that has tremendous athleticism a fourstar recruit they expect a lot out of him but he has been injury played Gerard on the Baseline keeps alive but Taps it to Zachary Langford and theres a transition Style so TJ Bickerstaff a Drexel transfer averaging more than seven rebounds per game already a concerned Jim behind sir mainly about their offense took the ball down to the Baseline but when that happens youre you guards drives down to the to the lane or the rim you have to have rotations on the back side as Syracuse did not Carl is on Bell scene free throw shootings but a problem the last couple of years theyre 67 percent from the line shooting over Alton the he need to get better 41 from the field 27 from Beyond the Army you know and after watching the live film on BC watch them all season long I think they have better Shooters than their numbers and some nights is just shot selection maybe the shots come too quickly those numbers tell the story Bleak for BC rebound by Elite Bay after the Vince Vince Here Comes Ashton Langford to dribble Drive and Edwards Corrals the board Vince in transition is bumped Jesse Edwards outstanding rebounding hes getting his offense has gotten better as well for the heck of an outlet pass but even a better catch up in the Crowd by Judah minson try to break this tape down and what BC needs to do is the first thing they need to do obviously stop Edwards not let him dominate in the paint but Joe Gerard in the past has had very good numbers against the Eagles yeah hes shooting close to 60 percent of his last four games against BC Syracuse has won 10 of 11 in the series eight straight last time BC one here was 2014 with Syracuse was ranked number one Applause there goes your first orange basketball today which means the fans could take a seat well Chris Bell had to work to get that and Syracuse right now is a little uncomfortable against his BC defense BC is getting right up into Syracuse chest theyre gonna have to get more Ball moving James Zachary penetrates and kicks it to a lead back a lot of bounds remains BC ball with 10 to shoot I thought it was telling Tim after the pit game when Jim Van questioned the forwards effort he said that was the first program history he said they didnt play well it was the lack of effort which was glare well you break the tapes down with bell and Benny Williams and Company you know certainly Jesse Edwards cleans up the glass but he needs help in the back and you know the guards arent exempt either even though theyre smallish they need to get in there from from the top of the zone and rebound from the deep guard spot Junior beat the 23 Zone oh youve got to be patient BC is being patient but Syracuse doing a good job of closing out angles not allowing second shots good possession defensively for the orange the Bell a moments ago their first bucket staff the Edwards to the post forever and the rebound by Elite Bank shot Edwards onehanded on the tip probably should have went up with two Valentine on the call part of this official Fish Room I want tomorrow Langford good job by Judah Mintz hes just got back from the legal guardian position and Syracuse so you can get a little bit more ball movement Player move because the defeat BC defense has been really good early Gerard has that type of rain Gerard 39th in the Syracuse scoring list over 1300 career points Langford in the post good pass Lamar Langford the beneficiary thats how you have to beat a meter I mean theyre not going to come down and beat you with threes BC is not in the lead enough shooting team to do that so theyve got to probe the defense get the defense moving and then get to the foul line and try to go Baseline after it goes into the middle Gerard with his first bucket of the day Joe Gerard 152 points second on the team shooting 40 36 percent from three and a kickball that will bring us for a First Media timeout so a defensive ball game the first four and a half minutes from the Dome Music theres been not here due to the break for the holidays its out of Baldwinsville New York hes Tim welsham jamita perel producer Christian Hennessey an outstanding crew the New Year everybody is the Eagles and the orange locked in a defensive battle and a feeling out process well both teams are playing good defense and thats sometimes that happens early and both teams have to figure out what the defense will give them and the PC have been very patient you can see their lack of shooting not a lot of confidence in taking outside shots uncontested is no secret against this Zone youve seen it so many times former assistant coach under Jim baiheim you know exactly how teams are successful again Joe Gerard off the line the rebounds scooped up by tomorrow Langford over to his brother Makai picker staff in transition so a five to nothing run for BC out of the media timeout so this is one of the things that Jim Boeheim has perturbed about in the pick game just that given up way too easy looks whether its from the perimeter by Makai Ashton Langford on the last possession or just an over the top easy transition bucket with no resistance foreign shots the defense on the orange Brown throwing it away here comes with Ty Ashton Lane for the province transfer the dish to TJ Bickerstaff opportunity on a leak out for tournaments and that was too easy in transition off the turnover the little bumped PCs defense was not organized getting back both teams giving up some easy buckets to the bench now but how about this opportunity well as Judah Mintz grows into his role as a college point guard hes now understanding when he can kind of leak out a little bit thats what Jim Boeheim is really emphasized the forwards getting into rebound more and then they can get out and get out transition its from Fort Washington Maryland originally committed to Pitt top 50 recruit for the orange drop it its 13 to the ACC in scoring close to 16 per ball game across Court finished down to Zachary Kevin lebrockton checks in and he hits and McLaughlin has been instrumental in BCs seven wins well McLaughlin was really good against Virginia Tech coming in off the bench and hes not going to be a score but hes going to find ways to get the ball up on the rim hell defend big so right now you see him on the defensive end guarding the 611 Edwards Brockton coming Georgia Rickshaw freshman Get Away by Gerard well nothing has been easy for Syracuse in half Cars court so far BC gets it right at The Rim again and they go on the post to McLaughlin off the dribble Drive paint touches a section for being senior old Grand told us that before the game the Syracuse is shooting just 27 with McLaughlin going to the line foreign Applause state college basketball doubleheader on the ACC ENT app you dont want to mention Duke and NC State at seven Eastern then its off to the Dean Smith Center Armando VidCon at number 25 North Carolina hosting Tyree Appleby and Wake Forest should be two outstanding matchups but North Carolina finally got back into the rankings after a few weeks of being out of the rankings while starting the year at number one the play will be always a challenge they went on the road yesterday and lost to Pittsburgh its time for a year the top secret Clemson off to a terrific start its 30 Jesse Edwards thats a dicey matchup has locked in against Edwards did some pretty good work early not allowing Edwards that low post position that he likes but he just shot right over the top hes got such a long Advantage 611 versus 67 first two of the game for the seven footer from Amsterdam post also from the Netherlands as we expect to see him later on for BC swarming defense in the 23 Zone and thats Jim baiheims recipe well youve got the length but you also need to use the lengthy you get down in a sense and get their arms up and hands up for the deflections and that time circus did a good job because BC is doing a nice job of cutting through the defense on the back side Eagles averaging 12 turnovers per game that was the second turnover thus far for tomorrow Langford quadir Copeland to Samir Torrance hes a Syracuse native Marquette transferred robbed for Edwards Applause present by a jock but Edwards comes up with it he is industrious in the post foul on BC its on tomorrow Langford that will take us to another timeout PC trying to win for the first time at the Dome Jesse Edwards 15 points 11 rebounds and how about those numbers incremental offensive improvement from his freshman to his senior year well youve seen it he came here kind of a raw young big guy trying to find his way to figure out how the American game how physical you need to be in the American game and hes really just jumped every year and last year with the injury as soon as he went out Syracuse hopes kind of flamed out because they were playing much better down the stretch and you know I think he has to be become more selfish as an offensive player because he can be really dominant in the painting you went out with a wrist injury against BC in February last year and after that the orange lost five of seven well hes the president its not only offensively but in the middle of that zone he is really big a jock the hide pose pass to Joe Gerard and thats what theyre looking for Tombola Doc is a terrific passer and then he steps out on the perimeter Syracuse gets good movement he will find the open man eagles with 12 in Maroon Quinton post his first game action of the season after suffered a foot injury and in transition its a foul on BC well I like Whittier Copeland Copeland he is a tremendous so watch him in practice hes very vocal even telling some of the veterans what to do out there his grittiness and confidence is what Syracuse needs about on the defensive end he just wouldnt poke the ball out and then got to the rim Music and BC will go to the bench again with Chaz Kelly hes a freshman point from Houston now the Eagles suffered a loss with Donald hand going down early in the season with a torn ACL and he was a top 100 recruit they expected a lot out of him he was going to be the backup point now its Chaz Kelly and the son of former Virginia star Donald hand Kellys got more minutes well they need some production Off the Bench but their starters are the guys that have to do it for them theyve been solid so far but you see theyre doing theyre doing what they do best theyre trying to just attack and get it in the lane theyre not forcing the threepoint shot PC hasnt scored in the last two and a half minutes seven to shoot do you think post can diversify their offense well hes as we said before hes a solid threepoint shooter but he can do that get to the rim with a big body catch it and finish 31 games last year 11 starts nine and a half points and five plus rebounds this is the mental air defensively youve got to make sure you put a body on you that was way too easy Joe Gerard the triple first three of the game for Syracuse well Gerard last two possessions did a much better job moving without the ball into the you know open area you cant be stationary if they know where he is theyre going to be in his chest moving without the ball is key Gerard the pride of Glens Falls New York prolific School scoring New York State leader in that department of the deep three by Gerard he can shoot from anywhere well theyre trying to set a little pin down screen at the top he does a pretty good job of moving without the ball he uses Jesse Edwards at the top and its a nice basketball good offense by the cues per game hes in high school I thought I was reading Tim Welshs High School set all the records and plants called you could be the mayor blessed straws thats for sure beautiful pass by Gerard so were cutting the same year Torrance so Syracuse has some momentum well its good job by Gerard last repossession we talked about moving without well that time identifying playing with his head up not looking for his own shot looking for the open man arent you made their last three shots and the Eagles counter mid post area BC is trying to get into that Gap off the ball attack it with the pass thats where Syracuse guards they have to drop down off Zachary because hes not really a threepoint threat yeah it just made the Hoops gonna be sexual ingredient BCE has success this year Mason Matson a transfer from Cincinnati they need his threegame to pick up if they brought him to bc4 and a turnover by Syracuse both like just trying to go a little bit too fast he probably should have just taken that jumper he was wide open on the drive and kick said he just dribbled into trouble coping to the bench for Jim bayheim Syracuse moments ago they had their first lead it lasted just 10 seconds well I like Copelands energy though Jim most likely go back good fire defensively in the back of that zone Zachary was BCs best threepoint shooter last year hes only shooting 29 this years opposed in the post wild shot as he was blanketed by Jesse Edwards a good job by Edwards he just built that wall post had to shoot over the top of Edwards Gerard tries to draw the foul instead it will take the three its hot look out he loves to face Boston well hes tried to take the down the corner and they didnt call it so he understood hes trying to just get his balance back hes doing a really good job of playing with and without the ball so far yeah we mentioned earlier that Gerard and his last four games against the Eagles 60 percent transfer from division two good look inside by post this Mania couldnt finish amongst the traffic Gerard leading all scorers with 10 now he swings it to Justin tiller and then I want to reset so Syracuse shooting well in the last five minutes grabs a twopoint lead Music the orange going by not just shooting the ball but moving without the basketball creating coming off those pin down screens ready to catch and shoot lock and roll but also playing with his head off playing with balance looking to involve his teammates and he has been a nightmare to for BC over the years and he is starting to feel it certainly is and Syracuse is nine for 40 in their first two ACC games and their oneonone start from three thats very unsyracuselike right and I think you know they dont have an array of great Shooters everyone in the building knows that Joe Gerard is the guy thats going to take it from deep but Chris Bells a guy that need to get open as well because he can knock down shots from the perimeter and Judah Mintz is an improved outside shooter Gerard with the ball Again hounded by Jayden Zachary now we have a foul on Zachary says Pat Potter for the break there is a shot clock reset now it is at 20 as mints will inbound and Gerard lost the ball and its kind of tumbled over Zachary but could have been a play on this excuse had did not lose the possession but uh BC is very feisty defensively theyre getting up into Syracuse on the perimeter theyre gonna make them beat them at to the ring Gerard gets in the lane and out of bounds off of the orange every Sunday afternoon we have womens basketball on acc network of the ESPN app New Years Day the game started noon Eastern next week were featuring these two Louisville hosting Pittsburgh at two and the matchup of the day between number five Notre Dame and number 13 North Carolina Sunday afternoons are for womens basketball on accn Outlet to Edwards and the pin by princely Bay but its the goaltend on the Freshman from Minneapolis good effort by Prince Im not sure that ball was going down he would have been better served just letting it come off but Jesse Edwards again getting out in transition really looking good up and down the floor largest lead for the orange Applause Langford Applause staff has it punched away Syracuse looks like theyve solved the BC offense they have theyre taking away that middle cut from the weak side theyre closing the Gap very quickly Music shoot him incident one outstanding body control by the freshman well tuna Miss is starting to learn by playing and getting a lot of experience and there you see just keeps the dribble off balance but still squared up to the rack foreign for the Eagles replacing Jaden Zachary with Mintz at the line we havent had a guy in what Juda mens brings for a long time a doctor Pete Moore their Associated athletic director for sports information he told me maybe maybe Johnny Flynn but that type of player he is and you know the thing you like about Judah mens when you watch him play is that constantly growing he works Foreigner top three point shooter in Syracuse history the illegal screen thrown by John bull ajak well thats a mistake by Jack he didnt establish himself and get set on the screen according to Teddy Valentine Jim behind doesnt agree with that but what theyre doing is theyre moving without the ball theyre trying to set a lot of screens for their guards on the pruner which is a good sign for cerebrums the Eagles scoreless drought telling against this 23 Zone BC has had problems with droughts first two years under real Grant trying to snap oh scoreless run and a foul after the shot by Demar Langford right on Jesse Edwards excuse me Peter I like John bowl a jock in the back with Edwards first of all defensively he gives you just another big long athlete in the back that can close the gap on the inside and thats what the DCs trying to do theyre trying to flash someone for the weak side right into that ACC Squad spot thank you right below the foul line and see if they can draw the middleman up and then go down to the Baseline with a jock King cover the rim if Edward steps out to the fountain for that eight points in their win against Virginia Tech on December 21st an overtime win Mike young told us before that game he was concerned that BC would mucked the game up and they created grinding contact Laden Affair and thats what they did well theyre starting to develop an identity and thats where Earl Grant told us earlier is that this is what we have to do we have to have our defense but it has to travel Edwards trying to pack it up Applause Here Comes Ashton Lankford defense by bigger stats just building a wall from the elbow Makai Ashton Lankford slight burst to cut it to three well the national anchors only made six threes on the season and at 19 so you got to get back you gotta get back take away his right hand lay off him a little bit force him left but give him the perimeter shot Gerard its tomorrow Langford Vince gets doubled and that creates a problem here comes TJ Bickerstaff Felipe looks like he didnt expect to pass what happened I forced it in there he wasnt open thats the thing you know just because youre running in transition everybodys not open BC would have been better served maybe to kick it back out to the perimeter or take it off the bounce to the rim but that last play down on the other end too tight in the middle bench try to drive the ball into the Gap is going to talk to him about it sign me or Torrance Gerard will take a three with the post back in for BC d by BC on the perimeter really forcing the tough shot by Gerard three by Ashton Langford brings some rain to Syracuse he said hes only made six on the year but hes made two this afternoon already so Jimmy Im gonna discussed and you know when a guy starts making threes against you you must adjust your time your defense and when the Eagles on a seven to nothing run in the last 93 seconds well take a timeout foreign Music this year Seth Greenberg our colleague had him on his team of the week after they beat Virginia Tech hes off to a good start well he he was the key coming into the game he talked to Earl Grant talked about all the younger players that he has that have been in this moment road game in the Carrier Dome excuse me in the dome here on campus but hes important because hes a veteran hes played on the road in the ACC and hes not going to force the issue and hes looked good from the perimeter so far this afternoon out of the time oh wheres the focus for Syracuse I think you got to go inside Jesse Edwards see if Quentin post is gonna ready to defend after being out so long theyre battling inside but hes got to give them a little bit more space interior Torrance over the jump ball good job by Torrance hanging in there come out of the game is kind of a fourth shot but fought his way back into the play so judamins back in for the orange playing some teaching moments for Jim bayheim and Samir Torrance Edwards with the left hand and contact from Quinton post ing a pretty good job Stephanie in the angle to the rim but Jesse Edwardson he has room and Space is really dangerous most of the time they post him up with his back to the basket but Syracuse has been talking about moving him outside a little bit more and having him catch the ball on the move going to the rim 17 foul on BC Edwards such a presence on both ends of the floor one of the top shot blockers Syracuse has ever had numbers in December shorts here earlier but he blocks in his last three games 31 rebounds his last three games as a former coach Tim thats a luxury well he covers a lot of ground on the inside obviously because of his link but hes got really good feet hes quick hes quick like a small forward out there on the floor and obviously very important in the middle of the Zone but has become a really improved offensive player its one of those under the radar guys for ACC Player of the Year candidacy Ashton Langford for three trouble with a line for Vince good job Syracuse going inside out to defend on the perimeter Music I have theyve been gritty and every possession has been tough to Syracuse to get anything going Danny Williams not much run in the first half as he missed the bunny foul on Justin Taylor explosive game against Bryant they were upset by Brian but he had 26 points and he was recruited by North Carolina no hes the guy that you like and Jim behind likes but its a little bit slow to develop well hes got to get more confidence on the offensive end its just sometimes typical as a freshman trying to adjust feel like where your role is especially coming in off the bench a league Bay at the line Mason Matson Cincinnati transfer needs to increase his output from Beyond The Arc well thats not theres no doubt thats how you beat the zone you get the zone to shrink you go inside then get your Shooters to slide into open areas on the outside but BC right now just doesnt have enough confident consistent Shooters Joe Gerard did he hit that from skinny Atlas he was from the high in Jim Boeheim court that was that was downtown the two swings Armory Square throw it all in there and a double dribble against the Eagles but Gerardo is 13 you know we watched three Georgia Ryan practice yesterday and the heels on the logo and hes doing a nice job he and Edwards are doing a good job playing a little twoman game at the top with good spacing on the wing Music eight points off the eight turnovers for Syracuse tries to defend Edwards and the put back by Benny Williams he is athletic well the message has been delivered from Jim Boeheim to rebound rebound rebound both Benny Williams and Chris Bell and Williams showing some life on the backboards plus five in the rebound department for the orange over BC 1712 Music Williams has been inconsistent eBay in the post has doubled but a foul Applause a questionable on Benny Williams very questionable looks like he has straight up built the wall but Matt Potter Williams hes got it I think the fouls on Edwards he looked like he got into the shoulder of course that was his second it was a call by Matt Potter not easy when youre one against twenty thousand as far as the judgments youre up against it as they would say Music transferred by way of Duquesne hes giving them some bouncy minutes hell give them a presence in the post hes not going to score much but his defense can help yeah he can block shots and he can close the gap in the middle and Syracuse is doing a much better job today not only closing out the middle but getting back out to the perimeter and then one and done on the backboards all right Williams flashes now for mints at the elbow locked and engulfs the board the drive is good by Makai Ashton Langford Langford is an experience he saw the Seas part the two guards at the top Gerard and Mintz both kind of looked at him he split the difference got to the rim his seventh game level figures he has 10 Williams now unextended boy if he can hit that shot thats another again moving without the ball in better spacing for Syracuse here in the last 10 minutes Music Applause on McLaughlin thats why they brought Hema here from Duquesne good insurance policy when Edwards gets into foul trouble Williams Betty Williams a oneman wrecking through in the last three minutes now from the doghouse to the penthouse start rebounding a little bit and the shots flow the head coach wont take you out and all is good and hes brought them off their feet at the JMA wilderstone fine and Tim Welsh defense to offense effective well very long in the backside of the defense closing out quickly at The Rim the resistance by Hema ever important and then mints doing a good job saving the ball and nobody picks up Benny Williams and just like playing in the backyard nobody contested knocking it down Williams eight points and four rebounds shooting by three that was his sixth three of the season in 16 attempts PC will hold for the final shot just to Langford almost from the logo Matson on the board blocked by Hema oh the orange feeding off defensive energy to end the first half looking good getting the best break going off to Misses towards sharing the basketball making open shots and getting into a better flow Ashton Langford with 10 but PC trailing by nine or a halftime show coming up triple had a nice season Austin College possessed me to start to finish it off in the bowl game in the Pinstripe Bowl coming off a loss to Minnesota and the Pinstripe Bowl orange finished the year seven and six but that was a lot of fun to watch the baby racing as a crowd interchained at the JMA Wireless Dome BC back at it to start the second half Prince Ali Bay with an easy two and a good pass by TJ bickerson well Boston College very well scored in what they want to do against the Zone theyre trying to reverse the ball theyve got good spacing theyre sending a cutter in from the weak side Wing trying to get into the middle then go baseball eagle shot 40 percent the first down 29 for three and a kickoff by picker stop but then he throws the ball away as Benny Williams plays safety Williams played well the last three minutes in the first half energy on the backboards and aggressive offensively Fade Away by Judah mince and impressive defense by Ashton Langford and Madison passed a bit to stop if its fouled Teddy pickerster Teddy Valentine rather calls the foul Valentine part of the sports person Ashton Langford after retrieving that loose ball in the corner just doing a nice job of pushing it with his head up looking over the top to Bickerstaff is under control to get knocked off balance Applause Chris Bell well off the line thats the problem DC has against this zone no one has that ability to make shots under duress Edwards to men saw that was special wow that Syracuse getting much better movement on the offensive end and thats why they want to step out Jesse Edwards a little bit he is a very capable passer from the perimeter Edwards winning all rebounders with eight in the first half between 15 and 11 to help them up to December Syracuse has won five of six coming off a lost of pit number five is foul good looks for Prince Alibi who played high school ball with Chet Holmgren and Jalen Suggs in Minneapolis over the years from BC to recruit and Troy Bell and Company and Jesse Edwards got caught off balance he just needs to present himself big and long he doesnt need to go in to a league Bay I think they did a good job of forcing the issue three fouls Tim on Jesse Edwards what does he have to do now just be careful hes got to know where he is on the court you know his size alone presenting big problems for BC he doesnt have to overextend himself in the paint Music by Benny Williams says I gotta get him thats a freebie rebound that I can put in the stat column coaches good graces but defensively Syracuse has been solid all afternoon Gerard Applause Music Applause well you know hes doing well theyre taking away the three theyre locking the trails youre getting on his hip theyre taking that outside shot away so hes doing a good job reading the defense coming off those screens and curling to the ring Lynch all scores with 15 largest lead of the game for the orange hit Applause Music an awesome foul Ashton Langford draws it from junamins and ran into him the second one of these that Syracuse has got called on by Teddy Valentine in here Im gonna dribble hand off when you hand off to your teammate on the offensive end you must establish yourself and not run into the defender good call Gerard is ready to launch again from 30 feet hes playing the two this year was the one last year he moves off the ball for mince Zachary amongst the trees Applause big staff Scoops it up and then one opportunity for the Drexel transfer thats the fourth foul on Jesse Edwards now this is a mistake by Jesse Edwards I thought he found one of the first rebounds getting himself involved in this play instinctively yes thats okay but its not good smart basketball with 17 minutes to go the two points you can have them the foul is trouble she had four shots on that possession you just got to give up the bucket if you get yourself caught in an area where you know you think youre gonna foul somebody or ask you guys could get up on the rim you just gotta back away at this point because hes too important for Syracuse to be out of the game now for a long time now they have to go to a more near Hima not going to give you much offense he is a defensive presence Music Williams Williams in Worcester Mass Music a nice Cut From The Top by League game you see again Ive been very impressed with their scheme against the Zone not forcing it from the outside a lot of movement not only with the ball but without the ball Cutters from the weak side into that mid foul line area just below the foul line right by the ACC logo pickup by Zachary as mints takes advantage of him can really break you down off the dribble if he sees any opening hes tough to guard in the open court possession by mince Force shot by Ashton Langford Gerard the three and hes got contact that will be three foul shots Prince the league on a league bet first on the team in a defensive Earl Grant halftime where are you going hes just gotta find a way to get to points and every time down the floor its just been a struggle theyre running good stuff theyve been patient but they just have not been able to deliver when theyve been open which has not been often but theyve had some an open looks just just inside the three Gerard is money from the foul line second best free throw shooter in Syracuse history behind assistant coach Jerry McNamara hes 86 this year and hes 86 percent for his career its doing a much better job as hes grown as a college basketball player of not just being a catch and shoot guy hes adjusted well to playing the two this year playing along with Judah Mintz and not only moving without the ball but creating his own shot off the bounce we just jinxed him two out of three locked great restart defense by Benny Williams is really ignitive Syracuse this afternoon fell with the air ballito dies for it 5050 opportunity and a win to BC just to Langford spinning contact but no layup if your staff has it punched around ball team in attendance at the JMA Wireless Dome as they get set for their game tomorrow night against NC State and the Man in the line green is Chris Joseph Syracuse Ford second round pick of the Celtics and number 27 on their alltime scoring list dark side has become a coach Crystal did a great job for the game in the Syracuse women Felicia look at Jack is the new coach this year and uh if you havent noticed her numbers up in the rafters and was a terrific player here and a really good coach at Buffalo and getting the program going I believe theyre 103 on the season practicing yesterday here at the Dome before the men and she was just uh a wonderful hire by John wild hack just a nobrainer very beloved in the community grew up in Syracuse was a great player here and well get the program back on track absolute Bay at the line misses the first after the foul was on Monir hema Syracuse for the moment playing without Jesse Edwards whose foul played with four one out of two for Prince Philippe so Jeffy Jesse Edwards being on the bench with the four thousand is not a huge huge issue on defense if they do drop off probably with the rebounding wise but Pima can protect the rim defensively but more importantly offensively where Syracuse gets their shots in the paint Music Applause Williams supposedly needs to work on his basketball IQ they say he needs to become more comfortable with game situations hes working through that as a sophomore but certainly doing all the little things today isnt he well he is in here the youth out there is just jumps right out you see Copeland out there in the four minutes just young players and Williams used to throw these roles and play with confidence he seems to be doing a better job of that this afternoon Elite Bay trains his eighth point of the second half as hes bolstering BC Eagles Trail by nine at halftime lead Bay with a career in season High 16 and theyre opening game win against Cornell and he grabs the loose ball just forced the issue nobody comes back GJ bicker staff converting the easy two thats just unacceptable Syracuse not doing a good job after the turnover just kind of Pace jogging back thats Joe Gerards got to protect the back you know hes at the top of the Zone hes the first man back you cant let anyone behind him bicker stopping double figures with 10 Music Gerard just tomorrow Langford off his feet Copeland gets tied up jump balls y Valentine obviously saw what we did with clear Copeland in the first half you mean number 12 Syracuse a lot of energy Off the Bench some pretty toughness on the backboards on playing that Wing position in the zone whats the adjustment like for a freshman coming into a Jim Boeheim program he used to be on his bench well hes got a hes got to gain his confidence thats the first thing and you got to be consistent and play tough what a pass there Gerard missed the three in post and for the first time in the second half coming up a right foot injury first game action of the Season back door action Langford Devin McLaughlin at the elbow found the cutting Langford in BCs Riding High as the Eagles some momentum under their second year coach Earl Grant they Trail by three back into this game gritty defense but also moving the ball around we said in the first half Kai asked for anchor needed help and Prince alipe has given them help in Syracuse at times does not come back and get their Zone set and Jim Boeheim in the last this possession was pleading with this team to get back and hit his own set because thats the way BC is going to get back into this game by getting out in transition and finding some easy buckets and Prince the league Bay has been extremely effective in the second half of those nine points he was only two for eight from the field against Virginia Tech in their win 10 days ago nine for 27 from the field in his last four but he gives them some extra juice and since Jesse Edwards went out at the 1406 Mark PC has a 136 run going Edwards went out with his fourth foul and we got a 10second violation against the orange what happened there well just lack of awareness on the offensive End by Gerard and mince and Company I mean you gotta Somebodys gotta tell the teammate your teammate that the clock is running should know that but sometimes youre just dribbling it up like it was a Sunday afternoon a sense of urgency needs to get uptick to the qs back door Zachary to McLaughlin and a foul on the post says Pat Potter so what BC is doing to attack the Zone meters similar to what they want to do in the first half set up in a one three one type set and then they throw the ball to the wing and then the opposite wings flashes into the middle of the floor and that forward slides down the Baseline and they try to get the center to come up to play the middle and throw it down to the Baseline before the forwards can recover at The Rim the line nextured freshman 18 points against Virginia Tech a one point Syracuse lead they led by as many as 10 time good awareness by Georgia right just to go get the ball bring it up against his pressure block at the Timeline St Johns face guarded Joe Gerard earlier this season and that gave Gerard problems do you think other teams will do that St Johns has Posh Alexander hes one of the best Oddball defenders in all of college basketball I mean if you have one of those yes if not Joe drugs doing a good job of getting help in there they dont get back in contest on the perimeter BC a 120 run to take a twopoint lead the feisty Eagles have turned up the pressure on both ends of the floor Penny Williams with the answer boy has he been outstanding for Syracuse well hes shooting when hes open hes locked in right now hes doing a good job of moving without the ball that time BC did not identify him as a as a trailer with potential to knock in a shot but he wants the ball and is playing with a lot of confidence 10 points for Williams and a steal by Gerard Applause tie up jump ball three balls effective for both squads things are heating up here meter in the dome a little good offense BC starting to feel it from not only in transition but from the perimeter two and then the points off turnovers a telling story BC much more comfortable in the second half against the zone of course Jesse Edwards not being out on the floor it covers so much space so good on the backboards but also an offensive threat also that bottom line of the game summary plus 12 for the Eagles since Jesse Edwards fourth foul he remains out for Jim Boeheim with Magnolia and Tina in the front Court Vince crafty move but the board by McLaughlin Syracuse has to be aware how quick post is back in the game and he wouldnt look to go into him with Hema guardian of oneonone down on the Baseline and you love where the Earl Grant has done today I think theyre very well prepared theyre staying with their scheme theyre staying with them theyre not forcing the issue against the zone blocked by hema a block party in Syracuse Zachary to the Rock and the two James Zachary LED be seen scoring last year its been slow to come this season but he capitalized Zachary doing a good job he just splits the gap between the forward and the guard and no one steps up he cant let the ball get that deep in the lane to the rim to the weak side of the rim against the zone so thats where the fiveman hemans got to step up and beat the ball outside the painter just as it approaches the paintings the weak side forward can protect the middle but everyone kind of stood and waited Zachary attacked Syracuse held the lead for more than 16 minutes BC for more than 10 and a half minutes Taylor and he Nails the three I think Taylor needs to be more aggressive offensively he scores hes just trying to step into his role coming in off the bench but he can do that knock down jacks he hasnt scored more than six points in his last seven games after scoring 26 against Bryant Music Applause to length for the dribble drive from McLaughlin and taken away by Zachary down the lane rejected again triggering the break from Vince that started with the backside forward Brilliance and Hema both protecting the rim and theyve got BC out of sorts Kai Ashton Langford throws the ball away the last bucket was out of the Stevie Thompson Playbook well theres no doubt about it Judah mints has done a good job reading the play and he understands when the defense steps up and protects the backboard and the rim he can leak out over the top how many lobs did you see when you were on the Syracuse endless coaching against the orange Williams Benny Williams he has had himself a ball game on New Years Eve hes not standing around and watching the play which he tends to do at times hes playing with a lot of confidence moving without the ball really ready on the catch just to attack with his head up with balance Music so the big men for Jim bayheim Edwards has four Kemah has three a lot of pressure on the big man here in the last 9 19 because BC is staying true to their game plan theyre going inside inside hes going to give them the outside shot but they struggled to take away dribble penetration in the second half his last four games entering this one to just one against 13 minutes but he has responded in a big time back to his post connects to cut the RNG lead to four Music happy over on the sidelines that the fouls are eight to one but DC has been done a really good job of you know drawing those spouse right right in the lane attack Music coming off the right foot injuries first game action how difficult is that for Earl Grimm well I think between Earl Grant and the player youve got to lay that out before the game starts listen well give you some minutes get you back into the flow but dont not overdo it three by Taylor Applause yeah they spent a lot of extra time on individual work and we can see what Taylor his confidence is today its big Zachary too strong with a three attempt Syracuse has made its last five shots and they are 50 percent from distance theyve made seven out of 14 threes Gerard from Ithaca Applause out of bounds I have to give you an ethical reference oh good job to step back its more like Glenns Falls with Joe Gerard but doing a really good job of creating some space off the bounce taking his time but again Benny Williams kept that play alive on the back side Taylor Taylor and Williams instrumental in Syracuses recent charge the runner by mitz comes Ashton Langford to hustle on the glass by thicker trap Lobster Applause stop blocked counts as a goaltend sure that shot had a chance to go in but good aggressive play again on the offensive End DC had numbers which created that offensive opportunity Unity come on no chance to go in that was not a goal it goes down as two for TJ Bickerstaff who has 12 one of three eagles and double figures crossover by Justin Taylor the defense by Bickerstaff smothered him we got the pinned at The Rim but he just protected weve got a good defensive position in the league base called for a travel but Betty Williams is having a coming out party Wrigleys played as a freshman being consistent as a sophomore but hoping he said hes done all of that this afternoon inside the Huddle during that timeout for both teams as you look at Williams numbers see where theyre going they gotta pay BCs got to pay a little bit more attention to Banning Williams now because theyre trying to go to him in the low box and weve got team on the outside theyre trying to isolate Williams on the inside while still dont forget you must pay attention to Gerard Music Applause defensively the 23 Zone in the second half what do you make of it thats been good but Teddy Valentine just got him out I believe thats his fourth it is forward Music three centers John bolajak they like to play him more on the forward spot in his own but he may be forced to go to a jock in the middle if Hema does foul out of jock has not played in the second half with Victor staff missing the opportunity Eagles have missed six foul shots 19 attempts and then one legitimates his team is tenacious in the land well if he feels like hes got any sort of space from the top of the key to the rim and they are just kind of a little ghost screen doesnt use it but uses that right hand in and out drably so quick get by you in a second hes got that gear that Syracuse hasnt seen in a long time for the first half as he completes the threepoint play Flynn was Stronger but Mintz is faster romance is so good off the bounce you dont have to play him from the outside youve got to respect them but you lay off him he still has that ability to keep his dribble and get to the ring Applause Ty Ashton Langford Zachary the board as he goes down Applause here Syracuse on the hell ball good hustle on both sides good job Syracuse was fortunate though because Mintz and Gerard started to leak out and then the Deep rebound came right into that area where the guards have to step in in the 23 Zone and help rebound but Vince with the extra effort on the floor a new game summary part of your focal points coming into this one BC three percentage 33 Syracuse 47 wow and BC continues to run good offense trying to go inside but at some point when you kick the ball back out and you open you got to try to you have to try to knock in a few to keep the Zone eyes 3 27 on the season Williams rolling towards the hoop Brent Hampton calls a foul on BC thats on Prince alike third on Elite Bay third on the team so hes just done a nice job not fouling in the second half theyre doing a very good job and Benny Williams though which has been flipped on he just he wants the ball hes playing with a lot of confidence right now offensively hes had some flummoxing moments throughout this year coaching staff trying to figure out what the formula is to get him on the same page well I think they you know both teams talked about their layoff and what it meant to them everybody has a layoff at Christmas and you expect to get better but both these teams are young in a lot of spots thats really important for the young players to approve during the break Gerard Nails the three Applause collides nine times out of ten well thats footwork 101 great job just dragging the defender down low and pushing off that inside foot coming off that little pin down screen on the Baseline out Applause Music he was quiet but now hes back on Prince Alibi with 11 in the second half will not be denied theyre gonna hang in this game they are gritty they are gritty basketball team theyre not pretty against the Zone but they are efficient and theyre on the same page thats the Mantra from Earl Grant pretty not pretty Williams fire out of the way by Taylor gritty defense Gerard and the put back by Benny Williams industrious Benny Williams here comes with kayash to Langford he cant convert on the oneman fast break Kemah has doubled and found that was a nice pass by Gerard but this is the way Syracuse wants to play on the offensive end but again it has to start theyve had such extreme major problems aside from Jesse Edwards finding any consistency on the backboards defensively but today Benny Williams has given them that second rebounder and he was coming out of the game tonight give them a huge lift while Edwards has been in foul trouble yeah to the best for Edwards coming back in with under five to play in regulation four fouls for Justin Bieber Gerard rebound for Quinton post Applause Gerard has 20 to lead all scorers so thats 55 points in the last three games Joe Gerard against BC getting back to last year Applause hes got it the average nine points last year good job by Arrow Grant and BC to go right at Jesse Edwards to see what type of resistance he would present inside with the four fouls post stayed with it Edwards had to back off surges has always had a counterpunch they have theyre getting production from guys they dont normally get it from including this man right there who has just been really good contact Music very good coach though to understand and were gonna go through Benny Williams until they can find a way to stop him theyre posting him up there isolating him with space down low theyre going through him and he is delivered Syracuse seven of nine from the line Benny Williamss first trip of the afternoon theres the foul trouble for BC its 15 shy was career high which he set against Colgate in their second game of the season now Justin Taylors had some really good moments this afternoon but here Copeland gave him some good energy they havent gone deep into his bench which hes starting to trust these young players as they get as they are improving during the season largest lead of the game for Syracuse and by nine at halftime post to Jamar Lankford whos been quiet that was nice got some elevation on the shot he did they stayed with the play on the weak side they tried to go into post he couldnt shoot over the top of Edwards but you see hanging around with some gritty defense Eagles at seven and six Trail perfect you know he doesnt force the issue at times he may take a shot off balance or too early in the clock but as hes grown through the years hes really feels more comfortable offensively he knows he has the green light hes playing the two guard spot theyve done a really good job of finding him coming out those little pinned down screens at the top and also their Baseline out of Bounce plays have been really efficient with Gerard coming off weak side screens the arms are 30 and he scores more than 20 points and here he is so play the one instead of mince yeah mince they totally denied mins Syracuse sent him deep and Joe Gerard good job recognizing he need to help boss the pressure Gerard gets double but still converts tells you about his strength doesnt it thats whats a big Improvement of and when he was young ever want to do that but now he is going amongst the trees with toughness and finishing post boxed in at the sideline and he needs to take a timeout so Earl Grant will have to reset for BC as they Trail by 10 its remaining from both squads Johnny deprell and Tim well sharp producer Kristen Hennessey an outstanding crew we hope youve enjoyed it thus far on the ACC Network Betty Williams in the yards they hold on theyll be celebrating the New Years on a winning note will be their sixth winning seven games well when you watch Syracuse play you understand there unselfish basketball team so they didnt cause problems down this end of the Court Mission defense theyve moved on the pass and that was not on the catch and done a good job protecting the ramp and rebound Boston College music theres no reason to go out there and extend Chase guys that arent real good threepoint Shooters just pack it in and make sure we rebound we need some easy shots for BC that can happen if we create some turnovers or some pressure or some quick shots by Syracuse but Syracuse youre going to see them theyre going to get the ball over half for it and then theyre going to take a lot of time off the shot clock before they attack dont you bam after their loss to Pitt 10 days ago they lost by two so theyre trouble having the Press but not a good pressing team but its been a different story today his front court has given in a lot of contributions Applause clustered by post the Valentine calls a foul number one TJ Bickerstaff Syracuse could say theyre taking a little bit of the air out of the ball with the eightpoint lead but still looking theyre still probing and waiting for the defense to make mistake and that time Gerard so intelligent got into the Gap drew that second Defender got it right over the top to Edwards Edwards quiet due to foul trouble four fouls Music Applause Jesse Edwards said nice pass Joe Gerard said dont foul Music tomorrow Langford not what they were looking for well but it was under duress had a lot of those opportunities today but the length of Syracuse has bothered them in the lane Eagles shooting 41 46 for the orange and an offensive foul on Joe Gerard punch to the the grin of the Hall of famerard oh this looked like a foul but sometimes when youre experienced Defender let me make it look like a foul a thousand officials at the JMA Wireless Dome voicing concern on the Block Danny Williams dictating plays on both ends of the floor well junabeth has to come out and help Joe Gerard a little bit at the top here and hes going to take some time off the clock maybe they can get Gerard now coming through the defense on a little pin down screen or a pick and roll with mince and Williams orange have seven blocks one shy of their season average per game hes gonna kill some shot clock Vince oh the runner Miss terrific body controls yeah sometimes you can take the air out of the ball too soon but not if not if you have a good sound smart offensive team Syracuse is playing very smart here in the last part of this game and the largest lead of the game at 12 well Ashton anchors all up in Gerard you cannot put your hands on the dribble is out Ashton Langford picked up that offensive foul in the previous couple possessions ago against Gerard Williams the post for Edwards just out Jim behind drew it up this is the clinic on how to run late game offense with the lead theyre not standing around theyre waiting until BC overextends and then they take advantage and hes dribbling into traffic extremely problematic against the 23 zone so Syracuse is going to win this one and be ninth consecutive time well Syracuse did a lot of good things on the offensive end this afternoon and shared the basketball had good balance and scoring of course Benny Williams production has been a bonus and something theyve needed and been looking for not only offensively but defensively hes been a presence and been good on the backboards and for BC they had a really good game plan I was very impressed with their scheme against the Zone but without a real long follow to finish plays in the lane you have to have somebody to keep the Zone on us on the outside on the outside making some threes BC doesnt have that and theres some concern amongst the orange faithful that Syracuse might have another uneven year they were 16 and 17 last year the only year on the 500th of June but it seems like Tim is that something they shouldnt be toward him I think what youve seen so far this year uh is not who they are because they have such a young team so they have a tremendous potential to get better and our third trip up here this year to see them play theyre getting better thats evident by the performance as they held on in the second half despite some pretty play from BC James reading the BC coaching staff as he picks up career Victory One Thousand Seven good effort by Syracuse coming off the game against Pittsburgh before the break or Jim Mahon was very frustrated with effort rebounding all the things you need to win ACC today they got him they did it well a 14point win for Syracuse as they improved to nine and
