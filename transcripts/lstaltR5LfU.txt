for taquavion Smith and jarkel Joyner NC State goes wire to wire in beating Duke 8460 great to be with Dan Bonner West Durham we say so long from Raleigh off to Chapel Hill heres Corey Alexander Music welcome to the deeney Smith Center as North Carolina has won the tip welcoming in the 105 Wake Forest Demon Deacons Cameron okay well off the iron first you can see Carolinas intention to try to get love going early coming out drawing at the first play foam didnt go down but their intentional trying to get Caleb love going offensively and I would like to welcome in my partner Randolph Childers the ACC Legend ACC tournaments Most Valuable Player most valuable ever everything in the ACC tournament my name is Corey Alexander I will be handling the playbyplay duties here tonight as the two of us get together for the first time doing this as North Carolina gets out in transition Armando Jacob with the easy finish off the nice fine from King of love only fitting that the big man gets the steal hands it off to his guard and reward the big man for running the floor thats going to be the focus of North Carolina of course is to make sure they get Armando baycott touches hes their better team when he has the basketball and theyre playing through him Applause Nikki black with the turnover camera Hildreth Drive about this is one of the areas you have to be concerned with Wake Forest they love to shoot the three Matthew Marsh with the offensive board Applause and fouled on the way up both of these teams like to play at a fast pace well I expect a high scoring game tonight taking that three in transition whenever he can get it catching the three Geeks are always looking for him to touch with you and forgive me not a foul on that possession great forcement who maintains possession but thats one of the things were going to see from the Demon Deacons theyre going to try to get it done from Beyond The Arc as we see an offensive foul good sign if youre Carolina rotating over drawing fouls great job coming over there Andre Davis jumps into him I think its tough uh whats up Cody had the angle didnt need to dip the shoulder like he did but he got caught up okay good job good leaky black leaky black continues to be the defensive stopper for this North Carolina team however theyre looking for him to provide more for them on the offensive end of the floor as RJ Davis is off the mark from Beyond the 30 I think its key to this game for both teams would be who establishes the paint right now its a jump shooting contest and neither team is putting much pressure on the rim both coaches we talked to earlier today concerned about the opponent attacking the pain as Pete Nash picks up his first foul as Andrew Card attacks the basket and just like that we will see Jalen Washington checking in for Pete Vance early in this game we talked with Steve kirschner earlier and he said that he thought that they would see more of Washington as Pete Nash actually exits goes directly back toward the locker room as Tyree Appleby knocks down to three in front of North Carolina hes just picking up where hes been up all year long I mean hes a legitimate ACC player in the United score and the second decision you got to find him coming off screens David Washington from top of the key off the mark and this is one of the areas of concern off of long rebounds Wake Forest will push the basketball as masato misses the three but got a great look its a young man whos made threes against Carolina in the back Applause unable to finish Applause coming out of the Baseline out of bounds and the last thing you want to do is lose this second late score in the ACC and lose the inbound this great Euro Step comes in switches late dont want to leave a guy thats having a 50 40 in close to 90 years its giving me easy to look for his first look and then now he comes back in next possession after good defensive steal good defensive transition by the deeds and something in the offense and now hes in a lot of shooting too but its still about Applebee and actually Kayla love picks up his first foul trying to contest him in transition this is one of the areas where Wake Forest has been great the last two games wins at home over the Duke Blue Devils as well as the Virginia Tech Hokies matching 26th and free throw attempts in both those games gets in trouble when they get jump shot happy and you saw they started the game with a couple of jump shots and then I guarantee you coach had a two Choice words to get those guys taught attacking rims that you wouldnt know that you fortunate foreign another turnover by North Carolina their third turnover early in this game defensive breakdowns Applause I think hes just trying to challenge his guys right now getting to the basket backing down RJ Davis but unable to finish and picks up his first foul trying to track down the rebound and hell just plays off two defeated its only about six three six four he plays a lot bigger plays really strong wouldnt imagine him getting it for him Music Applause I dont know if theres a better offensive Rebound in the country I think Oscar sheikways in that conversation but its not many better than that guy right there Armando Baker he really changed the game because thats a big a guard has no chance so it forces the guards to keep their man in front because if they have to rotate big comes over as a guard you got no chance of keeping him off the glass Jalen Washington picks up his first foul trying to hedge the screen because we have to get some constructions from coach Fords along the sideline quick loud ball screens attacking this ball screen coverage Music its fine in the corner David Wilson steps up knocks down a pretty young man who made Five threepointers in his debut here with 27 points two seasons to go he shot the basketball very well against the Tar Heels hes the last blue he hates it because he has a great game against these guys whether its in large roles up to three knocks it down has a little something to say to the bench right behind him for Wake Forest with a strong sign for the Tar Heels to see Mickey black getting on the boardroom good sign if youre a Carolina fan at all just someone knocking down shots for the threepoint line and back to a leaky black does best the deflection getting North Carolina out in transition Wake Forest is able to get back but not a time to take away the three from Caleb run but another offensive rebound leaky black in the corner Applause no good on that one weve got a tie game here in Chapel Hill late night basketball with CA and two Corey Alexander and this is of course my older less attractive you know brother Randolph childrens brother from another mother we shared it backcourt together 33 years ago and so of course with us doing this for the first time its only 50 we talk about the back course correct only fitting right now Wake Forest back towards gotten out to a strong start they scored all seven of their points Carolina back court is a little slow to get going in this game man thats nothing new to the Carolina fan those guys are all preseason first and second team performers but theyve been up and down all year I expect these guys to get on track if Carolina wants to get in control of this game Music by the way I just gained a point on the Freddy Carter scale so now its 22 true Biggs I got a good one in right there Tyree Applebys able to attack the basket unorthodox shot but this is one of the areas where North Carolina has been great traditionally but struggling to rebound this year the same way they have in the past able to come away with the turnover after Carr comes up with the second chance opportunity for the struggling theyre struggling rebounding because they cant get stops leaky black knock him down another three as leaky Brock has come out offensive minded to start this game six points will block his second three in the first five minutes its a great start for him he he usually anchors the D in his limb they need to keep him on his his length can bother him inside but you see leaky black getting it done on both ends of the floor offensively knocking down the three ball nice fine from Armando baycott recognizing where the helps coming from knocking down the three and then of course leafy on the defensive end doing what he does best anchoring this defense I think he takes on the responsibility regarding the best from the player on the other side I think just about matchups I mean Wake Forest runs so much movement and things hell just have to guard one of those guys like then just went through he can limit his postop ability Justin McCoy getting some early action off of his Miss North Carolina with the second chance opportunity as Caleb love attacks the basket avoids the offensive foul and is able to finish up the rim so I was on a 50 run here the crowd started to get into it picking things up here in the defensive into the floor does that say it before Davion Wilson he loves or hate that color blue but he has shot well against the Tar Heels I tell you what you know if youre of course on that sideline for the North Carolina Tar Heels RJ Davis helps off on that strong side thats a NoNo especially he gets a shooting like Williamson and Damian Williamson knocks out his second threepointer as you can see North Carolina in Temple getting the basketball in the hands of Armando gaycock looking at the officials not getting back in this this late 14th you got to make sure you get your defensive transition set cant give them those opportunities playing Advantage Basketball commandos got to turn and face against Bradley hes a guy with size hes been hes lost 40 pounds hes been that weight he came in at 290s now 250 Armandos quicker he has to turn and face him in the post and not try to back him down and now the sixth turnover already for Wake Forest as Marsh is trying to forgive me Carr trying to back down Justin McCoy and McCoy holding his ground is North Carolina has gone with some substitution Seth Trimble coming off the bench as well Justin McCoy seeing rare action early in the season for him hasnt been much of the rotation but with Pete Nance headed to the locker room after drinking his back McCoy getting action early Applause on his third three in the first half well hes been the best game here tonight as you mentioned remakes from Beyond threepointer at nine points already for leaky black Friday about a freshman Bobby Clinton attacking the basket unable to finish but when you miss against North Carolina youve got to be prepared to get back in transition the turnover allows Monsanto to get out to the easy flush onto Caleb buff turnover the easy bucket so frustrating I think the Carolina fans love just needed to catch and reverse that quickly no need to dribble it he did didnt quite get enough of the pass and turned it over another turnover for Caleb love allowing Wake Forest to get out in transition to nice fine from Applebee to David Williamson another easy bucket and for a team this oftentimes having strong struggles on the offensive end this can get them going getting those fast break points but theyve got six turnovers early but then you would think they would be in trouble with it but again Carolinas giving it right back to him and youre giving up baskets and transition off turnovers Music when he gets it inside its going to be a lot of traffic but two players not enough to stop the ACC preseason player of the year that time he moved him a little bit he came back where I for down hes just too strong six points are only for bacon in this one North Carolina getting a defense set almost a turnover by Monsanto on that possession Wake Forest maintains Applause Chicago the battle inside nice finish on the interior by Bradford just overpowering Armando of that no healthy leaving him by himself theyve given up threes trying to help inside on ball screen thats how they left him alone Armandos gonna have to anchor down and hold his ground a little bit better than he did in the left position now of course youve coached the coach for him so is that something that coach Ford is saying Hey listen we know were going to have to deal with Armando in the offensive on the floor weve got to make him defend as well you got to make them defend you want to try to get them foul trouble if you can now the six turned over from North Carolina however printman out of control Steph Trimble getting back getting set outside the restricted area and is able to pick up the offensive foul 1716 North Carolina the onepoint lead here on their home floor were here with the North Carolina Tar Heels hold a onepoint lead over the Wake Forest Demon Deacons Corey Alexander Randolph Childress on the call Aka CA and chill the first time weve ever had an opportunity to do this sharing the microphone unlike when you did not share the basketball we were teammates back in 1989 1990 well just stop saying the years just saying we played High School nobody needs to be reminded how old we are now we need to see us know how much better I look I still looked at you now lets correct that how old you are youre 50 just come if you just hope you look as good as me when you get here coaches are talking about ref talking to the about that last foul believe there was something that happened on the way to the benches for both teams that has caused some conversations with the officials in both coaching staffs however nothing official no call anything made so more so just conversations probably just a warning to both benches kind of sloppy first half so far away from six across Carolina and I dont think its just because of the great defense its just been fairly passable nice five for Bangkok inside to Trimble whos unable to finish but does get fouled and that was one of the concerns with Steve Forbes coming into this season was playing a smaller backcourt when youve got Appleby as well as David Williamson neither of those guys are big players so when you think about it both guards six feet or under yeah thats a small backboard especially going up the size of a guy like septram well he gets to to change lineups that time but when he goes with his initial starting lineup I think hes going to ride this lineup out because that lineup Gibson a lot that they have and sometimes they can bring car in and make him play the three when they really want to get big but I would imagine theyll use sometimes against this Carolina line Carolina gets to hurting them on the glass they have that versatility in there in their roster to kind of play Big like they did a year ago but musius if theyre not getting punished on the glass and you allowed him to get away with this small bowl lineup this is probably the most effective scoring off of the lineup when you see Justin McCoy will find the pressure similar to the winning Georgia way back in the day that was one of his papers that North Carolina basketball hadnt got four men helping with the point guard I know comes about his watching and proud nice defense by Trump Johnson cutting off the driving lane is now the eighth turnover for Wake Forest in nine and a half minutes of this first half and I know coach Floyd is not happy about that but he knows the numbers hes an analytical guy and he knows they just havent won games when they turned it over to high rate they dont want to go over 1314 no more than 15 for low turnover they want to keep it places to pass that quickly here when you look at the turnovers theres been an issue at times for The Demon Deacons throughout this season yeah season High 22 at Rutgers on December 17th but you look at the numbers when they handle the basketball 14 or fewer turnovers and I think the most frustrating thing about their turnover so far tonight is there some of them have been good defense like last possession but some of them are just trying to do too much with it and being careless with the basketball and they put themselves in a bond here early this eternal was a responsible Lieutenant Carolinas 19 points Forbes wants to get this girl out of team playing in a half court set like this doesnt matter when you got that guy out there yeah RJ Davis knocking down his first bucket on the evening now three points for him two points away from 1 000 career points for RJ Davis who will add to the NCAA record 80 current North Carolina 1 000 Point score Saturdays up for college basketball and ACC Network and the ESPN app this week we have a triple header starting at one Eastern with number 16 Duke and Boston College then Wake Forest takes on Louisville and we capped the day with number 11 Virginia hosting Syracuse should be a great day of Hoops on acc Network Music picking up their defense really getting off the way wakes not running much offense its kind of just one pass dribble theyre gonna have to get back to Ball moving and ball and body moving Applause QB cant be happy with that the same Baseline out of bounds Habibi got his first three off of he gets the same thing on the Euro handoff there theyre gonna have to keep that switch out there a little quicker than they have RJ Davis attacking the paint finding his way to the rim unable to finish theyre going to get Bobby Clinton stepping in trying to take the charge great job by RJ avoiding the contact jumping to the side hes the guy I think has to be the guy to get this thing going I mean getting the ball inside you know to Armando controlling the pace of the game the ball needs to be in RJ Davis man a lot more I think to settlements team down to get them to where they want to be so he can be that guy I thought he was second half of last year a great officiating staff today Jeffrey Anderson John Gaffney and Pat Driscoll John Gaffney going over and allowed him the scores table to know that they will review that last three from Tyree Appleby in the corner once we get to a dead ball situation to see if it was a two or three having some words Music Applause I think they were talking about you being late coming from here Applause were of course are social assisted by the best in the business Freddie Kiger on our side to make sure that we can try to keep you under control throughout this game Music RJ Davis has gone over 1 000 Taylor Washington knocking down Ive lost earlier the bucket on the last possession Applause sorry about that everyone our audio went out for a second another handoff there hes definitely behind the line for three and Carolinas late on the switch and thats his second second three I dont think theres any doubt about it RJ Davis now becomes the 81st North Carolina Tar Heel to go over the 1000 Point threshold in their career NCAA record Applause on his last bucket and you talked about Davis and his ability not only to distribute but also getting to the free throw line as Bobby Clinton comes up with the second chance opportunity beating Jalen Washington to the glass great job punishing the switch head to smaller guard so he gets to gets caught in rotation DeMarco done trying to block him out and just too small great job by Bobby Clinton getting on the glass before guard trying to box out big man when they get a running start on that foul not Jalen Washington one of the things Huber Davis going to the bench getting a lot of production from his bench this far in this game three reserves on the floor right now with McCoy Washington and done but done it earned himself into the rotation early I think cube is very comfortable with him he can make shots and hes a really good Defender and a humans challenged on this group to be better with defensive ending if not theyre going to sit nice look inside that could be touching the paint over the top to Marsh its going to be fouled by Jalen Washington North Carolina starting to find some Rhythm on offense but Wake Forest will have two at the line when we return Music and if you can hear the Ovation of the crowd here at the Deanie Smith Center it just went across the board RJ Davis has joined the 1000 Point Club here at the University of North Carolina NCAA record 81st player in the history of this traditional program as he gets a standing ovation from the North Carolina faithful congratulations to RJ I mean Ive been on a record such a huge fan of his game and congratulations to him on a thousand points Applause playing well so far with five points and one assist a couple free throws Applause this free throw from Morris there giving North Carolina opportunity to build into this lead and youve seen trying to give Caleb love downhill attacking the painted area allowing him to make plays but more importantly you see North Carolina wanting to make sure they get the basketball inside to Armando baycott forcing wakeboard to try to find ways to defend the big couple on the inside they caught with the kick out to Dunn unable to finish it but you have to like that shot if youre in North Carolina youre playing inside out would they feel that much better when they do that in comparison to the option you got to be a good guy I think Armandos a really a selfish player so you want to put the ball in his hands as much as possible is that a shot or a pass or outfield in that possession I think it was a pass leaky Black coming out trying to defend Bobby Clinton in the corner leaky black picks up his first foul but fouling on the three so Clinton will have three free throws great effort just a little bit out of control I thought he blocked him up top first we came down found him with his body he defended the post and closed out the emperor was there just couldnt stop himself I think someone else should have rotated over there no one there and give him credit just to have to play you dont like to foul threepoint Shooters and you dont want to file one is only shooting 23 percent of the year Applause and again that was one of the things from Steve Forbes making sure that theyve withstood that initial Surge from North Carolina back here on their home court Steve Forbes stopwatch North Carolinas different at home we talked with Huber Davis about that Huber Davis says he doesnt care if its home or away it doesnt matter its more so about the effort especially on the defensive end of the floor yeah I think hube has been upset with his group so far in only three ACC games their their ranked lasting defensive effort right now so you know I dont think he cares whether its on the road around home they got to fix this the number one offensive because theyre theyre dead last defensive plan I think a lot of Their Stars would let the ball touch this young man hands once again they got getting the test going to the right hand able to finish it eight points down for Armando baycott and bacon still playing with that sore shoulder so thats one of the things that you you have to hes going to have to play with that allseason wall but he did tell us it was getting a little better Williamson from the three once again that corner this time he misses allowing baycott to get the rebound North Carolina in transition and this is where the hills are so dangerous leaky black to the rim to finish the hoop to harm and an opportunity for the and one leaky block with 11 points here in this first half great rebound great outlet Great push finding leaky Block in transition this is so dangerous about this group they score on May baskets and definitely on miss miss baskets and I think the number one thing coach Ford told us today was we got to get back on transition defense didnt do a good job in that possession first foul well Matthew Marsh trying to get back and defend that black finishes it off the threepoint play now 12 points for leaky black as hes been the offensive star here in the first half he has been hes gotten off with a couple of threes and got himself going to transition I mean when you take him open shots Let The Game come to you youre bowed to have games like this and santoso bang at the top of the key going into his individual package going at Caleb loving the nice move by Damar masato can only see him being more of a threepoint shooter floor spacer but that time going into his trip bag for his fourth point like that but he looked real comfortable doing it thats gonna do the bucket and the foul back to back and won opportunities for leaky black as he recognizes the mismatch and attacks the rim just a confident score right now hes the leading scorer of the game I mean hes just hes in attack mode catches it fakes it rips and drives and takes the contacts and lays it in and 14 points early here by leaky black do you think leaky heard you talking about him having the best name in the game he may have but known that young man a long time and just great young man hes taking the role of being a defensive guy for this group and hes just so much again but hes making shots this team is really really good offensive rebound okay about trying to get bad on the Demario does stepping off at the sideline turnover number seven for the Tar Heels every Sunday afternoon we have womens basketball right here on acc Network and the ESPN app this this week the game start at noon Eastern but were featuring these two Haley van lit and Louisville have won six and seven they host Pittsburgh at two Eastern then its the matchup of the day between number four Notre Dame and number 22 North Carolina Sunday afternoons are for womens Hoops on acc Network North Carolina off once again in transition leaky black moving the basketball finding puff Johnson relief black catching again in the corner looking for the three not there getting the basketball in the hands of Bangkok baccock great job defensively by Marsh foreign Music Applause Davis picks up his first bass quite aggressive with Bob Davion Williams just pushing the transition there was nothing there to start he just turned on the gas and got into RJs body and Drew the foul its just experience guard play there mentioned earlier two seasons ago David Williamson comes in this building has 27 points already off to a great start here in this first half eight points for him three for five from the field now up to nine and looking to get the double figures here in the first half its not a tougher kid in college basketball man he is just rocks and he hes unafraid he plays hurt Applause Music Applause so he had to have that young man come back home from WinstonSalem Music and right now coach Gore wanting to get his team under control slowing them down quite a bit falling out what he wants to see for double the offensive over the floor David Williamson picking little action Applause about that shot Mickey black looking to give it up right now hes been the guy offensively for North Carolina cable glove into the painted area unable to finish Monsanto with the rebound and this is where Ray Forest once again is dangerous out in transition North Carolina does a great job building their defense getting back Carolina wants to play fast but you got to take good shots when you play Fast Wake Forest just seems to be getting the shots that they want when the game slows down and I know Carolina wants to play more than enough Tempo style but get an easy basket you want to take it if not I just think hell do themselves Justice by playing through a Model A little bit more Matthew Marks with his first bucket taking advantage of the mismatches Caleb love lines up the three unable to knock it down once again rapper on the floor Buck Johnson on the sideline and Andrew Carr both going after the basketball North Carolina with a twopoint lead but the Demon Deacons stuff going today knocking down a couple of Threes hes a guy youre going to give him to him youre gonna give him open threes hes knocked them down and when you get out and you can close out on top hes driving to the basket you definitely got to find him in transition hes got a 14 first half points only two off his career high of 16 I believe hell surpass that I think pretty good odds hell get 16 but I think so we may be able to get there today if youve got 14 in the first half of course Im thinking at least 28 but I mean again you know for you youre probably thinking what we whats your number now if youve got 14 first half points whats your number when you go youre asking me Im talking about but Im talking about vintage oh Im not even worried about the second half Im trying to get 10 more for them oh okay okay that sounds all right thats why you werent passing me the ball we were teammates play Hero Wake Forest trying to go inside to Cameron Hill Im not sure this is a mismatch going up against leaky black Armando bacon right behind it and Luke Bryan comes up with the foul quick conversation with Jeffrey Anderson Jeffrey Anderson having no parts of that and thats going to be the second foul on leaky black no reason to foul there I dont it just goes straight up touch them right there on the full arm and did a really good job let your length youre six nine with a seven foot wingspan you are hes already you know Hillarys giving up three or four inches but what I love here and of course one of the things I love about the ACC Jeffrey Anderson one of the great officials that we have in this league having the conversation with leaky black theres no technical foul for talking back or having conversation whatever it may be they talk they talk it out again Ive yet to see in my many years of talking about and playing this game anyone changing officials mind over a call by the conversation after the whistle is blown but yet I could appreciate this great group we have here having the conversation with the players why why is it when you talk about me you put years in but when you talk about you its just many years you get dates when my name goes up its like 1980 eighth 1862 you did this because many years Applause I mean that was pretty selfexplanatory except Trumbull attacks the basket picks up the foul Applause and Trump has been aggressive attacking the basket when hes had his opportunities in this game these guys to play with them on a perimeter because he put so much pressure on the remedies jump shots coming along hes not quite there with his jump shot but hes a great athlete great change of pace and quickness and putting him in with RJ and Kate of Love allows him to have the ball in his hands you can play those guys off the ball so good adjustment by coach Davis there hey Applause poison it has a seasonhigh minutes hes played more tonight than he has all season and again he was pushing all the buttons going to the locker room really the first couple possessions of this game Jalen Washington getting the nod but its been Justin McCoy stepping up for the Tar Heels playing heavy minutes getting the job done defensively and I believe thats more so what Uber Davis is looking for from his reserves coming in off the bench McCoy gets beat on that possession the nice fine to Bradford on the Finish Pawn making plays off the bounce and just like that Wake Forest takes the lead 3534 here on the road Applause closing out in Andrew Carr just shot faking and driving right down the middle of the lane its hard to help on that you step up he drops it off you help from the wing he kicks to the corner and carhill just catching the clothes out and driving down the lane Armando baycott steps up just to easy basket and dunk there for Bradford Music has done a really good job but trying to pin that ball screen on the inside ice in Boston hes trying to keep those sidelines they caught attacking Bradford unable to finish Trafford giving coach four good minutes on both ends of the floor muscle buckets for him but also doing the job defensively on Armando bake out his car at the top of the key continues to be more of a facilitator hasnt been a big score in this game thus far as mosato goes and has the basketball moving to hildred and the cornered five seconds on the shot clock theres Carr at the top of the key unable to knock it down North Carolina with the rebound and this is where the heels of dangerous in transition they have numbers McCoy attacking car on that closeout another foul as fouls continue to add up this week well have the first nothing but net of the season in fact Thursday at 10 Eastern right after our womens basketball doubleheader the nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only get right here on acc Network and the ESPN app so you can watch of course Applause oh my God hes just coming in and really giving coach Davis productive minutes on both ends of the floor but I do think theyre going to have to do something on that ball screen hes trying to recover missed a jump shot last time the drove out the first time theyre going to have to do something maybe switch that ball screen it starts the car starts knocking down shots and now theyve gone small they got its off to it before it needs to shoot so theyre gonna have to switch cant get back to him great job there recognizing it Tyree have to be attacking the switch trying to go about Justin McCoy McCoy with a great job defensively once again North Carolina author won exceptionally to the rim thats a foul offensive foul John Gaffney right on top of that cam hildren gets back and is able to deny that opportunity I thought he was coming down and moving a little bit but he was outside the restricted area and stopped and good call I thought Trump was trying to avoid him and just clipped him enough to call him foul not a popular car here within the arena as Trimble picks up his second foul Huber Davis doesnt like the call either and thats an important play because hell just playing with two fouls did not want to pick up that third still stepping in putting his body on the line oh that would have been a big change in The Swinging momentum for the Demon Deacons that he has to go out here first but one thing its a great shot there by nassan so you got to get up and close out with a high hand on him and Steve Force wants to turn over after the big three Bob Monsanto Wake Forest with a twopoint lead under admitted here in the first half remaining in Chapel Hill well Carolinas struggling in the offensive end when they when things slow down they just they struggle to score in half court sets so theyre forcing turnover theyre forcing the shots when they get numbers you started to charge there by Trumbull and they hadnt scored in the last four minutes and 35 seconds theyre both for five in the last field goals with a couple of turnovers and I think like again when things settle down I think this team the ball needs to touch Armando Bay caughts hand in the poster lets see Applause gets a hand on it but out of bounds once again the great job defensively coming up with the stop you know why Im such a fan of love because there is no one in the history of North Carolina that has the green light like Kayla love has had ever thats not even refutable no one has ever had the green light and human Legends guys play and shoot and he gives them confidence to do so and and Im not saying it as a negative thing I mean because no ones a happy dream like I cant alone in the middle gets down to Camp Hogan no two for one he wont wait for us on that possession go ahead and look for the best coffee shop they could get now for being here nice drive kick out from Santo unable to finish two hands in the back from Bradford pushing Armando Baker Music they have files to give at that spot I think youll see between Bradford and Marsh and if they need to go deeper with Keller they have bodies that they can throw 15 fouls they can give its going to be a one and one for Bangkok at the freethrow line Music forgive me North Carolina in the double bonus two shots for bacon Music Music Applause here in this first half hell make both of them because Im talking about him make out of kills the double double King Music Applause well I guess we should call it the prince will ever be the King 16 seconds remaining top of the key thats off the way for us they got the basketball in the hands of the guy they werent making the play doh nice defensive stand by love ends up being a turnover no shot for Wake Forest great defensive stand by North Carolina on the last possession of this first half Wake Forest with a onepoint lead headed into the halftime locker room a game that has featured a number of turnovers from both sides A little sloppy at times but still relatively high scoring minutes he started multiple games this years coming off the bench hes going to get double digit points and hes well on his way you know this afternoon and tonight rather and hes had a strong going I think hes Justin McCoy gets the second half start beat that school not back on the floor for the North Carolina Tar Heels a boy said a seasonhigh in minutes in the first half and has earned Huber Daviss trust thus far to start this second As Time reality is off the mark on the first possession of the second half for the Demon Deacons more importantly hes been better on the defensive end you know I dont know if Nance is going to make it back great job RJ get to this left hand getting the Rhythm pulled up again Ive said a million times I think hes the guy that has to get this group going seven points now for RJ Davis who went over a thousand points in the first half you got to swim before the basketball but this leaves someone open and this is where Wake Forest is dangerous beyond that threepoint off and thats the guy Tyree happens to be knocking down his third threepointer on the game now 10 points Applause weak side no win situation that you had to leave masato I would be open in two great shoes once again RJ Davis attacking the pick and roll throwing at Marsh inside hand to be able to finish and right now Steve fourth maybe going to have to make a change with picking more coverage right there not liking the way that Andre Davis has got back to his race car here in the second half just get to the paint I mean the floater wants to lay a bear here another quick turnover by Monsanto okay the Finish transition points from North Carolina great job defensively by Caleb love jumping into the passing away North Carolina takes a twopoint lead and the crowd is back into this one but when youre struggling to score the way you get yourself back in the game is defend they get out scoring transition Monsanto for three once again he made three big threes against North Carolina a season to go that stressed the lead from 11 to 20 and now has 10 points here and regains the lead for the DVD another miscommunication there is a tar heel defense there was the switch and those guys went back door didnt talk RJ Davis anything you can do returning the favor for the Tar Heels who go back up by two Music RJs come out of the second half locker room with a lot of energy and focus on the offensive end of the floor Cameron hildren calls the pick and roll and you see right now trying to get some motion going on the exterior four great for us as Appleby Fox car right wing is able to knock down the three ball high who leads to ACC and assists in the ACC play picks up another as the car knocks down his first bucket of the game theyre gonna have to do a better job of communicating on that they dont want to switch with him but I think they must same pickleball action Wake Forest covering better on that possession but in these leaky blacks with a run to the rim unable to finish but still youd have to love the aggressiveness of leaky black getting downhill driving to close out licky black just catching off reversion shot fake and then attempt to fake drops by masato against the foul and headed to the line for two thats going to be the first on March trying to contend with leaky black at The Rim leaky black at the free throw line 14 points for him opportunity to make two and tie his career high at 16 usually the Scout report you can tell Liberty was to leave him open to let him make shots and then he comes out and varies three threes in the first half so now you got to close out he puts it on the phone drives by again Lincoln Blacks had a completely different offensive outlook on this game as he knocks down just free throw now 16 points for leaky black tying his career high and I dont think hes done Music are we happy off the screen wall now has the match up against Justin McCoy gets downhill the easy bucket North Carolina youve got to make sure that youre capable and you know youre in Hell position putting Justin McCoy in a tough position trying to guard at the old agreement well you know you gotta thats what you got to know Scott report when youre a front line guy youre a customer guard at fours and five you got to get out there again not getting out on RJ Davis in another ball screen no teams just coming up this half just trading baskets and eventually someones got to play some defense to get a stop here RJ Davis going to his left once again knocking down the bucket Applause thank you oh cant finish but Andrew Carr can finish the car on the followup slam and thats normally the North Carolina style of play Second Chance points its great for his group but really opportunistic going to Opportunities like that they had a great offensive rebounding team but you leave the lane open like that they will collage goes to the left hand jumper gets the call but its been about RJ Davis here in the second half shell hes looking a little like you that you were playing on this court game 10 in the second half and a lot of that has become hot shooting for both these teams here to start the second stanza yeah Carolinas come out he struggled with the last four minutes and 35 seconds first man starts the second half theyre five for five and Geeks are hot themselves theyre five of seven I mean both teams have come out to a position and start 13 Points each and we still had a onepoint game here with these two teams of course better scoring teams in the ACC North Carolina at number one way for us a top five scoring team averaging 756 points per game so we expected fireworks on the offensive end of the floor from both these teams and we also have the number one and number two scores in the league Armando bacon whos number one and Tyree Appleby respectively right beside him who was I believe a point a tenth of a point back from bacon I think its a lot on the line for these guys and we talked to Armando about this before that the difference performance in Winston the other time they played a year ago was one of the reasons a lot of folks think its a lot of reasons a lot of winning one player a year and Armando didnt yeah if we talked with of course Sid extraordinary Steve kerstner earlier from the North Carolina Tar Heels his car attacks the basket unable to finish but to get an opportunity to go to the free throw line with the foul from McCoy but we talked with Kirsch about that and curse let us know that he and Armando had a conversation about that last year this game for North Carolina a year ago they went to Miami got blown out they come back and have to go to Wake Forest Armando has 1212 rebounds in that game but hes playing with a you know a sore thumb didnt have a very good game it was the only time they played great force a year ago right that was in coachs mind the reason why Armando did not win the ACC player of the year a year ago simply because of that game everything else lined up but that was the only time many voters got a chance to really watch his production two missed free throws here in the second half and the car gets the crowd Pringles but doesnt get us Pringles 5 000 Pringles theyre making five thousand and two five five thousand fans will give Pringles because of that and yeah thats two of us okay with love Off the Mark once again Caleb love also behind the art in this game Monsanto in transition pulls up knocks down a three long rebound leading to transition opportunities in the long rebound the long list allowsanto to pick up his protein point on the evening you gotta find him in transition thats his third three tonight and cant leave him open and right now Mondo baycott trying to direct traffic from the interior they get the ball into the hands of North Carolinas dick that plays unable to finish give Bradford credit for sporting his ground and thats highly after getting out in transition the finish for Applebees it was Steve Force who was concerned about his team getting back defensive right now Huber Davis cant like his teams defensive transition its a lot of frustration there with Armando Baker wanted to foul there didnt get the call I think hes trying to backlash hes got to turn his face in the driver he cant be backing down rappers too big but they caught once again doing that Bradford this time hell get the foul Music thats a layup to him you got to find him in transition he makes that at a high rate now for me again dont set your defense get back let the second ACC leave the score I think he wants a scoring title of the way hes going after tonight and after that 50 run frontway Force they built their largest lead of this game Five Points Bangkok Now with an opportunity to cut into that League thank you Applause Music Applause lets see if Amando can knock down his second free throw I jinxed him the first time I leave him alone this time yeah you did that Applause oh you did it again make sure everyone knows the voice of Randolph Silvers hey yeah thats a big man to give you one he needs his guard his guards to step up this game to help him out a little bit just right now you can see Tyree Abby looking to be a little more aggressive still running the offense directing traffic but looking at his opportunities Monsanto on the drive takes it to the midrange once again and carlisanto has done a little more than weve seen in doing the cash 15 points for him in this game but hes doing it in different ways a nice fine for Bangkok to Seth Trimble for the oldfashioned give and go looking at another three desert take the shot ends up turning it over Steve Forbes talking to his young player the Tiff turnover for Wake Forest its a great job there throwing into post giving going like we said before Armandos a really young selfish player just giving the ball in the post he needs to touch it more to kind of get back control to this pace the momentum and everything just seems have slipped since the last TV time obviously over Carolinas win surprisingly getting transition basket we thought it would be UNC that would get out in the fast breaking demarma Santo picks up his second foul walks immediately to the bench Bobby Clinton coming in to take his spot the Monsanto playing great basketball on the offensive end of the floor right now sure he wont be over here long as North Carolina continues to try to feature bacock on the interior that time kicking you back out leaky black to RJ Davis Davis he checks down to three ballada back within one 17 points for RJ Davis thats his 12th point in the second half and he only had five in the first half and hes really picked it up here got himself going thats how we have to be trying to get back into the painted area great job defensively about calebra cutting it off with nice cut by Carr whos able to finish off another assist from Appleby seven points now for Carr as Ashby continues to rack up assist Wake Forest forces you to guard the entire space to move forward I mean theyre going to shoot the three theyre getting the lane off two feet theyre going to have Cutters cutting off off the post off the wing and they they play off their guards over there being cant relax when they drop when anyone has the basketball they move by Mondo they caught mishandled it but hes able to gather it back and go to his left hand beating Wacker off the bounce and thats an advantage that North Carolina can look to if they thought it has face as you mentioned previously he can face up and drive past bigger Defender but he has to against Bradley Bradfords too big a physical for him to drive right by him nice job defensively cutting off Applebee that time by Caleb will have to be still getting to his look unable to finish puts it in Drive unable to find a way to the basket goes to the fade away and the bucket that Turnbull cut off the great footwork to be able to get his seventh point in the North Carolina faithful looking for a defensive stand on this possession not a high level basketball being played right there smart getting in a lane like this defense Applause Trump will get to the Lane hes doing it on both ends of the floor doing it there on his defense here hes doing it on the offensive end drives down to Lane plays off two feet shoots the fade away got ourselves a ball game here and look at that chase down block great game here come join us with him theyre well equipped and used to playing in these type of games and theyve had two buzzer beaters you see there against half state Music in Utah Valley early in the year and Tyree Tyree Appleby has been leading the way as you see averaging 23 points in those games but thats thats hard to imagine I mean six one point one possession games already in the season I mean that thats we got a lot of basketball enough to play I know like myself coach Forbes is bald but he loses a lot more hair yes you keep this up and speak for yourself me and Freddie cargo over here with a Hair Club for Men on this side so uh yeah you keep that over on that side but one thing if were going to have a close game in this one its gonna be because somebody gets a stop right now in this second half Wake Forest is shooting 69 from the field and that pales in comparison to North Carolina shooting 82 percent here in this second half as both teams will go to their benches right now or something going on in the stands and both officials to medical issue hope everyones all right feels good its not too stuffy here tonight too you hope its nothing nothing too serious boys Music come back and join us here again close game here in Chapel Hill 6160 North Carolina 11 15 remaining here in the second half got to give a shout out to the First Responders here taking care of business yes in the stands dealing with the medical issue and now we are back to basketball and of course I think its fair to say too to add to that is she was conscious that they were taking her out so we know shes I think shes going to be okay so thats thats a great sign and handle perfectly of course everyone very sensitive as deservedly so over the damari Hamlin situation and our prayers continue to go out to him and his family throughout everything that theyre dealing with and now as weve had the twominute warmup both teams ready to take the back to the floor itll be interesting to see how this yeah affected the offenses of this team you talk about North Carolina nine of 11 in this second half way four shooting 69 so both these teams were off to a hot start in the second half well see how this delay affects underneath inbounds only play and thats one thats a mistake you dont take away the inside Andrew Paul is able to get an easy bucket those are the little things in the game thats the eighth Point wake has gotten off of Bo Baseline out of bounds Bob playing when youre in close one possession games like theyve been and they execute perfectly but for Carolina got to do a better job of that Armando baycott attacking Marsh once again a fouled opportunity to get to the free throw line but you talk about those underneath out of bounds plays thats something that Huber day was talked to us about earlier today is paying attention to details and again after a long delay like we just experienced oftentimes you can get sidetracked coming back in first play UC Carr taking advantage of that so yeah lets call it what it is its a lack of concentration that you know that what you know thats a play that wasnt a new play date drawn up weve seen Wake Forest running they scored twice off the same play for threes in the first half then they get a point blank layup there in the second half thats eight point stack you know its coming and those are the things that Hubert says about this group that theyre struggling with its just the minor detail now 15 points for Armando baycott doing the majority of his damage from the freethrow line he made both his fear throws that time you see because you werent talking about it Tyree app be off the screen and roll finds Marsh Marsh David Williamson getting involved in the mix foreign moving the basketball side to side Appleby getting into the painted area doesnt take the shot by allowing Carr to go to work he wants car to take advantage of Trimble backing him down over the top of tremble great job defensively by Seth Trimble to deny the opportunity and a shot clock violation North Carolina coming up with that much needed stop but Jeffrey Anderson coming in talking with John Gaffney hes saying Carolina possessed the basketball and threw it back in so theyre going to check the clock theyre going to review and see if it was possession for North Carolina hes questioning whether Kate of Love Actually possess it before he threw it in or do they automatically call that possession of the basketball I think thats what hes looking at so Jeffrey Anderson stating Caleb love didnt control the basketball throwing it back in to be careful we wake Force the ball at another Baseline out of bounds play and important to note it is a 30second shot clock review not 20 because its not an offensive rebound so basically that is a turnover 4K LeBron on that possession giving Wake Forest 29 seconds to move in that same underneath out of balance play thats unbelievable and again Jeff Lebo up heated on the sidelines right now with his team recognizing its the third time that theyve been beat on that same same play underneath out of bounds play and Seth trimbled will go to the free throw line with three Opera sorry forgive me Tyree Apple goes to the free throw line with three opportunities here thats just disappointing I mean we talked about it just not not two minutes ago and hes gotten two threes off the same Baseline of the bounce play you know its coming you dont do it again and again its what Hub has been harping him with this group its its why they drop so quickly from being number one team in the country and why theyve been so streaky so up and down theres still a ton of basketball to be played this game is definitely far from over but you cant continue to make those kind of mistakes Tyree Appleby missing on the free throw one the better free throw shooters in the ACC and averages nine free throw attempts per game knocks down the second but this is one of the areas where Wake Forest has been so strong talking with Steve Ford prior to the game he didnt expect for them to be able to come in and get 26 freethrow attempts like they have at home in the last two games but he knew it was going to be important for them to attack and get to the line but no one does it as much as Applebee does hes one of the two players in the country gets to the line shooting almost seven at night he just put so much pressure on the defense RJ Davis goes to the step back unable to finish it got to the lefthand pick and roll action as Appleby continues to put the pressure on North Carolinas defense probing in transition nothing there kicks it back out to Williamson a lot of cutting and moving by Wake Forest they force you to guard the entire floor Appleby once again into the painted area unable to finish Bay cop with the rebound and right now North Carolina doesnt seem to be pushing the basketball as fast as they were in the first half that was allowing him to get those fast break points double team on baycott so pass out to Caleb love go back inside to bacon once in outside the level attacks the paint able to get it up on the glass not finishing doesnt finish the second chance opportunity as well been a struggle offensively for Caleb love in this one didnt throw it out you got to reverse the ball to the weak side against the double team the open player is on the weak side for rotation ball never changed sides of the floor love goes in misses the floater RJ Dave is coming up with the steal getting out in transition goes to the Euro Step unable to finish drops it off to Seth Trimble Trimble following it in coming up with the layup North Carolina regains the lead Trimble with nine points Off the Bench first round by RJ Davis if you mean slip is Europe thats what he did and great job about him finding trouble well call the Euro slip as Appleby goes up top to Mars whos unable to finish Baka in transition somehow by the Deeks now thats what you do when youre struggling an offensive end Caleb love goes up top meets the big fella at the rim blocks the log Carolina and turns turns defense in the offense great job buddy Tar Heels there just a tremendous job tremble getting out still as Corey calls it Euro I call it a slip from grade five for the tremble got ourselves a ball game here 6764 Carolina three points off 11 Wake Forest turnovers has been the difference for the Tar Heels as of late we talked about they werent pushing it as fast just like that a steal from RJ Davis and then a long rebound allowing Armando baycott to get out into transition with the finish and North Carolina with a threepoint lead with 8 33 remaining here in this second half again we talked about it early in the first half when they get stops they can get out and run they just havent been very consistent on the defensive end that allowed them to get stops consistently so they can run I mean they want to play in transition and theyre getting started theyre getting stops here in the second half and theyve been able to take advantage of it and now North Carolina picking up the pressure RJ Davis trying to Hound Davon Williamson and Seth Trimble denies Holly Appleby until they get the basketball in the front court but just like that only 13 seconds remaining on the shot clock for late to try to get a good Lookout with the steal gets out of transition doesnt have anything bonds RJ Davis with three got it you can feel the energy in the building going up there picking up 94 feet weight didnt start their offense to 13 seconds Armando jumps out and creates a steal and RJ Davis with his 15th Point here in the second half 20 total another near steal North Carolina getting the message get the job done defensively Huber Davis is preaching details they found it here in this second half Armando Bangkok coming up with the steal he cant finish of course he finds a friend RJ knocking down the three RJ Davis by RJ Davis with 15 second half points and gone three from three of downtown as youve seen here hes put this Tarheel team on his back but Armando bakar said not so fast I want to join the party ponzer helps his teammate out knock down his third three strong start since the break this is an interruption we talked about whos going to come out and finish strong just like that Andrew Carr from the corner knocks down to three off of another Tyree Appleby assists eight assists now for Appleby and just like that Wake Forest makes a onepossession game another beautifully designed possession from Steve Forbes coming out of time out North Carolina goes back inside to Bangkok an immediate double team RJ Davis unable to finish but Seth Trimble with the offensive board goes up and finishes over top of Andrew Carr Trimble now and double figures with 11 points its a great game by the Freshman hes coming in hes in a really good on ball Defender you see him Hawking out will be here really allows them to switch and do different things in the offensive end hes not a great shooter but hes finding ways to get himself going and score there by getting it off as a rebound and finishing in traffic leaky black going back to what he does best defending coming out great hands tremble in transition missed RJ Davis going to bring on that possession leaky black slows it down Caleb love top of the key for three thats the maddening thing about Caleb of love he can struggle all game but he has a knack for stepping up in big moments and taking big shots gotta respect that in young mans game seven points with Caleb love was two for 11 to that point his first made threepoint field goal in the game and now you see defensively the energy is picked up from Love as he picks up the foul damari Monsanto recognizing the aggressiveness of love trailing the play you see leaky black catching looking inside is not there Caleb love catches at the top of the key calmly knocking down the three ball S I swear to you I love the fact that his I love his confidence I mean he it doesnt matter if hes two for ten of Ten to Ten you think that this surprises me at all that you of all people love his confidence you talked about you love his green light you think that hurt my feelings Laughter Applause Music foreign Applause weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social you just might see it on acc Network Monsanto knocking down free throw 17 points for him to heavy play you made there drawing the foul Carolinas on a run and he draws the foul you know it changes the momentum a little bit here they got picking up his drug Works back in the double team doesnt happen cant as well long for trouble finding leaky Block in the corner for three air mass that one beat defense Applause Monsanto going 101 again RJ Davis coming up with the steal the Finish RJ Davis getting the job done in transition once again this great Difference Maker Punch Out turnovers for the Tar Heels to Mars Marsh with the finish on the inside nice find by cam Hildreth getting into the painted area but staying Poise dropping it off again he plays bigger than his size he loves to get down there in post he trobes great job there Baseline help game Applause the Finish defined from RJ Davis getting to that left hand now 19 for bacon this North Carolina crowd wanting to erupt over another defensive stop Trimble taking long car in the painted area no call on that possession not a popular call here however I believe thats the right call by the officials thought it was good effort about trump it was a little oversized they gave up a few winches and just tried to take a drop to contact theres no forward there I thought there was at least contact good thing he didnt call the flopping rules so you can get free throws in a tight game like this 14 points for Carr all of his 14 points been scored in this second half theyve got back inside unable to finish but fouled Bob Marsh and Armando baycott will take another trip to the freethrow line to shoot his ninth and tenth free throws of this game I think hes impossible to guard if he gets it off the move he made the adjustment that you were talking about how everyone compares to trying to back down guys facing up using his quickness against a guy like Mark well if hes going to try to back those guys down they had multiple fouls and they still do throwing bodies at it and they had size and physicality to throw but against wakes physicality of Marshall Bradford I think hes too quick for both of those guys so if he turns and faces him I think they have no choice but to foul them and then you see wakes trying to double him and get the ball out of his hands Carolina seemed to have made the adjustment with guys cutting if they just dont settle they could have found something here to help carried in the rest of this last four minutes and 16 seconds in the second half the seven twenty point game this season for Armando Bay cop his 23rd career now up to 21 points as this crowd continues to applaud their team was on the defensive end than they have even on the offensive end of this game oh this crowd knows good basketball defensively when they see it nice fine Appleby to Mars whos able to finish over bacott and Wake Forest not going away when you think about Tyree Apple continues to make plays dropping off his ninth assist of this game this crowd knows defense what they said they didnt see it on that end they saw the Corey Alexander version of Defense right there Davis Applause what a second half by RJ Davis its Fourth three of the second half Davis up to 25 points Harvey app will be trying to answer unable to finish Caleb love with the rebound gets the basketball in the hands of Davis plenty of time left in the game for Wake Forest they dont need to take quick shots they take good shots if they execute their offense they tend to get what they want North Carolina executed it offense nine points their largest lead of the game back in the heads of RJ Davis inside the Babcock baycott facing up now turns his back to the right hand jumper high off the glass great job defensively by March March as Albert gets out in transition looking to be aggressive finds David Williamson in the corner great job defensively by North Carolina taking it away Williamson tries to drive it unable to finish and a strong stand on defensive end by the Hills good shot good luck just didnt go down thats about eight feet South Bank play it off two feet Andre Davis 18 points this second half been lights out coming here getting kick out from his big man knocking down to score three turnovers North Carolina zero turnovers in the second half Wake Forest six turnovers in the second half but the Tar Heels have scored 30 points off of Weights 16 turnovers in this game Carolinas been on fire here in the last 10 of the five of those have been threes the magic number for Weight coming in was 13 you know 13 turnovers and they were at 14 and when they get to 15 a plus turnovers they it doesnt farewell for the Deeks right now and theyre at 14 and its its given that you see 30 points off that and coach Ford wont be too happy with that number but when you consider both these teams shooting over 50 percent for the game the high shooting in the second half has really carried them getting shot opportunities matters most and the fact that North Carolinas got more painted love gets downhill unable to finish but thats been the advantage for the heels theyre getting easier shots where theyre getting them off their turnovers cant Hildreth trying to find what theyre going to do in the offensive in the floor a little miscommunication right now Applause 15 seconds remaining on the shot clock but theyre accustomed to wait not switching back and then now they have a lineup with leaky blocking at the four they can switch that ball screen they thought they would get a quick quick hedge and recover and then they give a three to Monsanto and they switched it in great defense by uh UNC and they with this lineup they have now theyre going to switch forward probably just going to hedge with them on though you know Carolina going to take their time getting to offensive set get the basketball in the hands of Armando baycott allow him to work theyll find the open guide thats the open guy RJ Davis who puts it in Drive Caleb love has nothing two seconds remaining on the shot clock love unable to finish but another offensive rebound leaky block making the smart play throwing it back out no need to rush at this stage of the game Blakes got to come out and run you know double or switch the ball screen they got to do something different now five seconds on the shot clock RJ Davis Music the three ball doesnt happen but another offensive rebound theyre going to get Armando baycott for the pushoff two hands in the back of Cam hildred but the damage was done North Carolina keeping the basketball for close to a minute on that possession with a nine point lead every second is precious as Wake Forest regains possession wake has done a really good job theyve actually out rebounded Carolina tonight but those thats possession right there is the last thing wake needed was give Carolina two extra possessions burn off the clock admitted possession when youre down nine is the last thing you need to have happen there for the Deeks Applause Trumbull with a good job just make sure Applebee cant catch the ball in the front Court sorry down the painted areas the hook pass out to Clinton well look at the three unable to knock it down Caleb love comes up with the rebound North Carolina content to run time off the clock and right now Steve Forbes trying to encourage his players to get up and put pressure on the basketball Wake Forest going to play this possession out no foul unable to finish transition opportunity for the Demon Deacons Appleby to pull up for three unable to get it to go down offensive rebound Bobby Clinton unable to finish Carr with the putback sevenpoint game 306 remaining Wake Forest calls the timeout you wake for us now you gotta you gotta establish a full court pressure here coach Forbes is kind of telling everybody they may try to run some type of trap they got to go mantoman here you want to deny you cant get a five second count you want to try to get a steal if not I think theyre fouled immediately because right now the clocks surrender me down seven for 30 seconds youve been a part of the staff with Coach Forbes youre in that huddle right now how long did you take once North Carolina gets the basketball out of bounds if you dont get that turnover how long are you looking before you foul is it immediate or youre trying to get a trap and allow to see if you can get the steel on to throw out I think with 30 seconds left you try to get a try and see if youre getting one more pass but the one thing about when you double team youre leaving someone completely free so you got to make sure if you dont get the steel out of that trap you got to make sure you get there in your foul because if not this game will be essentially over theres still a small margin for error right now that Carolina has that you can use to take advantage of to get back in this game but it starts with this possession it cant be much time taken off one way or the other you know you need to decide whatevers going to happen has to happen in two or three seconds ideally you want a big defender on the ball like they have Carolina can run the Baseline and if not she got a foul North Carolina would love to get the ball in the hands of RJ Davis they get to Caleb Love Now into RJ Davis and if youre Wake Forest this is the guy that you dont want to foul but you have to follow him at some point Andrew Carr not fouling when hes right there next to him wasting precious seconds off the clock and thats what I was saying before is 30 seconds you wasted seven seconds he allowed the ball to get back to their best freethrow shooter the one guy you dont want to have the ball in his hands in a oneonone situation Music and particularly the way he shot the ball the second half 15 second half points I mean hes been likes out RJ Davis two for two today leads the ACC in free throw percentage at 887 percent knocks down the first one yeah Im not worried about jinxing him hes just not a guy you want to put online even when hes struggling from a Honda line hes really consistent making his free throws a little under 90 percent Davis knocks down the second 27 points for RJ Davis to lead all scorers Tyree app will be trying to get into the front Court quickly the kick out Lukey black with the steal outfitting leaky black with the Finish and a career high for a leaky block 18 points and is this game with the punctuation mark foreign Appleby no creating these dicks theyre going to play every second left on the clock leaky black all defensive team a year ago in the ACC coming up with the steal coming up with the flush his 18 points on the evening amounting to a career high as he gets an ovation from the crowd here at the dean E Smith Center Armando baycott taking a shot there going down I dont think the train is going to come help him with that I think hes got to figure that one out yeah baycott getting up slowly weve all been there young fella you got to walk that one out shake that off man you got to walk that one off theres no medicine to help you with that one you just gotta stand tall and figure it out breathe young man breathe Im sorry everyone its its its late when 45 minutes past my bedtime Im not like Corey sitting here drinking Bojangles iced tea stand right Im sorry sweetie right okay he got a half gallon of sweet tea sitting next to him trying to keep himself its well past my bedtime but the game tonight really good game tonight we have to be missing the free throw as the clock continues to run and this one is over the North Carolina Tar Heels bouncing back getting to two and two in ACC play dropping to Wake Forest Demon Deacons to two and two as well Randolph Childress what do you think about this one I think the story tonight was just turnovers we talked about it I mean that number for Wake Forest is about 12 or 13 they had 15 tonight Carolina turned it into 32 points it was the story of the game when they
