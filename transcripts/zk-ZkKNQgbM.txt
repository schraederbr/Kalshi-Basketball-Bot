Five combo is something different in Chapel Hill Its Henry Vasar who gets the honors to do the tip tonight Carolina in the home white We are underway in Chapel Hill And its North Carolina that starts with the basketball Our officials Pat Driscoll Jerry Eer and Chase Shaw tonight And heres Caleb Wilson in attack mode early First thing youll notice Jay this ETSU defense one of the best in their league Theyre long theyre athletic and theyre active Wilson knocks down the triple to open the scoring Doesnt matter if youve got 610 seeing over the top Terrific shot Thats the one thing he doesnt do Jay He He steps out his game brings it out to the threepoint line Im not sure what you can do You mentioned ETSU is long for the SoCon but they are short tonight their tallest player Jordan McCullum is 68 That is smaller than three Tarheel starters But McCullum right on Q knocks down a triple of his own North Carolina starting five still without Seth Trimble making progress though He was at five on five practice cheering yesterday Tarheelss have fared well without him Basar nice turn around with the left hand Come on Going old school Hes not your prototypical always back to the basket guy He flourishes when hes a little further away still has that in his game though They go right back to McCullum Why not Nothing but the bottom of the net Jordan McCullums got all five early for the Bucks Jordan McCullums an interesting kid Transferred from Murray State This is a guy that was a top 150 recruit in his class cheering He has that natural ability to create a little bit off the bounce Theres ETSU head coach Brook Savage Year number three as head coach of the Buccaneers No stranger to the ACC An assistant for Steve Forms at Wake Forest for three seasons And hes got his group dialed in on defense to start this season He absolutely does This is a team that forces steals Live ball turnovers on just under 15 of possessions Theyre aggressive to the ball and youll see how quickly they flood whenever theres a ball handler Allan Strs called for a reach in This is a defense you dont get those statistical numbers if you dont gamble a little bit So Brooks Savage hell live with a foul call or two Going to be very aggressive tonight on the defensive end Have good feet inside Besar puts it up in there and the Buccaneers have cheering no answer for the sevenfooter Its been big big and big here early Two for Basar Corner triple Caleb Wilson How they have showed up in the opening two minutes of this game The best front court statistically in all of college basketball averaging 35 points per game 20 rebounds per game Tallest cheering player on the floor for ETSU at 68 in the column Hes got all five Shot clock down to four Great cut Blake Barkley the Morgantown West Virginia native Its going to be a reoccurring theme tonight ETSU trying to run long possessions keep the possessions low for the entirety of this game cheering The deeper into the shot clock they go the happier Brook Savage is going to be And like Tony Bennett cheering Virginia teams theyre comfortable playing at the end of the shot clock Trying to make North Carolina uncomfortable playing these long possessions for a Tar Hill team that wants to turn it into a trap See a lot of dribbling The only guy that has the ultimate green light is McCullum but youll see very cheering hesitant to make something happen quickly Theyre going to use the entire clock applause But heres the thing cheering turnover ETSU Thats fine Buccaneers still get to set their defense Dead ball turnovers youre willing to live with Brook Savage fired up Tied at cheering seven in the opening three minutes This is an ETSU team thats very comfortable in their halfcourt defense How cheering does North Carolina need to attack it tonight You know whats interesting In games prior ETSUs gotten out hedged ball screens hard switched and really tried to create turnovers So far through the first few possessions theyre not hedging these ball screens Theyre playing it flat Interested to see how North Carolina changes up their style a little bit offensively Shot clock cheering ticks down to seven Diane Evans in trouble fires a contested three Nothing but air Another good defensive possession by the road team A lot of time you see a team get a couple of stops against North Carolina They get excited Not ETSU Theyre going to call sets cheering for most of this game and try to keep possessions low like we talked about Taylor fires the three Cant connect This in my opinion J Why North Carolina is so dangerous They have so many guys that can grab and go and they can play quick Excellent pass by Stevenson Evans no good but Caleb Wilson as he often is there to clean up the spill Just so athletic Bounces off the floor Caleb Wilson He Its hard to find a comparison Some have said Marvin Williams Some around Carolina have said Jameson Quick double team You got to slide down plus the foul Blake Barkley will go to the line with an opportunity to give ETSU the lead Poles I think this teams better than that I ETSU huge basketball following in Johnson City They love hoop there in that part of Tennessee Theyve got a great homecourt advantage 70 this season at home but theyve struggled on the road One and three Theyve started well tonight in Chapel Hill Wilson pull up missed it Good defense by Blake Barkley all over the freshman phenom there Blake Barkley number 13 in blue Its a guy to keep an eye on Hes a Northwestern transfer over his last three Has averaged 17 points a game Playing some good ball lately cheering Taylor that rolls around the it rim but does not drop North Carolina yet to establish a rhythm in transition cheering Skip back way over the head of Jonathan Powell Eric Dixon freshman mistake there Good news Jay The guy in the fourth row was open Hey difference for defense ETSU again and I want to emphasize this Carolinas walkth through today really worried about hard hedging about trying to get out and create turnovers ETSU cheering sitting back a little bit further in the half court on the defensive end Barkley passes out of the double team leads to a good look from three off the mark East Tennessee State working a lot through Blake Barkley number 13 The red shirt sophomore from Morgantown West Virginia We mentioned the head coach Brook Savage spent three years on Steve Forb staff at Wake Forest He compared Barkley to an all ACC player for the Demon Deacons and Jake Laravian And I think thats a pretty good comparison LRA needed to work on his jump shot when he got to Winston Salem Barkley kind of along those same lines but shooting a good ball so far this season Barkley commits the foul there Itll send Caleb Wilson to the line for two And one thing Tarheels fans will definitely have noticed through the first 10 games of this season is Caleb Wilson really good at getting to the foul line He gets fouled a lot Well Jay I think it has a lot to do with how hard he works to get correct positioning when theyre in the half court You see him they call a play a set he sets his cuts up and he doesnt chase the ball And what I mean by that is if he doesnt get it on the first catch he continues to work to get deep post positioning and get the ball where hes comfortable Now does he settle for a midrange jump shot or two Sure But this is a guy that understands I get a little bit closer I can get to that foul line And because hes so aggressive and is the aggressor on these possessions he ends up at the charity strike Well in every game hes played in a Carolina uniform he has made five or more foul shots hes got one already in the bank tonight Missed the second Six minutes into this first half ETSU dedicated to the game plan They want to use long possessions Take that shot clock down to the single digits and then fire a shot like that three way off the mark Somebody needs to close the door Good defense by North Carolina staying disciplined in the half court not getting anxious Good kick to the corner for three Its good Nothing but the bottom of the net for Derek Dixon This really good job by Ken Evans getting downhill along that seam Strong side help Cant do that needs to be a show and go Get back out to the corner Derek Dixon the freshman he just knows how to play ball Just a solid player Understands his role Big fan of cheering what hes done so far this season Evans alive He was looking for Wilson Follows his own pass Keeps the possession alive Good job to track that ball down Actually thought that was a terrific pass Wilson just didnt get his foot footing right Look at the here 5 seconds to shoot THROUGH TRAFFIC REJECTED cheering WHAT A STUFF CAM Morris the third Transition triple No good Mai Johnson way off the mark ETSU Theyre letting the threes fly but not accurately Just one for five from deep Wilson cheering on the floor Ripped away ETSU has it How about the hustle for the Buccaneers I I mean you see as soon as it gets to Wilson everybody swarms to the basketball If hes going to score hes going to have to make moves quick in the half court because bodies are coming cheering Miscommunication McCollum wasnt ready for it Tracks it down with 8 seconds to shoot ETSU of their last five from the floor Three seconds on the shot clock Smith from the logo GOT IT JAYLEN SMITH beats the buzzer and its a onepoint game North Florida transfer He was a big time player in the A Sun He was ready for this opportunity Evans lines up a three How about an immediate answer Ken Evans delivers Was a big fan of Ken Evans at Colorado State Played alongside Neat Clifford Played alongside Isaiah Stevens Both of those guys in the Kings organization Just two really talented guys He was brought along slowly at the point guard position Now North Carolina reaping the benefits Some of the toutelage under Nico Medvid now at Minnesota Another deep three Smith too much on that one Offensive rebound Morris goes up strong and that rims in for two Nice play Cam Morris Played at UMass L in the American East And heres Carolinas tempo Yeah Quick transition three This fires from the corner Jonathan Powell You like that look though I really do for Carolina They play fast Theyre enforcing tempo Now were going to get a break Yeah As far as natural gifts athletically Caleb Wilsons up there and you could throw names like AJ Deans on there but Caleb Wilson how he moves around the floor how he works for positioning hes about the right things This freshman class weve talked about it and talked about it around the country just so special Caleb Wilson Obviously a big reason why Shot clock ticks down to four This has been the game plan all night for ETSU A deep three off the mark from Brian Taylor but an offensive rebound keeps the possession alive for the Buccaneers Offensive boards over the last two games 22 offensive rebounds against North Carolina Got that little tidbit from UNCCs beat rider Yeah Huber Davis not happy with that told us before the game he wanted fewer paint touches and no offensive rebounds because it can lead to second chance points And just like that Brian Taylor fires ETSU in front Thats just a really good offensive possession And heres the thing about those offensive rebounds Jay Its coming against teams Thats a good call Its going against teams that crash their guards Exhibit A last possession Matthews the third crashes from the corner as youll see Just a nice job Its the push off afterwards I actually thought he had pretty good position It was the push the shove after that got Stevenson Gives the ball back to ETSU The team playing with a lot of confidence on the road against a number 12 team in the country What could the Tar Hills do to speed ETSU up because they are getting exactly what they want on offense Taking this shot clock down once again I think the biggest thing is continue being disciplined as long as you can just simply because theyre not going to turn it over because of how their sets are being run But you have to finish possessions with a defensive rebound Obviously a huge portion Stevenson trying to muscle through the double team A deep FREE DRILLED JONATHAN Powell puts UNCC back in front With Seth Treble out Jonathan Powell has proven that he can be be a guy to come off the bench and give you quality minutes And hes a guy Jay that you have to watch his game for extended periods of time to really appreciate him He doesnt turn the ball over He shoots high percentages He guards well Hes pretty athletic careerhigh 17 points last time out cheering Good rejection at the rim Henry Vasar says no applause Not only did he say no he said absolutely not Vesar how about the length 71 It doesnt matter Pretty good set back door cut but when youre that long and athletic you can get back into play Vasar not giving up on that back door The ultimate rim protector ETSU still with the ball 5 seconds on the shot clock They got to hurry here Barkley just gets it off in time and cashes in Blake Barkley ties it up at 19 Blake Barkley just a really good player 17 points seven rebounds in his last three Just understands positioning cheering and how to get there A little too aggressive here though Called cheering for the foul But the change in coverage though Ball screen on the side Hedge jumps out You look back That rotation from ETSU has to be a little bit faster And thats a big foul for ETSU Blake Barkley gets two He heads to the pine Has to come out here with 822 to go in cheering this first half Loaded into Vesar Nice pass Leads to a good look from three No good from Ken Evans cheering foul called against Van for the reach Thats his first ETSU making life difficult for the Tar Hills so far in this first half Brook Savage has to be happy with how his team is playing Well theyre rotating really well And whenever you send two to the ball your rotations have to be good on the backside And what thats doing is its forcing Carolina to make those extra passes cheering finding shots but Evans needs to be shot ready Thats something thats a little different this year because hes doing the majority of the ball handling I feel like applause thats taken a lot more out of him in terms of prepping for a shot but hes being relied on a lot more to just initiate the offense Good defense Shot clock violation You said it Excellent defense from Henry B Two European bigs Johan Gruntlo Ty Ditter super talented super old cheering Weve said diaper dandies before Ty Der Ritter played for Bill Ba Basket and won the Champions League He was their leading scoreer Hes a little older so Im not giving him diaper dandies Thats a liftoff Brian Taylor hammers it home And ETSU after creating the turnover back in front Terrific back door set coming out Hubert Davis dont like the turnover after the timeout and the Estonian gets the Euro step for two Vasar nimble a foot Excellent catch and finish Those long strides paying off for the sevenfooter and hes got six points tonight No but not only with those four teams ranked in the top 25 eight teams out of the Atlantic Coast Conference in the top 50 of the net And I love the net as much as I love a hanging nail but applause and cheering it matters this year because theres more farrun opportunities within league play Not a bad foul Yeah it stops the transition which ETSUs done a really good job of limiting in this first half North Carolina cannot get into their rhythm transitioning from D to O Terrific back door cut Awesome pass by Miles Taylor He knows what to do And then on the other end look at the sweet feet of Henry Basar Little finger roll for good measure So talented is this young man Get a look at Jaden Young who hasnt played a whole lot of minutes Number four in white transferring from Virginia Tech Kick to the corner A three Too much on it McCollum tracks it down for ETSU Stevenson over the last two games one of eight from three You got to be shot ready knowing that your guys are going to come in and double team Get your butt down a little bit base a little wider Just shooting 20 from three on the season And hes a better shooter than that MORRIS INTO THE LANE Kick out a three And McCollum missed it Offensive rebound again And what is it Its a guard Mai Johnson coming in across the free throw line If your guard heres the deal Its a doubleedged sword because if youre Carolina those guards like to leak out a little bit so you can play cheering fast You got to hit and get Dont let that guy crash from the from the wings and the corners Shot clock down to three ETSU 7 second chance points tonight Almost had another but that just rimed out off the backboard Tied at 21 Points have been at a premium Good defense on both ends Nice offense Evans wide open Hell make you pay Ken Evans cheering applause Just really good offense Jaden Young taking the initiative Baseline drive Didnt not much of a baseline drift but he hangs in the air long enough And the good better best The one more pass from Jiren Stevenson leads to an open three cheering having six points to go along with four assists tonight cheering Shot clock down to five This is what ETSU has done this entire first half Although this time they turn it over Theyve been playing comfortable at the end of the shot clock but Brook Savage team turns it over that time Jaden Young a little ball movement Hubert Davis hes going to be happy about this Jaden Young nice play and the one more pass to Kayen Evans who shot 44 from three last season Jay this is a guy who can really knock down shots Feel like its coming And I feel like if theres one guy whos been hurt more than anybody else by Seth Trenles injury its been Ken Evans Wilson Tough take Draws the foul applause Reason I say that Ken Evans being hurt by Seth Trimble being out Seth Trimble gives you that secondary ball handler Ken Evans through his first couple of years of college basketball at Colorado State was a guy who would give it up and end up turning back into a two guard Thats the reason he was settling into his shot Trimble gives him that ability to do that But this season so far Evans only 30 from three a much better shooter than that I expect that number to jump up more and more especially when Trimble comes back And Hubert Davis giving a very positive update on Seth Trimble yesterday saying hes returned to five on five practice Should be back sooner rather than later Getting close to having Trimble back whos missed the last eight games with a fracture at his arm And Huber Davis said Look he is a game changer A lot of people think hes a game changer on defense but he thinks hell impact them offensively like youre talking about even more so transition three Rattles in and out no good Another offensive rebound and McCollum puts it home for two cheering Tarheels getting crushed on the glass Nine second chance points tonight for ETSU And a turnover And if youll notice here ETSU has only attacked advantage situations when somebodys fallen on the ground then theyll Taylor Tannen Bomb and Luke Hancock and the entire nothing but net crew that we will keep everybody posted on what happens here at halftime in the puppy race ETSU they have hung tough Theyve done it with good solid defense and an offense running the shot clock down Ticks down to five here Cam Morris Good defense by Zayen Hop As the shot clock sounds that bounces off the rim No good When you play against Cam Morris you have to stay on your feet He loves two and three shot fakes at the end of his drive Wilson flies in THE LANE ONEHANDED JAM cheering Caleb Wilson with the rock attack applause And its plays like that that have many saying that the best player in college basketball is here in Chapel Hill Certainly could be My man had a runway for takeoff Nine points five rebounds to lead the Tar Hills tonight Brian Taylor unafraid ETSU continues to attack cheering He can do this One of the nations leaders in dunks Terrific ball screen Little pass in the seam My goodness he cocked that back to Atlanta where hes from What a finish by Caleb Wilson Hes a special athlete That goes without saying but my goodness cheering can he get off the floor On the defensive end Wilson commits his second foul and comes out of the game We were saying about the freshman Phenom He gets fouled a lot Well you see a play like that fouling him may be the only way to stop him when he gets ahead of steam down the lane Thats absolutely right And heres the deal too If youre the aggressor on the drive youre much more prone and much more likely to get the foul call cheering Hes taken that to heart He lives at the rim But lets be honest too ETSUs done a nice job on him flooding to the ball and making him see bodies two or three at a time The defensive performance so far for the Buccaneers has been really good Twohanded slam applause Just a really good offensive set Jiren Stevenson catches it out about 15 ft A guard goes and sets it down screen for a little curl in the middle Vesar finishes it up Cam Morris Nice turn around in the post Cuts the lead at half I will say this If youre Cam Morris no home runs Double team ETSU relentless on the defensive end A foul called applause as we take just under two minutes to play in this first half Terrific screen Jaden Young He comes down This is a set play Youre going to find Basars guy Vasars guy excuse me Hes just going to curl around right in the front Terrific pass Excellent execution by the Tarheelss Basar goes to the line as North Carolina enters the bonus Shooting a one and one Makes the front end ETSU head coach Brook Savage told us his number one key to this game No dunks did not want to inject life into this Dean Dome crowd And for a long stretch of this first half they limited it But then Wilson the onehanded slam based on the twohanded flush it has injected some life And North Carolina has upped the tempo since those two dunks Absolutely has But on the flip side when you get a little too juiced up ETSU can take advantage in a couple of plays or the next play Brian Taylor gets around Wilson forces his second foul So again doubleedged sword but I really like how East Tennessee State has approached this game so far There we go Thats a big trap right here A sevenfooter and 6 10 cheering in the trap Forces the turnover Stevenson lifted layup and Carolina has their largest lead of the night applause cheering Timeout ETSU Just a really good defensive Theyre sharing the ball real well 11 assists on their 12 makes in this first half Handling ETSUs defensive pressure so far tonight Only five turnovers Well below what ETSUs accustomed to forcing Kick to the corner Wide open Johnson got it Big three out of the timeout Excellent job Brian Taylor ball faking to the middle Getting Mai Johnsons guy to sink down for a wide open three in the corner The freshman cuts the deficit in half 50 seconds remaining immediate answer Henry Vasar delivers Hes so impressive You talk about a modernday 7footer Henry Vasar He dunks a couple of possessions He knocks down a few threes cheering Just a really skilled nice player And what a pickup applause and cheering Leads all scorers with 13 points of this first half Heres Cam Morris into traffic Rejected cheering Stevenson swats it Theres Powell Hard take and Carolina leads by eight applause 5 seconds at the end of the half A three off the mark And for as well as ETSU played in this first half its Carolina that goes into the locker room with all the momentum and an eightpoint lead Terrific job Carolina picked it up music on the defensive end Itll be the Buccaneers that start with the basketball And for 18 minutes they hung right with North Carolina Neither team led by more than four during that stretch but a late surge has given the Tar Hills an eightpoint cushion to start the second half Had to continue to handle pressure Not a good start Caleb Wilson getting to the spot quickly This is another part of his game his ability to initiate the break himself at 610 Make decisions just a tough fight How about this four five ball screen floats it to Wilson You know big man to big man passing is so difficult and they make it look easy How about big man to big man ball screen Thats 610 Setting a ball screen for 71 and 71s the ball handler I I mean you see at the NBA level now its a lot of guards coming up to set ball screens for five men Nico Joic theyd love to use him as the primary ball handler Well Carolinas taking a play out of the NBA playbook using their four and their five in balling action So difficult to guard because one the size is a nightmare Two the guys guarding them arent used to guarding those actions So its twofold Well the number one thing Hubert Davis chased this off season was positional size Mission accomplished That has shown up in a big way as the Tar Hills take a 10point lead Defensive intensity over the last five minutes of that first half Jay really picked up for Carolina again in limited possessions because ETSU has slowed this game down The target is very efficient offensively shooting 64 from the floor Trying to wiggle his way free Good defense by Mesa Terrific box out by Ken Evans Offensive rebounds a point of emphasis Terrific pass Paddle cant cash in Wilson the offensive rebound cheering and the twohanded slam applause Of course Ken Evans though getting down the lane lefthanded pass to the right corner setting his guys up with opportunities Six assists in the first half for the Colorado State transfer pull up off the mark North cheering Carolina starting to separate three Got it Timeout ETSU cheering The tempo starting to pick up Jay This Tarheel team terrific defensively They switch out They move They track with that size Theres a reason the Tar Hills this season second in the country in two point percentage defense allowing only 40 for opposing teams on the defensive end of the floor inside the three So that size it aint just for show Back door cut at ETSU Needed that basket out of the timeout That puts an end to the 12 nothing run been impressed with Blake Barkley number 13 for ETSU He works hard He cuts off the ball Just a really smart player Wilson goes right at Barkley playing with three fouls cheering And then a terrific defensive possession And heres the thing he understands Im not going to block the shot as the primary defender I square him up I maintain my defensive position I let the guy come from backside Cam Morris gets the block Barkley trying to back down Powell muscles his way to the ring Missed it Evans there to clean it up applause I thought that one was going on Kan Evans playing so well Terrific pass on the double team That rims out No good from Powell Evans with six assists in that first half for Carolina A pass first point guard Traditionally Carolinas got some point guards that typically are score first 100 And heres the thing Last year RJ Davis he was a guy that would really attack to score for himself Caleb Love before that and with RJ And then you also have Cole Anthony years before that And one of the things that Evans does as well as anybody is makes that advance pass and it allows your offense to get into flow quickly They enter the second side fast and the defense is scrambling and this is when you get rewarded I didnt hear the foul call but no step out of bounds turnover Pat Driscoll on top of it But I think its one of the more underrated parts of this seasons North Carolina team the willingness of their guards to let go of the ball and play quickly Like Ken Evans is not Ty Lawson and fast And Im going way back in the yestery year machine right now because thats who I played against It was impossible to stay in front of him But where he brings that same level of speed is letting the ball go and that creates a certain type of rhythm for this Tarhill team that does its best work playing quickly Yeah it ignites the transition 100 Not a ball dominant point guard and you know still finding a rhythm 10 games into a season with a new team but Kayen Evans starting to play his best basketball in a Tar Hills uniform After the offensive explosion at the end of the first half and a seven nothing run to start the second Carolina is scoreless for the last 230 Offensive rebound Tough take Count it Plus the foul James Brown Get on up James Brown Offensive rebound He seldom used for you and for Tarhill fans Your Sports Center for you is going to be Caleb Wilson a lot this season This was the onehanded tomahawk slam Youre going to see that later tonight on Sports Center top 10 And that dunk really ignited the end of the first half surge for North Carolina They ended with all the momentum an eightpoint lead and they have started to separate here 15point lead That was a catalyst That dunk and we talked to Brook Savage before the game I we we cant let them dunk the ball What ends up happening they dunk it Couple of turnovers forced Carolina starts to feel comfortable And weve seen the residual effects both at the end of the first half and here early in the second Shot clock down to two Morris draws the applause foul And whats incredible about Caleb Wilson is you know its coming right and you still cant stop it You Hes so athletic and he covers so much ground with his strides that once he gets you on his hip youre at his mercy And Im trying to find ways to describe how he moves in person cheering Im going Jaguar the cat the car This cheering guy moves so well and changes direction with power Its really impressive to watch in person cheering And Im not sure theres scrambled cookies on the line here Yeah the Dean Dome starting to go crazy cheering If an opponent misses backto back free throws everybodys leaving with cookies Theyll have to wait Kim Morris hates cookies How does ETSU who did so well in the first half keeping this close claw back into this one down 14 I I think its hard because in order to stay close they were playing at a slow pace Theyre going to have to knock down some shots and then they need to finish possessions And I appreciate what James Brown is doing He He gets a foul on one end of the floor and then comes down Hes playing aggressively and hes fighting for some extra minutes behind Wilson and Basar You applaud his effort At the same time play a little bit more cleanly but continue to bring that effort for 18 minutes This was a back and forth first half Yes one possession game throughout Theres North Carolina and a quick burst has gone up by double digits A floater does find McCollum Thats a tough set of forwards trying to throw an alleyoop over going right at Voz cheering it Hes talented isnt he Hes been the best player on the floor for ETSU tonight Hes got nine Wilson right down the lane Everything but the finish A foul on the floor But I mean one step or one dribble euro step covers a lot of ground I And I applaud Cam Morris at third Hes done a nice job today Hes battled He stayed in position cheering But I mean the change of direction plus the size is whats really unique about Caleb Wilson I think really too Jay as we as the refs are talking a little bit here well theyre trying to decide if Wilson was in the act of shooting or not It was called a foul on the floor Hubert Davis saying that he was going back up with it One of the underrated pieces of the great tobacco road classic between Duke and Carolina Caleb Wilson played with the Boozer brothers in AAU Boozer has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder So an added dynamic The chip on his shoulder is well documented too Two of the best players in all of college basketball Part of this phenomenal freshman class that has brought so much excitement to the sport this season as Morris misfires Carolina in control A 12point lead but looking for more We havent seen a ton of Luca today Guy comes over from Montenegro Nice pass Oh my gosh cheering Bo Gadget face off He just had a nice feed on the hoop He caught that ball behind his head I mean as good as Caleb Wilson has been tonight and hes been very good Its been Henry Basar so far for me tonight Some of the things that hes done on the floor have been outstanding on both sides of the ball Thousand Thats a tough shot the Estonian sensation transfer from Arizona and Carolinas using him so differently than Arizona did and more effectively a thousand J Heres the thing too at Arizona he was rim running at Carolina Hubert Davis is letting him stop at the threepoint line Thats where hes at his best as a screener and as a roller Look at this pass and how he catches the ball Tough angle It was so much more impressive from where Im sitting Look he catches it behind Able to put it in maintain his balance at 7 ft I mean just really really impressive Hubert Davis wanted to get bigger He Basar was one of the first ones to bite the bullet And because of that I mean Carolinas a threat to win every single game they play this year and make a deep run in March Well their fans will tell you theyre expected to win every game in every season Thats what the guy beside me said laughter Now with this roster particularly the front court that we keep talking about been outstanding this season Caleb Wilson just made his fifth free throw of this game In every game he has played in a Carolina uniform he has made five free throws or more He ties a record that Tyler Hanssboro did Tied for second in the longest streak of consecutive games Make it five or more When youre doing things that Hanssboro did thats good company The great Tyler Hansboro Now Professor Tyler Hans Yeah they keep him busy here at Chapel Hill Hes an analyst for North Carolina radio Hes a professor here at Chapel Hill And Caleb Wilson already just 11 games into his tenure in a Tar Hills uniform is starting to get talked about in that rarified air and statistically hes backed it up as he draws another foul You know the ability to get to the line is one thing but to consistently make them Theres Hanssbro through the crowd Now that work ethic hasnt stopped and you alluded to all the things hes done off the court Now his court is the pickle ball court where hes elite Oh is he a good player according to him Wilson pull up pop rolls around does not drop Ive had a chance to work with Tyler I mean just a great individual loves Carolina like nobody Ive ever met before Just passionate about his university and just stays involved I Ive really over the last two three years gotten to know Tyler Fantastic individual Smith just taken the shot clock down to five Now launches into the attack Not much TIME TO DO IT SCOOP TO THE HOOP FOR TWO IT worked out for Jaylen Smith Were looking to find Vasar at the post And another foul called ETSU has already committed seven fouls And now a technical foul has been called applause So North Carolina is going to be in the bonus the rest of the way here Brook Savage the Buccaneers head coach is still looking for clarification on why a technical was called against Jaylen Smith Jaylen Smith an emotional guy And Im going to be honest I so far this game has been really well officiated Im not sure how many times in my life Ive said that Jay Alter but Im willing to say it here But heres the thing Obviously Isaiah Sutherland thinks that he gets all ball The problem is you go over the side Im not sure what Smith said Were going to take another look at it Number four complains a little bit I wonder if it was what he said So it sends Derek Dixon to the line applause to shoot the technical free throws And then Carolinas going to get a one and one after this Dixon makes them both applause And heres the thing too When youre outsized and Southerntherland is outsized and hes a big fella 67 220 lbs but Vasar when hes posting up hes wide his frame is wide his legs are spread You have to move your feet quickly and its just such a difficult task when youre playing against somebody as large as Vasel Man he shoots a nice ball I Ive just been so impressed And obviously you come in you know what Caleb Wilson brings to the table You know some of these other guys Vesar I mean his role change here in Chapel Hill and his ability to function out on the perimeter I I just feel like it fits so much better here for coach Hubert Davis Hes playing everything with speed His advantage is size athleticism and the speed they allow him to play with Basar has 20 to lead the Tar Hills tonight Largest lead of the game for North Carolina after a close competitive first half They have continued to separate here in the second push there against Jaden Young ETSU trailing by 16 It has been all Tarheelss in this second half for the dindo Any great professor thats bringing in elite guest speakers to help you out Cant imagine that class is too hard Jay Oh Ive heard hes a tougher laughter Ive heard hes a tough grader Hey look I only say that cuz Tylers my guy so laughter you got to earn it No absolutely You kidding me Absolutely And giving any freebies And here his his thing was Im trying to help journalism majors understand what they can and cant ask players where the line is And he takes a lot of pride in this He really enjoys being a part of the UNCC community Thats why he keeps coming back Jaden Young is the three out of the timeout And it is all clicking for Carolina in this second half Thats something Jaden Young can do Last year at Virginia Tech had a couple of games in the high 20s Put 27 on Syracuse Streaky though I mean its hit or miss If you get him on the right night though hes got come off screens you can set up some offense for him Needs to work on his consistency level though But the talent is there Barkley playing with four fouls Two good looks and couldnt cash in Thats the type of second half it has been for ETSU Dixon fires one in transition follows his own miss Stevenson lays it off for Vasar and he muscles it up and it drops in for two applause Henry Vasar 22 points tonight to lead all scorers cheering And Carolina on a nine nothing run And Cam Morris just looks at his teammates says Guys theres not a whole lot I can do right there Right back to Morris They missed it again Besar dominating that matchup right now Transition triple off the mark cheering Thats Bogots spot He loves transition threes off the bounce and look it Do you love that shot if youre coach Huber Davis Not necessarily but you know his ability when he hits one Two or three more coming Very much a rhythm shot for Bovots And Boavots is still scoreless tonight So even though this has been a lopsided second half North Carolina outscoring ETSU 22 to9 since the break Bogavots individually has yet to get going And heres the thing too Jay Hey I played in Europe for eight years Like the Adriatic League where he comes from with SC Derby Very fundamentally sound Nice set on the baseline Very fundamentally sound very clean game very scoutheavy not as fast not as athletic So its an adjustment cheering right And he had a lot of success at that level Average over 14 points a game But the sheer speed of the college game very different than what hes come from in Montenegro Certainly the speed that Carolina wants to play at as Vasar continues to dominate Hes up to 24 They love that guard to post screen Throw it baseline 15 ft out Have the guard go and screen for the center who curls around about 8 ft Basar such a soft touch around that spot underrated guy today Jonathan Pal has played really well on the defensive end of the floor Tough call here but Jonathan Pal has disrupted this game with his work defensively away from the basketball Hes blowing up actions Hes blowing up downstream with his physicality I Im Im telling you Jay like thats a guy that the more you watch him the more you appreciate his game Safe for the basketball doesnt turn it over Really good on the defensive end Count me as a fan Wilson all over Morris as the misses continue to pile up for ETSU They missed their last six shots Its allowed North Carolina to go on an 11 nothing run Give and go Wilson to Veso Oh get in the cheering VW THIS IS THE best front court in all of college basketball Are you pointing the VW I love it By the way Joe a careerhigh Henry Vasar 26 points tonight applause cheering Oh they need some sort of nickname They certainly do What a pass though Five Carolina faithful are on their feet in what has been an outstanding second half Seven cheering straight misses now for ETSU The Tarheelss have done it with defense The transition is going WILSON WITH ONE HAND DRAWS THAT IN and puts it up for two Timeout ETSU Histically this is the best front court in college basketball But when you take a look at two players they average 35 points per game tonight Theyve got 43 outscoring ETSU as a team Even with that made three by Mai Johnson And that ends a near fiveminute scoring drought for the Buccaneers What you call him The VW Somebodys just a tshirt until somebody thinks of something better But you need something 11 games into this season Jay Alter brings the heat Print the tshirts Its a new day A Wilson and Vasar the dynamic duo in a reborn Carolina front court cheering And when they play like they have played in this second half its going to be tough to stop Smith somehow finds Barkley through traffic and he is fouled Thats James Brown committing his third foul in limited minutes Blake Barkley I love his his aggressiveness He This is a guy that could end up being an all SoCon level player Hes got good size He puts it on the deck cheering He attacks with a certain fierceness Its going to be a handful in the Southern Conference Brown whos only played four minutes tonight but he has committed three fouls As we look ahead to our final womens basketball double header of the 2025 ACC Network year hit at Notre Dame North Carolina in Chestnut Hill to take on Boston College That is December 29th right here on the ACC Network Boat still scoreless Nice crosscourt pass Wilson Shot clock ticks down to five Wilson does such a good job getting to his spots on the floor and cashing in And when you can hang in the air for 3 seconds it makes those shots a lot easier That helps laughter 19 points tonight for Wilson And outside of a tomahawk onehanded jam its been a quiet 19 if there is such a thing And heres the thing too His patience and his wherewithal Nice shot by Southern to fake the handoff Gets down on the block checks the score or not the score excuse me the shot clock Look at this Wilson going for another highlight slam and hes fouled He gets everybody out of their seat including you Yep I want to take another look at that I know its a missed dunk It might be the greatest missed dunk of all time laughter Look at this up and up there with Greg Odin and what he just tried to do Oh my gosh That is incredible Head at the rim Look at this I mean I admire the intestinal fortitude to try that He wasnt all that close but sometimes style points matter Alter you cannot teach that He came in Cant teach it but you can sure try it My only thing is Im trying it on a Nerf hoop Hes doing it on a real life 10ft goal And heres And hes doing it with people draped all over him Seven made free throws tonight And now 20 points for the freshman phenob Caleb Wilson And there have been some incredible freshman to put on the Carolina uniform and right now he leads all of them at points per game as a freshman They dont talk about Joe Forte enough I remember number 40 baggie shorts had everybody wanting to buy that jersey A lot of people talking about Caleb Wilson He was a bucket once upon a time Different player Caleb Wilson I think theres a lot of different players from Caleb Wilson I mean theres not many like him Exactly He continues to rock it up the mock traps but Huber Davis told us hes not focused at that at all He is so locked in Thats a shot clock violation laughter but Column didnt get it off in time Wave off the basket cheering Huber Davis told us that Caleb Wilson is so locked in on being present I have to talk about style points Lets go ahead and give him call him a couple laughter Hey heres the thing though James Brown Im going to give him the benefit of the doubt He didnt go out all the way after it Some athleticism on full display tonight at Chicago Nice action Oh my goodness Passing out of the double team Finds Powell for a three Missed it Hard foul of the pursuit of the rebound Cam Boris colliding with Bovots What a pass by Ken Evans to go completely crosscourt and Huber Davis told us before the game Were going to have another shot other look at this I mean you talk about all out hustle I need that ball more than you Little tangle up Nothing dirty Just couple guys playing hard But Huber Davis talked to us today about how aggressive East Tennessee State is attacking ball screens Theyre looking to cause turnovers You saw how they flooded to the basketball not just on the ball but all the help side rushes at that side of the floor for Ken Evans to be able to get that ball out of the trap Pretty impressive And Evans with six assists tonight All in the first half Its been a different half right Like second half a lot more sets called for Vasar cheering for Caleb Wilson Its been a little bit different in how this games been played Its been played at a much faster tempo after ETSU did a great job making it a half court game in the first half Brown trying to pull down the rebound He draws the foul applause James Browns been everywhere when hes been on the floor Ah yeah Exactly right And Carolina now he in the double bonus So Brown shooting two Hes got a good basketball bloodline His cousin Cory Brewer who won two national championships with the Florida Gator now coaching in the NBA from Portland Tennessee The great defensive players college basketball history Brown 0 for two from the line This game was close and competitive back and forth for 18 minutes and then Carolina found a new gear But when you think about it what changed from the way ETSU was able to hang around for most of that first half to now Carolina just keeping their foot on the gas and dominating it this second half It felt like East Tennessee State early in this second half was trying to get that eight points back quick And throughout the course of the game cheering when theyve played faster Carol its played into Carolinas hands because shots have gone up They havent been in offensive rebounding position And another thing too Jay in this second half one offensive board Stark contrast from the first half where thats where East Tennessee State was able to have some of these 40 50C possessions and take the air out of the game Another foul called to Brown at the center of it And hell shoot two when we come back Carolina a comfortable lead 7149 with under four to play College football playoff kicks off this weekend And you know Derek Dixon and his family will be watching His father John Dixon played football at James Madison in the late 80s early 90s How about the Dukes James Madison in the college football playoff taking on Oregon Was a split end Yeah split end which nowadays would probably be classified as a wide receiver but yeah listed as a split end Number 42 for JMU Obviously uh Dixon getting some minutes here Hes had a strong start to his freshman campaign Tough move cheering Good take from Brian Taylor Brian Taylor last year at SIU Edwardsville Second team all OBC can really score Uhoh Steven Z make it pay And another dunk to add to a few highlight jams tonight in the Dean Dome So two3 zone by Carolina here If youre going to trap a ball screen you better get out of the way cheering And the action behind you needs to be really good because if you dont get there quick enough you end up giving up dunks down the lane McCullum a half second short Gambles hand in a cookie jar Stevenson Its not bad You know the 2023 North Carolina Gatorade player of the year spent two years at Alabama before transferring home Stevenson and four points tonight to go along with a careerhigh four assists Coachs kid played for his dad at Seforth High School cheering All the attention on Vasar and Wilson but he adds a lot of length to this Tar Hills front court also at 610 And he can have big games If you remember a couple of years ago for Alabama they played Clemson in the Elite 8 cheering He had 20 plus in that game knocking down shots getting hot at the right time But I like his versatility Theres going to be a game where he gives Carolina 20 100 And then all the other games that he doesnt give him 20 he gives him defense at 610 Nimble athletic Theres something to be said too Ive talked to a lot of coaches around the country about guys whose parents either played in college or their parents coached them in high school The expectations of what theyre going to be like on a daytoday basis is a little bit different And coaches have applause come to appreciate that their parents just kind of let them go They let them be coached A little bit different for some of these guys I like Derek Dixon Hes a multiyear guy He knows how to play Hes got good size at the point guard position You talk about positional size 65 And you never know in the craziness of college basketball with the portal and everybody changing teams every season but you feel like cheering Derek Dixons going to be a player potentially a face of this program for the next few seasons as Caleb Wilson moves on to play professionally in the NBA Oh wow Stevenson left alone cheering Cant do that Two jams for Jiren Stevenson applause Openside pick and roll Quick advance pass with the backside wide open Thats just good offense for Carolina ETSU taking their foot off the gas a little bit defensively 38 points in the first half for Carolina 39 in the second half and theyve done it two completely different ways as this game has really opened up since halftime I think thats a big positive to you that you know pace can be multiple different phases and Carolina still finds way to score Thats absolutely right And heres the thing too Nine and one soon to be 10 and one Not all your games are going to be pretty You got to find ways to win in the mud when it slows down when it speeds up Really like what Im seeing from Carolina Conversely long distance deep three from Young and a rebound that goes off Carolina last ball with ETSU Conversely if Im Brook Savage and ETSU Im really happy how my team performed for about 25 minutes They competed on every possession They attacked the offensive glass They showed some toughness And Im Im a big fan as you are too Jay of Brook Savage as a head coach Well hes got a bright f future Oh he certainly does Went to University of Tennessee for undergrad Worked for Bruce Pearl Spent time under Steve Forbes both at ETSU and Wake Forest Really smart guy from a conference in the SoCal that seems to be the next place for high major head coaches Lamont Paris at South Carolina Steve Forest Wake Forest the bucky ball Absolutely At TexasM Bucky McMillan who was at Sanford as you see here Ed Deellis spent time at Penn State cheering Les Robinson who you know about Yeah Athletic director at North Carolina State as well in addition to being the basketball coach there You know interesting Ken Palm as ETSU favored in all their remaining games So think about Brook Savage in this team You could see them in March if they win the SoCon Theyll learn from this Theyre going to be up there Its them Its Mercer who has some real talent by the way at the guard spots Barack Oji excuse me played at Memphis last year Kyle Cuffy Jr played at Syracuse And then from talk about size for a Southern Conference team Bob Richie has put together a squad thats young in the back court given Certainly some talent This was a onepossession game with two minutes left in the first half Great pass Carolina went on a 12 nothing run Good look there from Elijah Davis Hubert Daviss son couldnt connect You enjoyed watching Hubert and Elijah before shoot around today getting some fatherson time on the court Thats how I screaming spent a lot of time with my dad I told Hubert you know I almost brought a tear to my mind My dad passed away 5 years ago and thats something we did together And sometimes its just father and son working on the jump shot together Theres something comforting in that for me And he said its the first time theyve been able to do it all season Its been a busy start to the season for Hubert Davis and he just texted him hey you shoot around at three get here at two get some father son time and now get some court time applause and cheering with North Carolina leading comfortably And it has been comfortable throughout this second half cheering Glass end it that way Carolina today Jay absolutely terrific especially that front court Front court Henry Vesar Fantastic A careerhigh 26 points to lead the way
