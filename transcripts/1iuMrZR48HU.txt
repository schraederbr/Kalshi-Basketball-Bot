the paint in the second half officials tonight Roger SS Lee Cel Tony chza Florida State looking to snap a threegame losing streak defense has been the issue in that span for The nolles Who control theyre in the black Virginia and the home white here is Watkins leading score for Florida State Taylor bu Bowen has been in a shooting slump and no Malik Yan for Florida State missing his second St great game with an ankle as Chandler Jackson got free air maluk battling for the rebound it will stay with Florida State so thats something Leonard Hamilton wanted to see a little more aggression and toughness on the glass and Florida state is a team when they score a lot of points generally is because they get some extra opportunities and Virginias got to be very careful with their blockouts Watkins measures the three mcney snags the carava starting lineups for Virginia Andrew roie the junor has been playing well in conference play averaging 10 and five McNeely had a monster game against Florida State last year with 29 and the question all season for Virginia what can they get from their bigs Day Day Ames first look no starting lineups for Florida State Ain Davis the freshman point guard he controls out of Baltimore Old Bowen entered the game in a 7 for 30 slump and air maluk making his second straight start we told you about Malik euan who this game was tailor made for him given Virginias issues against post players but again hes hes got some pain in that foot and so he cant play tonight see and those are shots Virginias going to have to make against Florida State youre not going to get very many open opportunities you got to put him down and theres the first basket AER maluk at his first career start against Duke and went scoreless in that game at 14 minutes and if youre Virginia youre going to shoot those threes if youre miss them and you get a long rebound that allows Florida State to get out and go mcneels Virginias leading score contested three is good and he shot that over maluk and maluk is 7 feet tall and he was pretty close to McNeely that was what you call a high arker B Bowen over Saunders maluk the offensive rebound Rush the shot and a foul called on Florida State they get B Bowen his first Cavaliers havent paid for it yet Anish but theyre really struggling to get the defensive rebounds its not a good rebounding team hasnt been all season now something to watch its a Virginia team weve mentioned a guy like Malik euwan could have been a Difference Maker had he been able to go Florida States got size and thats given Virginia problems all season and Florida State despite their size they switch everything and that time they double team ases we talked about the importance of as and being able to get into the lane but when you do you got to know that those seals are coming at you Ron Sanchez said Ames is their best oneonone shot Creator and when he gets the matchup its going to be on him to create for himself and his teammates McNeely with the shot clock winding down and hes got all five for Virginia you know McNeely has gotten so much better in his time at Virginia creating shots off his own dribble Watkins is fouled trying to split the double Music team mcne picks up the foul and Watkins is a guy whos always in attack hes always looking for a shot hes trying to drive the ball to the basket he goes to the free throw line a lot and you just thats a really good move to get MCN out of the game early you dont want him to get a second one quickly Cavaliers of course play that manto man and theyre so far theyre doing a pretty good job with their first shot defense their problem has been the second shot contact no call lot of Applause contact Watkins skips it to Davis hesitation blocked by Buchanan Virginia had a season High eight blocks in the loss to Clemson on Saturday Music its really hard to run any offense against Florida State because again they get after you they try to deny passes they switch everything here is roie working on Jackson All Glass seals on the offensive end have missed six of their seven two easy that time for AER maluk and its been Malo both times running the court after a tough Virginia shot if you take bad shots thats the same thing as a turnover Florida State wants to get out and run did you have maluk with all four early for Florida State absolutely thats what I Applause had T Murray as it poked Away by Watkins Jackson Virginia takes it away now this is also going to be a clash of styles and Tempo Florida State wants to push Virginia they can push but theyre usually more deliberate that time they take advantage aims the open three this a Cavalier team when they create a turnover they like to get out and go theyre not just holding the ball Watkins the tough fall away hes really good in the Applause midrange yeah thats a shot that the folks in the NBA and the anal atics people you know they poo poo a lot of great players have made careers with that midrange J and ases you mentioned him in the open hes got back to back threes thats a great start for Ames in Virginia theyre sort of leaving him alone out there the last few games against Duke in Carolina lot of open threepoint shots against Florida State Virginias one of the better threepoint shooting teams in the league 38 in conference five to shoot Watkins has to hoist and hits wow what a tough shot I dont think he can play defense any better than Ro just did yeah its two possessions in a row Dan where Watkins has had to make a tough shot if youre Virginia is that one where you say hey well take the result because we like the process well if hes going to I mean if hes going to play oneonone like that eventually the other guys are going to start standing around watching a little bit t Murray denied at The Rim which is a relatively frequent occurrence when youre trying to drive against Florida State Watkins picked up by Elijah Saunders knifing through and able to draw the foul Day Day Ames has scored in double figures in eight straight hes in the midst of his best stretch as a Cavalier and off to a good start and a late start here in Music Charlottesville got to go one and one for Florida State win tonight win Saturday against SMU in whatll be Leonard Hamiltons final home game have Clemson beat Virginia Tech as Saunders finishes on the run out or if they split they essentially would have to win then a fourway tiebreaker with Virginia Tech Virginia and pit wow its like Al Davis said just win baby just win baby thats all you can do so Im not doing any math my head is going to explode if you do that again you wisely sat that one Music Applause Music out so of course Florida State go to its bench they play a lot of guys make neing now back in the game Ames has a matchup here with young Christian NE left that one a little short Watkins he plays big minutes 30 minutes for Florida State thats a lot for a Leonard Hamilton team and finds a wide open KN to underneath points in the paint something to watch tonight Virginia has given up a 100 in its previous two games W theyve given up 10 today so all 10 points have been three dunks s two midrange Shots by Watkins in the lane so Virginia you know that you I dont know how you can win games youre giv up that many points they won against Wake Forest because they shot the ball well now wake had 52 points in the paint Clemson 48 Clemson only made 1 three and beat Virginia on Saturday aims airball on the turnaround shot clock violation see and its really tough to run your half court offense again against Florida State now they switch one through five they switch everything and you just saw a play a couple of possessions ago where NE at 7 feet tall is matched up against ases and Ne to won that battle because he forced AES to try to shoot a jump shot over him yeah that was a concern for Leonard Hamilton he told me at shoot around he said guys like NE to air Muk even though you know Florida State switches one through five those guys not as comfortable as Malik Yan now Yan is really good because he can stay with the guard that one in and out for Jerry dang who had been shooting it very well the last few games well you could argue that he shot that one very well that was all the way down before it came out yeah that ones good in Tallahasse Jacob Kofi The Freshman under 10 to shoot mcney defended by NE mcne over NE iron sides Justin Thomas nearly lost it here comes D another really good job by NE forcing a tough shot over the top they really like ns potential only a freshman and hes mismatched inside against mcne they got to thr the ball meanwhile Saunders picks up the foul on the drive by Boston Holt Music Miller oh man holy cow are you kidding heres snare on the wing on Harris snare again leads it in take the other the baseball pass Cleveland the catch good if it goes oh hit it he hit it clevel wins for in the Leonard Hamilton Tony Bennett era four Florida State buzzer beaters in this matchup Ian Miller Michael snare who had that one season where it felt like he was hitting a buzzer beater every other week had a big one against Duke and then you saw Dwayne bacon and then Matthew Cleveland most recently how close has this series been about as close as it gets well I mean theyve played 57 times and theyre separated by three points really and 23 of the 57 games have been decided by five points or less theres your reason to stay up Watkins with five KN to feathery touch little George gerin there W little George Gervin but again within two feet of the basket another paint point for Florida State poked Away by Justin Thomas hes on school number five in five seasons and if youre the Virginia Cavaliers you just cannot be loose with the basketball youve got to be very very careful youve got to be very tough Florida state is going to be flicking their hands theyre going to be coming after Music you its a SEALs team that has struggled on defense of late last three games granted the opponents were Duke Carolina and Louisville but Florida State gave up on average 95 points in those three as Virginia turns it over again you just cannot be loose with the basketball tomorrow afternoon in Greensboro its the start of the ACC womens basketball tournament presented by Ally willll have all first and second round games as well as two of the quarterfinal matchups right here on accn coverage for round one begins at 1230 Eastern with a nothing but net crew ACC Mens Basketball Tournament begins a week from Applause today to beat the shot clock no tipped around knee to the offensive rebound hes got six maluk has four the big producing early inside for Florida State with Malik you and out and they just called a technical foul and Im not sure if they called it just on jir Watkins or if they called it on jir Watkins and somebody from Music Music Virginia Roger a telling us exchanging pleasantries the reason for the double technical W Kofi for Virginia gets the technical and Watkins for Florida State and Virginias gone ice cold from the offensive end I mean they cant get inside the Florida State Defense Murray no good on the three Thomas the rebound meanwhile Christian NE tos been given Florida St some pretty good minutes oh hes giving him great Music minutes dang over Murray he gets it to go and again hes in the lane when he does that Virginia cant get it inside and thats all Florida state has been doing seals in the midst of an 80 run roie pulls up no good four black jerseys in the area for that rebound wow Virginia they dont send guys to the offensive boards even during their Glory Days they didnt rebound the ball well offensively knocked out bounds by Music Holt Roger oene territory iss going to get out the uh index card thats a catch two feet in bounds W Virginia just looking for a combination what is that combination well the combination you got to move the ball and you got to get it inside that Florida State Defense and like I say thats hard because they deny passing Lanes so somebodys got to be able to put it on the deck to get it past somebody now Ron Sanchez said for that was looking at DayDay Ames whos got the ball and beats his man he also mentioned Andrew roie well that time he didnt pull up and try to shoot over KN to again in the paint for Florida State its Boston Holt and another technical foul this ones called on Justin Thomas I think number three froma state auson H ass the techical foul its Holt okay I thought they called it on Justin he was Justin Thomas Im sorry Thomas number 25 was the closest guy to the referee but they called it on Holt according to the announcement from the PA Applause system so its a technical foul anybody can shoot it and Day Day Ames 78 free throw shooter he goes to the line misses the first one he gets one out of two so on the technical you shoot the technicals and then you pick up where you left off and where you left off was Virginia taking the ball inbounds yeah so you never know Virginia in a cold spell sometimes its those kind of plays which get you back into the game now some pressure by Florida State AJ Swinton 19 and black in the game for Florida State young man from Cabin John Maryland little more than two hours from Charlottesville roie the three from outside 41 threepoint shooter and that was again you move the ball you force the defense back you create an open three and Andrew Roy Boy his numbers all across the board have increased this year over last Applause year Thomas basine duanan got a p and maluk there for the putb maluk and Ne to have stepped up big time in this opening half W with Second Chance opportunities thats thats been a killer so far for the Cavaliers yeah those two were combining for a little more than four points per game Ro another three and this has been a problem for Florida State in their recent games they lose three point shooter and Swinton with his ninth three of the Season young man with Virginia ties grandfather and cousin attended UVA AJ grew up on ACC basketball had this game circled on his calendar for a long time theres roie again he scored eight straight for Virginia has a nice job if Florida States going to deny that back door cut will be open good pass by Buchanan Leonard Hamilton has a line change at the scores table hes goty it does that all the time Thomas looking for maluk roie got a piece of it Andrew roie has a reenergized the Music whoos and this has been a very interesting game two different modes of attack Florida State getting inside theyve scored 20 points in the lane are 11 for 17 on twopoint shots and the Cavaliers theyve been getting it done from outside theyve made five of nine threepoint basket so a 14 plus 14 advantage on the inside 20 to6 for Florida State plus 12 on the outside for the Virginia Cavaliers from three but in ACC play Ron Sanchezs team scores 39 of its points from outside the arc Florida state only gets 25 of it points from out there they get 54 of their points from twopoint range both teams playing to their strengths early in this Applause game Buchanan looked like maluk got a piece if youre going to take it like yanan just did you got to take it to the basket you cant fade away at the last second and BR Virginia they just they just cant grab the offense the defensive rebounds Florida state has four offensive rebounds thatll be credited as five now for the seminal and this is a team that doesnt really shoot the ball so well you cant be given them extra opportunities and Florida State especially of late in this threegame losing streak theyve had their issues on the glass but not tonight well theyve shot the all very well in the last three games their problem have been defensively Davis beats the shot clock too strong another offensive rebound B Bowen will go to the free throw line well thats just not blocking out right there Bowen was all the way beyond the threepoint line and just ran to the basket and nobody blocked him out the foul on The Talented red shirt freshman Anthony Robinson he came back Saturday against Clemson after missing the weight game with a foot injury and hes become a key rotation piece in League Play The nothing but net crew will be in Greensboro for the allly ACC womens tournament starting tomorrow here on accn pregame halftime postgame shows throughout the tourney providing previews highlights analysis and game breakdowns Music Applause now Virginia has had its struggles on the defensive end so theyve got to make sure that their Stay Stay sharp on the offensive Applause end ases has nine roie with eight mcney shot fake three no good rebound Watkins Davis did a really good job hanging in on that Jackson not a threepoint shooter Watkins thought about it on the drive through the contact tipped around another offensive rebound thats Music six Robinson picked up Watkins Watkins lost his Defender and then Applause missed Florida State just one of eight from three and Robinson is fouled thats probably good foul Robinson catches the ball close to the basket but he sort of stumbles and then he gets fouled after the stumble I I dont know that he was going to score that basket because he was off balance on the catch first foul on Chandler Jackson teams fourth Applause Ro on the Drive Ames with five down lad to Saunders doubl extra pass Robinson no that was Tipp from behind and its a shot clock violation wow Florida State they we weve talked about their quickness we talked about how big they are and theyre going to look at this to see if it hit the Applause rim pass gets I dont know if the ball ever under four media timeout were going to review the last possession ball never got never got close to the rim after review this crew got one right well a little humor there so the call on the court stands it is a shot clock violation and we step aside here at jpj Music Music Applause as six straight making a case and they can really make a case Saturday when UNC plays Duke thats a win if Carolina can get it easier said than done the way Duke has been playing lately that would put them into Joe lardys projected field going in to the ACC tournament thats a tough way to get there though Duke meanwhile has won seven in a row by an average Dan of more than 30 points per game Applause but they have been dominant and their last seven wins have come by 21 36 18 43 against Illinois 3735 and yeah then beat wake by 30 on Monday in a game that was hugely important for the DS we got a whistle down low youve been around this league a long time and I understand this league is down a little bit can you remember a team in conference being as consistently dominant the way Duke has this year not no not winning games like that now there have been some excellent teams you go back to 7374 when there were only seven teams in the league and that really really talented teams but North Carolina State won all the G won all the conference games for two years in a row so even though the games werent uh you know as the margins werent that great that was a dominant team yeah that David Thompson guy was okay well and it was one of the best Maryland had one of the best teams in the AC in the history of the ACC but they just happened to play in the at the same time as that NC State team and there was the year in there right NC State didnt even go to the NCAA tournament they went to the NIT well there was a a little bit of recruiting uh Kur fluffle about David Thompson Applause 243 left first half Virginias missed its last five Florida state has missed its last six as Sunday its the ACC wrestling championship it takes place at Cameron indor coverage of the finals begins at 8 Eastern right here on accn both teams have gone cold offensively Ames puts it on the floor against NE to back out to mcne with five mcney Quirk screws inside Kofi Baseline Jay in and out and a foul on the battle for the offensive rebound Saunders picks up his Music Applause Music Applause second Virginia in 2018 that was a a dominant ACC team went on to win the ACC tournament and and we know what happened in the NCAA tournament but they got they got even next year 2019 Tony Bennett delivering that National Championship Justin Thomas line drives a three now Thomas hes a little streaky from out there but he can make that three thats only the second threepoint back basket by Florida State tonight but the Cavaliers theyve got to be careful they got to keep scoring the ball because if they dont Florida States going to pull Applause away mcney puts it on the floor Fades away Buchanan tips it comes back to roie Fresh 20 again tough shots for Virginia theyre close to the basket but theyre difficult shots you brought it up early the challenge for Virginia who wins that oneonone matchup W so far Florida state is winning the oneonone matchups Virginia having a very difficult time getting by anybody and that time Andrew roie knew what Blake Buchanan should do but Blake Buchanan didnt and so the balls out of bounds we will step aside with a minute 33 to go in the opening half Florida State up by four on the road Music welcome back to ACC Network basketball presented by tro price Denise shro Dan boner of Virginia in the first half Dan five of 11 from three four for 14 from two well the Cavaliers they they struggled with their defensive rebounding a little bit but still their defense has been good enough to hold this Florida State team to 28 points Cavaliers their problem has been on offense theyve had two scoring droughts of more than four minutes Watkins to Thomas back to Watkins just two for seven shooting in the first half theres daquin Davis last seven games more turnovers than assists shot clock trickling down Watkins lets it Fly too strong theyre going get a foul on to yeah he pushed off trying to get that Music rebound no Malik Y and he is Florida States second leading scorer he leads the ACC and field goal percentage injured his ankle in the North Carolina game did not play against Duke over the weekend and now out again today but given the way Neu and maluk have played in his place they have missed him at all roie over knee to and one one of the things you have to be when youre playing against this Florida State Defense is tough and that this is just a tough move by Andrew roie he cant get by KN too but he does that little pivot in the lane and just hangs in there against the contact that is a basket that Virginia desperately Music needed 11 for Roy he leads all scores Applause Davis trying to split the D fell down wants help jump ball possession arrow to Florida State well they spread the court and they were that was Daviss job is to split that defense and create you know the whole time that was going on uh jir Watkins was standing over in the corner practicing his threepoint stroke so I think that was the play but he tripped and fell down seven on the shot clock on the Baseline inbounds Watkins back to Davis Davis has to put it up almost walked might have walked theyre going to wave that off sixth turnover by the nolles Im actually surprised Watkins gave the ball up with so little time left on the shot clock timeout Virginia down one Music onepoint game Virginia ball 142 seconds to go and neither team has been consistent in this opening half roie though has been the bright spot he has been the aggressor for Virginia and hes been rewarded for it yeah he sure has and that he made the oldfashioned threepoint play in Virginia they stayed in the game early with threepoint baskets but Florida state has shut that off here toward the end of the first half close games have been the trademark of this matchup between Florida State and Virginia final second is opening roie has got 11 hoists it up left it way short and thats how the opening half comes to an end 57 previous meetings between these Applause two Ames thought about it Ro along three front rim comes back to Ames New 20 and they got a mismatch inside with Buchanan if they can find him hes matched up on dayquon Davis whos 61 one and they find the mismatch that is a great play by McNeely no Malik Yuan Florida States second leading scorer and the accs leader and field goal percentage missing a second straight game with an ankle injury air Malo got the start inside at Center hes out there 21 in black Christian NE to backup center six points off the bench in the first half so Florida state was able to absorb the loss of yan their two unproven centers accounted for 12 in the opening half and theyre also able to absorb the fact that Watkins only scored four points in the first half only two of eight from the field roie had 11 in the opening half back inside Buchanan followed his shot and then a foul and Dan Florida State as theyve done under Leonard Hamilton they switch every matchup one through five thats one where Virginia might be able to take advantage if youre going to have dayquon Davis or Chandler Jackson on Buchanan and obviously the first two plays coming out of the locker room at halftime theyve done that so clearly the Cavaliers talked about that at halftime Buchanan has to finish that one inside when you get your big guy that close to the basket he has got to finish for you and Jackson just picked up his third third he goes to the bench Day Day aims the pretty turnaround that is a tough tough shot thats the way he started the game though hes got 11 most of those coming very Applause early b Bowen taquin Davis now one down he was 0 for four from the field in the opening half and in conference play hes only a 26 shooter from Beyond The Arc so if youre Virginia youd like to be a little closer to him but if hes going to shoot that I think thats okay Florida state has hit its last two from three after starting one for eight ases and Ro have done the heavy lifting offensively for UVA McNeely their leading score has been quiet and he couldnt get anywhere against maluk now Malo knocked it out of bounds and so Virginia have 13 Applause seconds Ames catch and shoot got it I want to know what happened right there its like Florida state was surprised that they threw the ball in bounds boy thats a serious breakdown by the seminar Watkins at the other end out of bounds to Virginia boy that was a strange looking Play Everybodys standing there the official hands the ball to the Cavaliers and they just throw it in Ames is standing there I hand it to him nobodys paying attention to him 14 points to lead all scores for am and thats his third threepoint basket now Florida State defensively has had a lot of lapses the last few games like see now you have that mismatch its Davis against Saunders Ames to roie open and casau thats what day day Ames can do so well the defense surrounded him inside and that left roie all alone Watkins Corner three hes had a rough night jump ball it stays with Florida State sixpoint lead for Virginia the largest for the whoos and that that wasnt a situation where you know Florida state did a great job battling on the boards that ball went right into the hands of mnelia bounced out of his hands bounced off Saunders foot meanwhile Watkins now two for 10 0 for four four from three here he is Florida States leading scorer make it two for 11 thats a pretty good Applause Music Applause defense entry pass dangerous pass Saunders out to mcne lines it up left it a bit short offensive rebound Saunders Applause Buchanan to Saunders FL from behind and well get a foul looks like theyre going to get Watkins its his second a 60 run by Music Virginia about the importance of dday ases and his penetration ability against this tough Flor to State Defense now thats a tough shot and here they just forget about him hes had the threepoint stroke going tonight three out of four but heres what were talking about you penetrate you find the open man and Ames and roie have combined for 28 points Ames has been on a heater his previous eight games 15 points per 58 from the field 40 from three hes now scored in double figures in nine straight simply put its been his best stretch of basketball in a Cavalier uniform Virginia with its largest lead of the game at seven well Florida States got to get the mall Ball moving a little bit little too much dribbling by the simers but this is a nice job going side to side moving the defense around Jerry dang whos had a couple of nice games against Duke in Carolina hes been quiet so far Watkins shot clock at four Watkins contested hits the jumper you weve said it all of Watkins field goals tonight now hes had a really work for him well he has but hes a guy who can make tough shots and at the end of the shot clock hes the guy whos going to have the ball that wasnt bad defense though Buchanan to Ames blocked by Thomas saves it Saunders lets it Fly put that in the playb dang walked wow Den is going to be charged with the turnover there but that was the fault of Boston Holt youre the point guard you dont throw it back to your big guy a blocked shot really nice job somehow Ames keeps his balance thats when things are going well for you your guyss falling down out of bounds everybodys after the ball nobodys with Saunders not really a nice job keeping his feet by Applause ases Cavaliers can open a double digit lead Applause here Virginia eight of 17 from three ases is Applause 14 working late in the shot clock roie on watch lost it and a shot clock violation you know roie came off the screen and he had an opening and at the end of the shot clock you need to shoot that three youre not going to get a better shot driving into the middle of that Florida State Applause Music Applause Defense Watkins knocks down triple his first three of the game hes up to nine he was two for 11 and hes made his last two shots including that three and here we are in a situation where Virginia cant afford another one of those scoring drivs they have two in the first half totaling 11 minutes this is a very big Florida State lineup in the game at the moment one of the tallest teams in the country and another turnover by UVA again I just dont think driving the ball to the basket against that size late in the shot clock is a good formula for the Cavaliers Watkins starting to heat up dang shot fake launches Saunders Corrals good block out by mcel and Saunders that Applause Music time see with the size that Florida state has in the game theres very little chance to have a mismatch on the inside that the Cavaliers exploited earlier in the half its been Leonard Hamiltons adjustment Buchanan cutting to the rim thats a really good back door cut sophomore out of Quarter Lane Idaho KN to has threepoint potential is not hit one this year Thomas down low deposit slip and Music Applause Music one he just takes the ball to the basket I mean this strictly oneonone basketball the Cavaliers cant get anybody over to help Music Applause Music so after a cold spell the Florida state offense has gotten rejuvenated here Thomas and started with Watkins and now Justin Thomas only a 59 free throw shooter he was essentially I guess traded for Primo Spears in the off season Spears transferred over to UTSA after a year with Florida State and Thomas from UTSA to Tallahassee Watkins offensive rebound and another foul on Virginia its going to be Saunders not able to block out and Saunders he I mean he really took a shot thats going to be number three on Music Saunders so Saunders is going to get in here wow they just showed the replay as Saunders took the hit and now looks like they may go to the monitor Applause here Roger As Lee Cassel Tony chazza huddling Applause up we are currently at the Under 12 media timeout were going to going to review the previous Applause play well step Music Music aside e e he looked to be in a cylinder wow he he looked like he was right on top of him yeah e e Music now 4338 Virginia leading Florida State Applause Music fou all right so Lee celle explaining the verdict from the officials after looking at the play well look at it one more time with d well they have called a defensive foul right there as Saunders sticks that we aoul UVA number zero number two Im sorry Florida state will be shooting two shots once were done there UVA is going to shoot two shots number zero on and then you be able to get the ball on the Baseline with 30 seconds on the shot clock so they called a double foul the defensive foul sticks but then they call this is a this is basically a flagrant foul while the while the ball is dead as soon as that foul is called the balls dead and so thats a dead ball Technic the foul for that elbow in the face so Watkins of course hes going to go and hes going to shoot two free throws and then Saunders is going to shoot two free throws and then Virginia is going to get the ball at the Florida state J wat and they are looking at Saunders on the Virginia bench have one has to shoot not so one out of two for Watkins and now with a Saunders bleed in on the sideline hes not in the game so Virginia can pick its free throw shooter W if if the guy if the guy cant shoot it then usually the coach of the other team can pick from somebody on the floor but in this case if its a flagrant foul or if the guy is bleeding and thats the reason he cant shoot and in this case its both of them then Ron Sanchez can pick anybody and so he picks one of his best free throw Sho McNeely 90 in conference this is what were talking about if after a player injury if the player cant shoot the opposing coach chooses which player on the floor shoots the ball however if its the players bleeding or its a flagrant foul and in this case it was both then thats why McNeil is able to shoot the Applause ball theres a lot going on there is a lot going on you want to go through tie break scenarios now no were not doing that Applause mcne to Kofi The Freshman from Seattle back out to Applause mcney Murray down the lane Kofi the corner three in and out rebound to snag by dang thats a good job by Murray to get in the lane there Kofi though is only a 23 threepoint shooter in conference play and there he picks up a foul thats his second but this again an this is a typical Florida State Virginia game theres its physical its intense the offense struggles because the defense is really Applause good now Leonard Hamilton told me a shoot around today he feels his team still has fight left a Boston Holt missed the bunny its going to stay with Florida State now Leonard Hamilton this weekend when Florida State concludes its regular season hes going to get quite the send off thats going to be an emotional game for Florida State for Leonard Hamilton of course hes stepping down at seasons end one of the most accomplished head coaches in the long history of this great conference and one of the nicest people I mean hes one of those coaches hes always kind to to you hes always patient hell take time with you hes devoted to his players particularly hes devoted to his players getting an education another official review they checking to see if Virginia ever had possession of that ball cuz the shot clock is at 29 from a player standpoint when you have all these stoppages and interruptions does that disrupt your Rhythm through the course of a game not in a game like this your rhythm is disrupted the whole time and so the shot clock reset to 30 but it is only reset to 20 and so now its 19 so we can play again no this game has been nothing but Applause disruption Watkins from inside not there you know if you were running up and down and the game had great flow then yes but not this game fair Applause point and we get another foul mcne got tangled with d and d is claiming that McNeely was the one who caused the entanglement now Florida State in this threegame losing streak one of its problems has been Music fouling now last couple of opponents gone to the free throw line at an alarming rate mcney with five bounce pass and thats a kick ball on a fresh 20 that is a break for Virginia cuz that play was going nowhere you know MCN is the guy we talked about the fact that hes better off the dribble but its hard for him to create space against taller guys on the dribble to get his shot off he only has the seven points today mcneel roie open as Music Applause fires hols three knocked out of bounds by McNeely and early in the game Virginia had problems claiming the defensive rebounds and now here they are again but that that you got to get that rebound Boston holdt is now 0 for 10 in ACC play from the threepoint line only 29 on the season Watkins in double figures he has 10 he scored at least 20 being three straight off the maluk screen Watkins with some soft touch like a dead cat bounce well again Virginia cant get the defensive rebound and Florida State makes him pay tipped away Thomas the steel Murray got a piece at the rim and we get a foul and that fouls on Watkins foul Onida States Watkins thir Watkins Watkins is a guy whos looking for his shot and that ball Just Hits on the flange and dies but this is a guy who looks for his shots he can really Music score 13 points for Watkins seven rebounds three assists Ames and roie with 14 to lead Virginia Ames amongst the trees McNeely hes had a tough night shooting it two for nine now one for six from three Well normally that would be a play you want ases draws the defense you get it to McNeely for a three but that one hit the side of the board Tang green lights off the window no great block out by Kofi Taylor B Bowen getting ready to check in for Florida State and this one turned over thats just a bad pass by Roy its been a game where both teams have had openings to take control and neither has really shown that it can W Virginia was chugging along there early in the second half on offense but now theyre now theyre in another one of their droughts and their Saunders changing jerseys because he had blood all over his other one hes got the big BandAid on his chin he was wearing number two its the uh the Jefferson right that was the 2 bill now hes a a Double Nickel theres Davis B Bowen not close boy hes been in a bad shooting slump but Watkins cleans up hes got 15 this is this is a repeat of the first half Virginia cant get a defensive rebound suddenly and the way they started the second half they were doing a great job on the defensive cours a onepoint game we get another foul its on KNE to his third a Florida State in its previous three games watched its opponents shoot 34 31 and 34 free throws and the foul starting to pile up 16 fouls Applause now one more and Virginia in in the bonus yanan backing down Neu poked away stolen away Davis hits the turbo NE to the follow hes got a career high eight and Florida State takes the lead on another offensive Applause rebound two ties 10 lead changes tonight but you can and you cant have guy in the middle of that Florida State Defense you cant have your big guy dribbling the ball as much as Buchanan just did mcney puts it on the floor in and out theres Thomas Florida State wants to run thats when theyre at their best when they can get out and go and their defense has been forcing Virginia into tough shots and turnovers NS up 134 run this one coming back the other way ases all the way beats Watkins who did not want to pick up the four absolutely and that is a really good job by Ames to attack the basket no Malik Y tonight but the backup bigs have stepped up Christian Neu a career high eight points and on cleanup duties Music three teams in the projected field Duke Clemson and Louisville and Virginia comes out in a Zone very active Zone B Bowen puts it in the air and he hits he had been in a seven for 34 shooting slump prior to that and we get another whistle a timeout with 659 B Bowens three as Florida State back on Music top e Music he Music take Applause and now for tonights experts at work brought to you by principal jir Watkins has picked it up in the second half well hes hit four of his last five shots two of them threepointers hes got a couple of rebounds this is a guy who scored 20 or more in three straight games and even though he got started slowly hes always a threat to explode and hes one of the big reasons why the seminal have dumped to this twopoint lead s minutes to go in regulation both of these teams trying to climb into the top nine in the ACC that comes with a first round by in next weeks Conference tournament Ro out a big first half turned away now this Florida State team they got a lot of size I think that was the smallest guy though dayin Davis who may have blocked it well if that is thats Daviss third block tonight Saunders its the three Virginia takes the lead well that is a big basket by Saunders particularly given the fact that mcne is really struggling tonight two for 10 overall one for six from behind the arc Florida State defending him very effectively Saunders makes a couple more he may change his number Applause permanently wearing 55 instead of two after getting blood on the other Jersey Buchanan the foul you know sometimes you think boy was that really a foul but you that time you think what is he Applause doing Davis too strong New Canon grab thats a really good job by roie he tipped it away from a Florida State player in the middle and allowed Buchanan to get that Applause rebound where they got Buchanan inside against Davis again they didnt see him now they switch roie jump stop rebound Bowen really good defense that time by Florida the Music state Davis The Freshman from Baltimore fellow freshman need Applause to meu doubled needs help throws it away freshman mistake were excited about our next gymnastics meet on accn Monday at 5 Eastern all part of the Elevate the stage quad meet Cal and North Carolina as well as Alabama and Michigan State all square off Virginia would really like to get Isaac mcney going on the offensive end two for 10 one for six from three seven points hes their leading scorer on the season Ames accelerates Buchan the foul missed it again your big guy inside has to convert that one maluk saves it Thomas blocked by Buchanan muks follow rims out TI back to Davis cres 20 15 offensive rebounds now for Florida Applause State Watkins driving on Ames shot clock at three Watkins doubled Davis the three and he gives Florida State the lead back in fourth we go but it all goes back to Virginias inability to get the a defensive rebound 14 lead changes two ties tonight par for the course when these two play Applause see maluk does a nice job staying in front of McNeil here C in trouble with the catch Florida state has numbers Watkins machetes inside and able to draw the foul its on McNeely and thats his Applause second ACC mens basketball is presented by tro price invest with confidence Music Applause Miller holy cow are you kidding heres snare on the wing on Harris snare again leads it in take on the other end the baseball pass Cleveland the catch good if it goes he hit it Matthew Cleveland wins it for the thats just in the Leonard Hamilton Tony Bennett era you know Ron Sanchez getting introduced to Florida State Virginia it kind of feels like were heading down that road tonight well it really does and Watkins this is only his third trip to the free throw line for his third attempt from the free throw on his second trip but points have been hard to come by for each team now Tony Bennett in the building he was visiting with Leonard Hamilton before the game coach Hams final game that hell coach here at jpj you think about it you know Tony Bennetts Peak at Virginia kind of coincided with Leonard Hamiltons best teams in Florida State well the teams always play really really tough games and we have another one here tonight I this is I think almost the way this game is going a must score situation for Virginia down by three Cavaliers have hit nine threes tonight Ames Retreats what a great job by maluk roie launches front rim maluk the rebound Applause maluk did such a great job keeping ases in front of him Florida state has not led by more than three tonight Davis too much tipped and Buchanon secures Saunders for the tie 5353 how about that Virginia in transition with a long threepoint shot now Ron Sanchez said when they had opportunities in transition against Florida State they couldnt afford to be patient maluk wide open and again elapsed by that interior Virginia Defense well they try to jump out on that screen like they always do and then they just didnt get back in time thats a great Music Applause Music pass against Bowen and maluk is guarding mcne and mcney looks totally out of sorts mcne drives and beats maluk maybe not as out of sorts as I thought hes up to Applause nine time out Florida State Music Applause yeah weve had weve had periods in this game where nobody can score but then all of a sudden the offense gets going this is just a great catch and shoot three in transition that tied the game and then what a pass here off the dribble by Watkins finds maluk all alone and then mcne who has struggled all game this is a really tough drive against that Florida State Defense maluk and Christian NE to tonight have combined for 16 points and seven rebounds theyre playing more minutes with Malik you went out again due to the ankle you and the teams second leading scorer came in averaging about 14 and8 so uh credit to NE to credit to maluk and then for Virginia Elijah Sanders has come alive in the second half Virginia has really needed that because Ames and roie have been quiet at through stretches of this second half tied at 55 58th meeting all time between these two the first 57 decided by a total of three points Davis catch release to much and Virginia with a chance to retake the lead again with the shot clock running down you expect Watkins to keep the ball Davis again hes only a 26 threepoint shooter in conference play Im not sure thats the play Leonard Hamilton wanted Ames has 16 to lead the Cavaliers with five with four yanan Roy falling away go s depy for Andrew Applause Music Ry this is not the way Virginia Drew this up you Canan fumbles the ball thats a pretty poor pass Ros lucky to catch it but then wow he throws it in what a big Music basket I mean it looked like Ro was just trying not to fall down we showed all those buzzer beaters there was a theme it was all Florida State Virginia is thinking hey its about time we get one of ours and roie comes up with a huge three hes got 17 tonight thats a season high in points four threepointers ties the season Music High round Roy handling the ball hasnt been perfect tonight but hes been tough enough against this Florida State Defense and as we said weve had periods where looks like the offenses are clicking then nobody can score weve had scoring droughts by each team Virginia has really struggled to get defensive rebounds but here because of their threepoint shooting and some toughness over the last couple of minutes they have vaulted into the lead now for Florida State on this particular possession you expect whatever theyre doing to go through Watkins you remember B Bowen is a guy who can hit a three so if Watkins can create something then Bowen is a guy who can get open the five on the floor for Leonard Hamilton Taylor B Bowen Watkins dayquan Davis Justin Thomas and air Muk Ro Saunders mcney Ames and Buchanan for Ron Sanchez plenty of time on the shot clock Watkins deep three air ball Florida State saying that it was touch as Stan Jones was pleading that the ball was tipped I you know Stan is closer to it than we were but I didnt think that ball was tipped Leonard Hamilton calls a timeout one remaining for Florida State Virginias got a timeout another Music look I dont think that ball was Music tipped look how far back behind the threepoint line Watkins is on a a step back jump shot Watkins is a good threepoint shooter but thats just really a tough Applause shot and pretty good job by Saunders to keep Watkins in front of them and force that step Music back now P Florida State you dont have to foul no you dont have to foul but you want to get as much pressure as you can next foul by Florida state would put Virginia in the bonus Applause Music thats the first thing Virginia has to do is get it across the 10 second one Saunders needs help and Ron Sanchez uses his final timeout 12 on the shot clock 23 on the game clock we remind you the nothing but net crew will be in Greensboro for the Ally ACC womens t starting tomorrow right here on acc and theyll also join us after the game for a recap of the night in the ACC so busy week for the nothing but net crew well now your Florida State and youve taken the shot clock down to 12 seconds without fouling you dont expect them to foul now Virginias got the ball on the side its Florida State can really put a lot of pressure on so the Virginia any time outs so they have to get the ball inbound and remember there was a play in the first half Virginia was inbounding underneath with a second on the shot clock and Florida State fell asleep with the wheel defensively ended up with a DayDay ases Corner three he was left alone but if this the timeout situation may be important because Virginia has none and so theyre not going to have the option if they cant get it in bounds they cant call a timeout so somebody has to get open Ro to inbound hes got to throw it Saunders able to Corral thats some catch a shot clock running down Road turns it over Watkins wide open up ahead dunks it home its a onepoint game 118 seconds to go Leonard Hamilton calls time to set up his defense well and his defense did what you wanted to do he like that steel earlier in the clock but what happened was Virginia had such pressure on him trying to throw the ball inbounds they looked a little discombobulated from the time it came inbound so Dan now if youre Florida state do you foul right away or are you playing for early steel and then foul if you dont get it well I dont think you foul right away uh I mean theyve done such a nice job with the defensive pressure and again Virginia has no timeout so they can force one of the other things they can do is try to force a 5sec violation now Virginia can run the Baseline because it was a made basket now that was Florida States last timeout but I think what you do in this situation is you try to get one or two traps and then you go ahead and you commit the foul now interestingly enough if Virginia had a timeout and they dont but if they did have a timeout they could get the ball in bounds and keep it in in the back court call that timeout and then get another 10 seconds so Virginia not having a timeout sort of changes the strategy here 58th meeting all time and Virginia leads the alltime series and in total points three more than Florida State entering tonight it is a onepoint game in the Hamilton Bennett era there have been four memorable late game almost buzzer beating shots all in favor of Florida State and do Virginia hold on here and if they do they going to have to get the ball inbounds first as you said against this Florida State Defense mcel to inbound they get it to Ames theres the Trap foul not coming lot of seconds running off and now Davis crashes into our broadcast table committing the foul on ases a lot of time ran off the clock there and DayDay Ames who is an 82 free throw shooter to the free throw line well hes an 82 free throw shooter and hes only one for two today not many trips to the free throw line so these are obviously big free throws see when youre fing at the end of the game like that you have to be really careful that you make a play on the ball and its one onone Music all right if he makes this do you foul if you Virginia up three well I wouldnt Florida state is not a good threepoint shooting team you defend the Music three threepoint game 61 to go nobody has any timeouts Here Comes Watkins and he is fouled by roie Virginia had a foul to Music give now the interesting thing is if Virginia fouls here and puts them on the line its a one andone yeah but remember the Cavaliers have given up 16 offensive rebounds to Florida State neither team is any timeouts do we get more late game heroics in this matchup offensive foul on dang well we do get late game heroics and its from Isaac mcne on the defensive there wow mcney steps in front and he just pushes him you know I think if the arms stay in then its not an offensive foul roie on the run out knocked Away by Davis 710 of a second left and all Virginia has to do is inbound Applause it so Florida state with the ball down three before the ball inbounded an illegal screen offensive foul thats the ball game Virginia holds on so now the Cavaliers go
