pit that was in the same week so hes really elevated his profile to what many believe is a guy playing better than anybody in the country right now as Boston College wins the opening tip and we are underway Eric kti Forum Joshua Beetle coming in averaging about seven points a game backing it out here Deon Brown at 63 and a touch here for Jad venning the 69 product trying to get a shot in the air shock lock down to three on the reverse nicely done and the perfect start for Boston College not only because they get a bucket but more importantly they dont allow Duke to get out in transition proor canle James flag and malok the starting lineup here for John Shire tonight flag with his first touch off the window for two and hes Off to the Races and when you consider McFarland being in the starting lineup that gives coopa flag a size advantage over the defender trying to defend him mcfaller off 64 Cooper 69 once he gets to his spots hes going to be able to elevate over the top Boston College at 9 and8 theyre just one and five in the ACC Beetle dumping it downstairs preventing and thatll roll off the iron gets it back and he has two more and Benning off to a great start as well you can see Earl Grant wants to feature his big fella and they feel as though they can have an advantage going inside against malok Boston college with a new mix theyve got three freshman and four transfers so a lot of new faces this year it has not quite clicked yet Proctor gives it up Mala watch will air mail that one from the corner and BC wants to push the tempo and has it blocked High out of the sky and Duke with a great Collective effort defensively yeah malawa is doing the job running the floor taking away that opportunity proor got to looking drains a triple Im not sure you can celebrate by going off glass from that angle however Tyrese brocker in this hostile environment makes sure to celebrate and let everyone know hes a rock hes making 41 beyond the threepoint line for the Blue Devils as a team they hit 38 hand off for Han Jr comes in at 15 and seven rebounds a game this is 65 guard again Bening with a touch and two more and I believe thats something were going to see a steady diet of Chad Benning throughout this evening they feel as though he has a advantage against malawat malawat out on the perimeter having a hard time keeping bending in front so in the early minutes anyway BC sticking with Duke going inside to the 69 Ving to grad from Brooklyn flag will miss fireing close Malo has it stripped and Eagles Come Away with a loose ball as brown will push the tempo heres Beetle to gr transfer from Clemson to set it up from the Applause logo working on James McFarland outside the three heres hand to launch he got it for threepoint Applause L now BC off to a spirited start here tonight and a lot of it has to do with this environment the best crowd theyve had all year and the guys paying him all for that malok will slam it down nearly lost it nearly rolled right out of his hands but he held on and crushed the dunk malawat grimacing a little bit on the way back Im not sure if its fatigue or if he injured something but you can tell hes expended a lot of energy early not only trying to defend Benning but a big bucket for him on the other end Beetle trying to take the corner nothing there for him he loses the dribble and and Junior top scorer at a 29point game against parley Dickinson earlier this season so he can be very explosive yeah the first time a fatherson combo ACC player of the week my little bro Donald H senior in the building watching junor get to work against the Blue Devil flag trying to make a move has it knocked Applause away up top long range proor got a good look rebound Pops to be Sav and with malaaz down youre going to have have numbers these are opportunities you got to take advantage of nifty drive there by Joshua being right past flag but I love the recognition by pet once he saw Marat go down he knew Duke would not be able to get back and match up attacks Cooper flag and gets the easy layup Duke the countrys only team scoring at least 80 points a game holding their opponents to 60 kipa will drive nearly gave that one away Proctor will swing for flag in a triple there for him and if youre Earl Grant you couldnt have stripted a better start than what youre seeing here in the first five minutes of this game not only are they leading but theyre getting the basketball and the shots that they want to get and with another long one too strong this time well Earl Grant has done some damage in the ACC tournament twice surprising the field by playing into the quarterfinal round O pulla pop and knocked down sweet Touch by Proctor and you see Tyrese Proctor who has been in many difficult environments throughout his three years with the Blue Devils is well prepared to take on what hes seeing tonight from K for he did not score in that big victory over Miami came up with no points in about 20 minutes Brown up high with flag on Applause him Brown looking to penetrate shut down again nice back door move for two just a smart play by Josh Beetle not available in the corner so cuts to the basket gives Brown an option and then the reverse layup to boost the lead to four for the Eagles 139 Boston College as the crowd is backing them in a big way flag will get hit he took the foul hit by McFarland 1348 to go in front of this great crowd here in kante for the Eagles couldnt have asked for a better start DJ Han knocking down the three ball and then Josh Beetle making himself available the reverse to give the Blue Devils forgive me the Eagles the Applause Music lead e matchs against Syracuse and Notre all right BC lets have some fun tonight how feel my name is iname host lets take things off by going to you it is time for our 42 North Dental dont smile Camp the rules are simple if you see yourself on that Big video board you can do anything except for smile all right lets see how we do for you tonight lets go up there and find out all right boys hard everything you guys look like youre having fun statistically through the roof statistics but in consideration for ACC most improved player as well so Duke at the line Duke before this they been trailing by four points for the first time in nine games yeah they go back to December 8th against Louisville the last time they were even that far behind and now 1311 Chaz Kelly in running the point now for Earl grants Eagles thrilled with their start MC Farley getting into the starting lineup Applause tonight Kellys been struggling beyond the threepoint line gives that one up for brown brown inside Hastings will will drop it in the 69ine freshman and thats been the recipe for success for the Eagles in this game get the basketball inside the points in the paint are absolutely to their advantage six points already for Bing and then Hastings comes in and has immediate impact the two bigs the kick for flag hell take it hard to the paint the reverse and no so did everything except hit the shots surprise Cooper didnt try to dump that one went with the Finesse on that possession probably would have been better served to try to finish it with a little more aggressive on the drive Kelly a wild shot and for his Z Miss couldnt get it and numbers for the blue doubles GLE blocked Hastings got up high heres flag at 69 and He will draw the foul and hit by Dion Brown the 63 junr picks up his first and Obi you have to only imagine the nerves Cooper flag of course playing in front of so many of his family and friends the entire state of Maine might be in this building tonight but more importantly for his teammates as well understanding how important this game is to him and knowing theres opportunity now for them to continue the longest winning streak in the country on a Blow by but no Duke Missi a number of relatively easy shots here in the early going you see trying to really take advantage and a foul on a big hit as Han Jor went down hard and in some pain right now the Baseline fouled on the drive with 127 to go on the half by Mason Gillis who made sure he didnt get it so for Gillis number one DJ Han driving the Baseline going off of one foot whenever you go off of one foot you leave yourself susceptible to that type of fall and so as he gets hit up top no way to be able to catch his balance comes down hard looks like on that right hip hopefully hell be able to get up and continue on but right now needing some attention love the fact that hes reaching his hands up for the teammates to help him out now Ron Groover one of the officials tonight to find crew along with Mark snner and Adam Flory over to our table but opportunity to talk with Ron gr and gr coming over and letting us know that because of the time out Duke will have the opportunity to pick who the foul shooter will be with the injured player down and having to come out of the game Duke can choose who they want to pick I mean to shoot the free throws but it has to be one the guys thats actually on the floor at the time yeah and they have picked the big freshman Hastings who is just nine for 15 at the foul line and Steve Smith out talking to Ron Gruber grber going over and explaining to them the exact same thing that he explained to us earlier that Duke has the option to choose as to who they want shooting the free throw Steve Smith almost spread it out the half court I always thought it was one of the more unus usual rules in in basketball that you can pick the worst foul shooter on the other team after youve disc committed the foul but heres the thing and the reasoning behind it because if youre a bad free throw shooter you would fake injured and so therefore if your team picks then you can send someone else to the free throw line and shoot those shots and the NBA if you cant shoot them you cant check back into the game and so I just like the fact that you can choose someone else to shoot it but the players are able to come back in well he one of two so 1611 BC they have had to better of the play so far in these first8 minutes over the number three team in the country Patrick gunba the 611 freshman getting some minutes early here for Duke Foster lines up a long one again a good look it just didnt fall the Blue Devils are told here and the Eagles are doing a very good job of finishing the defensive possession coming up with the defensive board and getting themselves on the offensive end of the floor keeping Duke off at the offensive glass all to check back in for John Shire here in a moment Boy Tough pass Hastings inside that was Kelly curl in that pass you you nailed it OB tough pass but I love the fact that Hastings was available and looking for the basketball thats a tough catch for a big guy sealing off but only able to catch it and finish points in the paints for the Eagles thats the difference in the game proor nice give there and itll be dropped in gunga getting some points early yeah and the great Hands by gangba as well the drop off was low a bounce pass to a big guy like that but both of our big guys right now the reserves showing off their hand Duke without the services of Malik Brown hes going to be out several weeks with a sprained knee thatll go the other way and the foul will go against Hastings getting a little chippy between the big gu and both of them getting it done on the offensive end of the floor Hastings theyre going to go over and look at the foul the offensive foul and see if its a hostile act against hean Music gangba e e e e Music to well theyve upgraded that foul on the Freshman Jade Hastings moments ago to a flagrant one that is involving excessive or severe contact during a live ball that is unnecessary or avoidable and Obie you see a little bit of arm wrestling between the two but its really more so to do with the swipe afterwards even though the elbow does make contact to gumba its the swipe through afterwards thats the excessive the of the common foul at 1059 was reviewed during the timeout its going to be upgraded to a flagrant one of 22 Duke will have two shots in the ball in their back court with 30 on the shot clock and gungo will shoot those and Ron gr explaining exactly what I was trying to say but in a much better fashion Im not so sure about that that is the first foul shot attempt of the season for the Freshman from Manasses Virginia the big Pat was in injured missed his entire senior year of high school and then coming into Durham unable to play right away so having to rest misses both free throws but does get the basketball back for the Blue Devils and he was a guy that with with Malik Brown being out theyre going to need more minutes from gangba and so a great opportunity for him stepping up in a hostile environment boy it is that and again that is not said every night in this building but this crowd is making a difference early on the student sections in particular Duke with the basketball Foster trying to cut in James over the top and the slam follow watch getting back on the floor great Hands by malawat however giving seon James just a Target to be able to throw it anywhere going to get it and finishing off the slam all thewi a terrific effort against Miami Tuesday at Cameron with 15 rebounds you saw saw that in person and if that was coming off of his first career double double a career H 19 points so playing his best basketball especially without Malik Brown John sire going to have to lean on malawat a lot more to play even more minutes and stay out of foul trouble where he just picks up one on that possession he did trying to deny venning whos been trouble early on for BC last three games playing some great basketball 14 points to G 16 out of 19 hes making 80 of his shots for the year I know nothing about that OB cut it in half thats about my range now coming up on the halfway point of the first half Cooper flag getting ready to check back in and a nice touch there by Chaz Kelly he knock it down yeah Chaz Kellys a guy that Earl Grant and his staff were expecting more from coming into this year but off to a great start here playing so well getting extended minutes Foster getting inside the lane lost the handle on it knocked out by BC with seven on the shot clock here for Duke CER flag back on hes the reason this place is buzzing tonight the redot Duke Blue Devils have ripped off 11 straight longest current winning streak in division one oh I tell you what I am having a great time with my guys back here the the students here for the Bost and and and and one of my guys called that off of the knee by James of Caleb Fon I believe they got it right Im not sure the officials saw that on that last possession but it was great Hands by Brown I thought that went off the knee of Caleb F I know like I know why you like hanging with these guys you can compare SAT scores with them the rest of us can not these guys they are well beyond my range pain a determined move got it up to the iron but it wont fall and flag with a rebound hes averaging eight a game along with 19 points but hes been quiet so far roor finds him flag kind of a choppy dribble great dish underneath for Mar watch and the dunk but Cooper flag grabbing his neck had a collision in the paint going to be interesting to see if thats something that affects him moving forward but he was going for the loose ball ran into one of the one of the Eagles again looking for that cut to the basket but this one knocked Away by Duke Evans will launch in transition though James grabs the rebound Proctor yes nothing but net from threepoint territory always the best time to shoot the three ball off the offensive rebound no one out there to even contest tyres Proctor who knocked down his second three of the evening Duke with an 112 Run deleted by two mfin at the logo is Han Jor Bing again getting a touch oh what a big move and two more and venning got away with a little bit of a chicken wing on that one OB however they these officials have done a great job allowing the physicality throughout this game without allowing guys to get away with fouling well he makes 56 of his shots thats where he lives flag on the attack off the window no BC wants to run KY to push it and Kelly is going to be foued by Tyrese Proctor trying to hold him up 742 to go in a half tyres Proctor off to a strong start here on the road off of the offensive rebound standing at the top of the key is able to knock down the threepoint basket but on the other end of the floor Chad vinning has been special a little ticket Wing however still a bucket in the paint Music rules of Cooper flag did when tickets went on sale for Boston College games this summer they bought a ticket package which included the Duke game because the ticket package for five or more Boston College games was much cheaper than the 1300 it would have cost them to get a ticket on the secondhand Market to be able to watch this game so I know over 75 different family members friends Etc purchased those Im not sure how many people is in total but I can tell you what a lot of Newport Maine is in the building here today and a couple does in NBA Scouts too oh yeah they theyre everywhere he goes though theyre used to that and a lot of media credentials shot clocks down to four Kelly on the drive right there for two more and a whistle on the play with 718 to go but one of the things youve seen from the eagles they have not been hesitant at all to attack the basket and Chaz Kelly just gets Kon nipple on the island and with malawat out of the play is able to get to the rim malawat coming over and picking up the foul late on that possession but late to be able to rotate but cant leave a shooter on the perimeter yeah they looking for the threepoint play around and out so its Boston College by two I think many tuning in at this point are shocked at the score right now but the Eagles have been the better team to this point but it shouldnt be shocking because youre on the road I dont care regardless of what the records are anything of such it is difficult to win on the road in college basketball we saw that today Tennessee going to Vanderbilt losing Iowa State losing at West Virginia it is difficult to win on the road and of course with the Blue Devils always going to get everyones Best Shot especially on their opposing team floor many he with the foul to put flag at the line where he makes 81 Auburn barely held on today Georgia had a chance to tie that game at the buzzer and missed one asan Cooper Flags teammate at Mont bird had a great game double dou 16 and 10 and as you mentioned had that chippy right at the end of the game to tie it up and send it into overtime unable to get it to go but strong performance from the Georgia Bulldogs at home against the number one team in the country Alabama Big Win earlier today as well we saw them in Texas AM in a real dog fight win that one on the road another 100o game for Alabama theyve scored 100 points against ranked opponents four times this season one of the best teams in the country great game at Kentucky to pull out the win this one tie to 24 Kelli being harassed by Applause Proctor swings it out for McFarland shot clock inside 10 now for the Eagles who won 20 games last year went to the NIT that three Off the Mark by Applause McFarland D trying to grab the lead here Proctor at the head of the key and thatll drop and another sweet Touch by Proctor Obi this is the maturation of Tyrese Pro stepping up making big plays for the Blue Devils on the road already in double figures with 11 points four or five from the field and more importantly three or four from Beyond the threepoint R along with Caleb Foster one of Dukes two returning starters from an elite eight team last year and trying to make a move and and lost the handle draws the foul under 6 minutes to go here in the first half at Boston College and the next SEC ACC super Tuesday basketball double header starting on ESPN 2 in Knoxville number six Tennessee hosting number 15 Mississippi State thats at 700 eastern time then at 900 RJ Davis in North Carolina in Winston Salem to battle Wake Forest North Carolina losing in the final couple of seconds J Blakes used to play for Duke broke their heart today yeah Jaylen Blakes also in the mix for accs most improved player the biggest jump from a scoring standpoint of any ACC player this year and so getting a big win on the road in Chapel Hill and the only guy I think that may be able to give Cooper flag some some competition at the ACC Player of the Year level would be Maxim REO for the Stanford Cardinal he got a little separation but the jumper clangs away Duke starting to grab a little bit of momentum flag with it back up to James looking to penetrate Slams on the brakes and takes a hit and draws the foul by venning 69 grad out of Brooklyn New York will pick up the personal these will be the fifth and sixth free throws of the first half for Cooper flag it was only one of five from the field but still continues to be in attack modee and of course his record setting game where he scored 42 at ACC freshman record he was 16 of 17 from the free throw line and thats the characteristic that you look at from scores all great scores get to the free throw line and take care of business once they get there 81 for him and none other than Coach K himself in toning this week he feels hes the best player in America right now and that ability to not just hunt shots hunt shots for your teammates and thats the thing about Cooper its not about always scoring for him he does whatever is necessary for his team to win against Miami he had 13 points you know but played all around game but they didnt need him to score when he scored 42 against Notre Dame it was a game they won by eight points they needed all 42 of those so he does whatever is necessary for a team to go out and get a win against Miami 13 points but seven rebounds six assists in that contest and that Victory pull up popped by hand glancing off the iron Brown went for the rebound and its knocked out of play with 509 remaining in the half Duke a perfect 7 and0 in ACC play they have just been throttling teams they buried Miami by 35 on Tuesday they beat Pit by 29 SMU by 27 Virginia Tech by 23 Duke has a plus 22 margin of victory when it comes to all games throughout the season so theyve been dominant and of course got a number of big wins uhoh Hastings went up high and denied Evans coming over he committed the foul stopping that possible spectacular dunk yes and again a good foul we talked about Hastings who split two free throws earlier but as you see kiple and Gillis run into each other give Evans a lot of credit coming over and forcing hings to have to earn it at the free throw line in comparison to the dunk that would have got this crowd going in DCs favor hting out of Orlando as kiple gets together with John shy Hastings got his first college start at SMU back on December 21 he had nine points he comes in averaging about three and foul shooting is an issue for the youngster and already a good foul can be a great foul if Hasting doesnt take care of businesses with this free throw smart play by Evans getting over there and taking away the dump and again makes one of two and you see the Eagles pressing up this pressure is not to force a turnover this pressure is to slow down the Blue Devil and take a little bit of time off as they initiate their offense with 20 seconds remaining and this a team that scores over 80 points theyre used to playing fast James to the other side of the iron and another missed layup for Duke and there been a bunch of those in this first half and a whistle its going to be a traveling violation Josh Beetle just got a little bit of Happy Feet at the top of the key found himself wide open had a three electing not to take it and trying to get downhill turns it over for the third time for the Boston College Eagles how about Duke zero turnovers in this game their Five Points off turnovers are really the difference to this point Applause flag wants the ball goes in strong for two no one was going to stop that one and again when you put a bigger defender on him hes going to drive past him its simply about once he does he finish when he gets to the rim that time doing a great job against Hastings trying to guard one the face up flag has already been named ACC player of the week three times rookie of the week six times and good Toy Defense as he plucks it away made the save to Gillis and then they fire it out but terrific effort by flag on the Hustle but you see getting his hand on the basketball deflection steals its not only about offense with Koopa flag the three quarter front coming up with it and then the presence to be able to give the basketball up thats going to be Mason gilliss turnover and the first turnover for the Blue Devils here this Applause evening hes like hey I did everything I could humanly possible actually 3125 well hes gotten rid of the nerves hes settled in now and again its you know its human nature when youre playing in front of all these people that you know and love coming to see you to make sure you want to have a strong performance and really one of the first times weve seen nerves from Cooper didnt get off to the start were normally seeing from him but hes settled in now a sensational as he is remember hes 18 fresh 18 barely as of December 21th turn around McFarland got a good look though a second effort now for BC Duke has surged in front here these last three or four minutes Brown getting into the paint nice spin with the left Applause hand Deon Brown to transfer from Maryland Baltimore County and this a young man that average over 20 points a game last year so coming in he hasnt really been able to get his scoring touch going as coopa flag has absolutely gotten it going now getting downhill the spin the Finish OB he was at the game last night at TD Garden watching Jason Tatum make plays just like this so coup channeling his inner JT for the bucket the hoop the harm of free throw when we return proud of the Eagles fans for showing up in this environment that they have created of course when you got Duke coming in the building its easy to do but the way that they have supported their players is a large part of the reason why they are in this first half against the number two team in the country during the timeout we reviewed a field go successful field goal made by Duke at 612 it was scored a three it has been reversed to a twopoint basket the score above is the correct score and flag at the line as we come back out of the timeout with three minutes to go before the break here at k for miserable night outside so that kind of adds to what talking about with a huge crowd here a sold out house and a pretty major snowstorm coming into New England I hope you get out of town I was about to say dont say that too loud you know I got a flight tomorrow morning crew hope you get to our game on Tuesday I know it those of us who know how to dig our way out of it hopefully thats the second time Brown has been able to keep that pivot foot down and multiple pivots to be able to get a bucket in the painted area BC staying close even though Cooper flag has started to pick up his production here over the last couple of possessions meanwhile kipo is coming out 25 he was Sensational the other night against Miami has been a nonfactor Evans trying to make a move and a foul at 230 left and thatll be Hastings but you mentioned that OB we asked Earl Grant earlier today in shoot around who do you have to slow down for the Blue Devils and of course everyone would think that the you know the answer is going to be Cooper flag but thats not the answer and I wouldnt expected that to be the answer because Cooper flag normally goes off in games that are close but when D blows teams out which theyve done a lot is Khan kiple is Tyrese proor its the other guys who are able to get off they blew Miami out on Tuesday because Khan nipple has a career high 22 points knocks down 5 threes thats the area concern for Earl Grant he said plain and simple Coopers going to get his theres nothing we can do about that weve got to slow down the other Applause guys freshman out of fville North Carolina Isaiah Evans at the line one of 92 McDonalds all Americans the Duke has signed in his story history should have just handed Coach K a McDonalds franchise after all of that success I believe hes got enough he just might but Isaiah Evans you know youll look back at the Auburn game and we have to say thats the slim game because he was the one who saved in the SI free in the first half of that game allowed Duke to get back into it and eventually win against the number one team of the country at the time Benning trying to move underneath he was the hot hand early hell draw the foul as he is hit on the body with 214 to go in half number one GBA will pick up the personal and so that will send vening to the line where he can be a guy who struggles at only 64 he had some big games 19 against Georgia Tech 17 against Miami the womens hoop Sunday afternoon double header coming up on ESPN 2 100 Eastern and thatll be Duke taking on Stanford Duke number 16 and then at 300 on ESPN South Carolina number two in the country battling number 13 Oklahoma how about my little sis Don Staley with Im sorry my little big sis Don Staley with the huge contract extension 255 mil the highest paid coach in womens basketball history I I just need to hit her up make sure you know Im good for a 5 loan you and I both next time were in Colombia richly deserved magnificent absolutely on her we go to Columbia nice touch there for three points and SL having some fun with the fans here behind us at KY form and of course no one appreciates that more than his teammate classmate Cooper flag he knows how dangerous slim can be once he gets going so Duke by eight trying to open it up a little before the break here in Boston and looking to tiptoe through gave it away nearly turned it over shock clck down to four McFarland will launch a long one and hit it and McFarland the grad out of port Lauderdale hes a thousand Point scorer in his career and that was a disastrous possession for BC which ends up being a blessing in disguise with mcaren knocking down to three ball K nipple will kick it heres Evans with another look and a second effort gun but keeping it alive flag slicing in for the slam early in the game the Eagles did a great job of limiting Duke to one opportunity on possessions the offensive rebound allows Trooper flag to finish strong and have his 15th Point here in the first Applause half McFarland just buried a triple and to drive it into paint and draws the foul it was with six on the shot clock 218 on the first half clock most guys would settle on the perimeter off of offensive rebound and wait to be pass the ball Cooper flag wants to get as close as he can to the rim because he loves to finish with authority as he does on this possession the nice find from Patrick gumba to Cooper flag with the Highlight flush and 15 points for Coupe here in half number one Boston College tonight good foul shooting team is 74 so far they are four for eight after that Applause make and Foster will step out James back on now for John shy and Han Jr outstanding foul shooter leading the ACC at 91 and a miss thats why I didnt say it well he had only missed eight all season long hes one of the best B shes in the country he absolutely is best in the country 91 I can tell you right now his dad didnt shoot free throws like that be able to go to his right getting to the basket Im sure the Blue Devils will have some type of action to get him a look 16 seconds remaining here in the first half so Duke to put it in here trying to add to a lead here that is expanded after an initial tough fight by the Eagles and theyre still hanging in close heres flag out at the logo flag gives up the dribble Proctor around and out got an excellent shot thats how the first half comes to an end with the Duke Blue Devils number three in the country wait you remember you mentioned it in our open the last time BC beat a top ranked team it was the Duke Blue Devils in 2017 Marvin Bagley and his crew coming in here and getting beat on this FL when they were the number one team in the country and nipple gives it up for Proctor on the drive trying to Slither inside for two and a quick strike for Duke to open up the second half and Tyrese proor has been a Difference Maker hes also in double figures now 12 points for him but more importantly the way that hes approached this game on the road has really had a calming influence on the remainder of his team Joshua Beatle with the basketball BC playing without one of their better scorers tonight and Elijah strong 115 rebounds the game he is out six given that theyve done a terrific job to stick around the nipple dragging that foot thats going to be a traveling violation but only the second turnover for the Blue Devils had only one in that first half as you mentioned so Khan canle and you got to give the Eagles a lot of credit theyve held canle scoreless only one field goal attempt for him in 16 minutes of action so that was the plan from Earl Grant to try to keep him out of getting it into the scoring column especially after a career high last time out Deion Brown to the paint looking for the scoop and a roll off the iron Benning battling strong and thats how he opened up the ball game yeah Benning back to his usual business the offensive rebound the putback as Elijah strong looks on wishing he was on the floor to help his team thats a big front line that you normally see for the Eagles vending a transfer from SA benture Applause Cooper flag with a touch spins and gets two thats too easy Josh Beetle if youre good to double team you got to get there get the basketball out of Coopers hands early you give him that much time hes going to pick you apart flag closing in on his scoring average came in averaging 19 a game McFarland hands off for Han Jr shot clock down to 10 for Music BC Benning with the shot that clangs away and itll go in the opposite direction itll be Duke ball Cooper flag moments to go in the post and of course you have to wonder whether this time to go get him because hes such a great passer youre not sure if you want a double team to allow him to open up the threepoint Shooters but when he puts that basketball on the floor youve got to get down there quicker to try to take Cooper flag away otherwise hes going to destroy one of your teammates on the Block the Eagles have to be very wary of being in that Danger Zone The Duke can push you in so quickly in the opening seconds of a second half flag again not to be denied off the window but so patient he allowed everyone and theyre going to get I believe were going to have a flagrant one right there mcfallen with the Chip Shot to Cooper flag on the way out Cooper trying to go back down the floor after the bucket Koopa flag just running back and McFarland um no oh wait a minute thats the problem the elbow going above the shoulders initially I didnt think that was enough but once you see the arm go above the shoulders making contact with the face that could very well be upgraded excessive or severe during a live ball well I believe the excessive part was the arm coming up I mean theres thats not a natural motion as you see the two bump into each each other but then the yeah I believe that ones going to be up I think thats going to be upgraded Marner coming over to let us know thats were looking at here and to see if there is a need to upgrade this but thank to thanks to marer coming over and letting us know if anything it would be a dead ball technical foul it would not be a flagrant one because the ball was not actually in play so youre talking about a dead ball technical in comparison to a flagrant one 4636 D give me another look here as you see it though OB like the initial is nothing but that the contact to the face afterwards and thats not a natural motion for the arm to come up especially if youre just trying to get away from the contact Ron Gro Marner and Adam Flory the standing crew tonight after to take a look they get together lets see what they come out of here with and flag got hit in the nose so stopping the bleeding not going to be the last time that happens to him and Ron gr going over to the mic as Wella foul so a dead ball contact technical foul on Boston College number three duke will shoot two and have the Applause ball so a huge possession is Cooper flag not only gets the bucket Duke has an opportunity to get two more points at the free throw line as well as the basketball back so this could be as much as a sevenpoint possession for the Blue Devils so flag will go to the line where he makes 81 actually been playing the best basketball of his freshman year against the best teams against two top four opponents hes averaging 21 a game and and thats the thing OB what we mentioned it earlier he scores when they need him to score when they dont need him to score hes more of a facilitator and a playmaker but when they need him to score as they have throughout this game he goes and gets buckers three points on this possession alone and an opportunity for them to even add to it when you look at the numbers of from CP before and after his 21st birthday another good look for kiple unable to get it to go but his own offensive rebound tough sledding for him and that ones going to be swatted away by McFarland its been a long night for kiple after a great night against Miami the Duke will have the ball back and James to put it in for the Baseline bat off the entry banks in two and its a simple thing and coaches teach it differently so Im not going to say that the bosson college Defender did not do his job however its easy to take away that pass on it just stand on the inside dont let him throw the basketball underneath your basket brown with the scoop yes this is an encouraging sign from Deon Brown we talked about a young man who averaged 20 points a game a season too at UNBC averaging 61 throughout this year for the Boston College they need him to be more aggressive on the offensive end thatll go the other way thatll go against malat the 72 freshman and thats going to be three on malawat and we have to continue to remind our viewers no Malik Brown so this Duke team is different without an all ACC Defender Malik Brown available no timetable yet on his return but malawat now playing with three fouls has to be extremely careful on this defensive end of the floor hes out with a sprain knee no surgery required there hand with it up top the James trying to stick to him done a good job on James to this point bennings been a different story though and a foul as well hell be off to the line and we just talked about it OB thats the fourth foul on malawat and Benning has been extremely aggressive going at malawat and thats something that Errol Grant told me earlier today he knew that they had an advantage here he knows how good venning can be shooting at 55 from the field second in the ACC continues to perform and had a great game thus far for the Eagles bending to grad from Brooklyn at the line looking for a threepoint play here just when it looked like Duke was about to start to blow out BC and the Eagles spring back to life and as you mentioned malat on the bench pack to gumba the 61 freshman now on for Duke he hasnt played much this Applause season bror denied tapped Away by McFarland it comes free and it rolls out off a Duke thatll be BC ball how about the response from the Eagles after what could have been a possible sevenpoint possession for the Blue Devils that has only allowed Boston colle College to pick up their energy on the defensive end of the floor Deon Brown getting after it the ball goes off of tyres Proctor regaining possession for BC Eagles just N9 and8 Kelly up top around and out just one and five in the ACC but theyre showing a lot of stick tutiven this tonight James down the paint look for the bank shot and a foul on the play thatll go on Applause venning so we are under 16 a timeout Duke on top here at Beast R in everything that went into that so one of the first block Pioneers to play in the NBA so Boston has been at the Forefront of integration in athletics and also in society seion James will be at the line with 1552 to go here for Duke trying to break away here thats been a lot tougher than maybe Duke anticipated tonight he sinks number one Dukes only losses by five to Kentucky and by three to Kansas coming in at 1550 to 27 and0 the conference they have been the class of the ACC without a doubt he makes one of two flag tried to keep it alive but it pops to the Eagles and right now if youre B and college this is the opportunity especially after a timeout run something to get the basketball in the hands of Chad Benning allow him to be successful hes been able to have his way throughout this game James coming over to double him up and tied him up on the play and Benning looking at his teammates wondering hey can somebody tell me that seon James is coming up somebody got to yell it out however as loud as its been in this building here tonight maybe he wouldnt have heard him even if they had youc with the possession arrow its been loud its been Lively too thanks to the outstanding effort by the students taken away here by Cooper flag bouncing for kiple and a triple this hasnt been his night no it hasnt been zero points coming off a career hot 25 against Miami last time out just hasnt been able to get it to go Kelly slamming on the Applause brakes at the line Benning on the spin move and draws the foul hes been playing with a lot of energy in this game the 69ine gr fouled by Cooper flag its actually not going to go against him its going to go on gunga instead thats going to be Sho and thats going to be three on gangba as well so malawat already on the bench with four now gumba picking up his third b and a missfire on number one and tomorrow ACC Network womens basketball a quadruple header starts right here at cotti Forum at noon o00 noon Eastern BC and Syracuse and then number 19 North Carolina and pit followed by Louisville and Virginia Tech they capped off by SMU and number three Notre Dame and venning with his second On Target Boston College not great from the free throw line throughout this game thats an area where theyve struggled now 50 six of 12 and a team that normally shoots much better from the free throw strike where every one of those is going to be key throughout this Applause game James into the painted area and one hell be off to the line as he slices in for the basket Applause John Shire has talked about his connectors the two connectors for the Duke Blue Devils cion James and Malik Brown of course Malik Brown out cion James the transfer in who is taken over at the point guard position and one of the guys that John sh leans on from an experience standpoint and also to settle the team when things are not going well Kelly with the foul making 75 at the line and a threepoint play so the lead up to 11 for dke Theon Bron came in averaging just six points a game outside of hand and venting they dont get a lot of scoring Kelly slithers the pass inside and a whistle 1427 to go thatll be on Cooper flag but thats the second time weve seen that pass OB so it absolutely has to be something that they work on its a very difficult angle to deliver a pass but when you expect the fact that the bigs are not only catching them but expecting them as well that has to be something that Earl Grant and his staff work on in practice but its unconventional however still effective as theyre able to get the basketball in the hands of vinning once again venning on a SE benture transfer who all A10 scored nearly 1300 points so he knows how to get to the 10 Earl Grant has been relatively reserved Im used to seeing him standing up in a defensive stance on the sideline James with a rebound so it remains 10 proor thought about it Zone def defensively from BC flag slams it in man can he get up in a heartbeat as impressive as the Finish was I love the cut he didnt stand on the perimeter waiting for the basketball to be thrown for Him He makes himself available as an option getting into the painted area just moving without the basketball which is a strength with Cooper flag its often a struggle for many superstars which Cooper absolutely is but you just is making himself available finding the open spot and of course when he catches that close to the rim he knows how to finish and exciting dunker hes up for dunk of the year after what he did against pit at Cameron Indoor I dont know if anyone will top that we shall see but just made another highlight reel play hes good about at least one a game one a game anyway at least one G often Applause more so 5543 BC again in one of those danger zones Kelly over the top Benning doubled up and its on the line with six on the shot clock so this is the area of concern especially where you missed Malik Brown now Mason Gillis has to come in and play the five spot so vinning with a tremendous size advantage over Gillis although Gillis is extremely strong and difficult to post up I think think Benning can still have an advantage flag got a hand on it tapped it out and that cost a second not a seat to be had inside k for him tonight completely sold out the hottest ticket in Boston you were at the Celtics yesterday yeah and speaking a hot ticket the Blue Devils actually were in the building as well watching two of their guys actually three of their guys Jason Tatum going up against Pao B Caro is Cooper flag goes well Above the Rim for the rebound on that possession but Jason Tatum po banero lendell Carter of course Mill Jefferson on the staff of the Boston Celtics so a lot of Blue Devil love in the house last night Proctor lifting good clean look cant connect got the entire group over there and you were doing double duty NBA game last night big win for the Celtics and the college game tonight heres Kelly straight on around and out and a whistle in the rebounding freay with 1257 left John sh told me earlier today you know if the game today this game had been like 100 we never would have done this but because it was tipping off late 800 it was a wonderful chance to get the whole team there but you see the pitcher with of course the Boston Celtics you see Jason T Mill Jefferson right there in the middle at shoot around yesterday Im talking to Pao B Caro and he says yeah Im going to have to bring the guys down to the locker room afterwards and I looked at him and I said you do realize youre going to have to share today right youre not at home and he thought about it for a while hes like oh yeah thats right got to share with JT Celtics a very impressive win over there at TD Garden Celtics playing now as well back toback at the guard last two days out of the double theyll swing for the corner great job Ling open man it happens to be Isaiah Evans to cash in AKA Showtime slim knocking down another three and the thing about slim he always knows where to find the opposing teams student section for his little bit of inyourface Celebration likes to do it 46 from threepoint lands iss getting used to Applause it we downtown looking to answer not there for pain and now it begins to slip in Dukes favor in a big way yeah uh important possession for BC right now Duke with a 15point lead media timeout at the next dead ball you dont want to allow the Blue Devils to continue to build on this before you can reset FL tried to get his way through the double and draws the foul so just under 12 minutes Boston College has gone 4 and a half minutes since their last field goal Duke defense clamping down get to eight and0 here this evening oh the inbound banked in by Proctor and a whistle to play there is pain fouls yeah but Proctors been a Difference Maker tonight we go back to him banking in three early in the game but hes been able to get it going on the offensive end of the floor and just you know rule the thumb whos the guy thats often going to be open its the screener tyres Proctor with the back screen and really was a faux screen right there trying to get some misdirection going and then opens right up to an open Lane to get the hoop and the harp opportunity for the M1 Junior from Sydney Australia makes 77 and a threepoint play and Duke starting to settle in to look very comfortable they really are and youre going to go with Hastings coming into the game theyre going to go with the two big lineup now for Boston College with Duke with a smaller lineup one on the floor with none of their centers out there Cooper flag the tall as God Mason Gill is playing at the Five Spot Luca Tavis from Tokyo Japan with a ball up top here and swings it nying to get off a shot for the Eagles the defense just swarming on the penetration attempt and Hastings has an advantage inside they cant get him the basketball boy po an ugly shot and never touched the iron 1126 remaining so back over to Duke it goes on the shot clock Applause violation now Ro Grands team able to hang on maybe longer than most anticipated as you mentioned I inan theyre at home and they were able to play some really good basketball in the early minutes of this game but they have cooled off a lot of thats because the Dukes defense an8 nothing run thats exactly what is OB Duke you know not only one the better offensive teams in the country but absolutely at the top of the chars when you talk defensively what theyve been able to do thatll be a charge on flag an offensive foul on the 69ine rookie Cooper flag has six turnovers last time out thats his first turnover in the game today and so something that hes cleaned up in the few days since we saw him last but again aggressive turnovers John Shire will never mind Cooper still trying to get downhill even with the 18point lead he has 22 flag Applause does Davis looking to make a move off the glass but no proor with the rebound and hell take a tumble fouled here against Boston College and they look to separate and this the second time cas has been involved in a scrum this time with b and Gillis both trying to go after a rebound and they get caught up but you see right here the officials not going to go well lets see I dont believe theyre going to go over and look at anything here fortunately yeah they do get Hastings for the foul number 22 Jen Hastings thats his four and thats number four on the big freshman again he played well early he was involved in a nice surge for the Eagles but he has also chilled out and now in serious foul trouble and Mark sner is at the monitor just checking it out hes holding up the free throw right now to make sure there was nothing extracurricular there oh he was actually looking to see who the foul was on for the so itll be Proctor to the line Proctor coming up 18 minutes against Miami very clean game nine points four assists yeah had no turnovers also had a really nice one in the win over Auburn with 11 points and no turnovers and now 16 points for him only one turnover here tonight but efficient six of n from the field two of five from three as Earl Grant looks on and and just as you mentioned this started to get away from his team where they put up such a strong effort in the first half of this game treating their fans to a great experience here but lets say lets face it this is a really good Duke Blue Devil team you knew they were going to settle in at some point especially on the defensive Applause end Benny with a hand off for hand back down to the big and cant convert it those are the shots that were going early and often for Boston College and a foul will go against BC and Hastings thats number five on Applause him Mason Gillis in some pain got hit on the back of that head the Hastings coming through and unable to get the offensive rebound swinging through with that left arm they contact to the back of Mason gilliss head I believe believe theyre going to go check this one out to make sure theres nothing extracurricular there previous play is under review its been common place in this game tonight a lot of reviews yeah its been a lot of reviews its been a very physical game and as Hastings come down comes down with that making contact with the back of the head he immediately recognizes it and tries to you know console Gillis and and I believe thats part of the reason why the officials come away quickly with that one saying that theres nothing there just the common foul so no upgrade after review the play stands as called common foul and sends Gillis to the Line Tonight by the way his 150th college game between Duke and Purdue thats a lot of experience 150 games is a lot of experience and you know John Shire talked about Mason Gill who hes playing some now at the five spot at the center position a guy that played alongside the wood Award winner a year ago and Zach Edy at Purdue played in the national championship game Im not sure that he ever thought that he would be playing the center position with the Blue Devils but John shy made it very clear he doesnt stumble he doesnt walk at anything whatever you need me to do Im here to try to help this team win and Mason Gil is absolutely stepping up into presence with without Malik Brown into that Five Spot and playing well all hes done is Win pretty much 79 of the games hes played in hes won a record of 118 and 31 wow hell win more games than most college players ever play true enough so Duke opens it up 6543 and a game that was very competitive until the early minutes of this second half here in Boston but you have to look at OB BCs only scored seven points in the second half theyve had success when theyve been able to get the basketball two inning is d DJ Han is able to knock down the three but the leading score for Boston College really unable to get going here against the stingy Duke game at averaging 15 points a game Duke has done good work on him as they do so many top scores canle directing traffic hes had a really quiet night but his teammates caught fire and they now have a sizable Applause lead roor pulls up and Pops cant nail Applause it Davis with the ball six1 freshman his cousin Jonathan won a Stanley Cup playing for the Blackhawks Benning shot clock to seven heres Brown well had a goodlooking shot came off the hand in good shape but couldnt nail it Cooper flag getting ready to check back in now for John Applause shy heres Gillis after taking a shot in the back of the head looks like he shook that off heres Evans he cant stick it off the back of the iron Applause goes so under nine here at KY Applause Forum Duke trying to win their 12th in a row they have the longest winning streak active in division one Davis around the back and reaching a foul with 833 to go and hell be foued by Mason Gillis going to be a cheap one by Gillis right there which could put DC at the free throw line and really thats been the only way theyve been able to really get anything going in the second half offensively Duke has absolutely locked down on the defensive end of the floor throughout this second half of the game now BC up to 12 points in half number two but its been a struggle especially from the field field now the Freshman hits the front end of the one and Applause one Obi this half alone 13 points four of 15 from the field for BC and only one of seven from the threepoint line 26 thats going to be tough to beat the number three team in the country Duke playing great basketball coming in and trying to go to 16 and two on the season Foster trying to get it downstairs and picked off the Steel by Beetle heres H junor working on Cooper flag little bounce there short Applause flag on the move the AllAmerica candidate going in strong will draw the foul and about to shoot to 752 to go well Cooper flag has been in attack mode all evening long especially when he catches it from a nice dish from his friends and let me tell you who loves it most that would be my girl Kelly flag husband Ralph in attendance here checking out their son Im with Dicky V Im going with the iris as well the golden domers so Im looking for the iris to get their next national championship but thats going to be thats going to be a great game going to be a tough one as well cant wait St playing great football they are Monday night flag at the line after a Miss on number Applause one and drops in the second end to expand the lead for John Shire and Company to 6648 see Chris Carwell beside John Shire the last time the Blue Devils were on the road John shy did not accompany the team to Dallas taking on SMU Chris Carwell coached the team and got his first win as a Duke head coach and he rolling inside flag with the Stop and again thats what he does its not all about what he does in offensive end the floor defensively making big plays as Applause well Evans with a long way yes what a great touch but CP knows whats going to happen once he makes the pass to slim he know its going up hes got an assist already got his arms in the air signaling its going to be a May three that is a freshman the McDonalds allam he plays with a lot of Joy Carin jumping into the paint no and a whistle 706 showing on the clock Isaiah Evans launches those he knows theyre in the basket before they come off his fingertips gbo at the personal gungo will pick up his fourth foul as Tom malawat will step back into the game we havent seen malawat in quite some time as both The Bigs for the Blue Devils have gotten themselves in some foul trouble here trying to defend vennings throughout this game Roger McFarland at the Applause line and here comes the big guy follow watch the 72 freshman from South Sudan and again terrific effort against Miami on Tuesday 15 rebounds of career high also chipped in with 12 points consecutive double doubles hamala watch not sure hell get there in this one eight points only three rebounds for him but has battled through foul trouble in this game back to Evans wants to launch again hes hot and loves to play with the crowd but he knows where all the students are hes not talking to anyone except for the BC students he knows where they are in the end zone right behind us so of course has his celebrations already set because as you mentioned before when he lets it go he always thinks its going in came in 28 for 61 from three Brown on the drive swatted away by flag again couple of blocks for him and a whistle and flag dumpfounded thats the technical I think well I believe he may have had a little something to say as Kellys not happy about it shes wondering what but he may have had a little something to say after the block shot so Brown will go to the line to shoot them for Boston College and flag teed up lets go back and take a closer look if we can so as he comes from pretty much out of nowhere blocks the shot well we dont see anything there Im not sure if he had something to say Applause afterwards as he chased down the loose ball after he didnt say he didnt say anything didnt look like it I am Im with Ralph and Kelly on this one Im not sure what the technical there maybe was something said but it wasnt Music Cooper so Duke on top 7250 and the ball we approach the sixminute Mark here at Boston Evans again operating inside and Bing with the block flag from three yes let me tell you this OB he has something to say after that one no question about it he let everybody know the Blue Devils are in the building and yes you are getting your first look at this years number one pick in the NBA draft 26 points tonight Applause Music Music with good measure got a technical foul for not saying anything however he lets his feelings be known after the three drop it in for venning and a quick strike for BC but it has been once again the Cooper flag show byy and large here for the Duke Blue Devils at man from Maine this is as close as most New England fans who love college basketball are going to get to him here in Boston tonight in this ACC game about a 3 and 1 half hour drive from his home in Newport Maine for friends and family theyll drive it in tight and back into more and is able to come to way a little slight Flex after absorbing the contact and finishing at The Rim up to 28 Benning making a move to his left thats a tough angle and draws the foul thats going to be number five on malawat so hes filed out with 5 minutes to play first Cooper flag 28 points five rebounds for this two blocks we didnt have enough space to put his Steals on there but I know he has at least one so you talk about a a young man who is leading his team in all five Applause categories leading and top 10 in the ACC in all five categories as well so we mentioned in our open only Ben Simmons in 2016 over the last 25 years only Ben Simmons has done that as well LED his team in all five of those statistical categor so youre talking about rarified air but what were watching with Cooper flag well the foul switches to Evans and not malawat so he remains in the game and Benning on On Target to make it 7753 let me correct that the only freshman to lead his team in all five of those Applause categories so under five to go here in Boston the crowd beginning to thin out at least a little bit super flag and the Duke Blue Devils exploding in the second half the nipple working hard heres flag with shot clock to five proor around the back will launch it and nail the triple Big Time Performance with tyres procer it may get lost behind the attention paid the Cooper flag but now Proctor with 20 points 7even of 11 from the field and three of seven from Beyond the threepoint Arc hes been special and hes also taken on the challenge of guarding DJ hand who hasnt been able to get on track well under his average per game for the Eagles Applause Music now John shers going to use the opportunity to get some guys into the game who dont play a lot Proctor denied and a good block by venning and Junior and will knock that in from Applause midrange so Applause 8055 first half was very competitive second half is not SP and a timeout well take the break with 340 to go here at BC it has been all Duke since the break at kti forum who would be his biggest competition and berer flag having a spectacular year weve talked about the numbers but it has more to do with this impact on Applause winning loss the handle its knocked out of play off of BC and K kle still in the game right now and Im sure John Shire trying to get him to build some confidence pipple with zero points has not made a field goal and still scoreless John Shire does not want this to be a game where canip walks away without getting in the scoring column is 9 for 11 in Tuesdays victory over Miami 6 out of eight from three you saw that in person go we go different story here tonight in Boston yeah the Eagles have made life difficult for him but so many other guys have stepped up when you consider the production of Cooper flag and tyres Proctor both over 20 points in this game that chump shot will go by McFarland 100 points scorer out of Ford Lauderdale Florida but under three to go and all Duke here since Applause Music halftime and thatll go the other Applause way he the next SEC ACC super Tuesday basketball double header starts on ESPN 2 in Knoxville number six Tennessee taking on number 15 Mississippi State and then at nine RJ Davis in North Carolina in Winston Salem take on Wake Applause Boris North Carolina losing in the final couple of seconds earlier today Foster will pick up the foul thatll be number two on Caleb look at Tavis to the line the 61 freshman whose dad is a long time basketball coach in Japan and well get another so grew up around the game of course and long way from home were finding a home here in Chestnut Hill a number of the International Players theyve had at least one international player on their team for the last 11 consecutive years Applause Harris will bounce the top of the key and gunga got a lot of minutes in this one heres Harris to launch no that didnt touch anything and the foul will go against Applause Duke so Mason Gillis will pick up the personal Jos still trying to figure out how that was a foul on Gillis all I saw was Gillis on the inside I didnt see how he got there well you know if you figure that one out Id love to know why Cooper flag got a technical foul earlier tonight that is also a uh question I am almost positive its because of something that was said now we watched Cooper after the block and he didnt say anything no but it Im sure when the block happened there was something said theres a term that is often used the reverse are getting that shot out of here and Im sure it was used but it didnt seem to be Cooper who said it did not appear to be Evans will line up a long one and thats off the front iron Evans with another one rare to see him Miss to an a roll yeah that ball couldnt get in his fans hands fast enough he was waiting to let that one go and on target from threepoint land its not been his night he came in averaging 157 rebounds a game the Eagles top score and they needed a big effort out of him like the 29 he got against barley Dickinson earlier yeah and just unable to really get loose but I mean this is what Duke does they take your top score and often times just pretty much get them out of the game just on Tuesday Matthew Cleveland came in averaging over 20 points per game in his last six games he only had two points oh up top B gungo with the slam get up big Pat out I know he had that in this game but Caleb Foster absolutely knew put it in right position for gunba to finish it off 8263 the Blue Devils Davis shot doesnt did anything and out it goes back over to the Blue Devils in a minute 13 to Applause go so Duke about to win their 12th in a row and go to 16 and2 and 8 and0 as the class of the ACC and tonight showing up here in Boston at Connie for in front of a jammed house every seat taken hottest ticket here in the city of Boston and they had a fight on their hands for 20 minutes but not after that they absolutely did give Boston College a lot of credit for the way they attacked this game follow the game plan in the first half got the basketball inside and really exposed the Blue Devils in the paint got Mala watch in foul trouble he eventually fouled out GBA playing with four still but the perimeter players with the blue that was just too much you see him side by side hoer flag Tyrese Proctor although kiple was unable to really get going here tonight they still had more than enough between that combination of starters to get them a big win here on the road now Duke scoring well over 80 points the game and holding opponents below 60 theyve come very close to those two again its been like clockwork for them to be blowing out opponents one after another and thats how this one will go into the books tonight we talked about the plus 22 scoring margin right now with a 21point lead the Blue Devils could still stay in that range Evans Airborne nicely da on the scoop you know that as long as Slim is on the floor theyre going to continue to try to score the Blue Devils who average 81 points per game now at 86 well for Duke an impressive second half as they take off and run away and well get the slam here by Gillis but the exclamation with 6 seconds to go and John sire did not want that under 10 seconds he absolutely did not want that well he did like much of what he saw tonight no question about it as duke rolls to a victory theyre 12th in a row as they knock off Boston College 88 to6
