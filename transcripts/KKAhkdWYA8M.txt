Young Usually we would you know would say Maui Mike wed be talking about Bray Mike Young coaching in his fourth Atlantic Coast Conference basketball tournament Skewed the socks and has got a stool in front of the scorers table for his effort tonight Coach Young Coach Bray two guys you want to chop it up with and just hang These are the guys But inside draws a foul on the first possession for the Hokes and it will be on Dane Goodwin the former Golden Bear of Upper Arlington Ohio His first and the first on the Irish Like the early statement from the Hokes Mutz probably the most physical player on the court currently to start this ball game Bury him on a low block See what the intestinal fortitude interior defense wise the Irish can present Thats advantage Mutz out of the gates 24yearold Millville New Jersey native is just a terrific example of a student athlete Too much talent in that body I mean too much talent in that body What a great kid Five double doubles this year in conference play You see the Irish lineup a familiar one Lasheski Goodwin Ryan Wartz all veterans The Niagara transfer Marcus Hammonds got to win that matchup Great advantage on Padulla Misses much the rebound Here are the Hokes 610 verse 61 Leashesky cant convert Unacceptable Padulla lost it on the drive and a second Irish foul You get a look at Youngs Hokes And Ill call your attention to Basili the grad transfer from Wright State who is the third best scoreer in ACC play at nearly 18 a game Music And weve got a foul on Hammond at the Irish defensive end of the floor And thatll put Shawn Padulla to the line Bazil putting up just stupid offensive numbers here as of late Meanwhile Hunter Couture the best threepoint shooter by percentage in the ACC And Padulla second best free throw shooter in the conference makes it a four nothing Virginia Tech lead Wartz and Basil on the switch Here is Padulla trying to defend Hammond Warts Shot clock at 10 for Hammond working against Basil on the drive Soft ball away Bounced out Muts the rebound for the Hokes Padulla And Virginia Tech driving straight to the basket and that time turned away Jordan is it me But Virginia Tech when they go inside out seems to be the better offensive perspective for Young success No question because they have the gifted shooters but they also are gifted back to the basket scores as well in bazillion muts So you have the ability to play inward and then work your way out Not a lot of teams have that kind of personnel Heres Trey WZ hanging two over Collins bounds away and its a four nothing Virginia Tech game We played almost two minutes Hokes doing a good job defensively getting out on shooters making them meet a chest on drives doing everything you want I mean the Achilles heel when the Hoke struggle they are not locked in defensively Here they have been out of the gates Bazills first triple rattled out of there Cormarmac Ryan will bring it up the floor for the Irish Bazili 33 33 points in that last matchup on February 11th against the Irish So hes eager to get going here once again Yeah he had 33 Nate Lasheski had 33 for Notre Dame that day There he is on the drive Couldnt finish or ground Bazili Still a four nothing game Buts by Goodwin Its a tough match up for Goodwin with the physicality of Mutz Padoula from the wing 63rd three of the year for the young man from Milwaukee Wisconsin Applause Already a touchdown extra point on the board for the Hokes on the drive Wartz and Notre Dame responds You dont have to tell Trey Wartz hes at the ACC tournament He grew up in Charlotte son of a very popular sports writer He watched this event as a kid growing up Transferred in from Santa Clara to Notre Dame and has been on the stage of a event he idolized as a child in Charlotte with those elite spacing of the Irish It allows plenty of gaps if you can beat your guy off the bounce Ws able to do that and no help defender in sight because how they spread you Padoula way strong with the three Heres Hammond Kick out for Ryan Look at Coutures in his pocket work Cormarmac on the hard drive They rolled off the iron Love to see Cormarmac collect himself play on two then offer with the angle at back out front Basil another one Strong Leashes kept it alive Hammond will chase it down Boy its good Its already in fifth gear Jordan We dont have And you aint going to have a lot of fouls in this one either Hammond scores Two teams take care of it Dont foul Skilled shooters I dont know if it plays in the 90s but most certainly you got to imagine were be playing in the 80s Yep But nice pass Bazili the catch and score Grant Bazili all horizon a year ago at Wright State Hes hes had a terrific year in Blackburg Honorable mention all ACC this week Lashes 15 to shoot Irish trailing five Nate with the roll and cant finish around Collins again Hes got a 6 in advantage Nate has to win those matchups A very skilled talent He has to embrace the physicality At least draw a whistle Almost five minutes gone Mutz tes one up Bazili tried to keep it alive Got knocked out Couture Collins looking for a three Third try Butts off the window Weve said it all day long Bad defenses cant give up second and third chances Irish do exactly that Yep Virginia Tech an early sevenpoint lead Ryan a deep three from the left Cormarmac Ryan 62nd triple of the year In three ACC tournament games hes averaged better than 13 points Thats just his fifth three in 14 tries at the tournament A fierce competitor Plays with an edge Something at times the Irish can lack He brings that for 40 Mutz against Wartz Thats a mismatch Absolutely Favors the Hokes and Justin cant finish But a whistle and a foul Well have free throws for the Hokes when we continue 6 minutes in 117 CC Network basketball is brought to you by New York Life Over 12000 agents are there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times Music lead for Virginia Tech Mike Youngs got his team huddled up there and earlier in the locker room on the glass kid Elijah Pot physicality tough Come on man Right Physicality tough All right youre out of bounds Special teams everythings in play Hey youre prepared Youre prepared mentally Youre prepared physically Go lay it on the line Lets go do it Come on man 59yearold native of Bradford Virginia 2019 Sporting News National Coach of the Year and an ACC tournament champion is Mike Young And physicality is always what the opposition really boast coming in to playing Notre Dame because thats kind of been where you can exploit them in that painted area The lack of toughness defensively as much misses the back end Defensively Tokis done a great job Generated some second chance but I think offensively theyre settling for the 32 easily Mutz needs some touches down low and challenge the Irish interior and see if theyre up to play tough this evening in Greensburg Won four games a year ago on the way to the title at Barlay Center Hammond on the drive after Muts missed two free throws and Marcus Hammonds got a second field goal here and its a twopoint lead for Virginia Tech Irish are going to look give that zone look here because matchups arent favorable Now more than ever if Im a Lynn kid Im looking offensive rebound But Hunter Couture you have to have an awareness at all times of one of the conferences best shooters Hunter Couture 72nd triple of the year for the best threepoint shooter in the conference Jordan at 43 Back to a fivepoint edge Hammond a shot fake a little hesy and a drive on Collins and hell get to the line but MJ Collins took a spill on the baseline Hammond came down your pardon Hammond Im sorry on his ankle A little bit of a limp Hes going to try and walk it off Love the shot fake Love the hesitation Threw an array of moves at the defense to find the drive But Hunter Couture look hes the best perimeter defender for the Hookies and by percentage hes the best threepoint shooter And that is entirely too much time to catch collect and deliver three Bench loves it And in case you didnt know they tell you its three Marcus Hammond three times was all Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference when he was at Niagara for Greg Paulace My guy Yep 85 starts Wait a second Did I just hit a CA my guy on the broadcast You did Ive officially made it Yeah you have Im officially here Theres the second I just dont have the breaths of my guys that he can deliver You got a list Its not as long as CA Theres only one CA I did not say it was long I just said we had a list 1410 Hokes by four And the ball Padulla Couture Mutz Lynn Kidd into the ball game Averages about 13 minutes a game in conference play but hes only averaged nine and a half to close the regular season And theres a turnover by Virginia Tech Also Rodney Rice the freshman from Clinton Maryland has come in as Ryan goes strong to the basket and scores Five for Cormarmac Ryan He and Marcus Hammond have 10 of the Irish 12 Thats a big time move from Cormarmac Ryan going against the best defender on the roster on the perimeter in Hunter Couture Challenge him to a man and beat him right at his chest Took it right to him Heres Rice Much of his year has been derailed by injury but boy he finished strong He had 10 points on Saturday in the win against Florida State Mutz almost lost it Look at this The little turn and push with a right hand Six for Justin Mutz I I try to get Mutz as many touches as possible early How about Cormarmac Ryan Front rim miss of a three Rebound for Vin Allen Luben freshman from Orlando Tremendous looking prospect Dane Goodwin needs to assert himself Hasnt taken a shot yet Were almost halfway through this first stanza Heres Ryan against Couture Cormarmac lost it on the dribble Turned it over Couture to the floor and a foul on Ryan Maybe out of frustration for the grad student from New York City Fourth on Notre Dame But thatll bring us to a break in the action A little back and forth offensive execution Hunter Couture best perimeter defender Cormarmac Ryan iron sharpens iron and afterwards lets him know youre a little too short Justin Mut says Okay if hes short then what are you With the skyhook of sorts bodied him in the ACC championship at 13 NCAA tournaments two elite eights 15 and 16 And of course hes picked up some partying gifts I might say Well let me tell you it speaks to Coach Ks loyalty but also what Coach Bray meant to him along the ride Coach K returned for one game this year at Cameron and is when Notre Dame played there He wanted to be there to support his guy and the relationship that theyve had for so many decades Yep Couture Heres Padulla Miss of a three Ryan on the run through for Notre Dame Lets Hammond go with a left hand And Rodney Rice collects it for the Hokes Well you can see why theyre excited about Rodney Rice cant you Jordan Oh no question plays with a good feel too Understands pace tempo makes proper decisions and can shoot it Yeah Came out of Damatha the number 10 combo guard in the country Had some ankle issues and a finger injury after his debut And Trey Wartz with a awkward looking shot An afterthought Left his feet Credit to Padulla was with him there the whole time And thought when he left his feet he could deliver a pass Had nothing Forced the shot Rice Nope And the rebound for Luben and finally collects it Hasnt been the offensive excellence we expected here in the first 10 minutes This failure to make some shots good looking ones for the most part Cant complete Its been fast to both ends but its not been necessarily organized Hammond over the top of Padulla Nope In fact now with the Hammond miss these two teams are 10 of 28 from the floor And of course we sent first one to 80 or 90 Might want to back that off to 75 Correct Yeah were taking I heard you talking Hunter Couturs dropped a couple of triples Drop coverage You cant do that against such a confident shooter and such an efficient one Substitutions wait at the table for both schools Mike Brays on a knee over there Hes not checking in Wartzes now Cormarmac right Look at Couture defensively Cormarmac a long three and Rice will run it down to the baseline Sevenpoint lead for Virginia Tech with 920 to go Applause kid Heres Mutz Think kid trying to shield Leashes Gets it right back and could not finish Point blank when the buddy becomes a bear Wes Applause Wartz Notre Dame with a two screen set Wartztz a three No theyre good looks both ways Jordan These are looks that both teams would live with I mean this is part of the inner fabric of who they are offensively just not completing Padulla soft jump shot from the right baseline First field goal for Shawn Padulla Six nothing run by the Hokes to push it to a ninepoint lead Virginia Tech as Jordan told you won the meeting at South Bend 93 to 87 back on the 11th of February Theres a Virginia Tech foul and stoppage of play will allow substitutions to take place as Padulla picks up his first Thats just the second on the Hokes Matt Sona is into the lineup for the first time on the 69 240lb junior who played a careerhigh 19 minutes and had 10 points the other night at Clemson Cormarmac Ryan very aggressive hunting his shot here in the first half Seen a couple go in kind of hit a cold streak here with some clean looks Yep Hokei still on that run here Seven nothing run over the last three and a half Notre Dame hadnt had a point in the last four and a half Seven to shoot for Couture Works his way into traffic all the way through Pushed it up and Zona Notre Dames missed their last seven from the floor Ryan turned it over to Couture who played the pass great Heres Rice Flips it up Collins the catch and the layup The effort from Couture to get it out early to Rice gave them the advantage heady play in the open floor as the Hokes taken firm control here in the last few minutes of this game Nine nothing run has made an 11point lead here But its the its the look ahead the deflection from Couture sees Rice pushes it out then it ultimately lands at MJ Collins who gets the finish 31 hits seven of nine from three Thats how he can go when he starts feeling it Starting to come alive here a little bit making plays Him and Justin Mut are two of the best leaders coach said hes ever coached But speaking of leaders oh man leading the Hokes athletic department right now an achievement playing for a one seat Yep Kenny Brookss team of course and Liz Kley Georgia Amore Kayla King thats uh Lizs sister Raven to the right and Khloe Brooks whos also a member of the team Kennys daughter Coach Brooks achieved some history here this past week Tell you what really cool to see a remarkable job by Kenny Brooks and Virginia Tech And of course Liz Kitley

Coach Brooks over the summer in Amelia Island for the ACC coaches meetings Yep And just came away with like wow that thatd be a fun guy to play for Yep Uh those young women are going to achieve at a high level And certainly they did And then I just remember thinking hows he so chill in CAS the way he is when theyve got the same bloodlines And he said oh CA has always been like that I remember laughing Yeah CA is one of a kind man Big Bro Yep Kenny and Cory Cousins right 7 minutes to go Notre Dame got a pair of free throws from Hammond and Couture answers right back Triple from Hunter out front Applause This a locked in hokey squad Yep sure is And they are defensively really grinding Yeah and leading is zero Good one A three Good for Dane Goodwin Hes got to be more aggressive Thats his first look And theres been spells especially down the stretch here in the season where Dane just hasnt taken the bull by the horn so to speak and say I need to go chase mine Theyre at their best and most dynamic when he has that mentality Elijah Potit is the big on the floor for the Hokes Big 34 Credit Zona there Couture tried to put him in a blender Yeah Slid his feet moved laterally even on the drive Stayed down and disciplined to block the shot Lead is nine Hammond trying to find a seam Heres Goodwin trying to take Collins into traffic and air one from in the lane Collins will bring it into the front court for the Hokes Applause A little dangerous here for Notre Dame I think Rice a three Pot couldnt corral it Good ones got it Potits an immovable force There he is Credit Zona for battling the best he could Bot listed at 265 You can believe it Theres that muscle Feels like its more than that Notre Dame in need of a bucket Just one of their last nine Hammond another three Oh Marcus Hammond Couture worked his tail off Tried to help tried to recover had to contest Shooters are going to shoot Double figures for Hammond First guy in the ball game to 10 Sixpoint lead for the Hokes Lobot overthrown Hammond kept it alive Heres works Zona catch and shoot three Applause Cornett is jealous Zonas fourth three of the year Well for one I didnt love the idea of words giving it to Zona trailing He has that in his bag but all the shooters filling lanes Didnt have Zona on the bingo card He shut me up real quick And West Thurm you work with me long enough to know thats hard to do Irish coming alive Words draws two Couture out of place Disrupted the lucky lefty Hammond And then Matt Zona going coastal Banks down to three Music Online personal styling Whats that Thats Stitch Fix And

have fun Yep Wing it Heres Mutz trying to back in on Wartz Justin up strong and gets his third field goal Eight first half points for Justin Mutz I think as some of the messaging over the years from coach Bray and one of the last games I had with them was Carolina and Notre Dame and he said everybody talking about Carolina being desperate Have they not seen us all year I think were firmly more desperate than Carolina But thats the disarming that he does to get his guys to be loose and take the pressure off them to just go play rolling and scores 12 in the first half Marcus Hammond Hammonds playing great basketball Sure is Catching and has a plan Playing a triple threat and then making a move every time Has a plan with the ball But turns on Zona Front rim miss Been great defensively Yeah Basils come back on the floor as well So they play Mutz and Bazili together with Rice Collins and Padulla And the Irish counter with their two bigs in Zona and Lasheski Boy Goodwin wants a little bump here from Zona Trey Wartz launches for the tie Airballed it out of bounds But Justin Muntz is doing his work here JC Justin Mutz is a dynamic piece and hes been productive here early Pair of free throws three field goals and right here versz get your weight up against two three defenders the finger roll Monday night 900 Eastern selection special of Nothing But Net right here on ACC Network of

Barry and Hunter Couture Barry faking like hes working over there No Barrys working Im gonna tell you where Joel Barry and Hunter Couture are on a list that is kind of interesting about the old ACC tournament Heres Basilia three Dont leave me on We were talking about this tournament and the kind of the uniqueness of it The most outstanding player award the ever case award in the last six years Three times its been won by players who were not all ACC Three times last six years Hunter Couture last year Michael Dvau in 21 as Zona ties the game Might be Matt Zona this year It could be But Joel Barry wanted it in 16 Of course he did Hey let me tell you that desk that nothing but net desk is the most talented desk ever put together in television history Speaking of the case award heres Basil shooting back into the lead They got three national champions on that desk Are you kidding me But you know what They got two Case award winners because Carlos Boozer won the Evercase Award in the 2002 tournament There you go John Sh by the way who coaches Duke was the 09 winner Wess knowledge unparalleled Its why you are who you are We got a trip and a foul off the ball on Mutz Where do you keep all that stuff in there That that dome of yours Matt Zod this is what its about Give guys given a lift in unexpected forms Look Ive seen him and shoot around in practice Hes smiling cuz hes like Finally I can show everybody this skill set that I possess Having fun Having fun playing loose Irish nothing to lose Cormarmac Ryan hard drive and a score Hes gotten that edge on Hunter Couture a few times now Seven for Cormarmac Ryan Hooks by one with 142 to go Whats changed here in the old Notre Dame firepower in the last five Well for one Zona has given him a lift with that shot Dane Goodwins connected on one and Cormarmac Ryan continues to pursue those driving lanes Not to mention double figures for Marcus Hammond Starting to have balance Braves team can take the lead in the final 90 seconds here Hammond has been sparkling Plus they got good ones early They just werent falling Now the balls starting to go in for the Irish Coach Bray will never be concerned offensively about what they do because he knows they can put the ball in the basket Its the defense which has been crushing to this team this season Theyre going to call a foul on Couture Now what quarterback Ryans done here is smart He understands Hunter Couture is an aggressive on ball defender And if youre going to get up there and be that aggressive I need to meet that with an aggressive offensive approach as well to Cormarmac Ryans benefit attacking that gap and driving lane Five fouls on Virginia Tech Notre Dame has three here in this first half Hammond on the drive and Notre Dame in front Marcus Hammond getting whatever he wants as the Irish take their first lead of the evening in the final minute of the first half Onepoint lead Padulla trying to answer Oh nicely done Shawn Padulla How about the body control suspended in the air to deliver the basketball all the way through for his sixth point Its the offense we were expecting right Wes Little back and forth five Yep 9second differential shot clock to game clock as we work our way down this opening 20 Im letting Marcus Hammond get a ball screen and try and get there again Heres Hammond Leaves it for Zona Blocked by Mutz Zona tried to keep it alive 12 seconds to go Padulla Couture Basili 5 seconds for Grant Almost traveled with it Gets it to Mutz at the horn and thatll do it Halftime here in Greensboro of our final first round game Virginia Techs going to take a onepoint lead here Jordan they got to credit Marcus Hammond for his toughminded drives that really lifted up this Irish team offensively And as they got the Yep We expected it to be full throttle at 94 ft And theres a look 12 field goals for each 12 five threes for each Rebounds virtually even Whats the score Pretty even game Yeah Im telling you its what you get Its had surges both ways Eight to shoot And heres Hammond again In a lot of ways similar programs here and how theyre run Long two Good 16 for Hammond on his sixth field goal Jordan and this is big because with JJ Starling out with injury with that knee injury that most likely keeps him out for the remainder of the season you need this from someone Counters for the Hokes Hes into double figures You saw Justin Mutz is just now one basket from the floor and a couple of rebounds away from his sixth double double against the league this year Its another great match up for Hammond Hammond into traffic Ryan lets go get it back Hes got Bazili on it Lets point the match up Cormarmac Ryan slips it Lashes scoreless first half Hell drive Padulla all the way to the rim and score Irish get you into rotations Have a few different opportunities to exploit a mismatch It could have been Bazili on Hammond but instead its Lasheski on Padulla for the drive Teams exchange leads here first couple of possessions of this second half Collins almost fell down and the shot spins out for Nate Lasheski Lasheski by the way only took three first half shots Yeah him and Goodwin were were pretty quiet in that first half two of these leaders that came back and for good reason till the till the year kind of took the turn it did Wartz tried to drive it on Bazili and had it rejected by the big man Good patience here and discipline from Bazili took the the shoulder into the into the chest but undeterred stayed with and used his length for the block 13 to shoot for Hammond and the Irish Hamilton will drive Basil Oh little crossover and flip Got his own rebound Couldnt score it Basil finally collects it for the Hokes Music Applause and a foul on Hammond trying to play over the top of the screen But I like the idea understanding Padoula is a dangerous threat from three You cant afford to go under Youve got to fight through over the top Youll live with that Just got to play cleaner But I like the decision making Not giving up the three Yep Theyre going over top of all these screens You can tell from the Irish defense Couture fired it right by Collins out of bounds AJ Desai and Lee Cassell going to come together and they finally collaborate and say it last touch by Notre Dame One guy always happy one guy always like what Cant please them all It never fails though Basili Little wraparound dribble and scores 10 for Grant Bazili And now its just becoming a match something here early in this second half Favorable matchup for the guy with the basketball in his hands and the ability to convert plays Good one Heres Wartz Feels like Hammonds got to get some help if Notre Dames going to win this Five to shoot and hes stepped back three on Bazil Whoa Now and now thats where Hammond can do it A few times he tried to take it right into the chin of Bazili and he got thrown off He created space to deliver the jumper and Padulla answers Heres the game Jordan Cornet advertised for you in the first half There we go These two teams have found their rhythm firmly into who they are and its two teams that can fill it up and light up a scoreboard Here we go now Warts and Goodwin You know Dane Goodwin wants to get in on this Backs down on Mud Squeezes around Can I finish Mutz did a nice job on the box out Good one tried to rush it to kind of catch Mutz off guard Didnt work Padulla had six threes on Saturday against Florida State And Mutz and Hammond got tied up but Jeff Han has called Marcus Hammond for his third And Hammonds got to be careful now cuz now Hammonds got three as we see Padoul on his step back Loses Hammond rises and fires And then Hammond elects to not drive it all the way but use a step back of his own to create the space on the bigger defender in Bazil But now Hammond with threes taken out of his rhythm goes to the bench and an Irish offense who struggled to score it without him now vulnerable And another Notre Dame foul that Zona it was Matt Zona his first third on the Irish of course he came off Brays bench in the first half knocked down a couple of threes when the Irish were making that run Applause New 20 for the Hokes Good job Ryan Good good job of chasing there Mutz got away with the walk Yep Sure did Gets the basket Got away with the walk 12 points now on five field goals for Justin Mutz Hi lead is three And Hammond goes right back to the table to check back in for the Irish Ryan Heres Zona lobbing for Lasheski Nice catch and score I mean thats all day if Lashes decides he wants to supplant himself Liter on the low block and catch and finish over a guy whos not nearly in size to challenge him Virginia Tech lead cut to one and turned over by Vasili Mike Young not happy He wanted a whistle there Heres Cormarmac Ryan on the drive into traffic Lowered the shoulder put it up Zona will follow and theres a whistle from AJ Decided We have a basket awarded here Lets find out Foul is on Brazil Itll be his second Itll be the first on Virginia Tech Music and Mike Bray knowing that if you dont win its all over at South Bend Music Well before were done here Saturday night in Greensboro at the New York Life ACC tournament I think youre going to get plenty of noise In fact I wouldnt be surprised if he gets cranked up about noon tomorrow I respect you too much to ask you to pick a winner because its too difficult Cormarmac Ryan knocks the free throw down Unless youre feeling froggy go ahead man I look Ill tell you exactly what I said in game one or earlier game with you I Anybody playing tomorrow yes is in the mix Its in the mix with the four that are still lump with the lump them in with the double buys Im with you and dont count out that seven seed I know its been invogue to count them out because theyve underperformed but Carolina still dangerous And remember we told we told you the story in the first game Boston College came within an overtime basket of going to the semifinals and theyre probably going to have Quinton Post I would imagine We have not been told anything Theres a good chance Quinton Post may suit up to take on Armando Bayon Thatd be fun That is his first So Basil will go to the line after the Lasheski foul 610 grad student Jupiter Florida Nate Lasheskys first and Basils free throw is good Dont forget Saturday afternoon triple header of lacrosse Well start on the womens side presented by Ally Syracuse and Notre Dame from the JMA And then well go to the mens side Number two Notre Dame number nine Ohio State at two And then Lars Tiffany and top ranked Virginia welcome Talson to Charlottesville All on ACC Network streaming live on the ESPN app Elijah Potit from about 3540 minutes away Reedsville North Carolina Transfer from Rice onto the floor now from Virginia Techs perspective with Looks like he has had a carb in his entire life Yeah hes pretty rocked up So thats what So thats what discipline with a diet looks like Thats cool right The miss the rebound We can all hope right I gave that up a long time ago Wes I think I was before you Heres Mutz on the drive and before Vin Allen Luben I think is going to be ticketed and is by Jeff Pondub freshman from Orlando Good looking prospect now An important piece for the transition that is coming here in Notre Dame And thats a guy you got to keep I believe thats try and build not necessarily around but he can be a key piece moving forward because of what he can be on that low block as he evolves and develops Still very raw zona a foul collision under the basket That is six now on Notre Dame with the second on Matt Zona and thats uncanny I mean theyre not typically a team thats going to get youre going to get into the bonus and get from the free throw line but defensively who theyve been this year they they can have that pension for violating which has been uncharacteristic of years past with coach Brays team Zona and Ryan are out Lashes and Goodwin came back on the hustle Torrens got to go get that back Heres Potit against Lasheski Elijah with a right hand Missed it and pulled away by Hammond Skip to the corner Good one Loads up for three And Couture the rebound and Wade Heres AJ Desai And its Collins on a clear out underneath the Notre Dame basket AJ Desai all over that call Not doesnt seem like a lot of resistance from the Hokes Collins knew he must have been caught with his hand in the cookie jar Shot goes up Good one Narrowly evades being out of bounds on the catch and shoot And yeah he definitely caught up Lashesky there on the blockout Right call Second on Collins Second on the Hokes And now another one Its on Couture Its his second The Irish generating second chance opportunities Did not have that on the bingo card this evening Wartz going to have to load it for Hammond who caught it right in no mans land at the midline Wartz again off the screen Lashes really wants the basketball Hes got to win here in isolation Hes got to win this matchup Rolls back Cannot score it Collect before you offer Hes getting sped up against a smaller defender Take all the time in the world Helps not coming Youre in isolation Take your time delivering the basketball You can still see that discomfort cuz thats not truly Lasheskis game Back to the basket Heres Collins Kick out Padulla three Strong close out from Lasheski Make him shoot over 610 He altered that shot with the effort And now Lasheski is going to be called for a foul Completely frustrated Lee Cassell on the whistle And Mike Bray felt like it was a flop from Padulla who was clearly overmatched down low You get the luxury of the look down low here You got to look on that right block Ah thats a flop You cant call that Thats a flop Coach Bray doesnt like it Dont Dont strain yourself now coach Seventh team foul No free throws Heres Rice young freshman from Damatha with Padulla here Seven minutes gone in this second half and its a onepoint game Rice trying to square up Good one All the way through Turned it over to Hammond They hurry They got twoonone Trey Wartz stripped and knocked away by Fedulla Itll stay with the Irish and Mike Bray pointed two shots and was soft jogging down in front of the Notre Dame throwing his right hand up in the air as if to say he was in the active shooting coach is staring his Notre Dame coaching life right in front of him here in the final 13 minutes Hes going to milk it for all its worth Yame hoping hell get a favorable whistle in what could be his last game here in Notre Dame Oh my goodness So Leashes comes out Cormarmac Ryan is back in the ball game Inbounds to Ryan working on Couture Thats been quite a matchup tonight by the way And an offensive foul is going to be called on Cormarmac Ryan Coaches Coach Bray is getting teetering towards that line Theatrics here Lets take a look Its not a charge I dont think the armbar came out to warrant the whistle but aggressive defense may have helped guide it towards getting that charge call from Couttor Virginia Tech is guarding it tonight And now WZ reaches in to try and strip Potit commits the foul So that is now nine on Notre Dame and free throws for Elijah Potit who has not scored in the last two ball games Only averaged seven minutes of contest for Mike Young to close the regular season 75 free throw shooter is the Rice transfer And that spins out Still a onepoint game Jordan Each schools fighting through a little bit of a scoring drought of almost three minutes And Patique missed them both Weve had some eb and flow here havent we We just what we thought We picked up that offensive rhythm Its kind of slowed to a halt but weve seen enough of these two teams to know it could come back at any moment Enter Cormarmac Ryan Look Cormarmac on a catch He understands the defender whos coming at him And Hunter Couture gets up in you and a few times Cormarmac said Okay if youre going to do that Im going to rip through and drive it And hes had success Cormarmac Ryan the pre the field goal Hes got 11 now Couture lost it off his foot over the inline Itll belong Hero ball from Hunter Couture Lost the match up on the other side Came down here and said I got to win Had nothing Too much ball stopping Got to move it Its when the Hokes are the most dangerous Yeah Eight minutes gone Second half onepoint game Notre Dame Two of those four turnovers came in the last three possessions They went for about 14 minutes without a turnover And look it works Oh no Hammond beg your pardon squeeze through and score It was such a blur Its hard for you to see I mean my man is cutting him up 21 for Hammond Its a season high He had 20 earlier this year against Pit Irish by three and Ryan going to be called for the foul Yes Second on Cormarmac Ryan 10 on Notre Dame Tough guard play from the Irish willing them to a lead here in the second half Cormarmac Ryan trying to get Hunter Couture off him Decides to drive it Rise finish And then Marcus Hammond crossover killer into the paint Gets back to

balance with the Hokes which makes them more dangerous Zona offensive foul Matt Zonas third player control No free throws for Virginia Tech Lets take a look Zona on the drive Lowered that left shoulder into the chest of Bazil Absolutely the right call Good defense from the big fella moving laterally Zona also playing outside of himself a little bit there Padulla Virginia Tech trailing one Pili down low has an advantage Put it up Zona blocked it Trey Wartz and the Irish Cormarmac Ryan against Rodney Rice Tease one up Front rim miss for Ryan Feels like really Cormarmac Ryan and Marcus Hammond are the only two interested in making offensive plays Padulla eludes Goodwin and rolls one in on the front 11 for Shawn Padulla Applause Hi back in front Applause I dont know how its going to finish but the Irish are not going to go quietly tonight Not with whats on the line Hammond But again neither are the Hokes Good one The layup and one And for Dane Goodwin who look he hes just a reserve guy by nature And I think at times that hurts him out there on the floor because he can become disconnected without the basketball Having the ball in his hands making a play like that may infuse him back into this game One as tight as it is Matt Zona gave Irish great minutes as he goes back to the bench Second foul on Mutz and Goodwin gets the threepoint trip Hes got six now Had just three in Saturday nights loss at Clemson and only one double figure game in the last four for the grad student from outside Columbus Ohio Irish by two Lob for Bazili Ryan tried to fight it and I think Cormarmac Ryan just picked up his third Yeah hes going to pick up his third So now youve got Hammond and Ryan with three fouls your two best offensive threats And suddenly the Irish become kind of vulnerable here Itll be interesting to see what coach Bray elects to do with a very physical guard in Cormarmac Ryan It kind of has to adjust his game here So here is Bazili at the line and the first one off the rim Dont forget ACC baseball game of the week comes up on Friday night Number 19 NC States in Miami Game one of their threegame sets right here at 7 oclock on ACC Network and also available on the ESPN app Second free throw for Basil Hes got 12 in the ball game four in the second half Collins is in Basil is out So Virginia Tech really sizes down here a little bit Much the tallest Hokei on the floor This is when you have to play through Lashevki And a foul on Collins He was digging in MJ Collins will pick up his third I mean thats 610 verse 64 Wes like you have to play through Nate Lashesky at this point until they put much back on him Now Hammond can try and have his way on the perimeter against a guy like Collins Long lead for Goodwin Applause Ryan against Couture Cormarmac squeezes around What a tough shot I havent seen many guys have the success in driving lanes against Hunter Couture in this conference as Ive seen from Cormarmac Ryan this evening Threepoint lead and the Irish force a turnover Heres WZ Ryan in the corner Good one against Couture Fights in front of the glass and cant score Good defensive stand there from Hunter Couture Didnt bite on any of the head fakes from Dane Goodwin Patient and disciplined defensively Drive for Padulla and last touch by Virginia Tech I thought that one went out on Cormarmac Ryan 901 to play and another look here at the scoop from Cormarmac I mean Cormarmac right here again just trying to take it right at Hunter I didnt think he had an angle contorted his body to deliver it by extending that right arm out just enough to get the angle Mike Bray has said that his grad student from New York City is going to be a success in whatever he chooses to do I asked Ryan about the statement yesterday Cormarmac said hes very nice to say that He said I may be really good at business but Im going to chase this dream of basketball as long as I can You know what youre not going to tell Cormarmac Ryan is no Yep And I believe if the rest of the team matched his level of heart this year I think the season may have looked very different for the Irish Im just going to say that flatly Knocked it away Justin at the other end Little euro and score Talk about a unique skill set Justin Mutz able to control his body with elite footwork And we have some energy in the building Wes Yeah Onepoint game Zona whos been a threat from the perimeter Hammond is the games leading scoreer Wartz off the zona screen with six to shoot Been a quiet night for Trey Wartz Fall away short Onepoint lead for Notre Dame And here are the Hokes Padulla back for Bazili Cannot crack the wall Mad Zona Got to move it or unless he wants to keep it and drive it on Zona but got to move it Mutz tried to lob Basil the catch Oh no Collins a corner three and Leski runs down the rebound and a foul on Padulla Silly move from Shawn Padulla Unnecessary Second foul on Padulla Six on Virginia Tech Onepoint lead for Notre Dame Seven and a half to go Jordan were taking this one to the wire Hey how about that footwork Like West Durham on a dance floor The twostep and the finger roll You love to see it here at Greensboro Its March Maybe onepoint lead for Notre Dame 734 to go Game three of the first round of this 70th annual Atlantic Coast Conference basketball tournament presented by New York Life that Mike Brain knows all too well about twopossession games Oh and this is what you were talking about the little things the details right And I think its most surprising to many because of its an old group Its a its a battle tested group and those are the teams you expect to win the tight ones but thats just not been in the DNA of this Irish squad Meanwhile look at a Hokes group that I think can go very far this week Theyve got to survive here against Notre Dame Hammond and the Irish with the ball and a onepoint lead And Ryan Applause 15 to shoot Applause Very quiet night Nate on the drive Kick out for Zona Applause Matt Matt Zonas got three threes and the lead is four And I am confident this was not on the scouting report for Coach Youngs squad I mean maybe an ability there but hes knocked down three big time threes for the Irish this evening Largest lead of the night for Brays team Mutz offensive foul and Cormarmac Ryan is keyed up 17 foul on Virginia Tech with 646 to go This is just Cormarmac Ryan understanding Justin Mutz is going to bring the pain in that matchup Again like I said on the other side heavy cell from Cormarmac Ryan felt more flopish than charge Six and a half to go Basili hedges on a double team and now follows Zona Theres some respect Heres Hammond 11 to shoot Irish are trapped on one side Ryan working with Collins Cormarmac reversed through Muntz had it lost it Ball went to the next shot clock violation Well send it to Virginia Tech Cormarmac Ryan very lucky playing with fire Almost got his fourth foul after the giveaway Would have really compounded the mistake there Ryan probably a little overzealous on the bounce Beautiful inside Bazil beautiful symmetry Y catches at the high post Mutz Bazili knows to come from that dunker spot make himself a receiver Beautiful basketball amongst the bigs That front line of the Hokes 14 points now for Bazili Hammond has really sparked Notre Dame tonight But switches to Ryan with 10 to shoot deep three Wow Cormarmac Ryan now 16 in the ball game nine in the second half And that was his second triple My goodness Jordan Cormarmac Ryan You wonder why hes not ready for business Cuz hes got some business to attend to on a hardwood from Charlotte Cormarmac Ryan feeling it Fourpoint lead for Notre Dame And Cormarmac Ryan Jordan Cornett is leading Notre Dame and not just on the floor Yeah hes hes a competitor And the guy hes going right at headtohead on the other side is equally as much of a competitor And Hunter Couture These guys are the lifeline They are the straw that stirs the drink emotionally and in terms of motivating their group Uh but no doubt about it Cormarmac Ryan has taken the reigns from what Marcus Hammonds has done as the scorer and its been a Cormack Ryan show here down the stretch Wartz Lashesky Ryan Hammond Goodwin on the floor for the Irish Rice has returned with Collins Couture Padulla and Justin Mutz And on Q heres Dane Goodwin trying to circle into traffic against Couture twice C spun left it short I think its really fascinating the Irish elect to go at one of the top two defenders on the Hokes team at Hunter Couture to try and generate your basket And now we get a quick timeout and Mike Young is sending Grant Bazili to the to the scores table cuz its offense time Y the New York Life ACC tournament continues all week on the ESPN family of networks But here are the stakes right now The winner of this will meet number six seed NC State Both teams lost relatively tight one games single games during the regular season to the Wolfpack Seven teams maybe even eight have a chance to win this thing this week Its a wild number Wes Yep Two and a half to go Padulla with 10 to shoot Couture bounce pass Basil the catch and score Couture does a fantastic job coming off the curl playing off two delivering the bounce pass in traffic for the finish from Bazil Twopoint game Hokei fans showed up Yep Hammond to work on Bazill Foul line good Marcus Hammond 23 tonight for the Niagara transfer This Irish backcourt of Cormack Ryan and Marcus Hammond have had a clap back at every turn Fourpoint game Mutz kick out Rice Hello First ACC tournament points for freshman Rodney Rice A triple to pull the Hokes to within one Two teams executing offensively here down the stretch I mean couple impressive plays Watch Couture with momentum coming off this thing gets in the paint draws two dumps down to Basil Quick decision from Basil to get it up on the rim And then right here Hammond exploits the matchup Basil the defender fakes the drive step back and then Rice been quiet steps into that one with momentum gives him the three And we got a onepoint deal here Irish lead 6261 And Coach Bray might find out what his future is on a final possession in this game here this evening First bench points of the night for Virginia Tech You saw Virginia Tech assistant Kevin Gilner really going through the defensive sets for Mike Youngs team Tell you man I mentioned these Hokes fans being here Them fans never disappoint Nope Every time Never Inside two onepoint game Wartz Hammond and Ryan have been driving the Irish most of the night Lashes a three missed Good one tried to slap it out Padoulas got it Less than 90 seconds to go What a huge three from Rice By the way heres Padulla lost it Ryans got the turnover and then Padulla took it back Lead for months and Virginia Tech leads A broken play at both ends of the floor And now Bray wants his team to get it into the front court and call a timeout And thats what theyll do with 52 seconds left Virginia Tech has regained the lead And we had a busted play at both ends turned over by the Hokes and then Padulla with a take away from Ryan It looked like it was just going to be an unfortunate sequence for Padulla But Cormarmac Ryan never got his footing with momentum going the other way but he still continued to try and push it unaware of what was behind him Cormarmac should have elected to compose himself get the basketball run one and instead its a run out the other way for Justin Mut Just a chaotic sequence Ill tell you everybody on pins and needles in the building A program in the Hokes that just want a chance to survive and advance and a group with Notre Dame thats not ready to say goodbye to 23 years of achievement with Coach Bray on the sidelines We saw Cormarmac Ryan hobbling a little bit and here is why Watch the ankle right there We saw Matthew Cleveland of Florida State have an ankle sprain and he came back and was trying to contribute Ended up not able to play for Florida State But tell you aint going to tell Cormack Ryan decide these last 52 seconds Hes playing Jordan Yeah right Yeah Thats like telling you not to talk to anybody at the ACC tournament Certain things just arent possible Yeah Or maybe you when you get to South Bend Yeah Right Those are hecklers Those arent fans Theres a distinct difference between the two I keep trying to tell you this You just mentioned a moment ago the winningest coach in Notre Dame basketball history Down one with a minute Cormarmac Ryans got to get the basketball here Hammond And we got a foul on Padulla Thats going to put Zona at the line Not ideal for the Irish Weve seen one attempt from him Thats 10 by the way on Virginia Tech and it is the third on the sophomore Shawn Padulla And so theyre going to go to the monitor just simply because of the contact Well take a look on the replay Its going to be coming down Thats contact on the face and a kick This might go the other way That was excessive from Zona Virginia Tech They might look at this and there very well could be a reverse This should go way of the Hokes Wes So its 10 fouls which would mean two shots And you see the I think this might end up being the Virginia Tech trainer looking at Shawn Padulla I mean Jeff Pon and Lee Cassell have gone to the monitor here Youve got that hand to the face right Now theyll need to determine if that was incidental Thats part of it But then youve got the kick that comes in a second half of this as well I dont It was the first angle we saw And forgive me here We were looking at one angle of Zona coming off the wing I couldnt tell if he got taken off balance I saw him make the contact but was he off balance And thats what theyll need to determine here The intent from Zona coming across See Bazill is trying to help Theres Ryan screen And thats hard to determine the intent It does not look good The visual as well as the kick I think thats got to be a flagrant one Wes you hate to see the game come down to this and whats been boom boom I just dont see how you dont call that right And a long look here Remember there are a couple different factors at play One is the play itself The other is the clock and so forth that goes behind that with of course under a minute to go Yeah that that thats got a Applause its tough Its a tough call but as I see it as my eyes look thats a flagrant one to me Looked like he hit the back of Collins foot that took him off bounce Nonetheless youre right The contacts clearly made Meanwhile Shawn Padullis putting the ice on the lip here Applause Theyre trying to sort this out The discussion takes place now with the three officials Music And its a onepoint game with 42 to go The foul was a block on Shawn Padulla but now that theyve looked at it all the things leading up to heavy deliberation here they understand the gravity of the decision that will be made here in the last 42 and a hook Applause So AJ Desai Jeff Pawn and Lee Cassell Crazy to think 23 years of coaching on the sideline for coach Bray hangs in the balance here and an ability for the Hokes to survive and advance and defend their tournament title from a year ago All this weights in the wings You got to love sports Come on Yeah come on Wes And we showed you all those onepossession two possession games that Notre Dame had played in the ACC this year And and and now I I think coach coach Brays angling for lets get a decision right Lets get back to basketball right Theres 42 and a half Its been so much fun down the stretch and its being deflated You you got to you got to get this right But youre off of the monitor now at this point So guys lets make the decision and go Were about to find out And AJ Desai talking to Mike Bray Jeff Pond talking to Mike Young Music and Lee Cassell is handling the scorebook and the game management across the way Ill tell you from the reaction youre not seeing a lot of emotion from coach Bray AJs going to make his way over Stand by Wes All right so AJ Desai will tell Jordan Music Okay The common foul on Padulla And theres a dead ball on Matt Zona So we got a common foul on common foul padulla Zona gets two shots The technical is called on Zona for the hands of the face Virginia Tech two shots and because of the literature and itll also be Virginia Tech basketball Got it Thank you So there we go You have to make by the way the foul on Zona gives him five So I dont believe he can shoot the free throws and Trey Wartz Trey Wartz will shoot the free throws and thats a win for the Irish in that regard So Zona fouls out with nine That is a blessing in disguise for the Irish that WZ would now get an opportunity to shoot those free throws And now Trey WZ is called to the line to shoot the free throws Im not quite sure whats transpiring Padoula Virginia Tech asking questions as Works makes the first The theater in this building right now Wow Trey WZ transferred from Santa Clara to the Notre Dame program and those are his first free throws of the night and pretty cool to make it a onepoint Notre Dame lead Now here is Padulla and hell shoot the dead ball technical on Zona That was his fifth foul by the way And then Virginia Tech will get the basketball Applause Performance from Words to convert two under the circumstances Padulla free throw good Second best free throw shooter in the ACC at 87 Two teams that make their free throws as well Similar in that regard Yep Tied at 64 Second one no good So now the Hokes will get the basketball Applause and theyll get it at the other end of the floor here at the Coliseum in Greensboro So not much gain a point shift in reality but a possession for the Hokes here Applause Music scoops it up breaks the timeline Applause Basil on the floor Hes playing with four Much a free path and a dunk Thats a heck of a play for Hunter Couture Hunter Couture just took care of two defenders to open up the path That is such high IQ basketball from Hunter Couture allowing Mutz to lean Twopoint lead Hammond going to work Its been a big night Heres Good one Cormarmac wants it 13 to shoot 3se second differential Ryan on the drive Missed the layup And a foul called on Lasheski after the Virginia Tech rebound If Im Mike Bray Im okay with number five trying to tie the game Cormarmac Ryan got to where he wanted to but going back Watch seal him off here Screens two guys Screens two guys West that allows Mutz to get there A human blockade allows the two hand off from Mutz Then on the other side look Cormarmac just his footing has failed him twice now in the most important moments Unfortunate sequences Padulla misses the free throw Notre Dame has one timeout remaining Make or miss Got a rebound Going to get an opportunity Its going to be one possession either way You call a timeout Jordan I think if youre Virginia Tech youll foul Im Virginia Tech Im fouling him So a 60second timeout will be taken by the Hokes here This is all goes down to what you do in this position If Im Coach Young Im fouling putting them at the free throw line Im not allowing a threepoint look Not with the Notre Dame team and their pinchant and ability to knock down a three in those moments Its a twoshot situation If if Virginia Tech elects to foul here Jordan its a two shot situation Its a threepoint game Now Mike Young can foul in the back court Wes my whole thing is I dont want my defense chaotic I dont want to give Notre Dame an opportunity for the look from three I want to control the controllables I want to allow them to shoot free throws See if they can make them in that pressurized situation We can rebound I believe our team can make our free throws on the other side I play those percentages more so than giving a scattered chaotic look for the Irish from three Well quick reminder as we show you the bracket here of the ACC tournament presented by New York Life The winner gets NC State tomorrow in the last game of the second round Well have our coverage on ESPN at noon with Syracuse Wake Forest followed by Oh is Georgia Tech trying to wear a glass slipper here in Greensboro after a onepoint win earlier today against Florida State Now let me remind you in Charlottesville that Notre Dame knows how to execute the missed free throw Remember they got a clean look for Dane Goodwin in Charlottesville Youre absolutely right And he just couldnt convert it Mike Young knows that So where do you foul Notre Dame If you foul if you foul you want to lose a little bit of clock here You dont need a foul right away but you also dont want to foul any shooter in the act So theres a theres a fine line here Mike Braves illustrious career in South Bend Hanging in the balance Theyre going to play Here is Words coming into the four court Trey toward the corner Here is Hammond Blocked by Mutz and out of bounds with 19 left He blocked it then touched it when he was out of bounds As to the rule under two minutes two 19s an eternity Youre going to you can catch compose and get a clean look Yep So the ball I believe belongs here to Notre Dame in front of their own bench What a block by M How about the effort from Mutz and then he is touching the sideline Thats a nice piece of officiating by Lee Cassell All over it Lee Cassell all over it Theyre going to just do their due diligence Double check to look I think the clock is the issue here more than anything else So theyll get that set Remember back in the first ball game today we saw them add one10enth of a second on the Jayvon Franklin free throws Yeah cuz that went from what 2 to three Yep You talk about changing the game 3 allows you to catch it to the other end Thats a big point Thats a big one Theyre going to give 24 Thats a significant at a 05 Yep So here we go Here we go Lets go Can the Irish find a clean look here Trying to push the sun back up in the sky for one more day of Mike Bray at another day Extended for a little bit more extra basketball The Irish have four capable shooters Quite frankly five out there They can all get a look So if youre Virginia Tech you got to communicate switch everything Those are those are the message Thats the messaging coming from coach Youngs group Theyve hit eight of 20 from three tonight Zona had three of them Two for Hammond two for Cormarmac Ryan one for Dane Goodwin Coach Bray question is what do you have left atto here to determine what your immediate future looks like Is it on to the next thing or is there a little bit more time on the Notre Dame sidelines Hokes bring back Collins Rice Couture Padulla and Mutz Wartz will put it in play Lashes catch fake shot to tie It rims off and Virginia Tech will move on to the second round and Mike Bray after 24 years in South Bend The Irishs alltime leader in basketball wins with 483 will bid farewell here
