Grant is 3 and two in his ACC tournament history Jim Lena of course one in ACC tournament title as Miamis head coach and this is a pretty friendly building for him by the way he took George Mason to the final four out of Capital One Arena Quinton post to three itll spin out as were underway tonight in Washington Nigel pack is on the floor for Miami popper Cleveland Joseph omir round out the card for coach still omir and post worth the ticket price and omir gets the roll and its two nothing scoring over lyp isnt exactly norads specialty however hes a guy thats been able to get a gr bucket here to start this one Cory Mason Madson has a strong finish to this regular season in this BC lineup too he absolutely has hes provided that shooting touch that they need from Beyond The Arc well thats really where Boston College has excelled here late in the season especially against the hurricane you see the Miami Lineup and very quickly inside wga popper from Philadelphia is turned away it will stay with the Kings and there is poppler the Junior at 65 who shot 38 from the floor and had 11 double figure games against the ACC this year Miami finished the conference play at 6 and4 remember they were preseason third Cory behind Carolina and Duke I do remember that I believe were they second I think it second thats right they were in the top 10 as uh in a late November meeting at Kentucky in the ACC SEC challenge the coach talked about it injuries have hampered this team theyve only started eight games in ACC play with their regular starting lineup outside of that theyve always had one starter missing right back to omir against mlon kick out Matthew Cleveland and its 5 nothing on Clevelands 29th three of the Year Miami already is playing with that confidence that they had before and then they just look different mton claudell Harris Jr and here is Jaden Zachary on a very nice drive to get BC on the board but one of the reasons for that coach this is the original starting lineup for the Miami Hurricanes to start this season it was Nigel pack benley Joseph in the back court with this guy NORAD omir dominating the interior and look at omir just Bulls his way to his second field goal but his strength he knocked Quinton post so far off that that second jump allowed him to be able to tap it in easily yeah when he stays out of foul trouble its a big difference for them too mton heres Matson post working on omir Fall Away right hand hook bounds off too strong for him couldnt get there omir thought about the triple and hell get it to pack Nigel all the way through and a kick in the corner Bley Joseph post the rebound for Boston College BC won the two regular season meetings February 17th by 8 at Chestnut Hill and then last week midweek in the regular season by T at Coral gaes here is a story line pertaining to Nigel pack in both games three ball away from Harris is off the back Applause IR pack did not play in the first game Cory and then was injured in the second game with Miami leading only to see BC rally to win at Miami and WD Nigel pack has not scored in his last two games of action is I got James Zachary AKA JayZ who he will be referred to for the remainder of this game gets the easy bucket in transition P missed five of the last six he only played 13 minutes in the game at watsco Center he against the Eagles 0 for five in that game line back four games prior to that is omir was unable to knock down the three he was 0 for seven at Clemson so hes 0 for his last 12 in the two games that hes played Matson a fire and hit Mason Matson has H 20 plus against Miami and at NC State and hes got his 55th three of the Year there and Im not sure Mason Madson has ever had a bad hair day WD I mean talking about my guys got a great head of lce right y very nice and Im envious uh Joseph loops around omir Rees left it on the front rim you dont like the shot Jim well he hasnt been uh exactly shooting it well and hes much stronger inside hes got two buckets in there so Im not sure why hes out there post you like post I like it okay I said that before he shot it by the way it was in the air no question oh so youre saying you called that all right okay I really I just like his shoot him shooting up there I think hes a good threepoint shooter thats eight straight by the way from the Eagles to take the lead popper step back over Madson wga popper answers thats what has avoided Miami the entire ACC play if you go back to nonconference wga popper was shooting over 50 from three he struggled during ACC play battled injuries with that left ankle but looks like he may have found his shooting touch coming to DC mlon heres Harris post will try again and hit six for post theyre both from behind the Applause line Nigel pack launching and hits there it is hes on the board his first made field goal in his last three games played Nigel pack who was still questionable we watched himim ler trying to talk to him during their practice yesterday to make sure he was okay post thought about it on the drive and theyre going to count the basket I dont know and draw the foul out from underneath the basket will count omir draws the foul we get a timeout in Washington all of a sudden Quinton post knocks down a couple threes Cory and JayZ with the head up the kick ahead pass finding the shooter andag knocking down the three ball and then Quinton post from the top of the key it was so nice he had to do it tce when youre great play Jim L enega and Miami of course now in his 13th season at Coral Gables cor you said it pick second in the preseason start 112 finished on a nine game losing streak to end the regular season and a four and 14 Mark in 18 but though there were concerns in those two when you think about that 112 start those two losses one a blowout loss at Kentucky and also getting blown out in New York City on in bark Lays by Colorado so there were concerns coming into to ACC play and then the injuries hit which derailed their season Michael noo a freshman from Toronto is coming to the lineup he replaced omir in a Miami turnover post collects Quinton by the Ways got the last nine BC points Madson a pull up bounced away and noo slapped it out of bounds Ted Valentine says it will stay with the Eagles he hes on the whistle with Justin Porterfield and Tommy morisy Ted here in our third game Teddy working his 56th tournament here but hes told me already hes coming back next year so I guess doesnt matter no portal for Ted hes good 6 minutes in wga popper a spot up Zachary runs it down Cory how BC get this obviously post has been huge scoring but Eagles playing with a little more Comfort it feels like well theyve already knocked down three threepointers in this game two from post and thats him knocking down one so when you think about the strength of the Eagles and normally it would be their defense Earl granny a coach who hangs out defensively but its been their threepoint shooting this season thats helped them out 11 straight for post the lead is five there goes popper into traffic noo cant finish with post defending Earl Grant you H him at the top give yourself a Fighting Chance all we have to do is Advance Prince a league Bay back door heres Zachary scores nice offense by the Eagles and the cut from Zachary but more importantly the pump fake to get the shot Blocker in the air got a little contact on that one but not enough forl seven nothing run by the Eagles and were seven in to the first half Cleveland working against Prince of League Bay sophomore from Minneapolis theres a kick into the corner and a free ball is an air air ball from Wugga Applause popper WD you talked about Earl Grant saying give themselves a Fighting Chance well right now Boston College took the first punch from Miami now theyre punching back how will Miami respond after getting punched in the mouth because this has been Boston College for the last 6 minutes of this game getting whatever they wanted on the offensive end foul was going to be on popper and and thatll allow some substitutions to be made Harris goes out and Donald Han Jr hey nephew 66 freshman red shirt Virginia Beach Virginia checks in for Boston College in Earl Grant and heres omir coming back and we get Paul jobay 67 freshman from France there is Donald Han Jr a legacy if you will at the ACC tournament he absolutely was his father was recognized as an AC DC Legend back when we used to do that and right now 13 points for Quenton post already in this game Quint po going to be an ACC Legend off one game ninepoint lead for BC coach and a timeout because tell you what Miamis seen enough here the Fighting Chance that Earl Grant asked for well his team has responded in the early rounds in 101 here Jim good pass to set it up post is good in the PO he has good footwork but he uses both hands he goes to look comes back with his left hand and the ability to use both hands the time before he went right now he comes back left his footwork is good but its the ability to use both hands is why hes good down there again I think hes an underrated player and DC has had some really good success this year but then theyve played some games that you kind of wonder what happened because they got a veteran team and they got guys that know how to play theyve got shooting they got the inside presence I I think its a little surprising that they havent even been better this year Cory ninepoint lead post has got as many as Miami does yeah hes been spectacular throughout this game and I coach I can tell you why they havent been better its because this league has been really good well nobody wants to say that they thats the problem but you and I have said it all year and this is an example Ive watched this Boston College team beat St John who is a team that is right now on the cusp of getting into the NCAA tournament but I actually called the game where they beat St Johns in New York City Matson another three Cory again that has been the thing for them especially against Miami they shot over 40 and now on a 120 run and most of the damage is being done from Beyond The Arc already Five May threepointers for the Eagles and a hell ball will stay with Miami forgive me four four of eight from be Beyond The Arc and when the league has gotten those wins its almost like theyre ignored like it didnt happen and they have been so BC a 12point lead with 112 to go dont forget our baseball game of the week coming up on Saturday 400 Eastern youll get the middle of three games presented by Auto Owners Insurance Tom Walter and Wake Forest visit Brian o Conor and Virginia Saturday afternoon 400 right here on AC Network always streaming for you on the ESPN app Kean George the Freshman from Switzerland launching a three out of the corner he appears on the floor for the first time with 11 and 1 half to go here 12point lead for BC theyre on a 12 nothing run in the last 3 minutes its 153 total post with 13 Going for 15 and foul by omir and thatll be his second and thats not good news for Jim Lena hurricanes with 1110 to go here in the first half but a smart basketball by Earl Grant and the Eagles recognizing that omir already has one foul you want to force him to defend and Quinton po did not settle by shooting the jump shot he attacked the basket and was able to pick up the foul qu he just got he just stuck his hand down a little bit he had good position he should have just held it yeah post has got 14 hes two for two at the line oms got two fouls hes going to stay in the game and this goes back to something you said in game one with or game two here today our first about playing a big man with two fouls here I I think coach has nobody that can guard post except for air so if he brings somebody else in theyre going to just go right at him I I think hes got to take the gamble here and play they theyre taking post out so that relieves that problem a little bit but uh you know you cant let the game get theyre theyre 14 down they cant let it get a lot more or any more really yeah 27 to 133 heres pack trying to get through traffic and a reach in I believe on hand and it is itll be his first that is only the First on Boston College here with almost 9 Minutes gone so Nigel pack Cory outlined the injuries missed five of the last six he only played the 13 minutes against Boston College last week and then I didnt think and Im no doctor that he looked 100 Yesterday did no I I didnt think he looked 100 Yesterday and again Nigel pack who is in his fourth year could be finishing his college basketball season also I mean career also has the opportunity to come back next year but as weve talked about a number of times when that finality starts to come into play that can push you to get back onto the floor even when youre not 100 he snapped the 14 nothing run by BC but only hit one of two Eagles still leading by 13 but now coach this is what you talked about before Mi dropping back and playing it looked like his Zone originally it was in the beginning now they kind of went back but but this is dangerous when you got omir playing with the two fouls theres the nephew Donald Han Jr knocks down the three his 25th of the Year keeping the family Tradition at the tournament going and theres the driveing bucket for omir six for nor Chad omir he is Miamis leading scorer the canes Trail 14 hes so difficult with the guard off the bounce and once again a Zone look for Miami will they stick with it or does this change into a manto man well you got Matson out there and just hit one Cory heres mson setting up another spins out omir the rebound tell you what million dollar move only 10c shot but it was beautiful to get there George cannot answer Earl Grants team maybe a rocky first 2 and 12 minutes after that they have settled right in and you see Bley Joseph calling out putting up the number two which normally signals Zone but for Miami they are moving into a manto man which is of course always dangerous when youre trying to protect someone playing with two foul matching with five to shoot Baseline hanger short Cleveland and Miami now tries to get something going heres omir in transition and hell throw it up there were going to get a block call on Boston College Eagles thought they were going to get a to travel Tommy morsy finds the foul on the sophomore from Toronto Armani Mighty itll be his first and the second on the Eagles now coach Im sure it was his regularly scheduled time to take a break however if youre playing with Quinton post the way hes playing right now and NORAD omir picks up his second foul are you taking him out of the game you know I I dont I but you know you you cant coach somebodys team for him I mean coach Grant thinks he needs a rest right there and maybe thats good maybe hell come back stronger if I got a guy like that Im going to go to him one more time for sure and just see what happens and you know oms got two fouls hes not going to play him really hard and I I think you go right back to him a couple times and see if you can space it out a little bit more then you give him a rest eight for omir 12point lead for Boston College they went back to claudell Harris hes returned to the lineup so is mcglockton Zachary trying to maybe look to the post heres Armani Mighty setting a screen for it and omir reached in knocked it away heres Joseph down the floor mlon blocked it but a foul first I think on claudell Harris W itll be Harriss first Cory if you remember what was the lead when Quinton post came out of the game uh I think it was right around 13 or 14 14 14 points 14point lead so as Quinton po comes to the table right now to check back in has a chance to have cut all four points from that lead with benley Joseph at the free throw line but more importantly what youve allowed is for nor Chad oir to stay on the floor without having to defend very much with post on the bench but thats getting ready to change now and Joseph only got one of the two lets see how this possession goes right well I mean again when you bring him back into the game in my opinion he has to get it immediately yeah 100 Zachary into traffic hesitated and scored or you can just get a basket eight for Zachary on his fourth field goal but North Shir had to be aware of where Quinton post was on that which opened up the lane for JayZ oh yeah in the corner pack three ball good Nigel pack was seven he and omir doing the bulk of the scoring theyve got all but seven of the hurricane points here in the first Applause Music half Applause heres post Zachary eight to shoot skip for Harris three ball bounced away postal commit the foul first on post fourth on Boston College but Earl Grants team whos won a couple in a row here in a 17 and 14 campaign they got four four wins on the road in the ACC too by the way theyre the only ACC team playing on this Tuesday theyre coming in with they win theyre in a two game winning streak yeah all the other five teams lost their last game so right now this Boston college team has a little bit of momentum coming to Applause DC 10point game pack trying to cut into it again long rebound omir Joseph right back at post omir the recovery cant score it mlon underneath Applause Madson heres post big man with a handle mlon back for post and a foul thats going to take us to a break on the Cleveland foul but Earl Grant 47 years of age coaching in his third ACC tournament he told the Eagles just take a deep breath you need to take a couple deep breaths and relax we need to relax and play the legends that have come from damaa including one of the accs best Danny Ferry the Duke Legend and all that has happened coming out of damaa we can go down the list prior to this we talked about Derek Wittenberg syney Sydney low so many BJ Ana so many different guys who have come from the school alone and of course Adrien Dantley may be the best of them all yeah Morgan might be among the best coaches Ive ever seen forget high school Im talking about coaches he you know him and Bob Hurley uh Gary mcnight from California those three guys they could coach anything anywhere they were just unbelievable basketball coaches yep you walk into this city you realize the impact that that Metropolitan Washington Northern Virginia Maryland has had on the college game through the just terrific terrific High school well WD there are statistics to support this as Quinton y post has his another block shot averages close to two a game madon misses the three the statistics report that the DMV area produces more division one college basketball players than any other area in the country wow this is a hot bed for basketball Talent Kean George on the floor Nigel pack its a 12point Boston College lead under seven to go in this first half post got a hand on the pass toward omir heres mlock keeping it alive threepoint deep from post Spence out George Cleveland Miami needs a basket oh for their last five make it six and a reset with pack trying to take hand on the drive into traffic what a shot almost vertical on the stretch out yeah thats great offense beating really good def defense Donald Han played that perfectly however Nigel Packs offense just able to get him a bucket thats nine for pack in this first half back in the zone trying to change the tempo a little bit Harris now they go back man its they really start out in zone then kind of switch it up how about hands Drive couldnt finish post recovers two guys there Matson open at the front left it on the rim nice Save By Hand BC gets a third crack and a foul on George Jim Lena not happy at all second or fifth foul on Miami its the first on the Swiss freshman kesan George how about this shot yeah Nigel pack attacking going through the body of Donald Han Jr the concentration to be able to finish off the glass good offense like you said he leaned in a little bit and got some space and he got the shot Applause up a 10point lead for Boston College fifth foul on Miami four on BC post missed badly off the Baseline M glockton for the rebound and offensive foul called as he knocked over jakai Robinson whos come into the ball game jaai Robinson who played his high school basketball in the area National Christian High School and jakai going to walk away got to shake that one off because one thing if any one looks and says well that was in the restricted area however its a primary Defender and dein mlin absolutely absolutely created all the contact from that one heres benley Joseph in traffic scoring first field goal for Joseph Miami to within eight WD you see benley Joseph getting on the floor yep forcing the turnover omir against post cant finish post picks up the rebound saves it for Zachary the lead for BC is big as 16 in this first half at 30 to 14 you see its a 122 12 to four run here by Miami to get back in Denley Joseph may be Miamis best competitor its Cardell Harris knocks down to three but this game is different benley Joseph is from Boston y it means a lot more for him in this game especially for the fact that Boston College has beaten his canes twice this year Applause Music Cleveland has just not really found his rhythm this year at all tap follow mcglockton Devons first basket of the ball game back to a 13point spread Miamis hit just two of their last 10 George foul on leaner good nice Patience by George getting into the painted area using the pump fake Coach in the soft touch good move hes hes going to be real good hes still young he still makes these some of the Freshman mistakes that you would expect where hes got the length and talent to be a really good player yeah I think the question with him is where is he going to be really good is it going to be in Miami or will it be in the big Association yep omir heres Joseph sacer got knocked down no whistle BC bench thought there should have been omir the three that post is chased down tell you what Quinton post has shown me a lot of stick toess and get around the basketball stuff here in this first half well and we saw the discrepancy and strength between he and omir to start the game but then he stepped out and shot the basketball very well and showed off his discrepancy and skill 11point lead Cleveland a fall away thats a tough shot yeah it is and maybe not the highest percentage for a team who is now 31 in the first half Miami 10 of 32 from the floor coach and and theyre lucky Boston College has missed four or five wide open threes that this game could be already Out Of Reach if they were making notes theyre getting good shots look at this two passes off the screen Cory beautiful ball movement in the great presence of M by Clinton post recognizing the help was there but knowing his teammate Deon mlac would be cutting to the basket that only comes from experiencing guys playing together for quite some time Robinson against Harris into the traffic tried to scoop it up almost bounced in BC will run it down yep mlock mson almost gave it back but coach you notice how all the loose balls all the hustle plays have gone to Boston College to start this game pretty much everyone Madson head of the circle threw it away to Cleveland turnover number five on BC heres Cleveland roaring to the basket for the hoop second field goal for Matthew Cleveland thats so much better you know theyre settling for jump shots and they can get to the basket and certainly Cleveland especially Ken and a time outs going to be taken here by Boston College and weve been celebrating anniversaries today today is 63e anniversary of when our guy went 25 for 25 in a free throw shooting where did that come we from look at this more anniversaries and more cele tell buddy that my guys name is Big Jim beheim though they started off with big Jim beheim look at that easy to communicate with during the game as Jaden Zachary finds out and we welcome you back to Washington Boston College an 11point lead on Miami and it would be a lot more they missed probably six out of the last seven threes wide open too so that it it could be worse B almost at nearly 50 cor once again Zone defensively and then they now theyre switching back out of it its its a different kind of Zone Pell Harris over the top of it for a triple making his debut in the ACC tournament Pell Harris Jr with six in the first half transfer from Charleston Southern out of hanville Louisiana 90 seconds to go and back to a 14point lead for BC its been as big as 16 and George trying to answer but the difference is Boston College has moved the basketball coach theyve shared it they created opportunities with teammates Miami has tried to go oneonone a little too often and create the offense on their own now Boston College played way better offensive basketball they made a couple more threes the game would almost be over already heres post and now Harris again another three that one out front Cleveland had it and mlon got a hand in Justin Porterfield says it will stay with Applause Miami Jim Lena played for the great Jack Curran and then went to Providence of course he was an assistant at Virginia in the early 80s with Terry Holland then went to George Mason won 273 games went to the final four 18 years ago coach keran was a great basketball coach and a better baseball coach ah that Arch Bishop Malloy there a few players came out there by the way Cory yeah yeah one by the name of Kenny Anderson Kenny Smith wasnt bad either yeah five to shoot thats a nice and a basket for Nigel pack hes had a couple beautiful takes yeah but he stood Clinton post up on the perimeter let him know hands up keep them in no differential riding it now the final 20 seconds of this first half eagles with a 12point lead its been as big as 16 in this first half and Harris would tend to shoot on the dribble into the corner theres Zachary a three got it 11 for your man JayZ and at the horn pack from the midcourt stripe is short quite an answer by Earl Grant team in his first 20 minutes guys they were just more consistent and really moved the basketball got good pack did what he could to try and guide Miami back into the water Nigel pack 11 points for him in the first half of this game but the most telling stat of that first half Boston College had 10 assists theyre sharing the basketball theyre doing it as a team where Miamis had to do it as an individual when you think about the 11 points for Nigel pack think about how difficult they were and the tough shots he had to make to get that ball start of the second 20 minutes clell Harris alob tried to go back to mton play got disrupted next thing you know heres Miami at the other end and pack Rees and tapped home by Cleveland and those are the type of plays that Miami was expecting to get from Matthew Cleveland the hustle plays the energy plays was of course thats how he played at Florida State yeah he hasnt played that way this year hes had some Sparks but not consistently Zacharys got 13 on his first field goal the second half 15point difference Miami comes in losing nine straight 10 of 11 DC by the way 47 points in the first half equals the most points in a first half in the ACC tournament in the Eagles history well defense has been a struggle for both these teams this year however its been more of a struggle for Miami as North chadow Mir is able to get to the jump hook over top of the length of Clinton PO he had double doubles in each of their last two regular season games hes a couple of rebounds off from making it three in a row so WD I did the math coming in y he has 296 rebounds in 30 games coming into this one yeah needed 14 today to be able to average a double double on the year needs to have 14 rebounds in this one hes on the drive and hes got another field goal so Miamis got a little bit of want to and get back here at the start of this second half fellas yeah and theyre following the lead of their best player NORAD omir who does not want his season to end here on Tuesday of the ACC tournament post inside from mlock high low thats a great set when they get mlin high him low they havent done that in this game but they have done that in in a lot of games this year and inverting the guys one low one high then switching it but it benefits when you have a great passer like Quinton post at the top of the key absolutely po pack finally drops in a bucket so youve gotten Cleveland on the board omir picked up a couple baskets now ndle pack chips in hes got 13 the lead still 13 though for grants Eagles well Miamis got to get a stop and they whoa thats a trip and a trip will be called here and a look back at Nigel Pac here Nigel Pac got off to a great start a young man who did not have a basket in his last two games but was able to step up knock down the three ball early two for four from Beyond The Arc in the first half and then the hesitation hands up forcing Quinton post to jump because you respect the jump shot getting to the rim taking you on the cont finish Zachary by the way 11 here in this ball game or 13 rather in this ball game will go to the line off the Cleveland foul and itll rattle around Zachary pretty good free throw shooter at 83 coming in yeah hes a veteran guy the thing with Pat going back there when he is right hes a 20 25 Point guy and when hes not doing that Miami just is not the same kind of team just too many injuries this year too many guys Cleveland out pack out oms been out I mean they just had all their key guys have been out and they dont have a lot of depth well and one of the things that they dont have also is that veteran leadership that theyve had in the past when you consider not only the ACC Player of the Year and all ACC I mean Isaiah Wong but all ACC Jordan Miller as well who I thought should have been the player of the year last year WD but its Harlem Beverly its Anthony Walker its the veteran guys that they had Off the Bench they lost all four of those guys and they lost a lot of leadership well I thought Miller was the most underrated player in the league by far you know those two years he rebounded he blocked shots he made jumpers he posted up and a good passer and a good Defender yeah I mean he was a big key I mean Mi me went to the final four well and then lead 8 the year before that but the biggest problem in my opinion coach is when you do that there should be guys that are watching those freshman should be watching and they should understand the way things should be done how the leadership should happen so for wer popper for benley Joseph who were freshman and played two years with those guys they should have taken on that role this year I just dont think theyre as talented as as those guys I mean Isaiah Wongs a killer in the G league and Millers really good so I mean theyre just theyre two special players I mean theyre all league players kanes have gotten 10 points on five field goals pack another driving score to cut it back to 14 here BC deserves a lot of credit here for playing with the verocity that Grant talked about to them in the locker room we heard it before the game the you know Fighting Chance opportunity take the deep breath heres popper or he left the three short Miami will get a second chance heres Cleveland trying to answer from the corner hell leave it short a third try is the Char for Cleveland hes got nine now Miami going to offer a little backcourt pressure here its not a press its hey were just hanging back here to make sure you attend to your knitting but thats concerning to Earl Grant when you watch a team get two off into rebounds and the easy layup afterwards and give Miami a lot of credit for coming in and fighting in this second half Zachary couldnt hit the layup you got to pick him up now now Cleveland gets it to Bley Applause Joseph 15 to shoot for Miami kanes have hit six of their first 11 here in the second half Joseph on the D D getss the bounce its so much better getting to the basket instead of settling for the three and theyre almost back in if they can get a couple more stops theyll be back in it six nothing run coach Miami seems to be playing with a little more energy A Little More burst than Boston College to start this second half theres mlon got an advantage inside went up strong lost the handle on it and heres Miami with popper out of there back to the trailing Cleveland and a foul on Deon mlon thatll be his second red shirt sophomore from outside of Atlanta gets Boston College their first foul and brings us to a timeout and boy this is a heck of a one now coming up Wednesday night 700 tomorrow night from Tallahassee number 15 Alabama in town number 18 Florida State All For You on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app L Als got a terrific program at Tallahassee and well have coverage for you tomorrow night of the tide and the NOS Miami trying to make a run here Kanes on a 6 nothing Run BC in a scoring drought thats lasted a couple minutes and theres a Miami turnover and the worst time to turn the basketball over after a timeout when youve drawn up exactly what you want to get on the offensive end noo in the ball game replacing omir and heres post to work guys Quenton skips out Harris a catch and shoot three is short thats tough not to be able to step into your shot that catch was high and they try to gather and shoot that one no wonder hit the front of the rim tough Applause shot Nigel Packs ready to take it on now Cory I mean again that thats what he does though again if hes not being aggressive hes not helping you his shooting ability opens up so many opportunities for his teammates Madson three offline Zachary tried to battle for it that might have hit Cleveland it sure did oh Justin bfield said touch Last by BC yeah did hit Zachary on the way out Cleveland did knock the basketball off of Zacharys leg so thats why Miami will get it back but Miami playing with momentum but theyve got to find a way to get this thing under 10 and keep that momentum going and Wes youre not getting your referee patch either that was a horrible call thanks coach but yet you have not been negative toward the official no no no theyre getting them right tonight three ball away back rim recover Joseph another offensive chance that one not converted Miami did get a basket on a third try at the offensive glass but that time and heres post catching and it drops in hes got 19 now I dont know why or 21 rather beg your pardon Miami is settling for the three when they can get to the basket and have gotten to the basket or create those Inside Out opportunities where you attack the paint and then kick out to your Shooters after the help Cleveland wanted to find some oh look at this he spun out of it and then missed it made a great move and threw an air ball but Matthew Cleveland did that to himself he was complaining about no one moving and he finds himself open and has a layup and then air mails it I wonder if he complained to himself Zachary with s minutes gone here in this second half BC back by 12 Harris skips here for a leag b bounce fast mlock the nice Cut couldnt finish post keeping it alive and and fouled on the play I think thats popper and wuga popper his second third on Miami and thats going to put post to the line hes got 21 on seven of 13 from the floor hes hit a couple of threes and has nine rebounds well hes got such an advantage down there with with nir out out of the game so hes they should be going to him or hes going to get the offensive rebound if they miss free throw by post is good dont forget womens lacrosse coming up on acc Network on Saturday noon start for number nine North Carolina number seven Syracuse and then the mens card number two Notre Dame coach caran and the Irish welcome Michigan to South Ben thats Saturday on acc network streaming live on the ESPN out and as weve done our lacrosse our softball and our baseball highlights Im trying to think to myself which of those three Sports is the most difficult to play and for anyone who thinks that softball is easy they need to stand in and see just how fast that ball is coming at you from a short distance those young ladies are bringing the pepper mhm well the the best games to watch are lacrosse its a its a one its a basketball type game to watch and its its a great game here is pack with three to shoot working on Zachary all the way into traffic and a shot clock violation BC gets the stop Cory yeah and BC stepping up defensively as well as Miamis tried to get within 10 points Boston College has come back with a number of stops and Coach as you mentioned lacrosse I didnt say it but it was brought to my attention that maybe you were at Syracuse around the time when Jim Brown was playing I dont know I was high school I was a little I was in I might have been in junior high school okay junior high school but we know that Jim Brown of course one of the best lacrosse players to go along with one of the best football players all say the oldtimers all say he was the best Gary gate was pretty close I saw Gary gate but Jim Brown they had to change the rules for him he put the thing to his chest and they tried to he couldnt get it away from him and then he just went down and put it in Harris goes down on the Baseline thats going to get us to a break here at the Under 12 Cory fault bubble for you Im getting crushed by the DMV you know what what and its not my fault hes a second Team all ACC player Cory youve noted hes got a year to go if youd like right mhm uh the numbers here are captivating especially when you consider hes a 67 guy and tonight hes playing against a 7 foot and a half 240lb post guy Jim well hes a perfect guy with the nil hell make more money in college and he will probably because hes looks like a gleague player uh hell make more money in college he should stay another year at College heres Kean George and a reach and a foul called and that is going to be on a league Bay itll be his first second on Boston College I tell you what the 67 though at the post in in todays college basketball thats thats noticeable it it is definitely noticeable and it puts you in the mind of a number of guys who have made the transition to the grid iron when their college basketball careers over however in my opinion I think NORAD oir is much better as a basketball player than the guys that weve seen you see the offensive rebound by omir and then the vision to find Matthew Cleveland at the top of the key who knocks down that three ball yep but the guys who have made the transition you start thinking of Jimmy Graham Tony Gonzalez you know all those guys very good basketball players but not all ACC like NORAD upir plus nor Chad those guys played High School football I dont know if they have that high school football in uh nicaragu yeah om is a baseball player in nicar nicaragu playing baseball and again its a different mentality when you go out there and put that helmet on WD you work in in in the NFL I mean just talking to guys who are willing to go out there and put their body on the line like that thats different than basketball and he traveled coming out of the offensive rebound thought he got held from Ted Valentine going to stick with it no NORAD going to going to litigate but to no avail here there you go rocking to Nicaragua yep couple and thats a double double by the way for omir dozen points and 10 rebounds despite the turnover on the Travel Lena he didnt like that call I guess no Jim is you know what 74 years of age and some people he said earlier this week to the field of 68 hes going to coach next year I think no reason not to I had yeah I was getting ready to say I had not heard that he wasnt going to coach Cory well one thing I can tell you for certain hes not going to go out the way this has gone for the Miami Hurricanes down the stretch whoa there you know every time you Lo have a little bit of a Bad season as youre older they ask you why youre if youre retiring okay you know thats thats what this is about if they were having a great year nobody would nobody would nobody ask them I got to tell you Cory I thought contact you got to find the ball before you make the contact Cory I I tell you this coach talked about it in our first game for big guys you got to be your fouls have to be smart foul that wasnt a smart foul from nor especially the fact that that gives him his third now he has to come take a break but he was frustrated over the fact that he didnt get the call on the previous possession and took it out on Jaden Zach the woko comes in to replace him Michael by the way 610 freshman from Toronto tend to shoot were almost halfway way through half number two and heres post rerouting inside and scoring but Quinn post took a second to see if a double team was coming and when he didnt and thats where hes different now he makes that play last year or year before he couldnt make he didnt make that play hes hes gotten much much better post a 21 points in the two regular season games against Miami hes got 25 and were halfway through half number baseball coming up this weekend presented by Auto Owners Insurance Saturday Davenport field you know it Cory Charlottesville been there a many and many of times

he lost it over the end line 25 and 10 tonight for Quinton post by the way the opening day is March 28th for you baseball guys well I gave up baseball in the in my sophomore year in high school however I still am an elite level softball player as a matter of fact Ive won an MVP at every celebrity softball tournament Ive been in oh my God my back is hurting your back hurting there from tapping it oh my gosh out of the corner heres pack a three 18 for Nigel pack hes had three games of 20 or more against the ACC including 20 in early February against Carolina in a necessary bucket to make this a 12point game but Miami went through a stretch where they were getting stops got it to 10 points but never able to get it into single digits time is not on their side theyve got to make a push now taken away by pack on Post Drive hes got a three on two love and the loo Taps it home thats what happens with post down there when Post men dribble from that far out little guys get steals Joseph trying to tighten up on Madson now heres George defending Applause Zachary you got to call that come on heres post setting a high screen Zachary with t to shoot Madson hes been a problem ski into the corner a league base sets missed everything another stop chance for Miami to get this under 10 in Prince El leag Bay couldnt finish noo 10 and a foul on Boston College what the Hurricanes were unable to do earlier in the half now theyve done an eightpoint game an opportunity to make it seven and theyre doing it off their defense Matthew Cleveland finding noo running down the middle of the floor great Hands by the big fella and just a little slight Flex just get off it first time in L since it was under five to go in the first half when BC had its lead cut to eight at 3426 Miamis got it to eight again now with 804 to play in the game and as weve said all year basketballs a game of runs and this is Miamis run and theyre going to be back in the game and theres still plenty of time left free throw NOCO bounces out hes now 11 of 18 at the line this year but he scored four in a row from Miami its a seven nothing run and Boston College who has handled this first round game pretty well so far playing with a lot of poise too guys they absolutely are playing and that energy level has just picked up so much its amazing the way their offense has inspired their defense heres post the catch Harris sets for three and its off itll spin out M glockton Taps it home those are the type of plays that hurt you in the midst of a comeback not securing the defensive rebound 10 for mton thats where po should have just scored in there Music Applause too Joseph the lobit turned away by post post has made some good defensive plays today Zachary back for the trailing three the big fella knocks it down coach you mentioned his defensive plays thats why he was all defensive team in the ACCC but on the other end caps it off knocking down the three ball at the top of the key which the reason why hes a second Team all ACC performer this year theyre going back and forth Miami had a run where they hit on a seven nothing take Michael noo the guy who was driving it for the canes when we continue coins get get the coins here wow Tiana you win he has got 28 points hes nine of 15 from the floor three of six from three hes got 10 rebounds inside and along the way coach beheim he is produced the third highest scoring output ever by a BC Eagle in the AC tournament well hes doing it inside out you know hes complete Game defensive game everything has been good omir scoots through and scores omir has been good too down there he just hasnt gotten it enough I dont think 14 for NORAD on his sixth field goal post falls behind Olivier Handlin and Tyrese rice uhhuh elsc Bird High School Richmond Virginia which is not in the DMB coach by the way yeah 41 for hanlin in 2013 against Georgia Tech 32 for rice in 2007 against Miami ironically in a quarterfinal game WD what year was that with Olivia hler uh 2013 was that the same year that Harrison Barnes went for 40 that is correct okay I thought so theres a Donald Han Jr field goal his second of the ball game hes got five to the Delight of his dad watching from behind the Boston College bench no I beg your pardon Cory Im wrong Harrison Barnes was 2011 oh okay yeah I was there to witness both of them just wasnt sure if they were at the same time yeah Harrison Barnes by the way was that was a semifinal game against Clemson when he had 40 for the tar Hills thats the record that AJ U RJ Davis surpassed in heres pack Cleveland George thought about it mlon closes with 5 and a half to go and Boston College up 13 Joseph trying to cut into it I dont think he realizes that he hasnt making those shots today Harris the rebound and BC now were going to walk it into the front Court as we go inside five and change to go here Earl Grant in his third ACC tournament trying to notch his fourth win in this event and Zachary fell as he delivered a bounce pass to nobody that ball just spot was vacated and Jaden had his mind made up that he was going to cut it Loose well JayZ been very shorthanded with the basketball throughout this season close to a 3 to1 assisted turnover ratio expecting for one of his teammates to be in the corner to space the floor however the corner had been vacated Applause yep Joseph Cleveland now pack on the wraparound and a whistling foul Ted Valentine off the left Baseline and Donald Han Juniors third foul its the fourth on Boston College dont forget more ACC Softball coming up

help with Cleveland having a slight size advantage over Donald Han Jr in the post 11point lead for the eagles post with noo there splits the double kicks for Harris standing three spins out and they Scramble for post is got it rips it away from pack ripped his hand away but this has been a great offensive possession for post he handles the double team gets his team made a great shot and then off the Miss comes up with the offensive rebound glockton lob for post in tight up strong wait a minute no whistle BC bench not happy heres pack Bley Joseph long three post kept it alive and finally heres hand Donald Han Jr the layup fell off the rim M glockton the rebound is anybodys whistle working or no they just stopped holy cow well it only took a game in 34 WD but there it is yep we finally got

the ptoi Cory and thatll send him to the exits here at Capital One Arena but you got to give the Eagles a lot of credit every time Miami has made it a game and cut it down under 10 the Eagles have had a response you been to the Watergate Hotel cuz thats where claudell Harris is standing when he cut that loose back after this the national champs Joel Barry Carlos Boozer Luke Hancock booze and Luke getting the makeup and we caught you on national TV doing it and the hardest working person at the ACC Network Kelsey Ricks I tell you what following the game here tonight shout out to my guy Joe

for hand back for Matson and a three ball thats tapped home by post 30 piece once again Boston College sharing the basketball extremely well Donald Han turned down a good shot to get a great shot omir launching itll Bound Away the rebound for Harris the BC lead is 16 and a foul on Miami well Brad Brownell staff is on the end line down to our left or right rather at the West end of the building getting the full look at Boston College the Clemson Tigers who beat BC in their only regular season meeting in mid January by 11 points but Cory you remember that game that was the one that BC had a stomach bug moving through the roster four or five guys missed that game one day yeah and how about the potential match up between Quinton post PJ Hall and PJ Hall and never forget about the CCs most improved player in sheflin yep the front line for the Clemson Tigers is a special one yep both teams like to shoot the three as well okay get up get up NE there you go Donald Han Jrs got seven and and theres my little brother now heres heres the record we talk about getting in trouble Donald Hs from Jersey he got that Yankee fitted on thats going to be a problem when everybody sees it omir knocks down the dunk nor Chad omir has got 18 tonight on his eight field goal Mason Matson trying to get across the timeline therell be a foul on there were a lot of FS on Bley Joseph and Donald Han Jr of course and Donald H senior and a look at Junior here splits the double team core won a state championship at lown high school as a freshman as you see his pops excited about and hes a North Jersey guy so he may be able to get away with the Yankee fitted on well his dad played in four ACC tournament games for Virginia 98 to 2001 he averaged 10 points in this event and hit 50 of his threes in his Virginia Career at the ACC tournament did Donald Han senior wearing number 13 for the Wahoos yeah hes excited tonight about his young mans performance as should as he should be well Jim Lena has taken omir out of the ball game and Matthew Cleveland luga poppler I think these guys seeing the campaign come to a close I dont think anyone would have picked the Miami Hurricanes to be the team that ends their season losing 10 straight games right but I can tell you this will be something that will motivate Jim Lena the entire off season I expect the kanes to be back in full effect next season cell Harris with a dozen final 42 seconds here from Washington so Boston College will move on to meet the six seed Clemson tomorrow and Applause aaya beg your pardon jakai Robinson knocked it down over attia thats his first three of the year and Earl Grant just going to dribble this out good performance Boston College post was really good inside Zachary they played a a tremendous game Miamis just had too many ups and downs too many injuries this year and they just they theyre missing the two key guys from last year big time yeah Kane season will be two below 500 Cory at 15 and 17 well and again the injuries plague them however believe the internal leadership you know the best teams are player Le teams we know that Jim Lena is a great coach however I dont think they had the same locker room that theyve had the last two seasons Earl Grant goes to 4 and2 in six ACC tournament games BC now 18 and 14 as the Eagles win 8165
