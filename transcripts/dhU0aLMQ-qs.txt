This time for 10 And what a crew we have by the way Doug Surmans going to throw it up with Doug Show and Pat Adams Its a big time officiating crew for a big time match up tonight SMU and NC State on a Tuesday night here in the ACC Mustangs start with the ball and Setu misses the games first shot Copeland tracks it down and nearly turned it over off a deflection from BJ Edwards NC State starting five Darien Williams has been terrific the last two and he feeds Alan Luben who is fouled by Geron Pierre Jr Trey Hollerman Copelan and Paul McNeel coming off 28 on Saturday are the guards for Will Wades Wolfpack Now we mentioned Cuadia Copelands ability to pass the basketball but Darion Williams has done a tremendous job as of late being a distributor as well scoring 20 points in consecutive games but also playing in the backup point guard position Makes a nice find out and move foul First free throw miss for Lumin at 73 Wills Wack and the Duke Blue Devils the only teams unbeaten in conference road games at 50 anyway screaming Clemson unbeaten but has not played five road games yet as Luben goes one to2 starting five for SMU its been the same pretty much every game this year Miller BJ Edwards a do it all guard Pierres a great score with Washington and Yatollu SMU gets some of the least bench production in the country but Five of their starters averaged double figures And when you consider the fact that both of these teams are sim similar in their starting lineup both are four guards around the big The difference though the big for SMU you get to much larger than Ben Alenova State 72 compared to a list of 69 Trey Hollerman bangs a three off the back of the rim Hollerman coming off a conference high 11 on Saturday as the first field goal And a good sign for Trey Hollerman as he takes on the responsibility of guarding Ruby Miller on the other end So a huge responsibility on both ends of the field by the way the games first assist to Premier Cook in the game Second assist to Bookie Miller and thats something we could be talking about a lot These two guys have high usage rates and we can see them making a lot of plays for their respective teams here this evening Pierre the opening bucket for SMU NC State a winner Saturday at Wake Forest 9678 16 of 28 from three Copeland sets up another Williams hits it Two assists for two made threes as Copeland sets up the Wolfpack And thats career assist number 400 Now Miller against Williams Rebound to Luga Important to be able to keep you total off the offensive glass averaged over three offensive rebounds per game That time really doing a nice job finishing the defensive possession for the Wolf Cup Step back for Holland will be tracked down by BJ Edwards senior from Knoxville Tennessee transfer Hes a superb allaround player and finishes superbly here with the off hand I dont know that there is a better maybe Joshua Jefferson at Iowa State but youre talking about one of the best allaround players in the in college basketball with two triple doubles on the season Cop rejected by Eagle Uhoh returning some of Copelands own medicine Something to say Yeah some conversation One thing you know when Claudia Copeland is on the floor theres going to be some talking And this time as Copeland goes to the basket spins Gigatu there to deny that opportunity but afterwards has something to say to QC who loves to be the villain on the road I think that may get Copeland going even more than he normally is Pass for you is deflected by Luben and Miller grabs it and then tries to lean into Van Allen Last foul is on McNeil by the way Heres an open three for Cory Washington to tie it One thing thats been a trend thus far after shots have been made Each team is looking and having conversation to the other teams bench Will be interesting to see how long the officials allow this to go on throughout this game Heres McNeel A brilliant shooter Misses on a catch and shoot opportunity Miller runs the floor for the Mustangs Thinks about a three Washington is open again missed it Knocked around and grabbed by Luben for the pack Another great job by Luben Undersized but still battling on the glass His second defensive goal Williams misses There have been 13 shots in the game Eight from threepoint range Expect that trend to continue Both teams shoot a lot of threes and both teams give up a ton Heres Edwards Miller up top instead Steps through Lubens there to alter it and Copelands there to pick it up He took a shot in the face as well Copeland Luben for three Havent hit one of those since December 3rd at Auburn Cannot believe Andy Infield will allow that to try to keep you at the basket And Yugato thought he get pushed going for the offensive rebound there Well neither team easing into this one A physical and fast start here in Dallas 5 years of SMU basketball SMU was a combined 3 and 23 Last year they won the bubble even though they never won a quad one game and they put themselves in much better shape in the nonconference this year And just like most ACC schools this year Andyfield challenged his team much more than nonconference with their schedule Huge win over Texas AM is really one that they will be able to hold on in selection Sunday McNeel with a pull up three into the shot clock Paul McNeel Jr buries one from deep and does more more of his shooting off of catch and shoots but that time McNeel going off the bounce Great find by Edwards Germaine ONeal Jr cant connect from three ONeal and Jaden Tombs two freshman are off the bench here for SMU Part of the youth movement for SMU Jermaine ONeal Jr probably the best athlete on the floor when you consider his ability and can be an elite defender for this SMU star Holland throws it away looking for Copen Wasnt happy with him And Poopy Miller cant finish as Copeland got back to the fence Such a smart play by both Copen I think Holland got back as well They baited Booby Miller into thinking they were going to jump as Hollins called for the travel Booby Miller tried to bait them into fouling him on this possession Both guys peel out stay away from it No contact there Although Boop is trying to plead his case Great job by Copeland to stay away from picking up a foul Quickly in Tunes who misses point blank SMU just three for 12 NC State three out of eight screaming Terry Williams back in the state where he played with Texas Tech the last couple years Backto back 2053 games and McNeel misses off the setup here Carl thank you Welcome to Dallas Ben Allen Luben with a welcome to Dallas For those of you just joining us Kevin Brown Cory Alexander Luben has put NC State up 1210 here at SMU Neither team ranked but both a projected tournament team by Joel Lonardi around the 89 seed lines Its a quad one game for both teams And its a game that features two of the three highest scoring teams in a much improved ACC Thats Poopy Miller the all ACC standout potential all ACC for SMU who gets fouled Maybe the two best playmakers Cory in the ACC Copeland and Miller have combined for five assists And its gotten a little chippy already as the officials push back SMU Boopy Miller Trey Hollowman having some conversation I believe Claudia Copelan just getting someone away from him earlier and I love the fact that Doug Shia got in there made sure that there was nothing extracurricular but more importantly not going over to look at this will not be awarding anyone technical fouls etc Doing a great job as we see the foul on Boopy Miller that Boopy may have taken a little exception to Trey Hollerman committed it So there are the numbers for Miller 19 and a half points 6 and 12 assists a game sixth in the ACC scoring leads the ACC in assists For folks just tuning in to see Poopy Miller for the first time Cory what makes him special And what makes him special is his awareness on the court of not only his ability to score the basketball but also taking care of his teammates but Pat Adams getting involved in between Ruby Miller and Cuadier Copeland the two elite point guards weve talked about Both those guys telling Pat Adams Were good Were fine Basket talking is just a part of this game And its going to be a lot of talking in this one Im sure something that the officials make sure they will keep under control Heres Copeland who may lead the ACC in words per minute too A young man after my own heart You know I love hell be sitting next to me in a few years Matt Able off the mark probably more than a few Well here Copeland may have a nice basketball career ahead of him the way hes played this year A kid who was on the wing at Syracuse a couple of years ago and is now a frontfacing player for a 72 team in the ACC I love the assumption that youre going to be able to keep this job that long but I mean laughter Miller sets up Sam Walters in and out and back in Three off the bench for the Michigan transfer and Sam Walter stepping in playing that four spot and defending Darion Williams but hes a guy that can really strengthen from beyond the arc only averaged five points a game last year at Michigan but was on a very good team but a winning culture here with NBA able miss Geron Pierre lays it in SMU leads by five Mustangs who were down seven to2 have scored 15 in the last race patience by Pierre in transition just probing seeing what defender was going to pick him up No one really stopping the basketball allowing him to get Im going to call the easy bucket but easy for him Oh my out of a double Williams into the third row of bleachers We talked about Williams really playing that backup point guard role where hes got to combine 10 turnovers in his last two games Five in each of the last two games So that has been an issue for Darion Williams Even though hes got backtoback 20point games the 10 turnovers Im sure lead to a little dismay for Will Wade NC State has all three turnovers in the game We are a dynamic score of 17 a game Miller a three would not go Once again the Wolfpack undersized doing a great job on a defensive glass not giving up extra possessions Williams down the lane Its a blocking foul Uhoh And Darion Williams took the worst of that immediately second to get up but shaking off that right wrist which was the first thing to touch the ground when he came down You look at what hes done over the last two games backto back 20 games The wrist looks fine on the first replay Shakes it again Had some shoulder issues earlier in the year Missed Texas Southern who had snapped a streak of 109 consecutive starts dating back to Texas Tech and he began his career at Nevada Was two for two at the line to snap that 7 nothing Mustang surge And again you and Im not sure if you know was it the right shoulder or was it the left shoulder Because if it was the right shoulder that really could be where the issue is The way he fell putting that hand down that could have affected that old Oh you hit the deck hard And theyre going to go over and look at this Doug Surmans signaling theyre going to go look at this And heres the thing I dont It didnt look as though there was anything dirty here This is jockeying for position But the problem is the previous play is under review The problem is youve got a very big guy and when you get into the legs of a bigger player the fall becomes much more dramatic And you see Copelan really just fighting for position there Comes underneath forcing the fall Copeland is battling for position and coaches will teach you get into the big guys legs So when Yikatu leaves the ground all of a sudden now theres no leverage for him when he jumps for the pass and thats the reason for the result of the fall I dont think theres anything to upgrade this to right on the tailbone music music So Doug Surmans coming over Theyre going to upgrade Thats a review Weve upgraded the common foul to a flagrant one foul number 11 Itll be two free throws for SMU The ball he plays on the baseline SMU The reasoning for the flagrant one is they felt as though Copeland kept going underneath Higollu And again I dont debate the call but part of the reason is when Higato leaves the ground you watch him jump for the pass as he jumps for the pass Now Copeland has no other choice other than to go underneath him because hes jocking for a position So I dont have a problem with the call but there was definitely no intent from Copeland And he and Doug Sha talk it out Copeland smiles and again this is not something that will affect QCs ability to be able to perform Doug Sherman saying it was unnecessary this line Thats all it needs to be You dont need to deem intent So one for two for Egllo and SMU possession I would argue that it was necessary because you cant stop your motion just because a player jumps But again I understand the call Im not fighting the ball Pierre spinning as poked away by Copeland Here comes the freshman Matt Ael and Ael shot was missed Yeah you can got that after it hit the glass Going to be a goend goending Hes arguing with Doug Shia Theres a lot of player official conversation going on right now You told may be thinking about his international experience where you can do that SMU is looking to see if they might want to challenge this as well You can challenge a called goend if theres a whistle on the play Heres the thing You dont want to challenge this And if the argument is that it wasnt a makeable shot but Im not sure why this is even a conversation the ball hits the glass first and then he touches the basketball afterwards I I I think thats a waste of time even having that conversation Thats an easy call So Matt Ael with maybe the strangest two points of his college career 1816 ESMU lead Hes clear driving against the freshman able Pierre fade away too strong towards Arsenal High points the rebound Thats one of those plays where Will Wade tells us Arsenal can make one or two athletic plays a game that no one else on the floor can make And you see him coming out of nowhere to pick up that board Their most athletic guy and hes a lot healthier Heres a turnover by Williams Hes up top Its ONeal Not a great pass by Edwards who gets it back Edwards from Ilu Fakes a three misses it through this time Remember my conversation about his athleticism and with Arsenal and I understand what will is saying but Jermaine ONeal Jr the most athletic player on the floor is right in front of his NBA Allstar dad sitting alongside Luben on a drive kicks it to Arsenal A low catch Arsenal slithers in leaves it short Heres Edwards with a rebound Four rebounds for BJ Edwards running the point with Whoopy Miller on the bench Whoopy Miller up on his way to the scores Table most live beat Edwards at the net dead ball go ball Edwards misses a three Oakland table cheering three just 341 now from deep Youre talking about the team that leads the ACC in threepoint field goal percentage shooting just a shade under 40 from three as a team which is absolutely elite here Could been convert at the rim but spins out to able scored in two close minutes Arsenal will not change There are now four Mustangs in the scorers table and two Wack Edwards puts it in driving around Arsenal But great patience by Edwards probing getting into the painted area and because hes such an elite passer guys are scared to leave cheering their responsibilities allowing him to get all the way to the rim for the easy layout whistle Arsenal from Copeland buries a three Cladier Copeland with his fourth assist on six NC State makes Now you gave me a a great stat earlier regarding Claire Copeland in threepoint shooting His assist threepoint shooters What was that number Third in the nation and assists leading to threes Oh there some air That is the primary reason that there are so many NBA scouts in the building Jon Pierre is someone that a lot of NBA scouts are looking at as theyre also checking out this guy the 66 point guard who goes off the glass from the top of the key What a show he is coach Will send the pass Its always going to be something spectacular It depends on for who Germaine ONeal meanwhile has been spectacular And alleyoop dunk missed a put back slam and now a three And Doug Sha says something to Andy Enfield regarding the conversation from Germaine ONeal Jr to the sideline Jr nephew going above and beyond This game has 20 can play back down Miller listed at six feet maybe a little smaller than that but both have played at an allac level The two teams that Joel Lonardi has in the tournament right now eight and nine seeds respectively Copeland nearly had a tickle Will going to a 131 zone now Lets see if they break take it off Theyre music going to most likely go back to manto man but the 131 was disruptive for SMU out of the timeout into Tombs who had possession of the ball leaning into Doug Survs who was standing out of bounds and SMUs first turnover Musier doing a great job putting pressure on Tombs catching that basketball along the sideline forcing the turnover contesting each pass Second turnover from St Louis Very good Kley top finish rebound Dallas and use BJK is right Miller to the line He got fouled by McNeel Its two on Paul McNeel Jr Tomorrow night ACC SEC double header right here on ESPN 2 We start in Louisville where Notre Dame takes on the 24th ranked Cardinals Louisville off a win over SMU this weekend Then Oklahoma and Kentucky at 9 Eastern 8 Central ESPN 2 in the ESPN app Thatll be interesting OG playing against his former school Oklahoma coming to visit University of Kentucky Im sure that will be emotional for him We saw that last week with Claudia Copeland Syracuse coming to the Lenovo Center to play against NC State Guardier going for 19 and N in that game see if Otega always has a similar performance tomorrow Kentucky just being the tournament coach and John Calip Perry And if you want uh the Young and the Restless thats Kentucky basketball this year You dont know if youre going to get the best or worst of Kentucky in any given week So its always an interesting show Unless youre a Wildcats fan in which case you probably want a little less interesting of a show McNeel fouled out top Davis Ray picks up personal Andy Enfield said today Im going to play the freshman guards a little more today He didnt bring in Davis Ray till this 8minute media timeout Germaine ONeal has played a music lot Looking for a little more energy a little more defensive focus off his bench Thats exactly what it is And youve got two freshman who can really be effective on the defensive end Two Wolfpack players ran away from that offensive rebound allowing Goofy Miller to get out in transition in comparison to going back after the basketball Could have been a offensive rebound opportunity Millers first field goal Copeland cant finish at the rim Copeland rips away the first NC State offensive rebound McNeel got caught in no mans land and turned it right back over But honestly and again the the turnover is absolutely on Paulo Jr but there should be someone in that corner Thats a space that should always be occupied So you know you have an outlet there But off of an offensive rebound the scramble no one able to get to the corner Arsenal going to the basket and it ends up being a turnover off of that first offensive rebound NC State has turned it over less than 10 times Six of its last seven Theyre going to create a turnover here Arsenal on a low pass for Miller With six to play in the first half where NC State led early SU has had the bulk of the advantage Hollerman had a couple of open cheering threepoint shooters and he picked Williams who misses and the ball is tipped in Matt Ael doing a great job getting inside coming up with the tip The offensive rebound showing that hes more than just a shooter as the freshman continues to draw a lot of praise from NBA people who are coming in the building to see him as well Now the official stats credited Mus with that basket Did you see Sier there Im Im asking Im Aral was in there and I thought it was Ael So Oh Oh it was Sonia It was Sier Yeah I saw Abel under the basket He tipped that from a See both of us would have been wrong Thats right for the first and only time this year So with a couple of push back tries into the hands of Luben for State with a three thought about it No Copeland on the floor right now They got Williams facilitate the offense frequently and Copelands on the bench but Williams has a mismatch right now with Miller trying to guard They want to get in the basketball as close as they can to the bucket Passed out of a double Luben will get back to the free throw line Its one of the things that NC State does very well They feel the open areas when they have a mismatch And Daren Williams is often times a mismatch when he has a smaller guard trying to defend him in the post But Ben Allen Luben vacates to that open spot giving Williams a music nice outlet when the double team comes Will talked about this a little bit this week He said its a unique offense we play Most guys havent played out of this with Copen Williams who their two best playmakers He said we back them down They call it the porch And he said theres some unique spacing when that happens He felt like they were cutting on top of each other early in the year but now theyre moving how he likes them to move And again it takes time Youve got so many new pieces outside of Balman Jr Theres no one in the rotation that got minutes for the Wolfpack last season and youve got a brand new coach So with that its going to take time to build that chemistry but at 7 and two in ACC play 50 on the road you can see the Wolfpack are absolutely starting to come together music as a team Theyve won six of their last seven Luben hits a free throw and NC State brings in Scotty Abubet 610 senior who hadnt played since January 6th Just his 11th game of the year But Abume can be very effective with his size against Iglu You see the strength that he has and the aggressiveness that he can play with to try to keep Igotu as far away from the basket as possible 610 280 Now hes on the switch against Edwards which means that there is a mismatch under the basket where you got to look for the big guy They dont And it doesnt matter if this Walters hits the three because of the mismatch that gave Walters enough space because NC State is concerned about not allowing Eatola to get the basketball on the interior A slow close out to Walters who knocks down another jump set up by his fourth assist for Miller Nice finish by Hollerman over Egan Trey Hollerman with five points and swipes Davis Ray Hollerman able shot off the mark from three and I pushed off Switching defensively often opens up music opportunities for your teammate BJ It has been a fun start to our game No undefeated teams here but a fun start How about the two remaining unbeatens as the guys who were looking to Arizona and Miami Ohio just as we all thought coming into the year 22 and 23 and0 respectively Everyone watch Travis Steals Miami Red Hawks What a watch they are in the match as Edwards can a straight on triple Hes the first player in double figures today And we talked earlier about guys who are extremely versatile DJ Edwards does whatever SMU needs for him to do He can score Hes capable of doing it with a huge block right there off a nice move from Midal Miller kicks it Pierre will drive it Pierre over Cooks under the pinch Jon Pierre is an elite scorer The first time I had an opportunity to watch him play in the NIC last year Wingsfield 30 points five assists six rebounds at Georgia Tech getting a win when he was with Jacksonville State the Conference USA player of the year last season bringing his talents to SMU Now 1955 career points and Miller is not far behind him splashed as a three in front of Will Wade Timeout NC State Corob score averaging over 19 points per game A little down in ACC play but scoring this 80 run over the last minute 194 66 assist 2 and a half assisted turnover Those are all top six in the ACC Bad spacing right there for NC State coming out of the timeout You got three players standing right next to each other unable to get much going on the offensive end of this possession gets it into Luben trying to dig in on Yigu Luben forces up the shot A career miss for him And those are the type of defensive possessions Andy Enfield wants to see from his team if theyre going to be able to advance moving forward Its going to need to be more of that Of course more of this great cutting and finishing on the offensive end And like Aman to Irvin Miller to Pierre here Wait wait wait wait wait a minute We talk about the triplets now Theyre good Six assists for Bofy in the half Williams launches bangs it home from three Williams with his second triple to momentarily quiet the crowd Williams has an NC State high nine Pieran Edwards each with 10 for the Mustangs Quad one game for both teams said he doesnt have a lot of these opportunities remaining Miller on one bounce to with one bounce off the back rim trying to stuff it home Williams from the free throw line will get the bounce and a nice response from the Wolfpack five straight points after the Mustangs have a strong run to time out Williams is able to knock down the three and then gets to midrange to go to make it a eightpoint game Looking for a cutter instead of hand off for Miller Miller came out to bump and Yatola with a catch Walters end of the shot clock and Yatr stands the offensive rebound Walters again missed again and Williams touched it out of bounds So SMU can get close to the final shot and shot clock should reset to 20 I dont believe you can call that There it is You cant call that a possession for NC State So 22 2 second differential between the shot clock and game clock heading into the halftime locker room Important possession right now for the Wolfpack to try to come up with the stop Took out Williams brought in the other big Russ and Luben for the final defensive possession Smart switch by Trey Holland with Boopy Miller all the way at half court to get Sier off of Boopy Three to shoot it Heres Poopy Didnt get it off this time Pass was too late for Pierre There should be a few fractions of a second left on the music game clock It should be exactly 22 if you would listen to your partner at times when I told you the difference between the two earlier but you dont like to listen music to me No not necessarily Im just surprised you didnt say Huh laughter Well Doug Shia was on it Well see if it changes Yeah Will Wades been pointing at the shot clock for some time now It should be 22 seconds I mean again it was 222 music I cant imagine how its not Well its 22 Two divided by two laughter Hollerman from Boopy Miller range Oh got the back rim Points responsible for that scored or assisted Miller 25 of the 42 for SMU Copeland 22 of the 34 for NC State 10 different players have hit a three 15 different players have put their account on the score sheet And NC State starts with the ball with their leading scorer Darien Williams with 13 And Williams going to the post and taking advantage of the mismatch And hes a mismatch problem SMU led by BJ Edwards Rob Pierre with 10 each Miller had the big first half with seven six assists Starters are out there for both teams Miller against Williams with Cory Washington Four to shoot it Washington gets bumped and fouled on the floor by Paul McNeel Jr Its the third foul on McNeel who was just one for four for three points in the first half And theyre going to attack Paul McNeil Jr They understand how important he is to the Wolfpacks offense leads the ACC in threepoint field goal percentage Also has made 46 threes over their last 11 games So they won him off the floor Total finishes for his first field goal And too easy thrown over the top to Evatu with his 6 in advantage over anyone else on the floor So NC State able to get an easy bucket for his first of the game Williams three That is good Set up by of course Copeland Eighth assist for Copeland And Darien Williams with 16 points Uhoh Pierre F State he didnt dunk it in somebodys face but just a defensive breakdown No one really picking up Pierre with no resistance for him The easiest bucket hes had in the game Hes had some easy ones A dozen points Six for nine Williams ends off to Luben and theres a foul Iu blocked the shot but there was a foul on the body first the sixth assist for a three in this game for Cuadia Copeland Eighth assist overall but Williams I guess expecting a screen and pretty much just Olay music defenses and allows Pierre to get right to the basket No one there to add any resistance Foul was on Yig told Allen Lubens going to shoot two music By the way we learned something during the halftime break Doug Sur came over You were wondering why are there not 22 seconds on the clock the difference between game and shot clock which he did explain to us for those curious So by rule the officials are not allowed at the end of the first half or at least music until the last two minutes of the game to be able to go over and just do simple math with the shot clock in comparison to the game clock So it is based upon when the whistle blows where the even though the shot clock violation happened with 22 seconds remaining It took another second pretty much for the whistle to blow to stop the clock and they cannot go over and review Appreciate Dave Simmons coming over and letting us know that because I thought it was pretty simple just to put 22 seconds back on the clock Luben meanwhile misses both free throws Keeps the lead at seven 46 shooting for SMU Seven of 14 from three Knocked away Copeland deflects it from Edwards Heres what we were talking about at the end of the first half Yeah you see in a great view of the side shot clock So as it goes to zero but the whistle doesnt blow until 11 Thats what its called So they cannot go over and look at that to change it And thats not on the officials Thats the rules of the game Strung for the ball Its not a turnover because SMU has the arrow but the magical number of 11 is now the shot clock for SMU I can tell you right now every coach in the country will take 11 to get a shot It compares to a turnover on any possession So therefore still a music chance for a positive possession for Indiana Edwards Pierre knocked away by Copelan Now there are 310 of a second left which means it has to be to the basket and a tip So theyre going to throw it up to Yuto to see if he can catch it at the rim Or theyll just take a shot clock viol They They didnt know They had no idea Its amazing Youve got two senior guards that had zero idea that theres only three on the shot clock I mean the whole SMU coaching staff was pointing to the shot clock Andy Enfield looks like somebodys just put poison in his Froot Loops I mean or maybe the water bottle that he was running My gosh Smashed his head out of the chair You understand why he just fell asleep at the wheel and turned it over for the sixth time Williams behind the back Nearly turned it over Good catch by Luben Three to shoot for Holland off the shot fake Short on the three and Lubens in the middle of three Mustangs It squirts out to Boopy Miller NC State only two offensive rebounds Miller gets wrestled out of the air Copeland hit him up high He was hit on the body as well And free throws are coming for Poopy Miller Boopy Miller changes end of the four quickly as that time hes able to get out in transition beat Trey Hollowman to the rim Cuadia Copeland the secondary defender committing the foul music but making a play on the basketball Luke Miller one of the faster players in the country especially with the basketball in his hands However probably not the fastest guy in Texas I believe that title goes to Kingston Flemings elite freshman this year at University of Houston who was a projected top five pick in this years NBA draft Miller where free throw miss second best free throw shooter in SMU history splits the pair Hes only three for six at the line Oh Holland man take an extra step with the ball there He just had to make sure he had his toes in bound Deep shot clock again for State Top looking to playmate in the Egolu and a foul against Igolu who pleads his case Tomorrow night an NBA Wednesday double header over on ESPN Nola Joic and the Nunas visit the Knicks followed by the two best in the West Spurs have owned the Thunder this year though meet up at San Antonio Coverage begins 630 Eastern 530 Central music on ESPN and the ESPN app And and well see if any of these teams have Giannis on their rosters Well tomorrow it wont be tomorrow but the the Thunder did get the last game against the Spurs So after the Spurs took the first three of that series this year the Thunder were able to get the last one Now this one goes to San Antonio which Im sure they will be excited to welcome in the the reigning champions And uh its taking a little while I know folks have are going to say Well Ive been watching the NBA this year What do you mean The NBA season has officially started because James Harden got traded James Harden gets moved You can start the season Hes going to Cleveland for Darius Garlo in the Cavs Clippers deal which was announced just before this game I actually told Coach Mowgli that earlier today father of Evan Moley who was on the SMU staff He wasnt even aware of the train Hes locked in on trying to make sure the Mustangs get a win here on the home floor Oh was struck by Washington on the way up Williams misses a three Punched by Ael Copeland to Hollerman That three will go A highflying possession for NC State which is within three and two offensive rebounds on that possession for the Wolfpack Both teams did a really good job keeping their opponent off the offensive glass in the first half but now the offensive rebounding starting to play a part here in the second Edwards driving his ground Well heres a three for Washington the response Another senior guard one of the four senior guards that starts for SMU experienced beyond measure for the Mustangs in a big play Hollan answers Speaking of senior guards there are a number of them for the Wolfpack as well And now youve got the veterans making plays on both ends of the floor And that was Claudier Copelands 10th assist He has 10 of the 11 NC State assists now Washington Thats a foul on the floor Oh its starting to get fun here in Dallas Well weve got some veteran music presence in this game Trey Hollowman the senior transfer from Michigan State stepping up and making music his presence felt for the Wolfpack as they try to get back to undefeated on the road Looking forward to seeing the match up between those two stellar freshman in one of the only two times well maybe AC tournament but they would play against each other in the regular season Hey years you know he had the final four maybe four times Yeah thats true They did play four times in the 2022 season SMU by three Luke Miller turns it over Thats an uncharacteristic turnover by Lucy That was easy but Washington getting a hand on the Trey Hollowman three blocking that shot Hollerman making the gesture that he should have pump fake as Cory Washington gets out does a tremendous job after Hollowman has knocked down his last two threes denying that opportunity SMUs led by as many as 13 Remember Saturday the Mustangs had a great first half against Louisville Fell apart in the second up top for ONeal The air was right behind him but ONeal put it in By the way both my nephews involved in that play Played together at high school as well as for Drive Nation in the EBL A question for you Sure How large is this handling tree Huge Williamson hits a three laughter Huge I mean I Im one of 25 grandchildren on my moms side and I feel like they didnt compare to your family and otherwise Pierre answers Williams with a three of his own Ninth of the game I truly believe for the Mustang moving forward not only offensively where we know hes a lead but defensively as well being the biggest of the guards for the Mustangs He can guard the position Williams shot Williams trying for his own miss Hes got it Calls for a clear out against Tombs And Williams will slow walk it out to the arc 19 for Darien Williams who throws it away Guardia Copeland once again finding threepoint shooters His music ninth assist for a three in this game But Jeron Pierre returning the favor on the other end knocking down the three ball over the outstretched music hand of K And it was Quadirs 11th assist total which is tied to careerhigh Hes playing with three fouls now by the way So heres the updated number you referenced earlier 101 assists that have led directly to threes That was unassisted That was Giron Pierre just doing work And the NBA scouts in the building he is priority number one Theyre coming to watch Jiron Pierre and he is now starting to put on a show Backto back threes on the last two possessions Williams giving space Thats a mistake That is a defensive mistake If theres supposed to be a switch you have to switch up Dont give Williams that much room from beyond the threepoint line or communicate Uhoh That was a mistake too Pierre missed a three Uhoh Miller takes it away from a pain Copeland who is on the ground And Doug Sh will stop play Yeah Copelands ankle got caught up underneath Boopy Miller diving for the basketball on that possession Vader will reace the right shoe Hes tough as nails Waves off the sub He has to come out at this point with the play being stopped Hes going to limp off the floor But this was a scary play You see Copeland going after the loose ball as Booby Miller dives for the basketball His foot is back behind him Scary play Fortunate to see Guadier get back up and able to walk to the bench And thats thats a play where in all honesty you dont want to keep him out long because the longer he sits the more it stiffens up If hes able to come back and play you got to get him back on the floor quickly do look like Jack Scherzer with the manager tries to take him out of the game And we got a foul to stop the play here as SMU was starting to run away with the ball Thats a foul against Egan Tollu who had no fouls in the first half and has picked up three since the break He just came into the game 12 seconds ago and has to check back out Andy Edfield doesnt even look at him Well so in this game because of the switching and because of the way that SMU wants to play on the defensive end Tombs may be a better fit as he has to go out and guard this pick and roll action Hes much more equipped to do so Able draws the foul and finishes Huge bucket by Matt Ael attacking off the bounce You have to respect his ability to shoot the three in the corner So the close out Uhoh Weve got some Weve got some action on the floor once again We talked about the talking in this game and the officials stepping in once again to make sure they separate And there Doug Sha goes over to the sideline and we see the chippiness here as Matt Ael gets the bucket and Sam Walters tries to walk through NC States huddle and then pushes Trey Hollowman in the back Theres still a little chirping going on And again much music to do about nothing And so the Wolfpack will get a delay of game warning after that but it has more to do with the music huddle after the after the bucket and not getting to the free throw line to get going So but again I think these officials have done a tremendous job especially and we cheering know that we knew coming in that this was going to be a testy game You talked about a qual opportunity for both teams An important game on both ends for two teams that are right now in the NCAA field but you never know what happens in the future So an important game for both the temperature has been high ONeal driving ONeal Greatness He has given Andy Enfield great minutes in this game Had five first half points making energy plays as well And now attacking off the bounce going to the turnaround getting a bucket SMU has freshman big Mitchell Holmes in the game for the first time Were in 13 and white fighting against Lub Williams in the Walters and a blocking foul called by Pat Adams against Walters Kind of he has much more in store as we have a close game going down the stretch Its not often that he needs a bounceback game and scored in double figures every game this year until Saturday Nine points against Louisville Shot just three of 11 And the infield didnt really recognize his team at Louisville And they got off to such a great start but after that he felt like the ball stuck They didnt share it as well as they normally do as Valenu was able to get the bucket to go on the interior But this has been much more of an SMU offense which weve seen all season long NC State has pulled within two Meanwhile Copeland and McNeel are at the scores table Heres a cutting Pierre over Arsenal off the back of the rim and down to NC State Andy infield on Pat Adams He felt like Pierre was contacted on that shot as Matt Abel was able to knock down the three ball and give the Wolf back their first lead since 121 in the first half Three straight makes for this good on the road They went 31 and won the national championship by David Thompson in 1974 On an 112 run They played so well this half Cory that SMU has shot 70 in the second half and been outscored by nine And its only been a difference of SMU has three second half turnovers Im asking myself how is that possible But its the fact that the Wolfpack are shooting six of 10 from beyond the threepoint arc 60 in the second half And they have really been able to find what they want to do And again this is a team that comes in shooting 397 from three leading the ACC and threepoint field goal percentage Second and close to 11 per game Miller off the foul by Lu Its Pierre Hits the underside of the basket Gets it back Cant finish Gets it back again and still cant finish Finally its Copeland emerging from the frame Great opportunities by Pierre on the interior Normally he finishes those but three chances Another nice find from Copeland to Luben These two guys are masterful in pick and roll action Washington picked up his second foul at SMUs sixth of the half tomorrow night Told you about that ACC SEC double header right here on ESPN 2 music Notre Dame against number 24 Louisville Oklahoma and Kentucky 7 Eastern 6 Central It all starts also available on the ESPN app Second foul on Washington Luben is just 247 at the free throw line this evening Its been a struggle and you got to give SMU a lot of credit Instead of Allen Luben being able to have permanent games like he did against Syracuse last week theyve cheering been sending him to the free throw line forcing him to try to earn the two and he has not been able to do against one on this possession cheering 626 midway through the second half Quad one win Thats the highest tier on your resume for both these teams Whoever gets it its a real resume booster as the calendar just turned to February Its that time where you start thinking about the bubble watch and brackety and its no longer small sample size Edwards to Washington Rebound Hes fouled by Luben on the floor Thats Lubens second February is the time where you can really start heating up and Duke is a projected one seed undefeated in the league Virginia and North Carolina on the five line according to our Joe Lonardi Five teams in the top six seeds in the ACC Miami hanging in there Cal and Virginia Tech are first four out So 10 teams in real contention right now in the ACC Remember last year the league got just four picked up smothered by Luben And heres McNeel whos in a very quiet game Four starters and Arsenal for NC State which is on a 122 run ONeal drives in cheering Eiglu and it will stay with State did a good job there Staying vertical playing in foul trouble Doesnt want to pick up that fourth Does a nice job staying vertical there And it was something that Andy Enfield went over his team with his team in practice yesterday making sure the guys did not bring those arms down Stay straight up and dont allow the officials an easy call Heres McNeel Finally get A THREE AND THATS THE careerhigh 12th assist for Copeland Its the 13th three of the game for NC State which has its largest lead And this is the Copen that will lose those less shots more assists But Miller with the attack getting downhill able to get right to the rim Once again very little resistance at the rim for the Wolf Copeland for Ael Hes open He hits it They cant miss Everything NC State touches and everything that touched Claudia Copelans hands first turns to gold Miller again cant finish here Pack with their largest lead Can extend it MCNEEL FROM COPELAND OF COURSE there is magic at their fingertips and Cuadier Copeland him underhand passes all kinds music of distribution Look at this bowling ball to Paul McNeel for his 14th assist But Cuadier Copeland knew exactly where he was going the entire time down the floor He was giving Paul McNeel Jr an opportunity to get to his spot and then he gives the student section an earful Doug Sha said Get out of here He said he was having a conversation It seemed pretty onesided and the shell shot SMU students There was an NBA scout pregame that said that Guadia Copeland took one shot and shot a couple free throws and then the remainder of the time he stood at half court looking at the other end This was just able to get the dunk off a nice find from Washington But he said Guardia Copa stood at half court looking at SMUs direction the entire time just shaking his head announcing that he was here to go to bat Hes on the bench right now Able whos got 11 off the bench puts in another two NC State now 13 out of 20 in the second half 8 for 12 from three and they are plus 16 since the break A strong second half for Matt Ael His only field goal in the first half was the shot that got goalended It was one of five in the first half but he has come on here in the second Should say hes now plus 17 for Red Sea State since halftime Danger zone for SMU Down by nine and turning it over Arsenal off the takeaway Folded it in the lane and still finishes WITH A FOUL Thats one of those plays Will Wade told us Terrence Arseno can make one to two athletic plays that no one else can make And you see just getting his hands in the passing lane the deflection and then turning it to the other end Loses the basketball but still able to corral it and finish with the contact Opportunity for a threepoint play off of a nice defensive effort by Arsenal music He was fully out of the rotation earlier in the year He didnt play in four games A couple of coaches decisions in there cheering but now with a tighter rotation Terrence Arsenal has become indispensable as hell take a seat Got a big smile and a slap on the back from Will Wade Williams replaces him By the way when Daren Williams went to the bench it was 6160 NC State He carried them much of the game And with him on the bench they outscore SMU 15 to four But you thats what youre thinking about when you consider a good team Its not just about one guy Everyone stepping up and playing their part and helping them get back to a lead and now extend it to 12 on the road Washington kicks it ONeal will take the three Swing it out to Washington again Its Tombs and theres a foul No a travel first Pat Adams had a foul Doug Surmans came in with a travel call to overrule the foul but Surmans had it first The travel was before the contact as you see Tombs catch it at the top of the key And as he catches it the pump fake but watch the feet that happens before the contact Thats music the right call And Doug Sur knowing that he had it correct is able to get in and overrule the foul Its a good job by one official being confident taking control which is what you expect with this extremely experienced officiating crew Able and Doug Surman has another travel Just keep rolling those arms That snaps a streak of NC State scoring on 10 consecutive possessions Had a game recently in Pit where they scored on 14 of their final 15 in a road win 10 straight today A road win where they were out rebounded by 25 and still able to get a win on the road But as you mentioned it was the offense at the end of the game that closed it out scoring on 14 of 15 possessions And now here in the second half scoring on 10 straight possessions this Wolfpack offense and again oftent times doing it with substitutes on the floor not just their starting lineup guys able to get the job done offensively Under six to play SMU down a dozen Pierre pushes his way in Too strong for McNeel And just a physical play by Pierre initiating the contact to make sure McNeel does not have a chance to contest the shot 24 Pierre but they need a stop He need a lot of them Williams short on a three That one was a little bit rushed by Darion Williams Felt like he could have probably driven that one especially with the close out for Miller on the floor for SNU Its Pierre Its good Its a three Holl drives in You went straight up just like they preached in practice Itll stay with the Wolfpack with 12 to shoot And thats a great job by Yugato But even better job on the other end of the floor Jeron Pierre making sure he gets his feet keeps his feet in bounds great footwork and able to knock down the three fading into the corner just showing off one of his many skills Pier had his fewest points of the year tied for his fewest points in his last 63 games with the nine on Saturday Hes got 23 today Copelan has returned for NC State Poopy Miller still on the bench in a tough second half for SMU Heres Claudier Copelan into Williams One dribble Williams cant finish Grab by ONeal Heres Pierre Its been his show for SMU and is denied at the rim time brings out only the fourth second chance points after doubledigit offensive rebounds for SMU And this time able to put it back McNeel No Edwards with a rebound SMU has scored the last seven IU will go to the line A chance for two more A chance to make this a threepoint game Third foul on Ben Allen Luben Germaine ONeal Jr has been incredibly active Hes the only reserve on the floor And again SMU is making this push with Andy Enfield keeping Boopy Miller on the bench towel draped around his neck You could get hits the first Just a 54 foul shooter The 12th offensive rebound for SMU The fifth second chance points They struggled to convert on those offensive rebounds earlier in this game but the last two possessions has made them pay for giving out extra opportunities Four straight second chance points to Higato cheering Final run Well let Moody take it cheering Williams answers And how about the gesture to the crowd once again the Wolfpack do not mind playing the villain SU answers three with two Yiku feeds Washington cheering Copeland with a 15 assist game Most for the Wolfpack since Dennis Smith Jr 9 years ago and a foul off the ball will send NC State to the line with 330 to go A frenetic sense Cory This has been amazing offensive basketball in the second half It really has and neither of these teams hang their hat on what they do defensively So we knew there was going to be fire worse offensively coming in and they have not disappointed One and one for Darren Williams out of the timeout and Williams calmly hits the first He leads the way with 25 Hes been the main benefactor of all that Guadir Copeland passing Terrence Arseno checks in for Paul McNeel to get a little more solid defensive in the third consecutive 20point game for Darion Williams who was the preseason ACC player of the year starting to round into form I believe this chemistry for the Wolfpack is getting better game by game as he misses the free throw but this team seems to be playing much more cohesive as a unit as of late With the same drive the ball into the rim Arsenal with three No And the rebound down to Germaine ONeal Jr Four starters and ONeal again Goopy Miller has been on the bench since 650 Tough second half Four turnovers in the game shooting just three for 10 And the Anfield didnt ride with him He rides with Pierre who a three and Arsenal has another rebound But one thing I will say with the late game heroics of Rookie Miller this is about the time I think Andy Infield wants to get him back on the floor You need your leader in these crucial moments especially with your team down five Cop sends up and a shot fake A three missed and Pierre finds it Two and a half to play Fivepoint game There goes to the table and a foul is going to send Edwards to the line for a one and one Williams who fell hard on what looked like his right wrist in the first half is on the ground again music And thats Daren Williams first foul And I believe that was after the foul the cutter running into Darien Williams Yeah Cory Washington who gets hit by it looks like Trey Hollowman and takes down Williams after the whistle An unfortunate and unintentional low blow to Dario Williams Edwards with a 101 There is Boopy in the game for Germaine ONeal Jr Edwards hits the first Thursday night music NC States womens team highlights an ACC Network play for K double header Clemson and North Carolina kick it off at 6 Eastern 5 Central Then Florida State goes to Reynolds to take on the Wolfpack at 8 Both games also available on the ESPN app That was the first point for BJ Edwards in the second half He was the first Mustang in double figures with 10 in the first half and just made his first point the free throw even though hes unable to get the second one cheering to go here in the second half He didnt score in the second half at all on Saturday after 13 in the first So the lead is still four for NC State approaching the twominute mark Copeland on a drive for Luben cheering Sets him up for two more But once again Vin Allen Luben relocating to the perfect open area right behind gives Copen out Miller not cold at all Burries one off the bench Hes got a dozen Fourpoint lead 140 to go cheering And Copela is just going to let the ball roll here to eat up the shot clock And look at this Hes eating up 10 seconds of the shot clock And Hefields not happy Duck Sur is yelling back at him He didnt touch the ball Its a smart play by Copeland You cant start the shot clock until he touches the basketball You going all the way across half court But it allows NC State in the front court to be able to use more time on the clock Copeland got to in the air and got tackled So Claudia Copelan used about 32 seconds there including the time that went off the clock when the ball rolled and he draws the fourth foul on Yigatola Guard Copen attacking the basket but watch Vid Allen Luba just relocate right behind Yiddigu and then Copeland finds him But here a nice pump fake to get in the air and then the hard foul Copeland just has a smile as he knows he baited the big fella cheering into sending him to the line You asked him today at shootout You said Quander would you rather play at home or away And he looked at you he goes Away He knew I knew the answer laughter Of course he knew I knew the answer It was almost like Why are you even asking me a silly question You know the answer to that He loves to be the villain Hes got a sevenpoint double double 710 and 16 And again in the home of BJ Edwards who has two triple doubles on the year is not unheard of for hope for this Washingtons able to knock down the three could walk out of here with a triple double because hes going to be the guy with the ball in his hands that theyre probably going to have to foul in a threepoint game Will he walk out of here with a win NC State takes its second timeout Its going to be a 30se second music timeout Dont go anywhere One of the most impressive passing performances in the history of this proud program and hes got the ball in his hands Theyll get it up to Williams Hollowman Luben McNeel along with him on the floor Williams will operate with 10 to shoot He scored 25 and from the midrange he misses SMU can tie a three with 30 seconds to go It will take its final timeout Andy Enfields sprinting up to call that timeout Wants to make music sure he gets exact 6 and0 road start in the ACC SMU one of its two toughest games remaining on the schedule A chance to try to music snake it at the end after NC State had led by 12 with 650 to go Washington will inbound No timeouts He has to get it in and he does but Copeland deflects it Its called off of Copeland Copeland is pleading with his team to challenge here Have to review The challenge is unsuccessful SMU ball on the sideline cheering The loser timeout We continue on NC State down to one timeout music Remember it used to be that officials could automatically review any out of bounds play in the final two minutes No longer is that the case It was close and and it was and it was a great challenge by Will Wade I mean whats the point in hanging on to it at that point But when you consider the fact that if you could have possibly gotten that basketball back that could have been pretty much the end of this game And so a great challenge unsuccessful challenge and now well see what Andy Infield drew up to get the three Washington heaves it into the back courty Miller Miller the late game hero for SMU so many times the last two years drives in to Luben and scores it Luben didnt want to foul him So its a onepoint game and now if youre SMU you have to go for the turnover and if you dont get cheering it you got to foul to extend the game Holl pretty good free throw shooter Hollan gives it to Williams They are running a lot of time right here and Copeland is fouled a 78 free throw shooter as NC State burned 7 seconds Thats the 10th SMU foul So it does mean two free throws for Quadier Copeland And played very well by SMU Again music Boy Miller did not have the three So he attacks the basket gets the easy two puts the pressure on Copeland to go make him at the free throw line and see do you walk away from this Is it a twopoint game Is it a threepoint game or does he miss ball and its a onepoint game Well hes not going to make those So now if youre SMU if hes misses one you got an opportunity to win this game Bookie Miller went over to the sideline discussed something with Andy infield walked into the huddle in between free throws and probably gave his SNU teammates the play And misses the second Its rebounded by SU which does not have a timeout Miller three game winners for the Mustangs in the last two years Miller steps IN AND A SHOT is blocked NC State will win it
