in the ball game for Cal He wears number eight for the Bears Evans carried it Lee Cassell saw it rolled it back in his hand Great call partner But Day was on the back side cuz Vasar was rolling for the live and Evans getting ready to pass it Thats why he carried the ball Why is Dayday Ames more comfortable tonight than he was Wednesday night Is it Carolina or is it Day Ames offensive initiative I I think its coach Matchin saying What are you waiting on You are who you are You got to be aggressive Speaking of aggressive Camden waits for no man I love it I love his attack I know you do Come on baby Evans didnt get the start for the first time this year today for Carolina That ball got knocked away on an entry for Bogots Carolina gives it away Here is Pippen Elich Basar shut it down They try

bench for Madson Do whatever you need coach Lob for Vesar The catch on Got it blocked Itll stay with Carolina Thats good defense right there We know UNCC 54 action Best in the business That time Basar keeps it high But good block Yep Real nice play by Illich Evans for Basar and stepped out of bounds before he passed it with a double team on the catch Dennis on the catch and Illich being all the way at the threepoint line harassing Basar Thats huge Thats a turnover Yep So a sixpoint lead for Cal North Carolinas turned it over five times Both teams over 50 Cal right at 50 Carolina almost 56 Bears have led from the start though Theres a back door cut Carr kicked it into the corner Campbell against Bogavas Bessar helps with the double team Campbell will soft ball away Sure DJ Campbell on the board Eightpoint Cal lead I was wondering first where he was going with that but he took his time and faded away and knocks it down Yep Evans Theres Treble Wilson fouled by Carr Mismatch there Favored Carolina Carr pays for it with his first and the third on the Bears Yeah Cars dribble dribble and Basars coming A lot of young guards pick their dribble up He keeps it alive Little step back I saw him

stay away from the double team Basar 13 to shoot Bogots on the floor Wilson and Jonathan Powell out there Heres Wilson The catch and the first bucket for Caleb Wilson with 1045 to go in the first half Stops the run by the Bears Carolinas also committed five turnovers in the last 419 before we had that break Kick out three and Pippen knocks it down Zone killer Carolinas a little match up Two or

for Wilson Poaching us Cannot stop that No Second field goal Four in a row for Caleb Wilson And that time he got the ball too deep You couldnt double Tarheelss back to the zone 3D match up Good ball movement Attack the middle of the zone if you can Carr getting a lot of minutes here with Ames and Pippen playing more of the wing Theres the middle zone Good pass inside Coaching us had it wrestled away and stolen by Wilson Carolina trying to pick up some momentum with Powell Bovots who knocked down an early three one dribble and heres Powell Wilson the catch up strong against coaching us and draws the foul But you notice the first on the sophomore from Lithuania five on Cal Dennis You know those last two possessions Calebs now too close to the basket Its hard to double team And now hes

out of the corner for Powell is good Yeah big time shot by Pow Carolina trying to make a run He was in this two3 zone Kind of taking Cal out of their offense a little bit Tar Hills have trailed by as many as 13 in this first half And with Ken Evans coming off the bench for the first time this year and Derek Dixon getting his first career start today for Hubert Davis the Bears were able to fire out of the gate pretty strong Leaf Dort had a big play early couple dunks four rebounds and then the Bears ultimately went on a 163 run to take a 13point lead with 11 minutes to go in this first half Carolinas rallied back from that 13point deficit with eight straight from Caleb Wilson and a three you saw from Pal a moment ago but it has been the Golden Bears on the attack for most of the first half Bell missed an easy one there Dennis Yeah he played good defense Once you hit the stem you you miss the easy layup Here is Wilson Double team coming Finds Bessar Hes fouled by Carr Second on the freshman Carr Thatll be the six team foul on Cal And we get a timeout in Berkeley Golden Bears by right way Sharing the basketball And when theyve held UNCC to one and done theyve got a good

Hes knocked down a couple that time The head fake You get Kayla Wilson off balance Now youre at the free throw line Dennis he came in here fighting it a little bit Remember it was a struggle the other

mindboggling to your point because I know that man right there is like shoot the ball Yeah Im putting you in situations You have to shoot the ball with confidence Tonight hes doing it Second one about Camden Hes good And that snaps the twominute drought that Cal has had and pushes the lead back to 15 Now if I want to nitpick Camden you should have missed that first free throw Too good of a shooter

miss Basar battles Dort had it Lost it Last touch by the Bears 20 to shoot for Carolina Oh I love that tug that tug of war down low with Vasar and Dort Theyre down there wrestling like two alligators And if youre Cal the encouraging part tonight is that Lee Dort is playing the same way he played Wednesday night against Duke when he had 14 Hes had two straight double figures in four of his last seven but the effort the intensity the defense and the offense kind of matching each other If Cal were to go on and win this game and theyre up 18 Lee Dorts start is going to be a big part of No

the line cheering Carolina struggling at the line Already 68 coming in Thats 16th in the league and below 50 and they missed them both Two pillars of the program are absent for Carolina Oh defensively and free throw shooting Dennis Yeah And thats once again thats what Hubert talked about Hes Im not worried about our offense Our defense is just not on par right now The free throw shooting has abandoned them as well This is not a good free throw shooting team by standard Well we always talk about your point guard or the guys who have the ball the most which is Vasar and Caleb Wilson They have to make free throws down the stretch Third foul on Caleb Wilson a moment ago Fifth on Carolina Oh good block by Vasar And itll stay with the Bears with eight and a half to go Yeah good move by Pippen right here Gets by his man Then you have the eraser that has your back Dort the catch and Pippen the way to Ames Normally we say mouthenhouse This time we say gotcha Day said I have a sevenfooter guarding west Let me put him on skates and drop him off Hes got 19 in the game now and leads all scores for Cal They have three in double figures Ames with 19 Camden 17 Pitman 13 And before the lob and catch for Basar theres a foul on Ames Itll be his second That is seven on Cal with 807 to play Carolina to the bonus now But as we noted a moment ago tough day at the free throw

playing Germaine ONeals son at SMU Hes not bad either I got a chance to watch him play other night Hes not bad either Ken Anthony Justin Pippen on that list Free throw good by Treble We mentioned this the other night has only appeared in a couple of ball games four in fact Stefon Marberry son Stefon III is on the Bears Terrific guy Great young man Times catching up with him Yes sir And Trimble hit them both All right One two two zone I mean trap excuse me Yep Carolinas had some success with it Caleb Wilson And everybodys giving the loop Theyre looking for the looking for the coach going to challenge this or not Sean May moving a little slow with his iPad Yeah Lets see Hubert Davis now I think were going to get a challenge here by Carolina Oh yeah Oh day to day That shouldnt take long That shouldnt take long All right well step aside Well it depends Theyre different players different participants on each team it looks like Thats true Back door lob Treble the catch I think he went for the tried for the dunk and now they almost threw it away Pippen knocked it away Itll stay with Carolina Derek Dixon did not put enough air under the lob for Trimble Great call partner Yep Oh Cows coach said no So Treble to put it in play 11 to shoot Tremble having a hard time now Gets Vasar to collect it Skip it to the right corner Derrick Dixon a three rolls in Derek Dixons got 11 Six and a half Carolina to within 12 And a timeout from Mark Madson 708 to play Closest the Tar Heels have been in the second half And well keep it here at Hos Pavilion Its a 30 second timeout taken at the Bears bench And already a busy day in the ACC and Day Ames we said at the top would have to be one of the guys if Cal were going to pull the upset and he has been Yeah I dont know if it was his music pregame meal or coach Match and talking to him but its definitely a different player than we saw Wednesday night doing what he does best attacking get to his sweet spots and Carolina has had nothing for him right here He gets into his bag a little bit steps back knocks it down with confidence So California shooting 53 for the game 47 here in the second half In fact the field goal shooting is identical right now in the second half for both schools Yeah if you Cal stay aggressive You know now every time UNCC scores theyre going to be in some type of fullcourt pressure Is it one two two or mantoman pressure Stay aggressive Attack it Dont be passive Ames has got 19 Hes had 20 plus in three of the last six had eight the other night against Duke on three of 11 shooting but he has been the guy today 19 for Ames 17 for Camden 13 for Justin Pippen Who takes the rope for Carolina here Dennis is as much a question that needs to be answered too Well I think you have to go through number eight Its one thing we know with him He can make something happen or he can see over the double team to get you a good shot on the weak side of the floor Yeah Carolinas also struggled at the free throw line They are 54 and a half today at the line 12 of 22 122 number eight the top of the trap Y away Jaden Young and Caleb Wilson forced a turnover from Justin Pippen Hes yelling He doesnt want it He dont want this pressure And now DJ Campbells coming back Theyre going to take Chris Bell off the floor Put another guard out there Yes you have three small guards The two bigs for Carolina right now Seven nothing run by Carolina The last minute and change Wilson at the top against Camden Dixon Another three Back rim and the rebound Dort had it Ames tried to make the save Threw it away Wilson collects Threw it up Besar the catch Henry in traffic trying to do something with it skips it Jaden Young WOW JADEN YOUNG is night three of the year And the Carolina fans in Hos Pavilion think they might have a path here Ninepoint lead for Cal But Dennis to your point this is where you cant linger if youre Mark Matson You cannot get past him Stay with the same intention you had to get the point The big lead you had earlier Ames for Camden Lost it on the dribble Heres Trimble Its threeon one Bounce pass Wilson fouled on the play I say it again partner The last possession for Cal Camden youve been shooting the ball well all night long Why be passing Now youre in transition Get the ball to number eight Good foul by Pippet Make Caleb Wilson go earn it from the free throw line Yeah Wilson has really struggled at the free throw Well hes four of four Carolinas really struggled at 12 of 22 Eight in the half 16 in the game for the freshman cheering And Wilson will rest and stare at the rim Its a one dribble operation for him Free throw good cheering You see he is the team leader in four categories cheering Checks all the boxes Yep Second one Too strong Thor the rebound Eightpoint game 6 minutes to go Feels a lot different doesnt it No question A lot different Intensity picked up now Can you continue to execute Kyle Pippen against Dixon Out front Heres Dor cheering Thought about the back door Now Pippen with 10 to shoot Skip across for Campbell on the drive Blocked Out of bounds Three to shoot Wilson Basar both there Campbell thought he got hit in the head in that play Caleb Wilson gets a piece of it Pippen on the baseline Besar will defend it Heres Camden in the corner A three Got it First field goal of the second half for John Camden Hes got 20 Come on partner Thats what Im talking about Oh thats what you were doing in the first half Shooting the ball with confidence Passing Cal had turned it over four times in the last three minutes until that and Basar answers Yeah miscommunication on the backside for Cal Good pass Back to a 9point game 77 to 68 Cal has led all the way We got five minutes to go in Berkeley Dort out front Heres Camden Now Pippen off the top back out front Camden again off the rim and Tremble collects it cheering Mark Madson says get back defensively Besar thought about Wilson Now heres Dixon cheering Jaden Young in the corner He knocked down a three a moment ago Dixons hit two in the second half Heres Dixon around Dort all the way through Tried to dump it to Basar He collects Skips it for Young Five to shoot Jaden Young back for Dixon Derek Dixon One dribble out OF THE CORNER GOOD OH MY GOODNESS Time out HERE FOR DAVIS DEREK Dixons got nine in the half And Carolina BAILS THEMSELVES OUT TO get to within six Carolinas making a run here Kick to Dixon Steps into it One little dribble and right there Yes the ball has left his hand Clearly shooting it with confidence And Dixon with the start is putting his imprint music on this ball game Thats his fourth three of the night That is his fourth three Derek Dixons got 14 in the game in his first start of the year First start of his career for the freshman from the DMV DMV baby Yeah Another one of you guys Ice water in his veins Another one of your guys Come cheering on baby Now Cal one two two trap Move the ball Have good spacing Attack the trap Do not be passive cheering Vixon has tied his career high He had 14 against Georgetown cheering Carolina with the 122 again DJ Campbell stays on the floor with Camden Ames Pippen and Dort And a turnover to Vessel Inside four minutes we go You know what time it is now partner decision cheering making time Whos going to make the good decisions now these last four minutes Five turnovers on Cal the last four and a half minutes Wilson for Dixon tries to beat Pippen baseline Besar a three and that will fall off for Campbell I know he can make that shot Wes just get a little more flow Youve been getting good opportunities Im not crazy about that particular shot Mark Matson consistently standing at the far side as Campbell or Ames rather launches a three that Trimble gets the rebound Heres the outlet for Jaden Young and he got wrapped up and a foul going to be called on Dayday Ames by Lee Cassell Foul on Ames will be his third Thats 10 on Cal Oh second on A That was close It is the 10th however on Cal That was close So Jaden Young who is two of four at the line this year thats all Only four Only four free throw attempts for the junior transfer and he rolls the first one in comfortably Well hes a jump shooter Shoots a lot of threes so didnt drive a lot So getting a penitative Six minutes the other night at Stanford was scoreless We saw him get a dozen last Saturday night in Chapel Hill Hes got four all here in the second half Make it five and we have ourselves a fourpoint game with 321 to go Yeah this fullcourt trap has really taken Cal out of their float offensively Pippen almost traveled with it Once again Camden lead for Ames And now to your point does Cal kind of wind clock here No attack cuz the more you slow down youre playing into UNCCs hands Thats why theyre back in this ball game Pippen Dort set the screen against Stevenson Pull up jumper Good for Justin Pippen Thats aggressive basketball Youre not waiting to see if the traps coming You get to your spot you rise up and shoot it 15 for Pippen Cal back to a sixpoint game cheering Stevenson out front Besar right side for Dixon cheering returns it to Treble Hell attack with 10 to shoot Right hand floater Too strong Knocked out Pippen collects Cal in the front court Stay aggressive Stay aggressive 17 to shoot 15 to shoot 210 to go at Berkeley California trying to post a second win against a ranked team for the first time in almost 10 years Ames with three to shoot Stevenson there Day fall away is no good They saw the rebound Its a shot clock violation and a good thing for Cal If it hit the rim itd be a run out for Treble Great defense that time by UNCC staying down not fouling getting the shot clock Correct Okay so game maintenance for Lee Cassell in this crew as you saw Caleb Wilson check back in He replaces Jiren Stevenson So Dennis the interesting part here is Cal in some ways is doing the smart thing from a game management perspective leading by two possessions under two to go But you still got to keep your temperament which built the lead Exactly Its tricky Tremble and a foul on Dort Thats four on Dort and two free throws for Seth Treble And unfortunately Dorks been doing a heck of a job all game long with the hard shows Now you have to be smarter on the hard shows knowing theyre shooting two free throws now for the rest of the game Inside two minutes to go and tremble to the line California by the way needs two more fouls to shoot free throws cheering and applause but not necessarily that that might not be Carolinas mode of operation as well as the Bears shoot them right But probably want to keep Cal off the line as much as possible given that theyre 79 and almost 82 against the league Well these last 10 minutes partner UNCCs figured out how to be aggressive without fouling Yes they have Second one bounces in a dozen for Trimble Six in each half One two one trap Fourpoint game again Camden now for Ames Quick pass front court for Pippen Dort Here is Pippen Pull up three right of the circle Air ball And Justin knew it when he left his hand Yeah So when he left his hand you know it didnt come off the fingertips So now its four points with 124 to go Weve already had the second conference game go to overtime earlier today when Boston College beat Syracuse Are we looking for a second one today and the third so far in this ACC season cheering 75 seconds to play Dixon Young in the corner Trimble on the drive Put it up Crowd wanted to travel Didnt get it They roll for the loose ball and Lee Cassell the whistle possession would belong to Cal if its a hell ball Its a jump ball and it will go to Cal The Berkeley partisans thought that Trimble walked with it on the drive He might have gotten away with a step And heres the pressure again in the back court Say it again Cal fans be aggressive Do not be passing and tentative Thats how you get turnovers Camden here for Dort And now Pippen Minute to go Remember Carolina has to commit two fouls to put Cal at the free throw line Theres the first one to get him to six And its on Jaden Young And Hubert Davis is telling his team one foul Now remember you might want to do this quick Yes And there it is Jaden Young the foul And thatll be free throws for Justin Pippen 57 seconds to play Tar Hills who lost by five at Stanford on Wednesday night have never led in this game at all It was seven nothing Cal before people got comfortable Justin Pippen to the line He is two for two back in the first half One and one Pushes it to five Possession count cannot change regardless of make or miss here And that ones good So its a sixpoint game 57 seconds left Carolinas got to get after it offensively Dixon Heres Treble Thats a three and it is off the mark Dort the rebound Oh Oh Dort Thats what Im talking about Wes Thats a grown man rebound at the end of the game Bass starts hanging all over him Thats what Im talking about Stay aggressive Good defense Can test a threepoint shot Look at this Go get that rebound in traffic Y Thats how you close out a ball game Besar commits the foul Eight on Carolina Lead Tort to the line for one and one He is 70 on the year Hes got eight today Hes got a double double or has a chance for a double double if he knocks them both down He missed the front end He was four for four the other night Right Sure was Sixpoint game It is Heres Young at the top looking for help Trimble on the drive Besar a three too strong back rim and Campbell the rebound a foul on Treble nine on Carolina and the Bears can feel it now with 294 to go in a sixpoint game Remember the first question I asked Mark Matson on Wednesday Does your team believe are they afraid of the blue bloodoods coming from the east coast coming out west Right They played a what a half a half quart and a half if you will against Duke and then of course Duke put him to sleep Tonight the same belief put him in great winning situations and the one and one no good and make free throws Third in the nation Here is Dixon back out front Besar a three Got it 8178 Henry Vasar his first three of the afternoon gives him eight in the half and 14 in the ball game This ball game was tied only once today at 1010 And that time York got strung out a little too long Not want to rotate You have a shooter in that far corner The snap if you will and then they take the four across the inline four to the field And Carolinas got to decide how theyre going to defend it And who do you want to foul here Oh its Camden whos going to initiate it to Pippen And with 16 seconds left Carolina playing for the turnover Heres Bell Hes the best shooter in the ACC Now Pippen is the guy you want to foul Just made You dont want You dont want Chris Bell to take him Hes automatic Four fouls on faceoff 10 on Carolina Pippen And the first one is the most important one And the free throw good That makes it a fourpoint game 8278 with 102 to go And second one good cheering Vesar in for Dixon 8 seconds left Heres Wilson A three at the front is no good They try for the tap Dort the rebound and a foul by Vasar will foul him out of the ball game And California is going to post their second ranked win of the season They beat UCLA over in Oakland back on November 25th by eight points The Bruins at the time were 18th in the country or in San Francisco I should say at Chase Center And here today theyre going to beat number 14 North Carolina and Lee Dort who started this can close it Two shots for the big man from Dallas Lets give Mark Matson a lot of credit His game plan to a T has worked Control the pace One and done defensively Not too many live ball turnovers Attack the paint for threes And thatll rim out Carolinas going to go 0 and2 on the West Coast swing 3D and Cal gets a very important split from Mark Matson
