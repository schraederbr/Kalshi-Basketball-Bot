its been a while since the theme sounded like we did on Saturday and the win against North Carolina the Panthers hoping to keep it going they wear the home goal tonight Virginia in blue our officials 10 Valentine Patrick school and Matt Potter Tuesday night in the ACC and we are underway its Virginia that starts with the basketball expect both teams to play man to man Pitt will extend their pressure some Virginia will work the ball for 30 seconds and get there a really high contest uncontested shot thats their ball every possession armon Franklin opens the scoring for the Cavaliers take a look at the pit starting five a lot of veterans on this Panthers team that have really all come together a lot of transfers they know this is their last goal and theyre making the most of it in the ACC heres Burton battles in and out no good Applause you only missed three shots 14 and 17 on Saturday in the win against North Carolina 31 points he is at the top of the scattered report Kate and Shedrick rocks the rim and the Cavaliers two for two to start the contest Applause Pittsburgh has great balance they move the ball they are very good in their false green offense Gardner rips it away this is a Virginia team thats coming off a game on the road at Georgia Tech they had 14 steals in that game foreign ER beautiful ball rotation Clark into the paint uses the window and Virginia starts on a sixnothing run Virginia does such a good job of moving the ball playing off the double getting the ball to the other side of the floor and attacking the closeout fantastic three well short from Blake Henson thats the exact spot he drilled that three on Saturday night at 67 against Carolina skip off the double attacking the closeout getting inside nice by Cedric at The Rim Virginia perfect three for three from the floor to start this game gaining Gardner fading away cant connect going inside to Federico Federico Way Off the Mark for the big fella they dont usually throw it on the Block to him transition three no good for Kihei Clark Pittsburgh still looking for their first basket of the night possessions at scoring at a premium when you play this Virginia Cavaliers team well you know they like to bring two to the ball in their ball screen defense and you have to be strong with the ball and youve got to move it Applause on the drive kick out Elliott with two on the timer get short Applause last this possession Virginias going to move the ball and get a couple of sides Pittsburgh started this game oh for five at a turnover Franklin fires a three hes off the mark Virginia typically doesnt send more than one maybe one and a half to the glass they like to get back on transition defense and build a wall make you score against their mantoman pressure in the quarter Court Shadrick great health defense Blake Henson lost control Virginia can test everything look how they come with the help and the rotation by Cedric Applause quick trigger off the inbound nothing but the bottom of the net finally the Oakland Zoo can let go of some confetti its him cuts the lead in half how good as Blake Henson been leads his Panthers team with 17 points a game seven rebounds Applause defense tried to TF Shadrick five seconds to shoot Clark eyes on the timer trying to cross it over and its a turnover Virginia and Pitts its going to be tough to score tonight defense dialed in early for Terry Holland he even joked with us he said I wish they didnt keep track of wins I wish coach Holland could just keep the record for alltime wins well he said theres no greater example of wheat than a record that includes the number of team wins and David teal from the Richmond Times dispatcher a great story about Terry home we wish him well in his battle with Alzheimers and uh wishes family well also 100 and thats something that Tony Bennett echoed to us throughout the week is hes been getting closer closer to this Milestone just hes keeping the Holland family in his thoughts well theres no greater representation of Coach Holloman Dave Odom and Seth Greenberg and Jim larenaga and guys like that that have wonderful spent wonderful time with Coach Holland of course Tony has won that national championship all those great games at UHaul on campus at the University of Virginia Music Applause starting off on a sixnothing run Virginias pick come back a little bit just a one possession game just getting started early on the impression is this is going to be a defensive lockdown battle where points are really hard to come by no easy baskets nothing in transition youre going to have to work and execute thank you Applause pet fans wanted a walk Virginia keeps it alive dander Bloss cant hit the three the pitch defense a couple of times has taken Virginia very deep into the shot clock Applause no points in the last three minutes 30 seconds for Virginia and hit hes used that time to tie it up I love the execution by Jeff capels team its a short roll to an open space where his Henson is capable of knocking that shot down because you know theyre bringing two to the ball on Boss green offense Applause stay with Virginia underneath their own hoop Applause watch the screen by Henson and then the short roll its not a roll to the rim its a roll into space where he can quickly get a shot off before his Defender can recover Virginia now in a fourminute scoring drive its allowed Pittsburgh to go on a six nothing run five seconds to shoot pull out pop beakman too much on it Applause getting his hands on it Clark fading away finally connects first making six shots for Virginia I mean right down the lane line what a great change of pace by the fifth year coin for Virginia never seen her early today getting up extra shots we took the first boss over he beat us to the gym which is its hard to beat you to the gym thats for sure time heres Burton draws the foul do you have to guard a guy more aggressively when he goes off for 31 the game before I think youve got to understand the Scout he likes to put it on the bounce hes a really good midrange shooter hes capable of making the three and hes shooting 44 percent Applause theres Jeff Capel and youre number five its all starting to come together for him in Pittsburgh 30 in the ACC theyve won nine of ten this is a huge test tonight to validate that this team is for Real when it comes to ACC play I think Beekman and Franklin have a good understanding of jamarius Burtons capabilities Franklins got the assignment right now Applause Franklin drills it Virginia starting to heat back up Armand Franklin his second bucket of the night I love how he uses that bounce to get into the rhythm of his jumper it was that short roll again spinning his way into the lane too much on it foul called on Federico Federico hes talking about Jeff Capone the success Pittsburgh has had this season epitomize this past Saturday they were down nine points with 11 to go against the preseason favorites North Carolina rallied back dug deep to win that game the 31 point s going 14 for 17 from the floor and Pinson with that big three with a hand in his face as Kihei Clark thats his second turnover in the early part of this game very rarely see that from Kihei Clark hes got a 31 assist turnover ratio Applause thank you Enrico from Corrales third turnover for Pitt and now theyre in a scoring ground of nearly three minutes these two teams just trading defensive stops heres Franklin nobody picks him up and he skies and slams its nothing Virginia run Franklin really doing a great job working off the ball constant movement Applause like hes a banding crossover fires and hits coming off the bench Jeff s Nike so Bandy is sixth starter and he shows why there I mean hes shooting 27 from the threepoint line and he takes that contester three trying to answer falls out to Kihei Franklin wide open and he makes pit pay Franklins got the hot hand he does a great job of locating off the Baseline penetration into the slot to catch that three catch and shoot three four or five for Franklin who would struggled for consistency this season hes founded here at the p as Virginia led by Armand Franklin theyve taken control 159 early home crowd recognizing with Tamar and his family are facing right now a really beautiful moment in a really tough time and the outpouring that weve seen in the Pittsburgh Community being here today and here that he has been overwhelming incredible empathy incredible love and support such a sad situation that a young man there appeared to be 100 healthy playing at the peak of his athletic career they showed on the board in here as there was a standing ovation here to raise twenty five hundred dollars for his foundation and theres over five million dollars has come in in the last 24 hours its amazing in time zone tragedy were reminded how great Humanity can be better thats Ronnie Tony Bennett Virginias head coach shared with us that chewed around that the Virginia Community knows exactly what the Pittsburgh Community is is going through right now where wins and losses are meaningless and so much more important things come to the Forefront Applause the sports can serve as a distraction from no matter what is going on in the world and thats what were trying to provide pit fans tonight Applause Applause Music Virginias gone and waves tonight started out on a six nothing run now theyve made four of their last five vanderplas trying to keep it going he cant Applause foreign Ty going right at Beekman and turns it over thats the fourth turnover of this first half for Pitt Virginia guards the ball so well such a great job with high hands Greg Elliott with his hands down gives Franklin a Clear Vision hes just short with his jumper Burton still scoreless after he put up 31 against North Carolina draws the foul here the Burton does a good job of attacking the Hedge right here you see vanderplast jumps out to heads and uh attacks that outside hip Applause draws a foul hes not afraid of contact no hell go right at you Im impressed at how he hard he drives how he plays the game on two feet plays on balance sets up a threepoint shooter Elliott wide open cant cash in Second Chance opportunity shoots from the same spot and this time knocks it down hes had a couple of good looks from the threepoint line and thats confidence right there when you put in the time and you put in the Reps youre not going to get that many clean looks from Virginias defense and off an offensive rebounds a perfect time to shoot a three Gardner the master of the midrange connects there Applause Pittsburgh has only made four shots but three of them have been from three its allowed them to keep Pace with number 11 Virginia here in seconds to shoot Burton kick out so Bandy pull up pop no good does such a good job of helping on the post up and then recovering back to the shooter Applause heres Mickey Neely now Franklin seven seconds to shoot Armon Franklin off to vanderplas for a three rattles in and out no good Applause so Mandy just lost his footing now here comes Beekman all the way to the rack couldnt finish it Applause just four of 16 of this first half against a stout Virginia Defense yet only down five offensive foul going the other way Ben vanderplas putting his body on the line and thats with the story of the night Virginias defense continuing to deliver extensively dominated physical game well we didnt expect much scoring right here and both teams executing on the defensive end theres Burton attacking the outside hip of Ander Plus and then the last play right before break Greg Elliott called for an offensive charge I dont know his heel might have been in the restricted area but vanderplas I think he took three charges in the North Carolina game Music he is not afraid to put his body on the line even if it costs him theres Vander plas moments ago headed down the Virginia hallway back to the locker room back in the huddle but wont return to the court and said the Freshman Ryan Dunn comes in for him well you know what kind of toughness you gotta have to play in this particular environment and to play for Tony Bennett those are the things that come to mind when you take on the Virginia Cavaliers I love Jeff Cables honesty when we asked him how do you how is the team responded since then Big Win probably biggest win theyve had in years against North Carolina over the weekend he said well find out tonight but they better bring the fight because we know Virginia Will Clark he will make you pay Kihei Clark delivers and Virginias up eight Music Tony Bennett can give Kihei Clark a break early in the game and then be able to maintain the lead I dont think thats a good thing because Kihei Clark is definitely a valuable piece of what they do on both ends of the floor passing out of the double team its stripped Jorge Diaz Graham trying to keep it alive for Pitt But ultimately Virginia swipes it away I got six steals for the Cavaliers Applause youd be correct and theyve cashed in nine points off turnovers make it 12 timeout Jeff Capel after the Reese Beekman three and it is all Virginia Cavaliers on an eightnothing run Kihei Clark has added that three level scoring more consistently to his game look at the ball movement hes wide open hits the hell they say basketball is a game of runs and Virginia has epitomized that tonight the Cavaliers have gone on a six nothing run followed by another sixnothing run now on an eightnothing run and theyre up 11 how does Pittsburgh respond after the Jeff Capel timeout Applause whiskey crosscourt pass finds Henson drives for the hole lays it up and in with three seconds left on the shot clock a mature very well executed possession by pit off the timeout Applause great thrilled by nine in the second half against North Carolina on Saturday Shadrick tried to follow up he was in good position and draws the foul you get enough ball reversals and switch sides youre going to be able to attack Closeouts because of the way Virginia rotates this is a big strong move to the rim son has seven points to his name tonight the rest of the pit combined only has seven points as well good time to remind you ACC basketball continues tomorrow right here on acc networks of Tobacco Road rivalries he got Duke in NC State and then Wake Forest against North Carolina great double header right here tomorrow Tyree Appleby for Steve Forbes and Wake Forest second in the league and scoring second in assist behind Kihei Clark about quickness theres a fun guard to watch Applause all over Nelly Cummins extending way out James city has been the hot hand that misses though foreign Music Applause thats a ridiculously high number and jamarius Burton after that Miss he is still scoreless after putting up 31 on North Carolina Saturday yes Mark the drive and intense they thought it was a travel Virginia turns it over anyway Elliott over to Burton count it plus the foul thats exactly what Pitt needed a chance to make it a threepoint play when we come back Burton first bucket of the night trying to get pit back in US Pittsburgh trailed by as many as 13 now Trails just by nine take a look at this drive right here by Virginia gets inside Cedric drops it off eight assists on 11 buckets by Virginia in the first half so far Kihei Clark driving the Baseline throws that drift fast and Pittsburgh gets a steal off and this counts as a fast break point now you know Tony Bennett is not going to be pleased about giving up any fast break points but its all for turnover and jamarius Burton will be at the free throw line and what a difference tonight compared to Saturday that was Burtons first bucket coming with less than four minutes left to the first half after he dialed up 31 in the huge win against North Carolina Not only was it Burtons first bucket of the night but first points off turnovers tonight for Pittsburgh come on Applause Music completes the threepoint play cuts it to 10 although a 10point lead against Virginia that feels like 15 right I think so because of the pace that they play with so Pitts trying to Speed the game up right here by extending their pressure off the main free throw Applause s youre sad than done when you get the Savvy guards like Clark and Beekman out there I think its really hard to speed a team up especially the maturity in the backcourt that Virginia plays with actually Applause rims out no good and a foul called against Virginia Ryan Dunn The Freshman picks it up Music 16 fouls for the next one Pittsburgh will be in the bonus for the remainder of this first half Applause commanderplas back on the floor Applause Music thank you theres instant spinning his way in as a step cant use it falls out to some Bandy and he hits another offensive rebound and another basket for Pitt weve got eight points off their offensive rebounder foreign kicks it out Beekman he knocks it down from three good job playing Inside Out smart play by Virginia recognizing the switch on the Block and then the skip back out to the perimeter Music thats beefman second made three of the night puts Virginia up by 11 swiped away vanderplas with the quick hands foreign Applause overs seven of those Virginia steals Applause usually Virginia is cashed in for points off those turnovers instead going the other way Burton unconventional layup but it counts all the same hits defense their ability to get a couple of deflections and their ability to offensive rebound has kept them in this game three standard plus double team comes in Burton knocks it out of bounds with 11 seconds left on the shot clock its switching on their screening action Applause watch the skip inside you see the collapse Shedrick does a great job of putting it in a pocket ready to catch and shoot on the perimeter Jaden Gardner reenters the game for Shedrick be a little bit of a smaller lineup on the floor for Virginia Gardner calling for it and he gets it eight seconds to shoot Beekman finds Clark Quick Pass to McNeely battles in and out it was halfway down but did not drop Music Burton out of the paint and he lost his footing found pain soon Applause 10 seconds on the shot clock did not need that shot from Guillermo Diaz grab confusion there for the Freshman Im not sure why he thought the shot Rock was running down he was shooting right in front of the Virginia bench you never know if somebodys counting down three two Timeout on the floor well step both aside for 30 seconds up at halftime youll be in the studio with Dallin cuff and Kelsey Riggs as they get you caught up on what was a dramatic and busy night in the ACC U finishes with our night cap tonight here in Pittsburgh Panthers trying to go 40 in the ACC Tony Bennett has beaten his pit team in the last eight meetings in the Virginia you would say to me has controlled this game since they started on that six nothing run I think theyve done a good job of moving the ball I think their defense obviously has come ready to play with the tips and deflections and steals theyve been able to get they got to clean up the offensive glass and they got to do a better job of taking care of the basketball right here now the turnover Gardner misandled it up ahead and a trip as Guillermo Diaz Graham was storming to the hole theres a second second foul for Reese Beekman tonight take another look steal off the double team and you see Beekman gets his feet Tangled Up only a 54 foul shooter on the season every Sunday afternoon right here on the ACC Network womens basketball a terrific double header it starts with Pittsburgh and Louisville at two and then Notre Dame UNC top 25 matchup in the ACC Sunday at four foreign Chapel Hill for that Notre Dame game against North Carolina North Carolina has lost three in a row they stay in the poll though at number 22 Virginia scoreless in the last two minutes they do control a seven point lead three seconds separating the shot clock in the game clock McNeely left open from the corner and he buries it well thats a huge mistake defensively by Pittsburgh not to locate him good Patience by Virginia McNeely 75 percent of the shots he takes is outside the arc you know its coming and yet could not stop it Burton Music Virginia takes a 10point lead into halftime I think Virginia cleans up the offensive glass taking care of the basketball this 10point lead does feel like its more than a three or four possession game just because of the pace that they play and the discipline they play with on the defensive end and the way they execute offensively points out at premium for sure terrific atmosphere here at the paint but its Virginia in the drivers seat at halftime a 10point lead 3323 lets get you into the studio with Kelsey Riggs and down Franklin leads away with nine for Tony Bennetts team Kihei Clark seven Reese Beekman six and Kaden Shedrick six well Jay Pittsburgh has scored 16 of their 23 off of five Virginia turnovers and second chance opportunities Virginia has to clean that part of it up but it has to execute better in the quarter court and I think they need to Speed the game up a three would help it goes bagging from Nelly Cummings to start the second half it is so hard to get good looks like that against this Virginia defensive when you get him you feel like you have to knock him down he puts more shot pressure on me for sure all right especially when you Trail by 10 as weve alluded to before it feels like its more like 16 or 18 Shedrick tangled up with Federico Federico Pat Drisco is going to come in and communicate that that ball should be going pit Cedric got caught up on Burton screen yeah it was actually Burton not Federico Capo cant believe it and I thought that was pitfall Clark Rises off the window and in for Kihei Clark so youve really got to extend on Kihei Clark hes shooting 42 percent from the threepoint line its the best of his career at Virginia and then he can put it on the bounce I dont think he called Bangkok the same Burton the answers right back Elliott down on the floor really collided with Cedric Applause watch off the ball right here you see they collide I thought their Bank hurts but Applause Music Applause Elliott Subs down for Nike so Bandy I think they were discussing whether they needed to go to the Monitor and look at it and officials came together and decided they didnt need to Jeff cable doesnt want him to go if youre going to lose a timeout if you go there and theres nothing all right whatever Pat Driscoll said it was good enough for Coach cable and to be fair it did look like those two guys just came together I dont think Shedrick even sees Elliot until the last minute until its too late Applause hes leading by 10 theyve won eight straight meetings against Pitt Jaden Gardner just left wide open easiest layup of the night Attack Mode draws the foul Kihei Clark is in position but inside the restricted area watch how far out Brook starts this drive in Kihei oh I dont know about that I thought he might have been in position I thought he was in the ark Applause I dont think he was outside the ark but he might not have had those feet set established legal guarding position you can move obliquely to protect yourself Applause foreign could have gone either way well take one more look or his feet two feet on the ground and then he moves I dont know yeah I think the officials might want to look at that one again Applause when you slow it down like that it does look like it was a charge I agree with it after a slow start no points of the first 16 and a half minutes Burton now up to nine for Pitt Applause ing over 21 in ACC play though Shadrick answers right back down low what a great duck in good high low action by the Cavaliers Applause against watch the timing on this Greg Duncan good delivery by the ACC assist leader Kihei Clark Applause Burton takes a right to Beekman double team comes in what a recovery by Reese Beekman he is so fun to watch on defense Applause stays pit ball 12 on the shot clock every action is contested on this end of the floor passing out of bounds leads to a three great job by Nelly Cummings to keep that play alive its a band he drills the triple when you drive Baseline you get behind that Virginia Defense and if you keep moving the ball and you go Swing Swing its a wide open three Virginias three for three to start the second half can Franklin keep it going yes Armon Franklin buries him Applause Franklins up to 12 points to leave Virginia and score and they are perfect four for four to start the second half action when they clear it out he cleared that out he was calling his own number the whole time Applause defense the issue right now for the Panthers nobody boxes out Armon Franklin Keeps The Possession alive for Virginia Applause Franklins the hot hand gives it up though to Beekman eight seconds to shoot Franklin dribbles in a lot of contact Falls to Gardner he cant convert trying to speed it up were going through their actions much quicker here on the offensive end of the quarter Court Applause and Virginia back up by 12 how valuable is Kihei Clark to what Virginia does I mean hes so good at setting the tone on the defensive end but he also understands what I call the three Ws hell get the ball to win and where Bluetooth keeps calling his own number that one misfires Applause Franklin with 12 to Pace Virginia scoring Applause wide open three so Bandy got it what a great decision by Cummings he could have gone for two and said he kicks it out to Savannah whos knocked down three triples in the game Pittsburgh cuts it to nine they trailed North Carolina by nine on Saturday in the second half and roared back to Win It a big Miss by Franklin Tommys going right at Clark now finds Burton in attack mode he knows Virginia is going to bring two he rejects the screen Burton getting really aggressive in the second half for Virginia or excuse me for Pitt good fine bye Cummings in transition big reason why Burton its a Bandy having a much better second half than they did in the first well be an aggressive 11 points combined in the first half already combined for 12 at this point in the second half Applause his way into the lane draws the foul you know Henson scored on that play in the first half for a three on a baseline out of bounds this time hes going to the free throw line really great acceleration off that screening action to get open Applause Music part of speeding up the game is accelerating through your actions quicker on the offensive end I think theyve definitely picked up their Cadence watch this movement right here good I think good job getting to the freethrow line by Blake Henson a part of that older group of players that Jeff Capel brought in and not only did they come from good programs they came from really good coaches Kermit Davis said Ole Miss foreign portal if you will whats interesting is they didnt have the full group together until September which is really late and yet Jeff Capel told us earlier today found fast chemistry they knew hey weve got something here this feels different and yet you start one and three yeah older guys veteran guys that understand culture winning want to be coached been coached hard in the previous places Shaka smart and Marquette and then of course the previous guy Iowa State Blake did not play in Iowa State he was Adam West they go to the big man Federico Federico who delivers and Pat has cut it to a two possession game Panthers have won nine of their last 10 since that one and three start theyre playing with confidence and they have battled with number 11 Virginia all night long Clark step back leans in lost the handle its Pitbull really good d by Nelly Cummings that time Cummings hasnt scored but hes done a much better job of managing the game in the second half for Pitt look at that close out walls up turnover Virginia scoreless for the last two and a half minutes its allowed Pittsburgh to go on a six nothing run Applause Cummings recovers and now draws the foul danderplas Applause Ben vanderplas is so aggressive Applause and that ball screen hedge right here and here comes the screen he jumps out aggressively Cummings attacking that outside hip thats part of managing the gamer here that Im talking about putting another foul on Virginia right to the rack Cummings an eightnothing panthers run and youve got a veteran team like Tony Bennett has he doesnt want to call that timeout right here not when his offense is in front of his bench McNeely Off the Mark Here Comes Pittsburgh theyve got all the momentum right now Applause the cut and finish timeout Tony Bennett its a 100 Pittsburgh run Applause Music Federico Federico with a drop off to Burton on a basket cut we got a game here in the second Tuesday night Pittsburgh on a 10nothing run against number 11 Virginia theyve cut what was once a 13point Cavaliers lead down to two well I think its their acceleration through their action in the court of court I think its their ability to get downhill and I think its Burton rejecting screens and starting to get hot along with sebanda Virginia in a scoring ground of three minutes and 30 seconds the pit Panthers have capitalized on a 10nothing run it has not LED for even one second tonight Franklin thats an air ball Captain by Pat Panthers have made three in a row Applause I definitely feel like its a more vertical game by Pitt as Mel Cummings gets into the pain and scores tied at 44 its a 12nothing pit run first time this game has been tied since it was 00 at tipoff who do you trust to get you a basket when you go on this run when youre surviving in Rome and that Virginia this is the one thing about their team about going through scoring droughts this season thats hurt them Cavaliers scoreless for the last four minutes at 35 seconds pit meanwhile on a 12nothing run weve got a fun finish coming in the ACC Music the person its their downhill Play Its theyre playing the game vertically North and South theyre aggressive theyre attacking theyre getting into the paint and theyre doing a good job of finishing when they get inside Music Virginias got to take the pain away protect inside out look at the numbers here Jay shooting in the second half eight made baskets in the first half they already have eight here in the second and you attribute that to just being more aggressive more aggressive more vertical looking to attack in the ball in the middle third getting to the paint Virginia led by as many as 13 they led by 10 and for outscoring the Cavaliers 2111 this half and the hoos are scoreless nearly five minutes tomorrow Music his first personal foul Applause Music Applause Virginia is the seven of their last day desperate for a bucket Applause trying to end a 12nothing pit run who do you turn to Beacon right here on the switch by Hinson whos late to recover he got a great look and just missed it Pitt looking for their first lead of the night Henson delivers it look at Nelly Comics doing a great job of managing pushing finding the open shooter with a great pass okay its a 14nothing run to take the first lead of the night for Pitt shendrick trying to answer right back hes rejected hard to the hall great defense and now here comes Virginia back the other way hit getting back Clark through contact counted plus the foul and now Kihei Clark with an opportunity to get the lead back for Virginia look at Cummings right here switch aside to the floor playing off the backside of Frederico dropping it off in Henson maintaining his bounce and then a little header there by the ball after goes through the rim watch this right here playing a little soccer Kihei Clark again off the glass here in the second half five minutes and 48 seconds between made field goals for Virginia and yet they lead by one after Kihei Clark completes the threepoint play I dont think I think he he changes everything for Virginia its Tangled Up and a foul called against Gardner he cant believe it thats his second foul coach Tony Bennett upset that he thinks you know the official in that area did not call the official coming from on the other side in the C position Applause thats what the officials Applause and Pitt delivers on the defensive end right back to Savannah hes in attack mode swiped Away by vanderplas and itll stay with pit Virginia has not done a very good job on Baseline out of bounds execution defensively look at the Slam by savande foreign Applause Music its a 193 panthers run Clark great patience and he knocks it down Kihei Clark answers if you ask me who you trust thats who I trust for Virginia Applause Applause eight seconds to shoot savandy off to Hanson fires too much on it Applause Pittsburgh quick to get back and set up their defense clinging to a onepoint lead Clark hesitate shoots doesnt drop hit every part of the rim but did not fall and its pitball Henson doing a great job of getting to that deep corner playing with some emotion right now foreign Applause Applause Way Off the Mark and itll stay pimp ball underneath their own who Panthers leading by one this game is cranked up in the second half two great teams going punch for punch monster second half Run Nike so Bandy send it into Bandy and now theyve got a onepoint lead Debbie well again Blake Henson on these out of bounds plays hes been the target Music three times he scored or got to the freethrow line when is the last time the Oakland Zoo looked like that its fun in here its loud stoops not even home in school right now look at the runs right here Virginia starts the game 60 and then they go on an 80 run to take an 11 point lead they have a 10 point lead at the half and look at the response by Pitt how did Pitt get back in it aggressive acceleration through their actions speeding up the game looking to attack and the right guy is taking shots and during that 162 pit run it included a 14nothing run that is the largest run against Virginia but the Cavaliers have allowed this entire season Applause went right to the rim missed it there to clean up the spill everything but the finish for Federico Federico foreign excuse me Applause backing down Henson now kicks out Beekman with 10 on the timer goes to work as a step and uses it counted plus the foul Reese Beekman on a big bucket the play was set up for a three for Clark from behind on the rescreen but Beekman has a step look how he uses his body to protect the ball and gets him to the chest of Burton to draw a foul leads the threepoint play restores the lead for Virginia you just get the sense this is going to come down to the final possession between these two teams I mean what a story for Pitt starting out the season one and three theyve won nine of their last ten coming off a huge win against North Carolina 30 in the ACC pick to finish 14th and here they have the number 11 team at home on the ropes thats who left it short for three offensive rebounds Second Chance heres Cummings and a shot clock violation it should have reset that hit the rim shot clock absolutely should have reset to 20 officials have to take a look at this Applause well all take a look together so that shot clock should reset to 20 from 20 and said it ticked down from five so this is going to be Pitt basketball clearly hits Music I want to make sure they get the right time on the game Music its not a question of hitting the rim or not its how much time will be on the game clock what theyll put the 20 second shot clock what theyll send it to true Music 12 on the shot clock 6 44 on the game clock its going to its going to be basketball trailing by two Panthers have done such a nice job battling back in this game they traveled as many as 13 including 10 at halftime and 12 with 16 minutes left in this second half you got to know where Henson is here hes the Target on uh Baseline at a bounce place they go right to Elliot whos fouled with a chance to tie the game from the line Greg Elliott using that 80 inch wingspan Applause hes just throw it up there

country fun finished Cummings has been at the bottom of the ACC and Jeff capels Fifth Season he put everybody on alert with that comeback win against North Carolina on Saturday what a followup
