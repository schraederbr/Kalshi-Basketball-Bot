Georgetown in dominating fashion 8161 and made nine threepointers in that game First win against Georgetown since the Maui Invitational back in 99 North Carolina in the white controls the opening tip They had a big win against Georgetown back in 82 That worked out pretty well Yeah pretty well 6362 in Portland Mike Mhm For the national championship Some guy number 23 hit the shot Young kid One of five national championships Six if you count the one from 1924 as well Those banners hanging in the rafters at this incredible setting for college basketball Bouncing around on the interior Wilson tried to get to it after the miss and its out of bounds And to the Spartans a big size advantage just about every position for they are the biggest team on average in the NCAA 67 and a half And you know Mike thats something they necessarily could not say every game last year They have stepped it up in that department As I said in the open not just big but big and talented Good combination USC Upstate 6 and five one and four away from Spartanberg South Carolina Shot clock winding down trying to work that baseline with Smith His shot was deflected Vesar was defending and he will pick up his first personal foul You know what That was actually a great possession for USC for Upstate And uh you know we talked to Marty Richtor that he wants to get the shot clock under 10 in every possession But not only that they get a foul on the play as well Armani Gregory who was trying to make the play is second leading scorer on the team Hes got the basketball now So were 15 points per game trying to drive it into the paint against Wilson Has to kick it out cheering Gregory with the shot clock at six Wilson alters the trajectory of that shot They keep it alive and now Smith tries to go baseline Its deflected and back to the heels Box trying to go all the way Had it wrestled away Held ball and it favors USC Upstate You know virtually every team that comes in here to play focuses on um transition defense and really nice job by Upstate that time getting back stopping the break Fifth season for Hubert Davis as Mike mentioned averaging over 67 for the height of Falina That is the tallest in the nation Floater on the baseline Gregory He stumbled down Wilson ends up with the basketball trying to show off the handles and gather it Nessar and two man action dumps it low Nessar lays it in for two Yeah Thog He was going to get a lot of playing time but actually you know you think you dont want anybody to get injured but Seth Trimble being out for this stretch has really let other guys step up Hes certainly gotten more reps Left arm injury for Trimble Hes only played in two games so far this season for North Carolina for the senior May get him cheering back before the start of the ACC season but they want to be very c careful with it Martinez sends it back out This is Smith This is THE JUMPER FIGHT FOR the rebound between two Tarheelss and taken in by Stevenson Up ahead quickly Vessar had it poked away out of bounds will stay at this end of the floor Head coach in his second season Coach Marty Richtor Well you look at you know the advance already six wins total last year a very rough first season but already matching that in December just two and 14 in big South play last year for the Spartans And if if the Spartans can get North Carolina to settle for threes early thatll certainly be to their advantage Then they just have to block out and get boards Now so far North Carolina this season 14th in the ACC in threepoint shooting at 32 Spartans are on a twogame winning streak Theyve won three cheering of their last four Bendinger and theyre going to find that theyre going to get shots but theyre going to have to alter because of the height of North Carolina thought about Vessel for three You mentioned 14th but on the floor right now he may be their best threepoint shooter And Hubert Davis talked to us yesterday He said Were a better threepoint shooting team than weve shown but Vessar has been solid Vesars ninth made three of the season 19 tries The red shirt junior from Talin Estonia Shot clock winding down on the Spartans and a miss Vesar has the rebound He had 18 points and 15 rebounds a careerhigh in the win against Georgetown Wilson cheering spinning on the baseline and elevating for the jam applause And I think those were the first two points he scored at Carolina where a dunk And he cheering he announced himself rather loudly and has stayed loud throughout this year But yeah if youre guarding him you cant give up the baseline like that 29 dunks on the season That is tops in the nation for Caleb Wilson Vessar has the clearance Wilson who had 20 points in the Georgetown win and 14 rebounds to tie his season high out of the corner for three Thats a miss from Stevenson Davis gives it up on the perimeter to Smith Back to Davis Thats for three cheering So the Spartans are on the board Yeah I thought you know in these type of games in this situation its really important for the visitors come in and and uh get some confidence early feel like theyre in the game cheering Eric Davis now has 10 made threes on the season Vessar driving and getting a chance to play because of the injury to Trimble And then Powell is one of those guys whos gotten more minutes Powell straight away Thats a three Jonathan Powell applause and cheering And he doesnt waste the time getting getting into the scoring column Transfer from West Virginia with his 11th made three of the season Struggled against Georgetown from threepoint distance Mike he was just one of five Lyric Davis comes back with the bucket at the other end Hes been playing well for them in the last couple of games 11 points nine rebounds And hes the one whos given them a little emotional lift trying to work on the inside with James Brown It goes out of bounds and it will be Upstate basketball And Martinez with the block This is 24th of the year And this is a team that they block five and a half shots a game So theyre deceptively long inside Marty Richtor telling us before the game that they not really long but very physical cheering He said that the Spartans want to try to slow this pace a little bit Had to kick it back out to Gregory Davis has all five points so far as the shot clock goes inside of 10 Gregory misses the jumper Wilson is high for the rebound up ahead to Brown Tough catch Well and you can see playing against North Carolina what normally happens is teams dont even try on the offensive glass They may send one guy in And you can see Upstate here its once the shot goes up its four guys sprinting back defensively North Carolina averages 43 rebounds per game Second best in the ACC in the early going Their only loss was when they got out rebounded by Michigan State Off the glass angle calculated Thats Davis Hes got all seven Mike Yeah And uh he like I said just hes giving them a little confidence early until everybody else catches up Wilson was trying to attempt the catch and got fouled Davis picks it up His first lyric Davis has all seven He averages eight and a half points per game for Upstate Caleb Wilson on the other hand leads North Carolina in scoring and rebounding Bogots in rhythm from the baseline Catch and shoot One pass on the underneath out of bounds Spartans missed their first six shots of the game Three of their last four from the floor for USC Upstate Atkins launching away for three Got a good look and they were daring him to shoot that shot He went underneath on the screen Carmelo Atkins has made 30 threepointers this season Team lead Brown inside Get the bounce applause Took it right to Martinez underneath Played through the contact Really strong finish Little runner bounces off to Wilson You know the thing about Wilson thats impressive He hasnt really forced anything this early in the game Contesting the shot and an awkward fall on the drive from Binger That was Wilson who will trot over to the scorers table And what did Hubert Davis talked about One thing that we really needed to improve on his offtheball defense his awareness on the other side of the floor He can be a real force at the rim blocking shots So Wilson will get a breather on that Huber Davis bench Stolen Such a great play to have a big head and the rim rattler of Jonathan Pow whos cheering got five Yeah See you get the turnover on the underneath out of bounds Everybodys buried the good look ahead But I love having Vasar on the uh on the inbounder underneath He got the deflection So tough to see anybody Seven field goals and seven assists so far in the first half Almost field goals for North Carolina Launching the deep three and it is all net Isaiah Skinner ripping the ropes for the Spartans cheering And uh The threepoint shot is keeping them in the game here early Messar from close range there on the feet Well he looked like he lost the ball on the way up So didnt really have total control of it Spent two years in the Arizona program Played 66 games for the Wildcats before coming to Chapel Hill Bending a written end to a roadblock Gave it to Collier too strong off the glass Vessar has the rebound Ryan Evans weaving his way for the easy layup And you know he actually used Ker the other team guy as a screen and got to the first ever meeting between the programs A historic day here in Chapel Hill Spartans with the basketball goes inside and finds the open man Really nice pass and misses his defender Tricked Could have taken the three but a very unselfish play First points for Bender the leading scorer this season for the Spartans Angular rebound off the miss from Bessa and Smith has it cheering Into the corner This is Smith Thats a three Got another one contagious and a good look too A lot of composure on the front end of that possession and to tie this game tries to untie us and it spins off the rim as you could see I mean normally you saw the early rush and then the Smith holding things back Their natural tendency is to run but they cant do that today Smith who just made that three last time down the court has the basketball now averages just over four points per game Bendinger misses on a threepoint attempt for the win Dixie Stevenson right back to him 43 A really nice job blocking out Quickly at the other end out of the corner from Atkins Spartans keep it alive cheering Nixon is the best threepoint shooter for North Carolina this season 48 despite the miss on the last trip down the floor Smith trying to loop it in Martinez couldnt complete the play I dont know how many laps youre going to be able to pull off against this front line even with Wilson on the bench North Carolina was so strong against Georgetown Wilson and Desar with double doubles in that game Evans to the corner Dixon cheering was down on the sideline right in front of that Spartan bench Coach Richtor said You know if the guys just listen to what I tell them Mike we might have a chance today Its kind of like your parents you know when youre a when youre a teenager they dont know a thing but then you get older and they get a little smarter Remember they had that win the beginning part of the season at Fresno State They won 6766 Did lose at Nebraska beat Coastal Carolina in overtime on December 3rd Its been an eventful season for the Spartans so far And theyre ripping it again Theyve got the lead on the three and those court passes are getting good looks from behind the ark Two threes made for Smith bend cheering in the rim for North Carolina Yeah thats what they needed to get back with him Get him scoring inside But I really credit Lick Davis keeping this team giving him some confidence early now everybody else feeding off of that for upstate International combination for North Carolina Montenegro Vesar from Estonia Bendinger spinning and shooting Well defended by Wilson You see on those shots I mean they just put a little bit more arc on it than they would like to Just out of their comfort zone Upstate by one Whistle underneath And they beat St Louis in the semis two to one Good things happening on the pitch for the ACC and Duke women actually had three of the four in the final four Duke was the other team there got beat by Stanford right now Mike it is a surprising 2120 lead for USC Upstate North Carolina started on a 70 run Its a distant memory The other thing thats impressive about the Spartans only two turnovers to this point well into the first half So theyre taking care of the ball getting good shots Theyre shooting for another three Its too strong Collier over the top against Vesar to keep it alive Hes the one guy that they can match up sizewise with Vesar This is Atkins Hes made a threepointer as is Davis Hes got a couple of them to his credit Gregory with the shot clock at five Davis misses cheering Jaden Young is into the lineup now for North Carolina Wheres number four Has the ball launches away and hits applause Well that that play starts with Caleb Wilson kicking it out reading the double team and then the swing around Jaden Young this season from threepoint distance had been one of seven seeing action in his eighth game this year Another rebound Hes got eight already in the first half Remember he had 15 against Georgetown to set his career high Hes got his fifth double double the season against the Hoya Wilson misses fouled by the smaller Gregory And hes going to see a lot especially against this team in the post Hes going to be oversized against everybody He kicks it out Good swing of the basketball Good ball reversal But it you know its the Tarhill fans have come to expect almost a double double from and this young man at the line every single game Freshman from Atlanta Georgia 77 from the stripe applause Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands And thats a great number for him that percentage from the free throw line because chances are pretty high hes going to be taking a ton of free throws during the course of the season This will be his 72nd free throw this year Mike hes made 56 of them applause 70 run North Carolina and in front by four Wilson had 15 points 12 rebounds and the win Kentucky Its going to be an offensive foul applause Skinner picks it up for USC Upstate This is again good anticipation from the weak side Ziden High coming over establishing himself Derek Dixon brings it up He was one of the heroes of that Kentucky game Mike Scored five points in the last minute of the game Nine for the contest against the Wildats as Carolina won on the road Will get a foul called against the Spartans Skinner picks up his second You know if if theres a weakness in Wilsons game right now its his threepoint shooting But but thats okay You know at his size hes such a great driver of the basketball You know you got to give up something Id probably heir on the side of giving him space for a jump shot Does so many things well Just two of 11 so far this season on threepoint trials Leads the nation Mike among freshman in rebounding Almost 11 rebounds per game on average So he made his first two comes up empty this time for Caleb Wilson Got to remember too a lot of firsts for a freshman including finals week So its you know its the first time hes ever had to go through that here Recently concluded for North Carolina a week between games between Georgetown victory and this afternoons contest against the Spartans Shot clock at three Just one of their last eight for USC Upstate poked away out of bounds JB Young got a piece of it Theres only 13 on the clock and 516 on the game clock Bendinger quick release Well thats the other thing that Wilson gives you You know you can rebound plus carry the ball up in transition off the dribble takes some pressure off the guards Dixon dropped it off Out of bounds North Carolina basketball trying to find Zayen High underneath Wilson drew the double Bogaving in the three Hes got five and theyre going to make the Spartans make a decision now Thats the second double team theyve kicked cheering out for a made three So you know Wilson again unselfishly reading the double team and hitting the open gap Its now a 100 run for North Carolina Luca Bogots Nobody takes more or makes more threepointers for North Carolina this season Wilson comes flying in for the rebound Working on a 100 run hustling it up the court And you can see any any shot close to the basket Spartans is a real rush really conscious of the shot blocking high Bendinger runs it down He is their leading scoreer for the season Hes only got two points so far Mike And USC Upstate one of its last 10 in field goal attempts Lot of dribbling from Smith Gregory tried to shake his defender Ball was deflected Dixon Young saves it Directs a little traffic and loops it into Wilson Everybody touches that basketball cheering Wilson the rim Just really advanced footwork in the post for a freshman cheering Six points in his second dunk OF THE GAME applause WILSON THE steel box all alone for the layup and a timeout you season of giving on display here at Chapel Hill Well just so we can try to our game right Yeah And to that end North Carolina 11 assists on 13 made field goals who are really sharing the basketball Bendinger little floater onehanded And they need points Mike since the 836 mark Well and thats a a confidence booster you know coming out of the timeout to get your leading scorer going Dixon inside Vessa got a foul going up for the jam And hell go to the free throw line But you know Marty Richtor told us something similar happened at Nebraska They that um upstate really in that game late into the first half then Nebraska went on a big run to get back into it build up a lead and then second half build on that Almost the same thing happening here in this game 65 from the stripe for Henry Vessar this season Coming up on the Subaru halftime report CW home for the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl and the legend himself gives us a preview Youre going to want to see that Plus well take a look at the ACCs remarkable freshman class all coming up on the Subaru halftime report Got one of those freshman in our game today applause Its good to see in this uh climate that we live in of so much focus on portal that there is a very strong freshman class around the country this year

are here at Roy Williams Court Shot clock down to five Bendinger trying to go against Stevenson Foul called against North Carolina before the shot went up But the the issue with Benner is that he has seen much taller players defending him Hes really struggled to get a good look at the basket He is two of seven so far from the floor Hes got the basketball now Vessard trying to defend Wilson helps into the corner Bounces around and fending able to get back to it after the miss from Atkins coach calling him You know they want to use as much of that 20 second rewind as they can Straight away Bendinger got fouled on the three as Wilson came out to challenge Maybe the spark that he needs going into the second half but again freshman mistake You just want to challenge this shot Thats a big guy bearing down on you too That was great concentration by him This will be the first free throw attempt of the game for USC Upstate cheering Theyre coming off two of two of their wins two of the last three wins Theyve been 36 times each at the free throw line Last Saturday at home they beat Western Carolina out of the Southern Conference 7867 They attempted 30 free throws in that game and made 24 Just one attempt so far up top Caleb Wilson well cheering above the rim to slam it home on the oop applause Well Huber Davis told us yesterday theyve been attached to the hip since theyve been here and uh thats just big throwing to bigger right there on the lob How far above the rim was Caleb Wilson Powell pass was a little bit behind him Goes out of bounds and thatll be off of the Spartans Caleb Wilson at least three dunks so far in the first half Told you hes the nations leader in that category And a lot of support Yeah that statement so far in the first half I mean just eight points six rebounds two assists I mean and hes and hes not even kicked it into second gear Over the top little jump hook Well in that time with the isolation no you know double team couldnt come down He was there on his own double figure scoring in every game for Vesar who was closing in on another double double in the first half Bendinger bumped in the paint Stevenson trying to recover defensively Nice roll for Bendinger And thats thats a good good sign for this team Something they can build on coming out North Carolina going to take that time out So Vessar is just two rebounds away from a double double in the first half with only 293 seconds remaining Eight points for Wilson 10 for Vesar Olga has seven and has the basketball now About a 5second difference game and shot Shot clock to seven

Williams as he watches Wilson try to drive to the rim All of Wilsons made field goals Mike in the first half were dunks Davis picks up the foul for USC Upstate Well the thing there is you saw how far away he was from the rim when he went into his shot And thats thats the thing people are going to have to get used to So hes missed his last three free throw attempts after making his first two North Carolina as a team 71 ninth in the ACC So Caleb Wilson now with nine points averages 193 You know we talked about the rebounding and you know its really been a team rebounding effort for Upstate Theyre only down two in that category applause Four of eight on threepointers in the first half for North Carolina Six of 15 for USC cheering Upstate Wilson applause denies entry And thats what I talk about again that helpside defense division In high school you can lock into your own guy but he can do he can average three blocks a game and he gets used to seeing whats going on on the weak side Second block of the game for Wilson Shot clock is at five But Gregory trying to get around Evans off the glass but Gregory really showed a lot of poor that time Didnt rush things through the end of the shot clock His first points of the afternoon Hes a second leading scorer for the Spartans this season Bogavots hesitation tried to drop it off the vessel off of his fingertips and out of bounds

a guy like Trimbo goes down Its not going to be one guy whos going to pick up all that scoring Stevenson put the shoulder down gave it off Messar did not get the roll and theyve chosen to play him oneonone They have not double teamed him at all this afternoon You know Caleb Wilson is the guy whos been drawing the double teams Gregory over Messar for three Little step back Nice challenge on the shot You know you dont want to foul in that situation just got beat by better offense Seven points now for Gregory all in the second half Tied for the game high with 15 in the win against Western Carolina a week ago And the Spartans have the ball back Spartans had the lead for short time in the first half North Carolina came storming back Gregory again This time hes off the mark Adrien to

Bendinger nowhere to go Defended Skinner misses Goats up ahead Wilson the catch Wilson Miss going up on the jam Foul called Isaiah Skinner got a piece of Wilson His third Yeah they see Wilson Hes going to get a lot of company when he gets the ball especially inside And at his size he can see over most double teams hes going to get Ogavots now is three of four from long range You know what I mean If if youre upstate its not a bad thing especially the way he has shot free throws to this point in this game that you take a chance instead of letting him get it done Fire the fan base up You
