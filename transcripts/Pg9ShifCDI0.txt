will come out in their navy blue with white lettering and teal trim and we have the college basketball season underway Randolph cant wait its been a long time coming were sitting here watching the preseason number one team in the country these heels came back to run it back and their quest for a national title is underway Donovan Newby with the basketball to begin at the point for the Seahawks Seahawks hook I like to do a lot of dribble Drive kicking the three Applause I want to get pink took almost breaks down theyre going to run the ball as fast this is shy Dean Phillips preseason second Team all accs got himself in a tough spot shot clock down to five and he is fouled by Caleb love veteran guy using this experience getting in the paint playing off two feet shot fake down love off his feet just an experienced guard good player showing his level of experience in smarts Here Yeah you mentioned what head coach Takeo siddle told us this morning to shoot around they got to get paint touches hes most concerned with rebounding against this big front line and big team across the board from Carolina well the good thing is every team that Carolina plays is concerned about that when youre going against them and now with Pete Nance by his side I think those two guys will be informal on the glass Phillips a senior from Winterville North Carolina wearing number 20 tonight instead of his customary number two and hes got the Seahawks on the board first now this familiar Carolina lineup at least four of them youre familiar with and if youre a Big Ten basketball fan or a college basketball fan youre familiar with Pete Nance younger brother of Larry Nance in the NBA of course their father Larry Senior former NBA Slam Dunk champion he is an interesting piece itll be interesting to see how coach Davis and his staff integrates and uses Pete Nance on both ends of the floor Applause well statistically hard Hayes with a strong drive to the bucket the North Dakota State transfer has the first field goal of the Year there would not be afraid this team is going to pick up 94 feet theyre going to attack the rim Applause oh Sam there Applause extended the arm a little bit from Fordham theres Huber Davis the 52 year old second year head coach at his alma mater great player here for the Tar Heels back in the late 80s and early 90s long NBA career as well Seahawks want to keep the bottom perimeter a lot of dribble handoff and ball screens when things break down theyre gonna go right to a ball screen tough shot Phillips Davis this is the Carolinas most dangerous in transition they get from one minute to the floor to the other as quickly as anyone in the country well it was interesting to see even freshman year to sophomore year how RJ Davis and Caleb love handled the backcourt the progress that they made a year ago just opened everything up for this team well I thought RJ Davis Ascension as an elite point guard last year was at the head of the reason Carolina made that run and their improvement from their freshman to sophomore year and thats usually when you make that jump you know most Rush can come in you dont get a full summer but that second year after your freshman year you get the entire Summer with the team and most guys make a massive jump when they do that RJ Davis playing tonight after missing the exhibition with the sprained right hand two free throws good by Pete Nance the Tar Heels on the board Applause its always tough when you play these games early because youre accustomed to bigger teams and the planet gets these smaller lineups were on it for other guys play on a perimeter Amari Kelly The Duquesne transfer Banks it in 62 Wilmington we talked about it theyre going to be unafraid theyre going to pick them up 94 feet Carolina has multiple ball handles so it shouldnt be a problem for them I expect them to try to get Bangkok Texas in the post now this is the first time in UNCW program history playing a number one team in the country they moved up to the division one ranks in 1976 they have only once before defeated A ranked opponent but off to a good start here tonight well we know theres no quit in that group there theyre going to come out and theyre going to compete theyre going to do what they do theyre not going to change it no matter theyre playing a number one ranked team in the country more than 100s ranking youre just going to commit to play basketball the way there coach coach Kelly his first inspect the motto they got to touch the ball quite a bit tonight until Carolina settles down into their offense baycotts turn around well short knocked out of bounds back to the Seahawks great defense there you know Victory no if youre a Carolina fan you want him attacking a rim you know good size 68 250 hes a grown man a graduate transfer from Marist who began his college career with a couple of years at Memphis whos the only guy one there roster to have the physical size to help give some resistance to Armando Baker hes at the monster screen on leaky back black to get wide open for the bucket that seems to be the game plan early theyre going to attack Armando and put them in ball screens trying to get him out of the paint four of the five UNCW starters have scored eight to two early Caleb switches home the three its a great sign of your Carolina fan hes just so explosive of the score I think he is as gifted a score as there is in this league and if hes taking him making shots Carolinas tough to beat well the offseason work hes done with famed NBA trainer Drew Hanlon has provided dividends thats just part of what he has worked on to grow his game traveling violation great defense there Bob Mando staying in front of the ball forced to travel there theyre going to pick on him early he got to go at him theyre trying to get fouls on it we cant let a big guy like that just play on one into the floor as expected full court pressure by UNCW this is the way they play theyre going to do it for 40 minutes pick you up turn you theres milk time off the clock Davis off to curl foul down the shot and hell shoot two hey good job rjd was just coming off getting to a spot towards pull up jump shot First Media timeout from the dean Dome on opening night the number one team in the country getting a stiff test early by unz they had a tremendous summer they came back both of those guys improved and again they let the way toward that team get into the to the championship game a year ago and I expect that to continue to shoot and they both keep working on their games coach Davis says that RJ Davis is so much better of a Defender this year he has focused in on washing lots of Jose Alvarado Tate the former Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket and ACC Player of the Year ACC first teamer now with the New Orleans Pelicans and Caleb love just keeps working on harnessing some of his great ability not going 100 miles an hour at all times changing speeds and just becoming a better player all the way around if he slows down his ability to make shots and just take good shots he can become your lead I think hes a gift and scorer that comes naturally I honestly believe that RJ Davis is their best player I think hes that talented that good on both ends of the floor I think hes the ring leader of the squad foul on vacant do you see a difference between Davis and love when one has the ball and the other does not is one better with the ball or off the ball or does it not matter just go with whoevers got the hot hand and whoever has the ball at that moment I think the work that love has put in to do that this summer I think he can do that well I think now hes earned the right to develop into a player that can initiate offense and make decisions but last year RJ Davis took a step and I thought that he was the more of the point guard I think this year its interchangeable as theyre going to need tonight against the team like the Seahawks at a press in full court so now they get multiple handlers out there on the floor like here now Jamari Thomas Off the Bench for the Seahawks misses a pair of free throws still 87 early at the dean Dome on opening night now the one thing this pressure does look how far Armandos catching the ball off the post and lets see what hes doing on the perimeter no easy catches nice find in the corner black left is short Applause theyre going to give that shot to Leaky black draw a lot of attention in the Armando baycott clog up the paint hes gonna have to knock down a few to get them to come out there Applause five minutes in white crosses over bacon pump fake and he travels this is the thing theyre playing against these early games that you have to switch everything so your bigs have to guard him a perimeter Armando baycoes doing a great job right now moving his feet over the course of his now fouryear career here in Chapel Hill how has Armando at both ends of the floor become more comfortable away from the basket I think the credit to coach Davis you know with coach Williams as great as he was you playing with you back to the basket coach Davis assistant hes playing more open getting free runs to the rim like that because hes playing on the perimeter and thats giving him a free Lane to go in and clean up the offensive blast hes averaging nearly five a game I believe thats called a wedgie and what that is is another rebound for Armando Bakery somebody gets the ball down for him he can shoot the free throw there we go to be the first of many followon Thomas sending bacon the senior from Richmond Virginia to the line shooting two coming up next the nothing but net crew will break down all the ACC games highlights analysis and sound from players and coaches right here on accn and the ESPN app theres the preseason ACC Player of the Year first team AllAmerican takeout gets a pair theyre one out of two from the line hes AllAmerican preseason along with Oscar shibwe Drew Timmy Trace Jackson Davis and Marcus Sasser and you wouldnt say hes the prohibitive favorite to win national player of the year but hes certainly in the mix and if the Tar Heels have the same type of success going deep into the NCAA tournament having the chance to win an ACC title you got to figure hes going to get his share of votes I think hell be right there theres a familiarity with the team theres a theres a confidence with his team now having gone on a run they win a year ago so I expect him to be right there and have the player of the year National Player of the Year and as a college basketball fan this really does feel like a throwback the unity of this group coming back to run it back shot clock down to five great defense leaky black with the denial being the preseason all defensive player ACC Defensive Player of the Year candidate he is great defense showing what he brings to the table with his team Applause foreign Applause Styles into the game stays down in the Fate six nine weeks man it was difficult to get that shot off The Leaky says the two best things he has to defend with are his seven foot three inch wingspan and his IQ and like in that case right there Randolph he understood with the shot clock down the guys gonna have to shoot it you can time that defensive block easier hes embraced that role and with his length and his position flexibility he just gives you so much on that end of the floor its like right now he slides to the fourth spot new be no skying for the rebound is Styles Tar Heels with the ball for the first time with the lead something we had seen a lot of last year if youre a tar heel fan you hadnt seen Don trash Styles and DeMarco done early as you see them so far this year Armando again playing space big fella showing he was moves on the perimeter I think hes just going to get so much better hes more comfortable in doing that he wasnt actually do that in the past facing you up spin move people saw a customer playing with his back to the basket he adds that to his game consistently hell be unstoppable a 100 run for Carolina Harvey on the pullup cant quiet the crowd Malik Hardin Hayes on the putback though puts everybody back in their seats theres no quit in this team theyre going to continue to come after Carolina Applause great job contester shot Music just didnt go to rebound Applause inside the bake out theres another spin didnt get the slam good defense to Come Away with the rebound by Victor Eno Applause Im gonna put him on during the ball screen and things break down he cuts Phillips off who brings the ball back out front with 10 on the shot clock now theyre forced to switch Newby with a clean look hes got that shot in his Arsenal great shoot hes hes a 39 threepoint shooter you dont want to give him that I mean thats pretty automatic it was open Styles made a huge mistake in helping him a strong side corner you never want to give that up minutes in UNCW back on top Davis calls for the three and puts the heels back in front hes just developed his threepoint shot so consistent so much better than he was in the freshman year thats the part of his game that he made drastic improvement on a year ago and he continued so far this year now hes got a little flavor of his father Robert Davis his dad was a division two Legend at Mercy College Dobbs Ferry New York still the schools alltime leading scorer 2100 points but Dad has that bragging right on newbie again this time front Rings it hes the guy who taught his you got to get to him you dont want to get him give him open looks into Bangkok and a foul on the entry pass recruiting him I dont know if youre ever going to be able to play here I dont want to do this Huberts reply as a teenager youll never know unless you give me a chance and all Huber did was score 1600 points in Carolina blue and is 435 percent career threepoint shooting Remains the standard here at UNC and oh by the way he led his alma mater to the brink of a national title last spring he has done it all for a man who has bled Carolina blew his entire life well I think its so under the job that he did a year ago I mean coming and replacing the legend and coach Williams and coming in and doing as good a job as you can imagine and just to humbly unbelievable guy great shooter even better person and his demeanor threw out everything Randolph is always topnotch well I think its the reason everything turned around for the team a year ago you know he set up the storm took all the pressure off these guys and they responded and they play well when they play hard for him Huberts second year as head coach at his alma mater of course he served the long apprenticeships under Roy Williams he did but just a great job well think about the coaches he worked for and played for right and hes taken it all with his personality and created something new that he can sustain here in Chapel Hill and call his own he erased any doubt if he was the right guy for the job lets be honest last year they started off a little suspect yeah there was some doubt RJ Davis in and out but his Poise and the way he handled himself everyone knew immediately things would turn around and everyone that question is Applause counted 15 just past the midpoint of the first half here on opening night with the number one team in the country one thing you didnt see a year ago as a freshman plan for Carolina as you see its Tyler Tyler Nick was playing right now but you also you didnt see Armando Baker on the floor and thats what Pete Nash brings to this team the ability to have Armando rest on the bench and play The Five Spot they couldnt get away with that a year ago and you mentioned Tyler Nichol hes number 24 another ESPN 100 recruit threepoint Try by DeMarco Dunn Off the Mark correct to him because coach Davis doesnt play anybody unless you earn it saying DeMarco done out there he didnt play his freshman year as talented as he was because he didnt earn this question to you but hes out there playing now coach Davis said hes been stacking good practices and so hes going to play credit to him for responding brazarian white tough shot did he catch the iron Nance with another rebound because Dave was one of these guys to push tempo right now now whats bothering Carolina in a half court is theyre icing and theyre down in all the ball screens RJ Davis went down hard and is in pain as he gets back up and now goes back down to his knees Applause I think he caught a knee on a spin move there but that down in the ball screens giving him some trouble right now people dont know what I mean theyre pinning Carolina on the side theyre not letting them use the ball screen and they cant reverse the ball and its forced on RJ Davis to reject yeah I think he collided knees right there but he started his spin move and landed on his hip remember he missed the exhibition game with a sprained right hand as well and I used to do the same thing too when I turned the ball low I followed after my coach wouldnt yell at me thats what you do too thats called a vet move right now man coach so hes more worried about the injury this pressure is modern Carolina right now theyre getting up into these ball handlers and if theyre pinning them to the side Carolina had handled his pressure thats a big concern of Huber fourth turnover and the turnover by love was compounded by him committing the foul on shakeem Phillips oh no I guess theyre saying it was on Phillips Music so I stand corrected wow so Caleb loved to the freethrow line to shoot a 11 of the game goes Tyler nickel you remember the first time you took the floor at Wake Forest as a freshman could you catch your breath wow youre gonna bring back some memories there I uh I just remember thinking that the first time I touched it I was going to shoot it thats the only thing ever and that never changed it never changed I just kept that philosophy every time I win the game helps with the Jitters just get it over with just shoot it and get it over yep got a 50 50 chance of making it and then what 2200 points later he left Winston Salem went out of the NBA hey turns out well they worked for me sure did right now you sent another freshman on the floor playing Seth Trimble was a really good foam ball Defender yeah I never want to lose sight of the emotions for these freshmen playing their first games on the big stage nice job to get opened by Phillips its a really good midrange shooting gets to his spots plays off two feet Armandos gonna have to step up he and Nance gonna have to step up on that on that uh down ball screen action Trimble handles the point and the pressure into baycott Advanced crashes the glass rebound Eric vanderheiden the former Ole Miss rebel oh say a little bit of frustration out of Carolina will only have four offensive end Al ball possession arrow will give it to Carolina got ourselves a good Bowl Music guitar Music usual Carolinas got some highly touted freshmen we begin with Seth Trimble who you see there hes the younger brother of former Tar Heel JP tocato hes getting his first opportunity to play tonight Tyler Nichol weve also seen we will not see Jalen Washington though as he continues to take it slow on his rehab from his second ACL surgery hes back to practicing five on five full court look good today youve seen him in practice a couple of times Randolph but they are just not going to rush him back into the pool but at some point hes going to impact this Tar Heels team this year he definitely will hes another 610 athletic big but his ability to stretch the floor shoots him really well I I dont think he he definitely wont be a fouryear guy I think he once he gets healthy I think with his skill set aside I think hell be off to the NBA pretty pretty soon thanks for shoot leaky black pole well short and he commits the foul start the shot guitar heels want right there contested midrange jump shot from leaky black doubles down and commits the foul so now the heels as a team only four of 15 theyve missed their last six shots from the floor again the way UNC Wilmington has defending and keeping them out of the ball screens and really pushing them out and being real physical with Carolina right now Applause this is the end of the Carolina house depending on right now they want to keep control of this game Applause of the boss man theyre going to put Armando and ball screens when things break down Eno gives it back to Phillips with under five to shoot Phillips goes to the floor and its a shot clock violation right IQ Randolph you said uncs got to pick it up at this end and they do coach Davis has challenged those guys they need to rely on their defense we know theyre going to score points eventually theyre going to get some theyre going to get going to hit shots they have to defend hang their head on defense if they want to get back to anywhere remotely close to the level of play they played a year ago fifth turnover forced by Carolina tonight there you see the drought on the offensive end though for the heels five and a half minutes and Counting the pressures bothering the one thing that you know Wilmington also does is they changed their pressure that time they were in a one two two sometimes theyre in Maine double team comes to Baker knocks it away momentarily five to shoot he finds leak underneath and leaky I should say puts it in leaky black with his first two its a really good underrated offensive rebounder so he was running in thinking Armando baycott was going to take the shot found himself with a dump off pass again Armandos a really good passer Applause wet spot on the floor there fortunate for leaky black he didnt hurt himself I think he slipped when he landed foreign Wednesday well have the mens soccer championship semifinals third seed in Virginia takes on second seed at Syracuse at five eastern then eight seeded Clemson which upset Duke in the quarter squares off against fourth seed in Wake Forest at seven Eastern both matches right here on accn and the ESPN app the winners will meet in the championship match Sunday noon Eastern on ESPNU Applause again adding impression Applause pass deflected out of bounds by Malik Harden Hayes Carolina will keep and what does pressure do they change the pressure so it what it does is it forces you to think about how you want to attack it they attack you so many ways defensively and right now Carolinas unsure about how to attack maybe its back into the game at the point starting unit on the floor for Carolina Nance on the pullup this is field goal made yeah this is where Brady manic was so good for those guys a year ago and I think this is where Pete Nash is going to step up to Brady had the ability to step up and take and make shots like that and theyre going to need this experience right now as theyre unsettled in offense whats really interesting how similar their stats were a year ago Nance at Northwestern and manic here but coach Davis downplayed it he said their greatest similarity is how seamless they both fit in as newcomers oh when the talent around them allows you just to fit in and theres no pressure on either one of those guys coming in and I think thats what helped them leaky black with another rebound there are the stats from a year ago between Nance and menick you cant help but compare and contrast the two of them I think the biggest difference of the two is just manic was such a shot more threepoint shots another steal by Phil Tar Heels fourth turnover turns into two more Wilmington points that was coaches coach Daviss biggest concern with this group just turning the basketball over he wants to make UNC Wilmington play in the half court right now theyre getting stops and turnovers and getting out in transition thats a blocking foul on the North Dakota State transfer from Moorhead Minnesota Malik Harden Hayes Music Phil said it was really impressed with him said hes a lot better offensively than he thought when he when he got him on campus and watching his game his ability to score he thinks hell be a major player in an elite athlete for those guys as well yeah it says hes a big time competitor and Likens him the former Seahawk Jalen Sims but he takes a seat after having picked up his second foul and RJ Davis to the freethrow line Applause thats a concern coach siddlehead is just theyre a deeper team but the piles eventually foul up with Carolina trying to pound it inside hes got depth issue you know unlike years in the past but this is more of a team the more versatility the way he wants to play theyre going to be a force in the CAA this year now coach siddle grew up in Eden North Carolina we tried to get him to say who he rooted for as a kid he wouldnt tell us but Im guessing he had some Carolina blue in his closet at some point along the way well he wouldnt tell us that and I dont blame him hes not going to admit being a state guy I dont expect anything to acknowledge that he he said he wont confirm nor deny he played in this building a couple of times as a freshman and as a sophomore at GardnerWebb they lost both those games but he did win in this building as an assistant coach Kevin Keats with North Carolina State and that is the story that he has shared pregame with his Seahawks to try and again get across the point that you can go into the dean Dome and get a win you always want to put that you know in front of your players let them know that thats possible but he also has a player and shakeem Phillips that has played against Carolina Caleb love left it on the bottom of the rim got his Bat puts it up Carolina with its biggest lead of the night hes just so explosive he scores in so many ways didnt put the finish at The Rim got the loose ball shot to pull up jump shot her last defense is picking up Brazilian white on the switch shoots over fake hot a little strong and Nan strands the defensive rebound love from deep heat checked those are the shots coach Davis wants him to change thats the tough difficult shot there Tar Heels starting to find their Rhythm have opened up the sixpoint lead welcome back to the Deanie Smith Center Carolina getting to the freethrow line and thats been a big part of how they have been able to open up the sixpoint lead neither team is shooting the great right now I think both teams are defending well I think Seahawks defense theyre throwing so many different things at Carolina four foot pressure half court pressure 10 of them on the side on ball screens theyre switching a lot and theyre throwing a lot at Carolina but this is the way they play it has taken Carolina a little time to figure out how they want to attack I think the most surprising thing right now is that were tied rebounding the basketball that was something that coach Sitta was really concerned about and they actually had more offensive rebounds than Carolina thats the biggest surprise makes the first theres the reigning CAA Coach of the Year okay they went on to win the CBI the first time in this programs division one history they won a postseason tournament hes as a heck of the future ahead of him and I see him being a high major coach in the near future yeah hes just 36 years old still very close with Kevin Keats he was a key to assistant at UNCW then again at NC State theyre in contact every day Applause I think the notice is another offensive rebound right there again black just got his hand in there knocked it away I thought he might have stepped out of bounds instead of tax and gets his shot blocked paycock comes up with it another rebound the Moses Malone there two rebounds two points on the same possession Patton is offensive rebound of stats there well you dont get 13 rebounds a game no without having to move finance and style and smarts in there theyre going to continue to attack him on this end of the floor too put them in a lot of ball screens Camari McGriff has come into the game for UNCW number 21 hes a redshirt freshman from Tallahassee five to shoot repeatedly weve seen Phillips with a shot clock down having to put up tough shots he makes that one he wants to get to that right hand but he is really good midrange shooter thats the second midrange jump shot today senior out of Winterville North Carolina now with eight points to lead the Seahawks I know got tangled up there you dont want to see him looking to get the ball inside to Armando in the post Applause McGriff now trying to keep the big man from getting into the basket and foul on the double team and it goes against shaking Phillips Saturday morning at 11 AM Eastern the ACC huddle crew will be in Syracuse New York to get you set for another full day of football well also have halftime shows and pre and post game shows throughout the day at 6 30 get a complete wrapup of the afternoons games and then theyll get you set for the prime time matchup between Florida State and Syracuse on accn at eight oclock Eastern its all right here on acc Network and the ESPN app show you if it cheering for your orange man boy theyve lost three in a row they had they spotted out the game really really strong see if their quarterback Garrett Schaefer can come back from injury and yes I will be watching your your Geeks arent so bad either no my dicks are really good were struggling right now as well weve uh Got The Yips right now in turning the basketball over but well respond against Tar Heels this weekend back into the game number zero Seth Trimble 63 192 pounds mentioned hes from Menomonee Falls Wisconsin the younger brother of JP tokito and hes got some of the same athletic jeans JP has hes really athletic and really strong a great body for a freshman and he has an expert gear he can really move and this is the lineup that we talked about as well theyre playing him with RJ Davis gives them more ball handling abilities slide RJ off to two RJ has nine points is playing well right now so five in the shot clock vanderheiden nearly loses it he traveled turnover forced by the Tar Heels now you can see how DeMarco done and some trouble got over got a report this year ability to get out fight over the screen Philly to switch its a really good athletic group Carolina has on the floor right now freshmans coming out Applause Davis done Nance baycott and loved the five on the floor for Carolina Davis goes end to end for two she has 11 he really has it going offensively rejected the ball scream Quinton Lane shot a floater down by coach settle well take it with him back in 30 W has played a good first 19 minutes here at the Deep Dome against the number one team in the country but Tar Heels starting to pull away a little bit coach wanted to make sure on this final possession of the half they get a good shot yeah I think he wants to slow things down a little bit Carolina stepped up the defense his halftime is coming at a good time for those guys getting slow the truth down set them down a little bit try to get him down one good shot for the half judging by the group is out there now I think itll be another ball screen I think that their offensive game plan is to put a Mondo baycott and ball screens but theyre going to take him out to now small Carolina lineup again with Dunn and Trimble with the starting backcourt Nance the only big out there final 23 seconds of the first half Nance gives them the ability that this late ball screen when he runs up I think theyll switch it with him hes showing the ability to guard guards hes done it in practice Applause Phillips fouled by Trimble a freshman mistake there letting Trump let Phillips get to his right hand foreign Music Applause Phillips looked like Vance got a piece he did the ability to switch my name stepping out great job defensively Carolina in the last five minutes stepped it up the defensive end of the floor pushed the lead up to 11 Music halftime here on opening night at the dean Dome with Carolina up by 11 transition theyre going to struggle against the half court second sir Carolinas too big too athletic to play in a half court their offensive way of attacking them is just putting them in ball Springs Carolinas making an adjustment so theyve got to force turnovers get some easy baskets in transition shakeem Phillips leads UNCW with eight points and weve got the shot clock not working for the first four seconds of this half Phillips leads the Seahawks with eight hes number 20 tonight in navy blue well RJ Davis leads all scorers with 11 for the Tar Heels this is Caleb love with the defensive assignment on Phillips you could have left the shot clock Corner three good look just off the mark by Newbie theres an offensive rebound as UNCW just keeps fighting another offensive remap Applause foreign move by Harden Hayes again into the corner this is the way they want to play Drive attack the pain off the dribble Donovan Newby the UW Milwaukee transfer with Five Points thats not his strong suit he loses usually wants to get in there and find guys and spot over and take threes but again the way they want to play dribble drive pink Touches for open threes and finishing up the rim love back to Davis inside to bacon single coverage he dribbled it off his foot another turn over there unforced air great job by Nance defended on the perimeter well trezarian white at 66 he is not going to be defended this year that often by somebody as tall as dance and moves as well as he does its a great job by nasty really impressive how hes moving his feet leaky black blocked the shot but he landed awkwardly stays at the other end of the floor holding his right foot or ankle as the bucket is scored at the other end lets hope its minor and he gets back out there he says sales coach he doesnt want to come out entire shoe up and stay on the court great job defensively there going up blocking the shot comes down when Phillips foot rolls his ankle the Ubers not going to take any chance hes going to take him out anyway the duck take a look at him and so the fifth year senior heads down to the end of the bench foreign Carolina comes off the bench with DeMarco Dunn sophomore from Tucson Arizona played his high school ball here in the state of Carolina after his family moved across the country tough shot by Harvey and a foul on the rebound gonna go against Amari Kelly the 69 senior from Norcross Georgia does a really good job of crashing the glass there but unfortunately he went over a long to wake up back got the foul but theyre getting into paint theyre starting to get the looks that they want they want to play by getting dribble drives and pain touches theyve kind of went away from the ball screens they were running the first half in this half theyre spreading you out driving in the paint fouls going to be an issue for UNCW as Kelly is the first to pick up his third he goes to the bench Eno comes back in but Hardin Hayes Phillips and Thomas all have two as well theyre going to force Seahawks deep into their bench thats part of what they do put so much pressure on you theyre going to draw a foul love from Deep well done got a piece of it but its UNCW with another rebound this is the way they want to play as well hard Hayes with a tough drive to the bucket baker said him flying both teams are struggling offensively right now so you want to get when youre struggling to score you need to get out and get yourself in transition get easy baskets like that thats how many score but he drew the foul I think its a byproduct of both teams playing Superior defense I think its a combination of both I think both teams are trying to play hard on the defensive end but its the first game being unfamiliar with each other some of these guys theyre playing Carolina a lot of Carolina players on this on the bench for this team and they grew up watching his team play someone that you can see by the Jitters with the files the line Malik Hardin Hayes grew up across the Red River from Fargo North Dakota in Moorhead Minnesota he makes a couple of free throws give him six points on the night for the Seahawks actually has the athleticism Applause Music anybody in the Carolina team he shouldnt be able to weld by anything at all every bit of six seven one ninety five Oh shot nice finish by love thats what you want to see some love last two shots with deep threes that time he put his head down and got to the ramp oh nice move what a move but then he just couldnt finish Phillips a little strong off the glass Eno gets it back midrange shot Phillips misses again Carolina wants to get a play and transition himself Davis no Applause this is the pace the both teams usually want to play like I said we wont need the shot clock Applause go gets it back to Harvey he puts it up and thats an airball Applause good dribble hand off there love just getting downhill getting to the rim using this size and athleticism finish kids in the paint hes gonna be tough to guard tonight shouldnt settle theres no shot blockers out there to bother him when youre not making your threes just getting the paint elevated finished well what a finish to his sophomore year made the allfinal four team last spring its tournament games average nearly 19 points per game and he really did it with second half flourishes scored 30 total against UCLA 28 in that memorable game that ended the career of Coach Kane taking out Duke 22 of those points against Duke came in the second half and then had the gamewinning three with 24 seconds to go he sent Coach K into retirement and then he decided to run it back and it was neat you know leaky black after that Championship lost to Kansas started a group text with these four starters who decided to come back and say we need to talk and he wasnt sure what kind of response he was going to get especially from Caleb but eventually over the course of the coming days and weeks they all decided you know what lets go back and get a national title if we can I think it helped that omondo was hurt so he couldnt work out for scout so he you know that was the reason he wanted to come back and if you think about that you knew you know youre going to be good and when you won a rebound away from doing something special like winning the national championship I I think you just feel the need to come back and do so I think this team is hungry they work really hard theyve added some pieces and they expect to be back in the mix of the final four competing for a championship think about what Mondo showed on that bad wheel last year what he was still able to provide in the final four there he is with a good contest rebound to Nance Ive really been impressed with you know ability find a nose for the ball with a chance for three great job pushing the ball by the hits nearly turned it over well the Defenders sworn Pete Nance he was able to keep the basketball get it back and find big number five hell have a chance for a threepoint play when we come back its 13 I mean like I told you before hes hes changed he has to take my mind at all I think hes their best complete player shoots to three gets in a paint sets things up for everyone else theres not a shot blocker out there so I expect him to continue to assert himself in the second half he was Mr basketball in the state of New York back in 2020 pretty good list he joined there you want to hear some of the names RJ Davis is along with how about Kenny Anderson Jamal Mashburn Stefan Marbury Elton brand Tobias Harris Kevin herder just to name a few wow pretty good list its a really good list really good list uncs defense making it tough on UNCW here in the second half they stay cold now over their last seven and only one of nine since the intermission these are the white has been struggling with his jump shot at this game I think the length is bothering its not accustomed to having a bigger defender on him like like Pete dance Music UNCW is the reigning champ in the Colonial Athletic Association having won 27 games a year ago but they are picked to finish fifth this year after losing a number of really good players for Coach sittl Towson is the team to beat according to the preseason pick number two they would surprise me if again if theyre right back up there as coach X I mean this team is deep theyre going to play hard theyre going to defend try to get a little bit more perimeter scoring baycat now with 12 points and six rebounds ball will stay at this end and with those six rebounds I mean bacotts name is up with the Immortals here at UNC he has passed Brad Doherty and Mitch cup check tonight now seventh all time in North Carolina rebounding history you think youll finish at the top of that list I mean his ability to to rebound I mean my goodness hes dominant on the glass and with the talent around him and theyre building to get to the rim and finish and hes getting that free run to the rim from you know from playing on the perimeter a lot more than he has ever in his career just allows him just to heat up the glass hes just been a force and when youre a really good player who stays at a place like Carolina for four years your names going to be along with a lot of great names theyve got 12 Nae Smith Hall of Famers from Carolina 11 different national players of the Year 18 different consensus first team allamericans and Armando bacon has a chance this year to join that list well heres Saturdays week 11 ACC Network college football lineup Fresh Off Their upset of Syracuse Pittsburgh squares off against quarterback Brendan Armstrong in Virginia noon Eastern and true freshman quarterback MJ Morris leads number 22 NC State against Boston College and the days capped off by our accn Primetime matchup 20th ranked Syracuse tries to turn things around against the Florida State team that has won backtoback games Florida State starting to play good football the ACC needs the Seminoles to get back to be in the Seminoles yes we do your Alma Maters done pretty well actually done very well for itself in recent years my alma Maters done better this year but the reality is you need Florida State you need Miami along with Clemson to be the standard bears and actually here in the Triangle I mean Carolina and state are having great years both nationally ranked right I think Virginia Tech needs to get back into the mix of what theyre accustomed to being and I I think we will eventually get to that point Florida state is taking that step Miami just seems to start off that way and it doesnt seem to be able to continue great defense about Seahawks there getting a 10 second count on Carolina again mixing up that pressure six Carolina turnover five and a half minutes into the second half shakeem Phillips hesitation deflected Away by bacock crisserian white to the bucket for two great job by him getting into the rim finishing in a strong strong move with his right hand he does a great job at the head of that press love turned down the open three tried to set up black and its a turnover for the heels number seven Applause white turns the corner top finish and he was fouled French I need to get him going hes been his second leading scorer this year you know so far exhibition and preseason games and struggled the first half great drive and finish against Valencia and one well as a freshman last year he started 23 games for UNCW averaged seven points four and a half rebounds he won a pair of Texas 5A state championships Timberview High School his teammate 2017 youll know this name Isaac likely ice was the star as a senior white was a sophomore together they won a state championship Applause hes doing hes playing really well right now hes picked it up the second half cut the lead to 10 done a really good job of pushing Armando away from the basket and catching the ball Kellys back in there guarding the Mondo baycott now hes had three fouls lets see if Carolina will go to Armando to see if they can pick up his fourth there he goes a lot of contact no call Bay cop quietly having himself another terrific night 14 points thats where hes improved in his game again just like he scored earlier facing you up putting it on the floor hes really difficult to guard in space with a head of steam paycock clears another rebound this is what Carolinas really dangerous in transition Music Seth Trimble oh Applause great extra pass but I cant be upset with you missed a shot like that its a good look good pass hell make more of those Kelly soars for the rebound and weve got a foul so where are they hurting Carolina glass is that when they set that ball screen Armandos coming over to help and theyre big just getting a free run down the lane between Omari Kelly and Victor Uno those guys have got their hands on a bunch of balls and so far between the two of them theyve got six offensive rebounds first foul on RJ Davis nonshooting foul as Tyler nickel the Freshman from Harrisburg Virginia has come back into the game Applause White had it poked away good to see leaky black back on the floor and weve got a whistle away from the ball as Davis went down hard its another foul by Hayden Hayes I mean hard Hayes thats the sport we saw the trip in the top left corner thats a difficult way to pick up your four foul to sit down I mean its I think its an accidental trip yep its away from the ball you would have liked for them to continue to play when I was beginning to say good to see leaky black back on the floor for the Tar Heels after he went out having rolled his ankle or his foot theres number one in white Rayshawn Malik black he says only his mom and his sister can call him Rayshawn nobody else gets away with it everybody else is leaky and here goes leaky along the Baseline no I like leaky a lot better anyway great name Music skipped has to find newbie really impressed with the way womens is attacking the glass just over eight minutes gone here in the second half Carolina trying to pull away but the number one team in the country in its opener still being pushed by UNCW for the last preseason number one to win it all back in 20082009 North Carolina led by Tyler Hansbrough that team had seven future NBA players could this team this Tar Heels rendition match what those guys did and run the table number one preseason and be the last team standing at the end of the year I think theyre the favorite right now I mean theyre not playing well at the moment but again you want to get out of here with a win UNC Womens is here to play so I wouldnt overreact to this this game so far but they have debt that they hadnt had in a long time Kelly was foul down the drive well the stakes are so high for this group of Tar Heels came back I mean anything short of getting to Houston will be viewed I think by them as well as a failure I dont think coach Davis would say that certainly the fans expect them I mean when you run it back like this you got to get to Houston if not win it all right well I think theyll do a good job of managing those expectations because last year the expectations were theyre always just Carolina theres always expectations you have Hubert coming in following coach Williams into that distraction you started out really really slow and deal with that and then you make the turn and make a run to the championship game this team is built to handle the adversity thats foul number five on Amari Kelly on the illegal screen so he is out as we take another look yeah hes got his leg out there tough night for him Mondos drawing quite a few fouls on him hes only played nine minutes its got just four of his five files and it seems just a matter of time before Kelly is joined by others Malik Hardin Hayes has four fouls nobody else wore the two so far for UNCW well Im talking to coach Davis during shoot around this afternoon he talked about that noise that youre talking about and the expectations that he said last year he tried to tell his players dont listen to the noise which was negative for the most part as they struggled throughout the regular season now he thinks its just as invasive that noise when everybodys pumping him up yes its a different message but the noise is still the same and they did a really good job of staying consistent against that a year ago that was a lot of negative comments against his team and they just walk through it thats going to get the foul thats the one part of his game Id like to see him make the adjustment and he gets it inside he draws so many people again do you like see him kick it out fourth foul on Baker Brothers and you see white took the brunt of bacots 235 pounds and is limping at Mid Court as Mondo goes out with that fourth foul now this is something you were really concerned about a year ago if youre a Carolina fan but now having Pete Nance there I think this is where he really helps you now youre able to set up Mondo down and not have to rush in back at the game I think this is youll see him step up in this role so again its one of the big story lines coming to the year for Carolina Nance essentially taking the spot on the roster of Brady Manic and thats one of the big differences between the two this year yeah and but he has the ability to play more inside Brady Matic spent most of his time on a perimeter and its not that Pete Nance cant shoot but he will punish the mismatches inside maybe rebound a little better and hes a better Defender so I think thats why they feel more cure this year and not having it really is something as we said in the first half how similar their offensive statistics work and Nance could really shoot it he made 45 percent of his threes last year for Northwestern look at the confidence coaches putting in his young guards hes got two freshman guards out there well the lead was 16 its down to 10 Davis with a mismatch got himself three for the jumper just couldnt finish Applause in a dangerous part of the game for Carolina with the young group young guys out there Applause Music and weve talked about his athletic jeans as Trimble got up to the rim to block that shot South Carolina essentially has four guards on the floor right now so someone has to help them rebound they are getting out rebounded I never thought Id say that again UNC Wilmington great job cant security use loose ball and 50 50 balls weve gone UNC Womens his way how about this for a discrepancy on the glass offensive rebounds UNCW 13 Carolina only six would have never thought that coming in that was the biggest concern we had the other thing thats shocking is Carolina does not have a fast break point for both teams that love to play in transition but this is what happens with the pressure the pressure puts you on your heel its a dangerous moment right now because you got two freshmen out there who havent experienced this lets see how they handle it we need to put the ball into RJ Daviss and Caleb loves ham right now to make a play This Is Love preseason second team AllAmerican trimbled under control puts it up good looking shot with the shot clock going down here at the midpoint of the second half youre okay with him doing that hes got got to the paint shot fate got his got his man in the air just missed the pullup all right thank you trying to create space want to attack the paint White block nickel playing some defense heres Trimble at the other end how about that for a transition basket I just jinxed him I just thought they didnt have one all game thats the first transition basket of the night for the Tar Heels and they needed it struggling offensively without my Mondo on the floor great defensive block by the freshman foreign class by RJ Davis is really athletic except Trimble is Music a little disappointed he didnt dump that though yeah I think there will be a few to come well that bucket snapped a drought of more than four minutes for Carolina Applause see the struggles offensively for UNCW missing 14 of their last 16 Dino back into the game sets the screen Corner three up and over the top of the backboard for Jamari Thomas its a really good defensive line up to Carolina out there now all five guys are pretty solid defensive players theyll be able to switch a lot if they need to Applause its the versatility of leaky in the backcourt being able to initiate offense with his team with his size throwing over the pressure great move Davis Davis 15 points for the Junior from White Plains New York lets put the ball in his hands let him make a play I think I got said all along I think hes the best player for the Tar Heels this year preseason all ACC first team couple of Tar Heels Bay caught in love RJ Davis on the second team along with Isaiah Wong turquavion Smith and Jeremy roach should be fun on opening night everybodys looking up everybodys looking forward to being an AllStar and having dreams of making it to March Madness and for these Tar Heels anything sure to reach in Houston will be a surprise to many Applause anybody on that first team all ACC roster surprise you anybody else you think should have been on there like I said Im a big RJ Davis fan and I dont know who you take off but I I think he when its all said and done by the end of the year I think RJ James will be there Im a big taquavian Smith fan I think he is as explosive of a score we have in this league so I I dont know who I take off I mean its all you know theyre all good players but of the guys that are not on that list I would have to say for me to be RJ Davis okay now I dont know who you take off right Isaiah Wongs got to be honest that wont have to be there Armando they got it and Wong hands down I think those two are there everyone else then you can probably depends on where you live Ive been on the Isaiah Wong bandwagon since he was a freshman he scored 16 tonight the Hurricanes opened up with a win over Lafayette that new back court with Nigel Pat could wind up being the best backcourt in the ACC Applause I could argue that well see how nice are Peck performs in the cut in conference play but I know these two guys out here has performed at all level so as of right now Im gonna take take love in Davis is my Best Buy Courtney ACC but a lot of good back horse NC States back quarter be equal to as well equal is good Trimble call for the foul on the drive by Newbie that is his second foul hes looking up on a scoreboard to see if he how he get the foul I thought he elevated straight up kind of a little bit on the arm there is athleticism speed just jumps out at you when you watch him play I think the fans of the building were watching the Jumbotron like you were I dont think they like to call but I wasnt sure if they were saying Lou things in Luke foreign Williams in the building with the other Champs from that 2017 team that have been recognized theres another look gets him right there on the yawn when he goes up I think its a football plus hes a freshman theyre not going to give you their call as the first one Is that real I think its Teddy Valentine thinking hes a freshman I cant give him that call I I would imagine so I would imagine so tough shot by Trimble he can get into the paint whenever he wants he would youd like him to play off two feet there was help there he should have kicked it on the weak side hell hell make that adjustment as he watched him hell make some mistakes on the offensive end but you wont question his effort on this and gets in the stands regards the ball big and physical enough to switch Applause five to shoot thats where Nance is so good just the ability to switch late and guard the ball yeah instead of Phillips having a rhythm 18foot shot it was a forced buzzer beater from the corner and it turns into two points at the other end for love give him a dozen on the night again it hasnt made a lot of Threes but hes attacking the rim Applause Carolina has the lineup out there right now that can just switch five theyre gonna switch everything Applause great shot fake by white then he puts up an air ball vanderheiden pulls it back out a rare mate threepoint bucket tonight this one by shy King Phillips hes got 11 hes been the one God has got it going offensively tonight black had it knocked away Nance goes down lets see if hes okay looks like hes all right looks like both guys are all right new be playing hard time out here at the dean Dome its an 11 Point Carolina Lee on opening night in the ACC 5140 Carolina with the lead second half UNCW has not been able to make a shot only four of 23 what percentage was that you said Randolph 17 from the field right now man but theyve done a really good job of getting to the free throw line theyve played Carolina evening in the second half because they scored 10 points for the free throw line but theyre struggling from the field well they played them even here in the second half it was an 11point game at the intermission now a 12point game as Nance makes the first free throw theyve also out rebounded Carolina 3226 out rebounded them on the offensive glass 146 that could be a problem going forward for Carolina thats the most disturbing thing I think coming out of the game today you just dont expect and its all Hustle the bigger team you dont expect him to get out rebounding no matter which theyre getting out rebounded tonight off the steal love couldnt finish the layup back the other way theres a nice looking finish by trezarian white give him 13 points to lead the Seahawks foreign Applause Music because theres not a lot of assists its just a lot of my turn your turn they got four assists on tonight but I guess you can do that when you got this kind of tattle as love tells me to shut up and pull up to this midrange jump shot youre not wrong though as the competition heats up theyre going to have to do a better job of moving moving bodies and moving the ball in the offensive end Phillips back out to White theres another threepoint bucket made by the Seahawks and its back to a 10point ball game theyre not going away Applause I think were going to see Armando Baker come in soon here leaky black taking advantage of that seven foot three inch wingspan down in the block great decision by Lincoln put his man in the post turned this side of his inside shoulder just too small to defend the rolls up and shot right over shot the third foul on Phillips as leaky black the only remaining Tarheel from that 2019 ACC Championship team in number one seed still around young man from Concord North Carolina has his undergraduate work done now working on a postgraduate degree out of Cox Mill High School although he didnt play his whole career there he played a couple of years at Concord then went down to montverde for a year and came back up to the Carolinas for his senior year at Cox Mill and you know even though hes not an offensive threat you think theres a shot at leaky finding a spot in the NBA someday I do because hes six nine he can defend every position on the floor and he knows what he is and hes accepted theres not a lot of guys that buy in to what their game is and I think theres somebody in the NBA to find him on a roster because theres a roleful he wants to guard the best player on the other team well the list of guys he shut down last year was really impressive that list will grow this year as well it will good defense Again by the Tar Heels its a really good group on the floor defense for the Carolina I think this may be their five best defenders on the floor and a chance for three theres no shot blockers out there its love in RJ Davis decided to get to the paint theres nothing thered ever stop I think theyre going to continue to do that and close this game out Applause great crossover dribble just bodies them up elevates over and finishes its just too athletic and too strong that is the election and one indeed and he fouled out Malik Harden Hayes in the process well Calebs from a wonderful family in St Louis his mom Alicias dad Dennis storys been told his dad a huge Tarheel fan from the beginning who when Caleb was just a youngster he doesnt even remember the 2005 final four dad got him tickets really good tickets to go see the Tar Heels and it seemed destined that Caleb would wind up here in Chapel Hill but he hung a banner on that 2005 team so Im sure he wants to come and hang him hang him at himself you know like I said they were a rebound away from a year ago and yep the talent and the depth this year the depth has been as productive as we we would like but theyre playing you could see that theyre going to bring something to this team as the year goes along and thats why the expectations are high and I expected to continue to stay high well Carolina only has four bench points tonight yeah all from Seth Trimble and again theyre playing without Jalen Washington still coming back from knee surgery and without puff Johnson tonight he has right knee soreness 17 points now for love to go along with 15 for Davis 14 for bacon Music coach Davis likes this group for the defensive end Applause theres that outside defense for Manchester talking about again theyve been defending well thats Lance thats Lance coming over but again his ability to defend the ball screens switching is this is something that they didnt have a year ago when Armando went out of the game and he brings that to the team got to get the perspiration off the floor now hes not having a great offensive game but his presence has been felt defensively this game he got his degree at Northwestern in radio TV and film but he wasnt done after four years playing for Chris Collins playing basketball he wanted to go elsewhere and use his covid year and he didnt have Carolina on his radar until the summertime when Caleb Lovin him became friends in Chicago and the recruitment started there probably will send Newby to the free throw line hes a great fit just the seamless transition here so its hard to turn down the powder blue when you come to visit here coming up next the nothing but net crew will break down all the ACC games highlights and Analysis and sound from the players and coaches right here on accn and the ESPN F weve had a marvelous opening night a triple header of live basketball the Louisville women took care of business the Duke men took care of business and Carolina trying to make it a three for three evening for the ACC on night number one were gonna have college basketball for the next 125 nights on the ESPN family of networks were so glad youve joined us here on acc Network on day number one what a day well the only ACC school to lose so far that Ive seen is Florida State really surprised with that game today they were not at well its going to be an over and back leaky had not reestablished himself in the backcourt when he took that pass he jumped from the front Court caught the ball and then landed in the backcourt but Florida State I dont think was at full strength tonight but still you wouldnt think the Seminoles would lose on opening night not at home I mean you expect him to come out with the Atlanta athleticism give him some credit its like the UNC Wilmington team they came to play tonight Eno set to screen Nance gets called for the foul contesting newbie indeed UNCW has been game but the Tar Heels up 16 late to prepare against its the first game you dont know what youre going to get out of teams theyve thrown they threw a lot of that Carolina but their best players are bringing them home and after sitting out the last few minutes with four personal fouls Armando baycott is back on the floor and needs two rebounds for another double double Applause it would be his 50th career double double again he is quite a role with the rebounds he is tied with the great Sean May one of the assistant coaches for Carolina averaging 10 rebounds per game six best in program history there was coach May Billy Cunningham his numbers are never going to be caught he averaged for his career over 15 boards a game some records will never be broken I dont see anybody breaking that one Applause Armando would have needed to play for Coach Davis for all four years to have a shot at that one its first time you dont see women Preston went back to the zone Applause we talked about that at shooting around not a lot of teams are prepared for that ball doesnt move as it hasnt moved most of the day for Carolina settled for three probably one as he should have gone through a little earlier tonight Applause Eno hands it back to Jamari Thomas five on the shot clock white creates a little space and draws the foul on Trimble got trouble reaching a little bit again its his third foul just sticking his hand in right on the top elevator for a shot tried to strip him stuck his hand in the cookie jar got caught with his third foul right there he is going to be a good one freshman from Menomonee Falls Wisconsin I just like saying Menominee any idea where it is in Wisconsin I dont know I did not check that out is it near Milwaukee I dont know I have no idea I dont know well he picked Carolina over Michigan and Marquette hes a fourstar recruit number 46 in last years ESPN 100 Mr basketball in the state hell have a choice when his brothers his brother came on the recruiting visit so I think that was part of it saying look you got to follow yeah this is where youre going whether you like it or not its the Family School Jay Davis I think he can do that all night if he wants we have learned that it is 20 miles Northwest of Milwaukee Menomonee Falls its a nice looking Stroke by Eric vanderheiden his first points as a Seahawk theyre all the native after transferring home from Ole Miss time out hear the dean go 12 nay Smith Hall of Famers from the Tar Heels sets the pace and if Mondo does what Mondo does hes going to move to the top of that list somewhere midseason this year I dont think theres any doubt I mean hes about two rebounds away from having his DoubleDouble tonight had he not gotten his this poor foul I think hed already have it Music Carolina still with four of its starters out there along with DeMarco Dunn we used to playing heavy minutes we hadnt played as the usual tournaments tonight Applause that ball bounced out of bounds apparently untouched it stays at this end this is what I didnt grab the loose ball the last to touch on the shot block and then Eno could not Corral it Commandos is so difficult is so difficult to guard if you get to that low you cant do anything but foul Im gonna let him have it and put so much pressure on your defense by drawing fouls no yes yeah exactly excuse me Randolph in 25 minutes played for baycot so far tonight he is drawn seven fouls on the opposition eight make it eight with this one Mondo last year 67 percent from the line Carolina is a team of pretty good freethrow shooting Squad as he misses a pair is he changed them I did I did well loving Davis career both well over 80 percent owns your ball hand towards you want them to be your best free throw shooters newbie Applause boy he has really carved out some space inside now he comes away limping after the putback hes a low coming down that lane he sets that ball screen and Dives to the front of the rim he doesnt get it and the shot goes up gives himself a chance to rebound it Bangkok blocked from behind and fouled by Eno who played his freshman year at Memphis for tubby Smith that played his sophomore year with Memphis under Penny Hardaway for transferring to Maris to the last couple of years and youre right he provides bulk inside that otherwise Takeo siddle does not have at UNCW no and if you play for those coaches then tubby Smith and Penny Hardaway youre going to have to defend the play for those guys so he obviously plays really really hard and now Im playing for siddle this is seamless transition form and Id be remiss if I didnt say that he played for the great John Dunn at Marist College the last couple of years another exacting coach I say that because JDs a friend of mine but he is a good coach he is yes that he is Applause Mondo without any Jinx worries goes calmly to the line and makes a pair hes got 16 points see and you didnt talk about it and left the Maloney knocked both of them talking about Coach Dunn instead it works Thomas no one look at leaky black hook and get that rebound Applause one minute to go on this opening night great defense dude done great move by Don you want to see him get going too hes worked really hard in the off season you want to see him have some production in the game I think hell be a really have a really big season for Carolina they really want to get to their goal done in styles that need to be a big part of that as well tell you what trezarian whites put together a really nice second half for the Seahawks he has 15 of his 17 points coming since the break and he heads back to the line to add to it he stayed aggressive throughout you could tell hes familiar with the system hes one of the guys the returning players one of their leaders of this team he struggled early but he kept batting well UNCW in its division one history is 2 and 43 all time against ACC opponents they took down NC State in 92 and then sorry to mention this 2010 will beat wait but they will not be adding to that win total here tonight against the number one team in the country Applause Music you still live and die with the Deeks I would imagine one way or the other one dude Im just tearing them Im objective now in this world but all right you know I I I I can say that now because you flat out told me youre a big Syracuse fan so arent you a big surface guys so now I can say Im gonna wake up were all from somewhere and when we do a Syracuse game I call it straight when you do a Wake Forest game you call it straight very true well heres leaky black back at the free throw line Applause coach Davis will have a lot of film to show his guys now and I mean hell be extremely disappointed I never thought Id say this but Carolinas been out rebounding tonight and that and their lack of transition baskets those are things that they only have four points in transition those two things have ever been theyve been Staples in the Carolina program and uh they didnt do a very good job of those things tonight fight for the basketball its another great job by man just switching moving his feet on a smaller guard hes really going to be so much helped his team so much on the defensive end of the floor hell be better offensive offensively I know everyone is expected him to stuff the stat sheet tonight but we tell you he can play he can play yeah well for Nance tonight six points one of three from the floor two for three from the line shot clock off and the Tar Heels can dribble it out Elijah said a lot of teaching points but youd rather learn those lessons than a win than a loss they control the game Throw they led by 11 at the break never fully pulled away Id say this final score is fairly representative of how the game went but Hubert Daviss number one ranked team starts the season off with a 6956 victory both coaches got a lot of teaching points tonight Carolinas happy with the win you know you would have some things youll point out with those guys but hey cant win a championship to you in the first one at least so great job by the tar he was coming out get the job done
