did not play against the balls last week Out again today with some back soreness Kobe Rogers his teammate a key reserve for Pat Kelsey also out in concussion protocol Your officials this afternoon Tony Henderson Tommy Morrisy and Tony Cheyaza And in the road maroon uniforms the Grizz control the opening tip Yeah one thing Louisville wanted to stress they wanted to take the pop out of Montanas offense So just watch Theyre going to be up into the pass up into their lanes and just make it real difficult Freshman Kenyon Aino misses the first shot of the game Good D by the Cards Heres Ryan Conwell averaging just a tick under 20 a game coming in 196 for number three in white And your starters as you see no Mike Brown That means Adrien Woolly number 14 in white is making his second consecutive start coming off his best game of the season against Tennessee Yeah Adrian Wy had 19 points of the game And you know talk about make a statement to have confidence uh to be put in new situations Heres Fu with the dish to Javon Headley Open the scoring So what Montanas going to have to do they got to keep Montana excuse me Louisville out of the paint When they get into the paint they just have too many weapons and too many options Heres Money He is a bucket but he turns it over there Heres Woolly with the ball They swing it around They love the three ball and theyre off the mark on their first one This is a team that some people might say Mech lives by the three and dies by the three In their wins theyre unbelievable In the two losses theyre not Yeah So you know they shoot a lot of threes So after talking with Pack Healthy yes theyre shooting a lot of threes but really what theyre trying to do is theyre trying to get to the paint So when you get to the paint the defense collapsed and hey they got 40 point shooters thrown all around them They kick it out and they let them fly So theyre shooting kind of heavy now as the game as the season continues They might adjust that Heres Conwell taking it to the cup and he turns it over Good defense by Montana Theres Tyler Thompson Four in Maroon Now moneys being guarded by the lone big man on the floor Sonu They dont get it back to him Heres a three from the wing and its in and out from Tyler Isaac So what Travis secure said is that uh theyre going to have to be patient and grind out and find good shots That was a good patient offensive set on Montana Tyler got a good look It just didnt go in Heres Hadley from the wing off the mark and a little bit of a chilly start for the Cards threepoint shooting And another uh point that Travis um Te wanted to make hey look these guys can put it up but we got to make sure that we make their threes difficult and make them contested They shoot about 35 threes a game And theres the freshman Aino Three straight player of the year awards coming out of high school in New Mexico I really like that kid man Hes a freshman but hes playing above his years Really solid in the post Great footwork great touch around the basket He can go right or left The lob from Bully to F And another point of contention as we mentioned as you mentioned about the threes um F only had three attempts last game and Pat Kelsey didnt like that So a point of emphasis today was to try and get more touches in the post Yeah just four points for Fu in that loss in Knoxville Theres another three attempt by Thompson off the mark Montana for their part shoot the threes as well Neily out of bounds Thats a turnover for the Cards So a point of contention you have some threepoint shooters going to uh draw a lot of attention Thats going to leave the post open When you have an athletic big like Fruit you got to use them spoken like someone who knows about athletic bigs I I might laughter have Hey back in the day I might have you know got up a time or two Just about 20 years ago echo before the Yukon Huskies won a national championship You can just say many years ago You say 20 laughter Heres a Grizz turnover Cards looking to capitalize An early 42 lead The Grizzlies have to have to take care of the ball because of things like that Louisville is very elite at turning defense into offense and capitalizing on turnovers And Montana just cant give I know its Christmas season but they cant gift wrap They cant they cant gift wrap things like that Theres Tyler Thompson with an answer from three The first three of the game for the Grizz That previous three by Ian McNeilly a great sign for the Cards He was 1 for 10 from three in his last two coming in And you know its a law of average when it comes to threes Mc McNeely is a career uh 40 plus percent shooter So its only a matter of time before he starts knocking down again Louisville coming in ranked 11th in the country Two losses both to top 25 teams The last time they played they took it on the chin in Knoxville against Rick Barnes in number 20 Tennessee Pat Kelsey held what he described as a football practice a couple of days ago Theres Pat and Ian McNeely doing what the Cards love to do Fire away at will from three And in our practice when I we were at his practice yesterday that was clearly evident in the way he conducted himself Heres Ali Khalifa They call him the Egyptian magician A pass for first big man number 15 in white Yeah I really like Khalifas game Hes always looking to get his guys going right there And he did The interesting thing about him is despite him only playing just under 11 minutes a game he is the second leading assist getter on his team at 30 You know what He has more assists than shots How do you like that for a teammate Theres three in Maroon Brooklyn Hicks He was a focal point of Pat Kelseys scouting report He was he was he uh you know Pat Kelsey is very interesting that he just he he refers to the players as just numbers and I like that because cheering you just encapsulate all their attributes and just really focus on what they do And Hicks hes an energy guy that can do everything So you want to make sure you disrupt his flow and uh mitigate his energy output Five on the shot clock for the Grizz Theyre going to have to get it up Thompson does a onelegged deep jump shot and its a three for Tyler Thompson Second one of the afternoon for him Grizz within two Heres Headley in the paint and hes going to go to the line and shoot two Lets take a look at Tyler Thompson going to work So this goes back to you have to be patient and work and get the shots that you want They you know Tyler Thompson shooting a high clip coming into this game Hes shooting hes made 14 of his last 26 threes shooting about 45 on the season And theyre going to need every single one of those threes this game to put up a good fight Headley hits the first free throw Thats the first free throw of the game between these two teams And now Canai Roots checks out and Quesan Prior jumps in There was some question as to whether Prior was going to play in this game Only played eight minutes against Tennessee but here he is helping the cause for the Cards Yeah hes battling snorts back from the injury in ACL Hey thats an athlete Weve all been there Khalifa with the steal McNeely thought about the transition three inside Khalifa Hes like an offensive hub when hes on the floor Now Khalifa for three Too strong off the back iron Heres the freshman Aino working on the bigger Khalifa And they force the turnover No numbers for Louisville but Headley doesnt care I like Headleys game He just kind of does a little bit of everything And Javon Hadley loses it out of bounds Its going to be Montana basketball And when its Montana basketball the ball is usually in the hands of zero in Maroon And thats Money Williams If you havent heard about him folks he is one of the most electric offensive players in the country My man can get buckets Youre talking about an appropriately named basketball player with money His c his shot is money Everything about him is money Hes had three 30point games Uh he can get him up in a in a hurry And you know his usage rate at 355 is actually the highest in the country That ball goes out of bounds Its going to be Louisville basketball When you talk about money Williams its funny Travis Dur their head coach who has been so successful at Montana said Sometimes our best offenses give him the ball and get out of the way because hes such a great creator He he just a magician around the rim and hes looking to get his teammates going Uh you know in terms of assist total assists hes had 73 so far and thats best I mean excuse me thats good for 12th in the nation So not only hes a bucket getter hes a facilitator as well Heres Tyler Isaac like he was shot out of a can and goes right at the rim Draws the foul And Tyler Isaac will go to the line and shoot two And you know Tyler Isaac I like this guys story Its pretty interesting So he started off D1 at Cal Baptist He registered his first year Uh his second year he only appeared in seven games where he had five points five assists three rebounds and three is three steals total Thats it He said Hey man let me collect myself He went down a level to Citrus College where he found his rhythm averaging 186 points a game on 411 three uh threepoint shooting And now this year hes come back on the D1 level Hes uh I want to call him the primary ball handler outside of money one So hes the second man up Hes chipping in nine points a game Hes hes hes uh dropping dimes and hes just a great story of how to believe in yourself work hard and come back and try again Yeah he is normally a threepoint specialist 59 of his attempts come from three but we just saw him drive to the rim and get a couple of free throws So now Montana still within two nearly 8 minutes gone by in the first half looking for what would be a monumental upset of the 11th ranked Cards But Javon Headley has something to say about it Headedley has an early seven points and the Cards lead is up to five Thats why you got to keep them out the paint Once they get to the tank those shooters they can light it up And all of a sudden the threes are starting to fall for the Cards Theyre three for eight in the early going Theyre third in the nation in threepointers made Theyre fourth in the country in threepointers attempted And even Javon Hadley who qualifies as a big for Pat Kelsey has shown that he could stroke it from distance as well He can put it down He can put it he can put him up Hes more selective in it Uh which hes hes shooting at a pretty pretty high you know 40 plus clip Uh but just more firepower for them Good defense by Ryan Conwell on Money Williams The two stars we touched on at the top of this telecast And now were going the other way Thats good really stingy Tennessee defense Grizzlies hanging around right now down just five with 1144 to go This is a team that was preseason number one in the Big Sky Conference They went to the NCAA tournament last year And Travis Dur is Montana through He graduated from there in 1994 one of just 10 coaches in mid major basketball to have 24 or more wins the last two years And Montana coming out playing some defense You got to stay attached from the shooters and did an excellent job right there Heres Money Havent heard from him yet This cards defense knows he keys the Montana offense Heres another Grizz turnover And that looked like it was off Montana Itll stay Louisville basketball You know I I really like Montanas energy They really theyre coming in here You know Louisville is a very tough place to play and theyre just matching the energy and just fighting I like it I take that back Thats why Im not a referee It was indeed Grizz basketball Heres number 11 Grant Kempley getting his first run of the game Connor Dick ten in Maroon is Montana through and through just like his head coach grew up 10 minutes from campus Money with the lob to number one Trey Taylor Dont sleep on the 19 points a game He has six dimes a game too He is constantly looking to get his teammates involved first So yeah money can score but my man can pass He has his eyes open head up looking for a teammate Gets his man a nice dunk And one thing about Money Williams he scores 19 a game But the majority of that mech comes in the second half He averages 136 a game in the second half only 56 in the first Nice lead for Fu goes off his hands and out of bounds And look at this The entire Grizzlies five goes over to help up one of their teammates And you talking about coming in to make an impact I believe Keley is the one who blocked Conwell and hes the one diving off of loose balls He I havent seen him His his playing is a little bit inconsistent but if you want to instill confidence in your coach do what this young mans doing the inbounds McNeely off the mark but the follow by Fu And one thing that Pat Kelsey reiterated to his team as the CRO Mech was rebounding is number one on our list They especially wanted to craft the offensive glass Got to take care of the glass That shot off the mark but the follow and the foul How about Trey Taylor make the most of his minutes Speaking of take Speaking of taking care of the glass speaking of getting in Trey Taylor is another guy who doesnt really get that much playing time Hey you want to get more playing time and earn and and want your coach to keep an eye on you Effort effort effort effort And thats what that man just exhibited And unfortunately Tyler Thompson stepped into the painted area too early So no free throw for the Grizz but theyre still within a possession of the number 11 Louisville Cardinals down just 3174 halfway through the first half You know when youre on the road in a hostile environment the key the key inside the young center You got to stay loose man Got to stay loose Rich Hollenberg and Mecca Okaffor Happy holidays everybody Heres a lob from Conwell to Vroom for two So some bigs are horizontal spacers meaning that they can shoot the three and space for horizontally Mr Fu Sunny Fu there is a vertical spacer in which he puts pressure on the rim vertically As you guys just saw the big man from Berlin sending it down He has six Heres Thompson cheering And now its Kepler Leans in Cant hit the one off the window And Conwell brings it up for the Cards Lefty three no good from Woolly out of bounds Itll be Montana basketball So what makes Louisvilles offense so deadly is that they have players around the perimeter who can stretch the rim horizontally but then you have that lob threat Youre constantly putting the defense in a bind of what to take away Heres Money The lefthander goes to the left side and will go to the line A chance to earn his first points of the afternoon He is just so crafty at getting to the cup or getting fouled Like I theres something new each and every time Just something innate that he has Well Money Williams what he is doing is remarkable on the court especially when you consider the hardship that he had to deal with earlier in his playing career Last year lost his mom and his dad within months of one another They told him about it after one game and Travis Tur told us its been almost like a roller coaster ride for him of emotions You can only imagine what hes been going through but he has responded and he is back for his junior season and playing as well as anybody in the country Fin for the big man See as a big when you get a bunch of easy buckets like he got a couple of good dunks it warms you up and you allow it allows you to have the confidence to make a move like that Fivepoint lead for Louisville Their largest of the afternoon against the Montana Grizzlies A number of reserves on the floor for Travis to cure keeping cheering the team in the game But a turnover here Conwell McNeely and its going to stay Louisville basketball And now Tyler Isaac checks on as does Kenyan Aino So the starters back on the floor for Travis to cure Pat Kelsey trying to develop some depth especially with not only Mike Brown on the bench but Kobe Rogers whos one of their key re reserves off the bench not playing this afternoon Yeah Kobe Rogers Hes a just a a a great not only player but just a great person Hes elected team captain a real big member of establishing culture which is if you want to win a team you have to have culture So Conwell asked to carry even more of the offensive load than hes done so far this season with those two out Canyut off the mark Offensive rebound by Fu Oh and players hit the deck Money Williams goes right over the top of Sana Fru Time out on the floor with eight minutes to go in the first half Weve got a close one as we music countdown to Christmas time When we come back its big on big Acha Okapor discusses Sonu 50 The key is activity You got to use that weight and that length Active on the board looking out for your teammates active around the rim being physical And when you touch the ball and youre active it allows you to expand your game You can take it out drive bump finish Sandu has eight points to lead all scorers and three rebounds And whats important about those rebounds is thats what Pat Kelsey has been hammering home to his team especially after they got punked in Knoxville He said and listen its not the prettiest picture to paint He said I want you to rebound like youve got snot coming out of your nose You want the ball every time the shot goes up And Sander Fu has answered the call So heres Louisville Fivepoint lead their largest of the afternoon They go back inside Capu added the timeout and he responds again Double digits for Sander Fu Louisvilles game plan of going inside You can you can just see it Sand is responding Heres Money Oh and he gives it away And slow to get up On the other end Roots and one opportunity Cany Roots will go to the line for a threepoint play Yeah Montana Mont Montana one of Montanas issue and coach the Dure said it uh is is turnovers They have to mitigate the amount of turnovers especially live ball turnovers because Louisville theyre fast They capitalize on it so quick and you just dont want to put your defense in a bind like that Renes cant roots cant complete the threepoint play Its going to be Montana basketball in a little bit of a danger zone right now Things starting to tilt the way of the Cards Heres Thompson now Money Williams What a matchup this is Conwell on Williams Thompson from the wing No weak side rebound to Hadley Conwell step back three off to the right Loose ball Who wants it Grizz got it And now just three for 12 from three for the Louisville Cardinals Tony Henderson has a foul called away from the ball and thats going to be on number 53 Velis Zugris Yeah Montanas going to have to look to find a way to get Tjan Sawyer involved He hasnt even attempted a shot yet this half and you know after the 23 and 12point perh performance they got to get him going Heres Sawyer with the ball 32 in Maroon coming off a career game last time out despite a loss by Montana to an NIA school Montana Tech Theres Hicks Pretty drive but he cant get it to drop And Conwell controls for the Cards Now Hadley working on the smaller Connor Dick Roots for three Way off the mark And that helps out Montana Roots Hes a very athletic player Havent quite found a stroke from the three So if you have to give something up you let him shoot that all day Those are the tough threes that coach Dur was telling his team they needed Heres Isaac high off the window No good Good defense by the Cards Conwell Brad wanted a foul No whistle came Montanas really holding hustling on defense but making it tough Conwell lefty three again Hes off the mark Sou with the rebound and he lost it And no whistle again Theyre letting them play inside the young center That was a nice little sequence there They started on the opposite end with all the activity that Montana had on defense They they dug it They dug in on their on their heels and took it back the other way Patience is the key Head was turned made the cut An aggressive move to the rim Thats the way theyre going to have to get back in this game Just keep on attacking Keep on attacking and bring the force So Connor Dicks steps to the line He is the embodiment of a Montana Grizzly basketball player Grew up 10 minutes from campus His dad Ryan played for the Grizz As a matter of fact the most improved player award is named after his dad Ryan and now hes following in his pops footsteps Yeah And his uh coach coach Travis Dure played with his father too He goes one for two from the free throw strike to bring Montana to within eight Heres Kase Frier Seven and white And we have a foul going the other way You know I I like what Montana is doing Theyre bringing the effort When you bring the effort you give yourself a chance And thats three quick fouls on the big man Vanelis Zugris So hes going to have to go to the bench And we were talking yesterday with Tra uh with coach the cure and he says Hey you know I just want to get my guys to execute the game plan And so far it looks like theyre within earshot just eight points but it looks like theyre executing just fine Williams thought about the three A willing passer and an electric scorer is money Williams but he has no field goals so far this afternoon Oh Aino gets it to go at one Aino a freshman but showing that a couple of classes higher This was an incredible basket Uh just extremely patient Got the patience of a senior right here Got him up in the air and then the strength to follow through Free throws not necessarily a strength for Kenyon Aino 63 from the line but it looked good there Aino has five Montana back to within five That kids a winner Four straight state titles in New Mexico Heres McNeely IMAC to the rim Well so much for the star watch Money Williams no field goals Ryan Conwell 0 for six from the field so far So does that count as a broadcasters jinx Does that follow It does not I know youre new to this but broadcasters jinx do not exist Okay Okay At least not in my book Okay Ill wipe the sweat off my bro Were going to come out of this game undefeated Here we go Theres another turnover by the Grizz their ninth so far this afternoon So were under four minutes to go Its been an entertaining first half Montana has hung around with 11th ranked Louisville And their Achilles Hill has been turnovers as Louisville just turned it over Heres Dick at the other end Circus layup No good And no whistle call Sometimes you got to just bring it out Theres one on three Deep three by McNeely So sometimes the best shot is the shot you dont take He tried to force it and now cheering another turnover on the back end and a missed three by Prior cheering Woolly tries to follow Williams hits the deck and its going to be Montana basketball End to end action between the Cards and the Grizz 319 to go Conor Dick trying to finish at one end No sir But at the other end we have Ian McNeely saying This is my gym Theyre going to get their shots up We just have to make sure that their shots are contested Right now Louisville shooting four you know for 16 And I think thats a major reason why theyre in the game today Theres an open look and Hadley cant convert McNeely three again Isaac McNeely chips in with his third three of the afternoon He has 11 So does the broadcast reverse I mean does it work in the reverse way right there Largest lead of the game now for the Cards due in large part to Isaac McNeely And subs coming on now as Ryan Conwell and Son Fu checkek back in Yeah you know shooters live a Yeah he came in here one of 10 but its only a matter of time before he gets this thing turned around He gets that much space You can count that good as go 86 of his attempts are threepoint attempts He is a sniper from beyond the ark and hes showing it so far this afternoon Three for four from downtown for Isaac McNeely Two and a half to go in the first half as Louisville looks to extend the lead and the fouls going to be called on number 11 Grant Kempley Well not only are the Grizz down 13 now but theyre without Tjan Sawyer whos been saddled with three fouls Yeah theyre really going to have to just dig deep and find a way Theyre on the road theyre down and uh sometimes theres theres no Xs and Os Its just about fight Ali Khalifa hits the front end of a one and one Both teams in the bonus shooting free throws on every subsequent foul Theres Taan Sawyer Didnt start the last game but came off the bench and had 23 and 12 in that loss to Montana Tech It was his first time off the bench in 40 games and he responded Louisville in the midst of a 100 run now Heres Aino off the mark Offensive rebound Grizz 10 on the timer and they stepped out of bounds That Louisville defense extending beyond the threepoint Its extending and you know even though money isnt in the game that he just him being out there just helps their offense run a little bit more smoothly So them being down 15 and him out the game is going to be a little tough to for them to score And the turnovers mounting for the Grizzlies as Louisville turns it over again Theyre eighth in the first half Nice steal by Conwell playing up the line and he takes it himself for two and a threepoint play The first bucket of the day for Ryan Conwell and Conwell he gets you know a lot of attention for the shooting ability but the guy hes so good and quick in transition and nifty around the rim And for a shooter whose shot isnt going in right now the best way to get yourself going hey a good easy bucket at the rim follows a free throw He is a 41 threepoint shooter but so far hes been off the mark from deep If you are take it to the hole son and he did Completes the threepoint play and the lead has ballooned to 18 now for Louisville Ryan Conwell coming off a 22point effort at Tennessee but he was only four for 13 from the field And now McNeely snares the rebound into the hands of Conwell The three still wont fall Shrew gets the garbage bucket Bruce have himself a game and as a big like once you get going early it just carries through Hes used to touching the ball in a very variety of different ways Hes rebounding Theyre throwing him the lob Uh hes passing it So when you get all that going the ball become a magnet and the ball just finds you Sand Pruz had his fair share of doubledigit scoring efforts this season had 10 against Kentucky 14 at Arkansas a dozen against Indiana and 11 against Memphis He has 12 today already against Montana The lead is 20 for Louisville coming up on one minute to go Nice shot fake by Kepler Brooklyn Hicks three and Maroon has been quiet today Kepler might have gotten away with one there At least the crowd thought so Hicks off the mark and a gang of Cardinals grabbed the rebound Now 40 seconds to go About 13 second differential between the shot clock and the game clock After a slow start it has been an avalanche for the Louisville Cardinals Pat Kelsey has a use it or lose it timeout with 28 seconds left Well step aside for 30 These uh tough games will stress the system You find out what your strengths are what your weaknesses are what you can hang your hat on and you can make adjustments Khalifa the lob to Fu Bigto passing Ali Khalifa with his third dime of the afternoon And Sand Fu leads all scorers with 14 now and a three at the buzzer In and out for Kepler It was all Louisville in the late stages of the first half They go to the break with a Yeah Uh I actually think that the ball actually went off of Louisville Coach may want to consider a challenge but too late Heres Conrad Now hes 0 for seven from three So the one thing Montana has going for them is that they are a second half team Theyve scored about you know 10 points more than the second half in the first half So theyre going to need every single bit of that to get back in this game Heres Sawyer harassed and hounded Lost it but Isaac got it back And Tyler Isaac has his first field goal of the game Theyre going to need something from Tjan Sawyer 32 in Maroon He was scoreless and helped with three fouls in the first half And they go right over the top of Sawyer that time Another alleyoop to Sonaga Fru So now the Fu is having himself a game and as a big especially coming off of last game only getting three shots Just so important to get your get your rhythm so it can carry you through uh the next few games and just keep on building Sandrew already has a season high 16 Heres Thompson from the wing Tyler Thompson has his third triple of the game Kind of off to a good start offensively so lets hope they can keep it up Hadley doesnt have an answer And Tony Williams comes up with the rebound but Woody strips it away wide open McNeely cant cash it in Offensive rebound to Fru Conwell still cant find the bottom of the bucket 5050 ball and its going to be a jump ball possession arrow to the Grizz So coming out of second half you have to come out with some energy and coach secure talked about hey we got to grind it out right here Montana showing that they have the will to do just that Came into this game six and six on the season Theyre usually dominant at home at Dalberg Arena in Missoula but theyve lost four home games already this year Preseason number one in the Big Sky Conference Grizz trail by 19 now And heres Money Williams averaging over 19 a game and hes a second half star cheering Spin move Aino off the mark and Fu clears for the Cards Sand Fru with 16 points and six rebounds now And Money Williams hits the deck Looked like he might have been there but probably was just moving just a little bit Thats the second foul on Money Williams Hes going to go to the bench again Just by way of reminder Money averages just 58 8 points a game in the first half but 136 in the second half Coach Dure gives him a rest with those two fouls Final nonconference game for both of these clubs before the Christmas break and then conference play begins Hadley spin move Pretty scoop shot from Javon Hadley with nine So when you have that big of a mismatch you got to send another body You have to You cant leave Connor down there by himself Jake on the wing locks the hands and its going to be another Montana turnover there 14 So here its just all size advantage is clearly Javon So someone needs to come there start digging or maybe uh come baseline for a double and just get the ball out of his hands Check that 15 turnovers now for the Montana Grizzlies And the Cards have cashed in to the tune of 12 points off those turnovers Heres Fu Hes been a star today But now Conwell who struggled Saved by McNeely who wants it Isaac with the tap ahead to himself and the layin That right there is an extra effort play and they will need plenty more of those Khalifa another dive from the big man the Egyptian magician showing why he earned that nickname Ali Khalifa the sevenfooter now has four assists Sawyer blocked by Fu LOUISVILLE RUNNING AND FINISHING Sandanda Fu living at the rim and above the rim This game is going to just do wonders for not only him but his teammates as the the more proficient he is down low and the more threat he is hes just going to open up space for the perimeter for the perimeter shooters The lead is 23 and Louisville is threatening to blow it wide open That one off the mark by Isaac And remember Louisville doing this without the help of fabulous freshman Mike Brown Theres another assist from Ali Khalifa to Javon Headley Khalifa So Hadley in double digits with 11 Fu leading the way with 18 No Mikeel Brown No Kobe Rogers for Pat Kelseys Cards No problem today against the Grizz In and out Big rebound by Dick Keley off to Sawyer Off the mark Heres Khalifa Tried to thread the needle It got picked off And nice tap away by Conwell with the steel How about this Cards defense Nine steals already this afternoon Now Khalifa in the low post He still wants to PASS IT AND HE DOES ANOTHER beauty of a dime dropped by Ali Khalifa to Javon Hadley I really like Alis dime game He is just Yeah he earns that magician nickname through and through Ali Khalifa lost 50 lbs during this last medical red shirt year turning defense Hey this is the best thing right here When you get a block shot as a big on one end and then follow it down with an emphatic dunk thats the best feel ever sooner than later as the Cardinals get set for ACC play come December 30th Theyll be on the road against Cal and then Stanford before returning here to the Yum Center to take on the Duke Blue Devils So Sorya has one Hopefully just seeing the ball go through the net will ignite something Sometimes its all it takes You just got to see the ball go through the net get that kinesthetic feeling and the game takes off Just shooting 67 cheering from the free throw line this season but hes a career 74 shooter and he knocks down both there And now Sawyer with those three fouls goes to the bench after the free throws and Trey Taylor checks back in Okay for coach Dure getting a little press trying to mix it up a little bit Lure talked about switching up coverages a little bit Now Brooklyn Hicks with the task of guarding Ryan Conwell Heres Kasem Prior splits the defense up and in Pride taking it straight to the rim Again priority of inside games getting the inside game established and getting the bigs going cheering Eight on the timer for Montana Heres Keley Nice dribble drive by Tyler Kempley Check that Grant Kler Heres Khalifa almost had another assist with Kenny Roots going to the rim Hell go to the line instead Yeah Another uh adjustment that Pat Kelsey wants to make He said Hey if youre not a 40 shooter guy in the corner we want you cutting And you saw Roose cut to the basket and Ally hit him for the uh for the rim attack So this Louisville team were witnessing them without Mike Brown Hes one of the fabulous freshman that has been touted coming into this year A possible lottery pick after the season is over What do you think of the prospects of this Louisville team once he does come back start guys who can both put it on the floor shoot the three and MueL being a freshman his ability to handle the ball in transition his ability to attack the rim it just adds more firepower to their already pretty full arsenal interesting in the year of the transfer portal This has really been the year of the freshman so far at least in the nonconference Yeah So with the transfer portal a lot of teams have just been wanting to get older And as a result freshman have been getting the short end of the stick And we talk about the freshman numbers If youre just just going by numbers alone Carlos and he hasnt even started shooting the ball that well Yes its a very very talented group Im very excited to see how it plays out in the ACC These kids can they can ball And those are just ACC freshman How about Darren Peterson for the Kansas JayHawks Co Pet Heat and the Arizona Wildcats I mean it is insane Ive heard some people say the first 10 picks in the NBA draft could all be freshman this year And that is a very likely possibility These guys have are wise beyond their years in terms of basketball IQ and their head physically and their body maturity Uh I really like watching AJ Debons I I just in general I like the mindset of all the young these young guys Theyre good but theyre hungry and they want more and they want to get better And I think thats where what makes this class so special Yeah And if you want to look really smart in a couple of years keep your eye on Money Williams because a lot of NBA front offices are looking long and hard in the direction of Missoula Montana having some conversations with Travis Dure about him You know not anybody can just get 30 points in a game much less back to back This kid is a talented scorer and uh he definitely deserved a good look Heres Money for three off the mark Still no field goals so far for Money Williams Just four points today Nice pass and Case Frier cashes it in the assist to Conwell the bucket to Prior And now 11th ranked Louisville has extended their lead to 27 They led by 22 at the break Montana has to keep the energy up and keep fighting You you always have to get better You know that 000 mentality doesnt necessarily only matter when youre winning but also when youre losing Nice take by Brooklyn Hicks His first two of the game And the foul by Keley Thatll be his third Well take a timeout 1109 to go Louisville trying to run away and hide in this one at the Young Center How you know the modern games play today And its very nice of Pat Kelsey to do you the favor of featuring his big man while our big man is calling the game Sandru with the ball leading all scorers with 18 points And and more impressively hes nine for nine hasnt missed a shot yet Yeah hes working on a possible alltime Louisville record in terms of field goal Theres Tyler Thompson with another three Tyler Thompson has four triples Conwell finally sees one hit the bottom of the basket Ryan Conwell with eight his first three of the game One for nine from that department Talking about zero zero mentality Ruth picked up the ball you know three4er court Theyre not letting up One thing this Louisville team practiced incessantly when we were watching them yesterday was immediately after a basket is scored you have to sprint back in defensive transition And if the ball isnt made you have to have as Pat Kelsey said snot coming out of your nose trying to grab that rebound Keep gets the first to two Sandrew is nine for nine as you touched on The record for a Louisville Cardinal 15 of 15 That was Clifford Rosir who did it all the way back in 1993 against Eastern Kentucky So if they keep getting Sunny through the ball he might have history on his side And and one thing so Pat Kelsey is a is a real big on uh teams being player led And if you notice on every dead ball they huddle up They huddle up have a quick powwow before going into their next action Thats great for camaraderie and just keeping uh keeping focus and being aware of whats going on Heres McNeely for Fu Had that one blocked by Sawyer So I think that counts as a broadcast I think Hicks way off the mark and Canyut grabs the rebound and brings it up himself Conwell catch and release and he saw one go down Now its two in a row for Ryan Conwell You know as I mentioned earlier shooter you have to have a short memory Its all about the shot right now You believe you can make every single shot You got to walk into it and just let it fly Tipped away by Hadley Cars in transition Heres Fu Spins between two defenders and lost the handle Still havent seen money Williams as advertised bottled up and bothered all afternoon by this cards defense And to be fair he did hurt his wrist last game So hes not 100 his uh when hes not playing is bandaged So he is bandaged up now So he fell on it last game for his shooting hand That could be playing a big factor Can I roots for three And now Khalifa and Woolly at the scorers table set to check back in for Pat Kelsey And they will after that turnover Well Ryan Conwells got himself 11 points Hes the leading scorer on this team averaging under 20 a game grew up in Indianapolis about two hours away from Louisville but was always a Cardinal supporter Heres a picture of young Ryan as a sophomore at a high school And he used to visit Louisville all the time where his grandfather lived Roger was a diehard Cardinals fan Passed away last year But Brian in living the legacy of his grandfather gave turkeys away at Thanksgiving at his grandfathers cheering church this past Thanksgiving This community of Louisville adoring Louisville basketball and the basketball program gives it right back to the city This is this is a a very special place to play Um you know you ask all the players from top to bottom what they love They love the sense of community of the fans They love the sense love the sense of community and culture of the team Well Ali Khalifa doesnt specialize in threes He specializes in dishes but hes got one with a 72 to 40 lead over the Montana Grizz of the Big Sky Conference Its been an afternoon for the big men Ali Khalifa with five points and five assists And Sandanda Fu leading the way for the Cardinals with a game high 18 points Nine for 10 from the field for number 13 in white Now through on the bench were coming close to that time where Pat Kelsey might consider emptying set bench Yeah I I really think that uh title Pat Kelsey got what he wanted from the inside today inside production you know and if if you have championship aspirations you need balance You need both inside and out So they have the outside game clicking And when that outside game doesnt click you need to find another source of offensive production and the bigs have to be ready That was a point of contention Wanted to let the bigs know that hey man youre part of it You can do it And we see the results And its interesting when we were talking to him about those championship aspirations yesterday I thought it was really fascinating that he told us one of the reasons I know were doing it the right way at Louisville is because other coaches tell me how difficult it is to play us They change their strategies when Louisville comes to town and Fully who just went to the free throw line will go back and shoot another two And I asked Coach Dur yesterday hey you know what do you hope to get out of this game Hey you know these games theyre theyre theyre tough for us but they help get us ready for not only Big Sky play but this is NCA tournament prep Were going to face these teams if we make it to the tournament So its good for us to get a look now figure out what we got to do And also too hey we need to get clips on film to show that we can play very very good basketball against good teams Just like Louisville has their finals nonconference game today before ACC play starts Travis Secure and the Montana Grizz have off the rest of the holiday season and they will open Big Sky play on January 1st against Northern Arizona backtoback Big Sky Conference Championships as Woolly hits both Yeah So to put on my last point you know that this game is a bit of a blowout but I think that they have some stretches especially here in the second half where they can show like hey man this can be what Grizzly basketballs about toughness uh sharing the ball hitting the boards and take that into take that in stride into conference play With seven to shoot Thompson does off the mark and a foul on the floor says Tony Henderson 15 but thats his third foul Montana So itll be Montana ball Money Williams who we touted at the top of this telecast averaging over 19 a game has been held to just four points on four free throws today Not a single field goal made credit the Cards defense Tyler Thompsons been a big part of their offense Four threepointers And Sandafruit has dominated on the inside for the Cards to the tune of 18 points on nine of 10 from the field You just have to wonder how much that just moneys injury to his left wrist is bothering him This is atypical for his style Thats a three by Grant Kley He has six Big sporting day for the Montana Grizz Not only they get to play the number 11 Louisville Cardinals in basketball their football team is in the FCS semifinals Theyre playing number two Montana State Its the Grizz against the Bobcats Missoula versus Boseman in Big Sky Country with a trip to the FCS championship game on the line Shout out all the Grizz fans who are watching on the streaming services today And a three one opportunity for Grant Keley Little stocking stuffer for Montana A little three and one opportunity You know its funny We watched practice yesterday Grant Kempley was is only averaging 8 minutes a game but as we were watching he really popped in practice Good athleticism real aggressive and hes shown some of that this afternoon He has when you know minutes are scarce and you get in there you have to make the most of it And I think that Grant Kemp has definitely made a case to just lobby Hes lobbyed himself for more minutes going going into the future Hes 10xed his scoring average Averages under two a game Hes got 10 today Conwell tough two No good But its going to stay overall 17 ticks on the shot clock So lets widen the lens a little bit my friend ACC play is coming up in a few days Duke right now looks like the clear favorite They were preseason number one but Louisville was preseason number two How do you think it stacks up going into conference play I I think thats an accurate portrayal of of the ACC landscape Duke I mean how can you doubt them right now They just you know not only are they undefeated but theyre just being bullies out there from Louisville Theyre a very intriguing team Um you know theyre theyre super deep They have they can get you a lot of different ways but Louisville is not necessarily taking you know one or two guys away You got to just take away you got to just make scoring difficult And I think once Louisville once everybody buys into their strength and understands how they can move as a cohesive unit Louisville is going to be a very very very dangerous team ACC has four music teams in the top 25 The names you would imagine Duke is number three This Cardinals team 11 and right behind them North Carolina is 12 But Virginia has reentered the chat in the top 25 So its going to be another year on the uptick for the ACC it looks like as Isaac Neely has his 12th point of the day Last year such a magical year for Pat Kelce in his first year as head coach of Louisville They went 278 and tore through the ACC to the tune of an 182 record And they did it with with all new players Understand thats very difficult to do to build a culture immediately get everybody to buy in and establish roles only to turn around in a short period of time and go 18 and two in the ACC Yeah it didnt end the way they wanted him to Obviously they made the NCA tournament but lost in the first round An upset at the hands of Kraton and yet it was their first NCA tournament since 2019 It its a its a great starting block and a testament to coach uh Pat Kelsey It was no wonder that hes been cheering elected coach of the year in three different leagues You understand Three different leagues That is consistency at its best one of only 10 head coaches in division one basketball to have that claim He won a conference of the year or coach of the year award with Winbrook another one with College of Charleston and got one last year in his first year with Louisville Zugris on the floor again with those three fouls Gets his first two of the day Time out Montana And a timeout called by Montana 425 to go Its been all Cardinals What Whats I found very interesting in in uh new the new uh college uh conference shift You have California and Stanford in the ACC on the opposite end How much travel does California and Stanford have to do Its one thing for them to do the twostep What What about the other way Right Oh my goodness As a student athlete Im thinking All right how do you get your work done How much class are you missing Must be tough That one off the mark Ripped out of bounds though Its going to stay Louisville basketball 352 to go All Louisville on a Saturday afternoon 50th birthday My wife uh orchestrated this behind the scenes 50th birthday this past baseball season Tell Ill tell you why They they come through with the most clutch gifts Wait are you saying husbands dont Come on man We We are running to catch the bus bro laughter Happy wife Happy life Theres theres a meme going out with uh that my wife showed me of uh a SNL skit where you know all the everybodys unwrapping their presents and the moms like I got a robe And then you know the kids I got a Nintendo I got a Switch The husbands like I got this tool set or whatever And then the wifes like I got a robe And its laughter just you know thats the plight of mothers man Mothers and wives We love yall Yeah Theyre the heroes We get to go out and live a dream for the living And they stay home and make it all work What a day for Grant Kempley A career day He now has 13 Well the Cards have made doubledigit threes Thats a good sign especially coming off an effort against Tennessee on the road where they went 7 for34 from three Again their two losses they were 8 for 37 against Arkansas 7 for 34 against the VS That combines to 21 from threepoint range In their wins theyre shooting 39 Brew back on the floor and another miss All the more reason to establish that inside game Inside game steady meal steady diet I should say You always count on and its not necessarily an inside game Meaning with all due respect Mech its not just feed the post its the guards penetrating because paint touch threes is really what the Cardinals are looking for Its its touching the paint and having everything be an option right When everything is an option youre you know the goal is to put the defense in a bind to make them make a decision and punish them for that decision And the more threats you have the easier it is to do that Canyuts will go to the line and shoot two This is a Louisville team by the way that love to point out the fact that going into the Tennessee game they had more free throws shot than the opponents had free throws attempted And Kenny Roots at the line that is the calf of one Kenny Roots You talk about in a day and age of the transfer portal being wide open someone committing to a team he is a Cardinals player and a Cardinals fan The C A R DS commitment attitude responsibility discipline and sacrifice And Cany Roots lives the Cardinals ethos Yeah my man takes uh school spirit to a a much different place Another three for Isaac McNeely He has four on the afternoon 16 in all That right there is Montana just continuing to play hard Playing hard They dont care about the score Theyre working on themselves Uh had theyve had nothing but success Uh they havent had a a losing season in the past 12 years uh under the cures leadership And you know I know the score doesnt indicate it but all intents and purposes youre dealing with different weight classes You have like a middleweight fighting a a heavyweight and you see the result Dont get it twisted This is a good team They play hard and I think theyre going to do just fine in the Big Sky That one nearly picked off by Hicks Heres Prior off the mark Out of bounds Whose ball And its going to be Montana basketball with 141 to go for Montana After this game the Cardinals are free to fly home wherever home would be for every player on the roster Theyre going to be back after Christmas on the 26th And Im sure Pat Kelsey has them getting ready to go through a little bit of a boot camp before ACC played yet cheering And if you hear that round of applause from this Cardinal faithful crowd thats because Pat Kelsey is set to empty the bench Four on the timer Dick for three No good cheering And Kesan Prior comes up with the rebound And he wisely pulls it back out Time out Kelsey calls timeout Entering the game now number 55 in white Spencer Le Number 33 Will Hanky And number four Louisvilles own Cole Sherman Hanky and Sherman both Louisville natives As a player you always love to see the walkons get in especially you want to see them get a puckering Heres Sherman Not shy The rebound to leg under the basket Sherman again Yes Here we go Cole Sherman had six points total coming into this game Hes got three now You know Ive got to point out Grant Kleys energy His energy has been consistent this entire game Im rooting for this team Well Hanky on the score sheet grabbing the rebound OH THE DIME AND HANKY PAYS it off All the ends of the benches getting involved and the crowds on their feet They love it Another rebound this time for Hanky again And theyll dribble it out Success all around for Pat Kelsey and the number 11 Louisville Cardinals They take care of business and
