itll be Matt Zona up against Davon Ellis for the tip both of these teams coming in at two and two he mentioned the overtime victories noted aame over Oklahoma State and Maryland Eastern Shore over Penn and the Hawks win the tip and that was right at the buzzer fores one of the biggest wins for head coach Jason Crafton in his career absolutely hes rebuilt this program hes takes on programs that struggle and hes done an incredible job there 18 wins last year their best winning percentage in a long long time 40 years Deontay Johnson under five on the timer top of the key three follows from hubad well he said who shoots the ball the best going to win this game and I more when you get a big stepping out knocking in threes early that gives your team a lot of confidence you wouldnt have expected that 0 for five on the season before making that three and now a turnover from Notre Dame as you took a quick look at Notre Dames starting five same lineup as the last game for the Irish as thats off Target from Chase Davis bton you look at this Maryland Easter short team got to tell you one thing youre going to see great defense they led the nation last year trading turnovers yeah and they especially defend well on the perimeter they limit their opponents to 25 from three top 40 in the country in that statistic thats going to win you some games under 10 on the timer for Roker down low Zona off the glass we take a look at the starting five Chase Davis is a player who can really light it up from the outside he really can and so itll be interesting How the Irish defend him at the same time uh due to the portal they brought in a lot of new players upstead again thats what he usually does going inside and what a game he had against pen 22 and 15 yes just a man and he is strong physically when he can step out and shoot a three and then come back inside thats pretty amazing Burton down to Zona and a foul Irish doing a really good job early of trying to establish inside position you know I think thats something that you want to do in the game you want to really establish something in the paint get a couple easy baskets cuz the Irish have struggled early in the first four minutes of games yeah we talked to coach ruberry before this game he said were 0 for four and having fast starts so looking to get a little bit better in that category game against Oklahoma state that was the first time this season that Notre Dame LED at the end of the first half as kesn Nails the three well thats a good feeling when a HomeTown kid comes back home and knocks down that first shot then the butterflies kind of leave and now you just focusing on playing Applause solid Elijah Wilson on the outside guarded by kesn goes over for Ellis sophomore out of Chicago 10 on the timer pull up jumper bounce doesnt fall and rer with a rebound pesi drives instead kicks out Roper three falls again a great drive a great kick out a great look those are the things again a coach has talked about dont let the ball stick keep the ball moving on the offensive end and a good sign for Notre Dame to see those two threes drop they were shooting just 22 on the season coming into this game as that jumper goes Elijah Wilson with his first points and boy did he have a couple of big shots in that win over pen the one to tie yes and then the game winner with n left in overtime rer looking for another one and hes got it wow that was no hesitation whatsoever against the pressure or broke the Press allowed an open three and buried it Johnson over for Davis preseason third Team all MC provides some leadership for this team with a lot of new faces as heres a drive on the Baseline that doesnt fall and Marcus Burton grabs the rebound Is looking to push it up Applause quickly Roper kesn looking for another too strong on that one battle for the rebound and Tay Davis comes away with it Burton lines up a three no good and theres the put back for t Davis wow that was great offensive position got inside you know again thats the easiest way to score in basketball those offensive rebounds sixpoint lead noted aim five for seven from the Music field Ellis in the corner upstead looking for another three that ones offt Target and Burton with the rebound Marcus Burton coming off 20 points in the win over Oklahoma State and hes going to be a person thats going to be constantly attacked physically because he has just led the r in shots taken and scoring 19 and a half points per game he leads all ACC freshman heres Zona driving and puts it off the glass it is great opportunity to go to his left hand and kiss it off the glass as a right ended player you know thats the scaring cour hes going to go right but he went left and was able to score off of it Deontay Johnson hupstead swarms and hes fouled and thatll send us to a break as Marcus Burton picks up the foul Notre Dame was looking for a fast start theyve got it they lead by eight greatness is a feeling and he is going to go Fearless Brotherhood greatness is more than winning the game its changing it touchdown greatness is what we do accomplish Music greatness rated T for Te when did you last really feel something beyond the

slant yes I got it well build it like this perfeto Red Bull gives you Music wings welcome back to purcel Pavilion Notre Dame leads by8 and head coach Micah Shrewsberry of course in his first season and when we spoke with him earlier he told us just how huge that Oklahoma State win was for the belief of this team and you know when you get a young team and first year coach he wanted to look for those nuggets and that was a big nugget to come in and beat Oklahoma State and you know he was telling both of us that you know he has really seen the standard set now they need to meet and match that standard every night out trying to keep it going its been a 70 run for Notre Dame as you take a look at the resume for Micah Shrewsberry so impressive that pen State the job that he did leading the nitty Lions to the Big 10 championship game and then a winning the tournament as well and of course learned from so many Fantastic coaches Brad Stevens Matt painer doesnt get much better than that no hes got I mean hes got a doctorate in the coaches he worked with I mean its pretty amazing the people that he has rubbed elbows Music with itll be Hawks basketball Deonte claxon to inbound the other point guard for the Hawks and hes been in a battle with Deontay Johnson for that starting spot just sense a different focus in the Irish now that theyve come back home upstead had it affected there by kbai but an offensive rebound upstead trying to put it back up unable to save it and the Irish take it back but thats notable Kev the first time hes been on the floor in a Notre Dame uniform yes that is important if youre a notre name follower this is a big key to the team of getting him minutes in back playing again you can still see the wrap on his right hand as Davis fires the three offt Target and the Hawks spring it the other way Chase Music Davis Davis with 16 points in the win over pen there were four different players that had career highs in that game for the Hawks you know theyre new theres a lot of but isnt that amazing to have have four guys have their career games last weekend led to a massive win as theres a nice little move from Claxton offensive rebound hupstead trying to put it back up loose on the floor battle for it Marcus Burton has it for a moment and hes able to get it to ji maybe an opportunity in transition now for Notre Dame but Roper being harassed there by Claxton and its a turnover back toes but Kevin ji we talked about it just so big to have him the transfer from Penn State he really came on near the end of his freshman year and you can see it especially the way he played in the NCAA tournament absolutely hes got the experience that a lot of the players on Nord aame team does not have and you know hes also got the side so now coach shuberry can go with a two big lineup and so he can go with him and booth in the lineup the same time before when you only have two bigs you got have one on the bench One play and so it gives him so many more options as a coach and Coach ruseberry is always all about defense and Kev is AER that they fig to be a kece of the puzzle defensively so its been T to be without him as out of bounds there in a turnover fores also Logan Imes came on one of the other freshmen from zionville Indiana Braden Shrewsberry got Four Freshman on Four Freshman Carrie booth and a sophomore so this is what youre seeing with Notre Dame in their first year under Micah shrewbury so many young players making an impact and theyre theyre going to be building the standards that ning fans will enjoy watching in the future try up top lot of ball pressure Burton trying to bounce past it five on the timer here over to Shrewsberry driving in and he has it Music swatted and this going to have to be a quick out of bounds play here look for a lob if the Irish can get that off in time its point three seconds you see that roster breakdown there so many new faces here in South Ben but the Irish have to get a quick shot away here maybe just a tap and truberry its going to be a shot clock violation thatll give it back toes yeah tough situation with point three theres only going to have to be a a lob and of course defense defensively you know exactly that so its going to be a tough play to get get a good shot there Israel Yao inbounding there sophomore from Guyana as Toby nzi drives doesnt fall and Burton will bring it the other Applause way Burton trying to get it Im stolen by Claxton and deanii Claxton all the way to the bucket doesnt follow the put back neither and a battle for the rebound jump ball possession a arrow goes the way of Notre Dame but coach we talk about changes Jason Crafton he has almost an entirely new group as well but what a coach he is and and what a pedigree he has he learned from Jay wri you know we asked him what whos your Mentor who where did you learn your craft and he said Jay Wright who he worked with vill NOA and you know thats Hall of Fame coach and so you can see it his walk through his demeanor and how hard his players play they they are going to be solid because of his coaching no question about it he was an assistant in the NBA G league with the Delaware Blue coats as Jai tries to back his way in Yao stole it away here come the Hawks turnovers are starting to mount up a little bit for the Irish as that three Falls from Tyler Mack and the Hawks really needed that that ends a scoring drought of over five minutes yes now Notre Dame looks to break a three and a half minute scoring Applause DRFT shuberry on the outside one high low higho look Davis on the drive takes some contact and hes down here head to the free throw line yeah as a coach you just dont want to see anybody go down but uh I think its going to be all right hopefully Davis is all right hell be at the line after this Notre Dame ahead by five in the first half rainx water repellency wiper blades apply the magic of rainex to your windshield so water beads up and flies away the

is always there for the Music taking Maryland Eastern Shore trailing in this one by five we mentioned a little bit earlier though what a season it was last year for Coach Kon and Company 18 wins they led the nation in steals per game and turnovers forced its really amazing you think that hes been able to accomplish you know were looking back the best record theyve had since 7374 in 40 years rebuilding a program that he was sharing with us before like theyre probably the worst program in the country at any level yeah he mentioned that in terms of alltime record theyre definitely near the bottom but he definitely has them on the up and up pick to finish this year fifth in the meak but that was after they had to replace all five starters right and you know he just has that pres about him as as a coach total Optimist were going to get this thing turned around and were going to make it work and thats exactly the program he has created here at EAS Marland short well free throws good there from Tay Davis as there on the drive nzi unable to finish and then Booth was fouled well go on Israel Yao and one of the things I see right now is a coach the length of Notre Dame as people attack the basket there is a lot of length deflecting making people make adjustments as they go to the rim which they havent had in the past Shrewsberry deep three and he rattles it home good to see for Braden Shrewsberry Yes again I think when you see that first one go through as a shooter it just gives you a lot more confidence Yao tries a three and hits Applause it e sh again playing strictly manto man and they really try to pressure the Applause Music perimeter G down low out to booth for three that one short the rebound taken there by Victory neoya sophomore out of Temple Hills Applause Maryland Max tried to kick it back out this will be back court violation theyll just let it go out of bounds and a turnover over to Notre Dame you know as a coach you want to get your Shooters off to bit start so youre going to see young freshman just getting a good open look and you know thats whats going to happen but you know they matched right back up and came right back here good penetration good kick in the game of college basketball just like the NBA is becoming a threepoint shooting contest in a lot of ways well the surprising thing coach three threes for Maryland easternshore but you didnt expect one to come from Israel Yao and Troy hupstead a couple of The Bigs knocking down the threes no I mean thats not a SC report thats that frustrates coaches when they say hey this wasnt in the report Whats Happening Here Notre Dame has to get a shot away Imes with a teardrop off the glass at in great attack the basket and great awareness of knowing how much time he had and had to put it up quick Logan Imes another one of those instate products from zionville the Indianapolis area Elijah Wilson off his foot it will be Notre Dame basketball as we take another look back at this floater by Logan eyes yeah you know just attack the basket he knows he doesnt have much time notice he puts it up soft off the glass you know I think the glass is the players friend and the young people out there you can use the backboard its going to help you knock in more shots Marcus Burton bringing up the floor there still without a point Dame hasnt needed him though with a ninepoint lead I think thats a good sign they dont want to lean on him too much no especially as a freshman yes rer tried to get it to Zona off his hand and that says a lot L about Burtons game too hes not forced anything underneath the reverse lay in Devon Music Ellis came over from Fair State Community College to link prep as well originally from Chicago J has a lot of family here absolutely pretty quick drive just about an hour and a half yeah you know what thats like I do absolutely got out of town before Thanksgiving Rush yeah you got to beat that rush around Chicago yes Im really impressed with the crowd here tonight I think when you local players you know you know the students are on break but you have a lot of local players Indiana people and thats going to bring a lot of Indiana people just to be here to watch the games roper in the corner left it short offensive rebound Zona out of FAL call I think he got his left arm in there pushed off to create space first foul on Matt Zona its been a pretty clean half so far you know you havent seen a whole lot of fouls havent seen a lot of turnovers and I think that just gives the player sense a better flow of the game so absolutely you know you watch games sometimes with whistles blowing a lot players never can get in a flow that was just the second foul on Notre Dame four so far ones both teams are playing really hard Music Applause defensively Davis the outside try to kick it out another turnover back to Notre Dame yeah Jr kades had a great deflection there he got his hands on the basketball deflected it off and its Irish basketball well that intensity is what coach shuberry is looking for from JR kesn he mentioned there was a 5050 ball in that Western Carolina game he wasnt able to get to but in the Oklahoma State game he did get that tie up in overtime that was huge for Notre Dame yeah and the one possession one possession can determine a ball game and it may not have been in the last 30 seconds you know so you got to win every possession one possession at a time and by doing that you win the game five on the shot clock good cut by Burton the kick out Shrewsberry Corner three he hits it plus the foul oh my goodness that is a great penetration not too many point guards can find that man and make that kick out freshman The Freshman thats a connection Notre Dame fans are hoping to see for years to come

prove it tow hitches of the world prepare for Music Glory what a start to this game its been for Braden Shrewsberry a new career high for him with 13 points came in averaging five and a half per game and Coach really I think it was just a matter of him hes got to keep shooting from the outside hes a shooter and he started to get hot yeah Shooters shoot and I think theres been some pressure on him as a freshman coming in thats the coach everybody knows that high expectations but now I think by coming off the bench hes maybe relaxed just a little bit kind of saw the game game caught up with him a little bit then he exactly responded well from it Hees cant hit the three tapped around and taken there by Wilson Toledo transfer Mack Qui airball another opportunity though as Wilson grabbed the rebound Dame defense has been St o a little miscommunication and that hit a fan straight on hopefully theyre all right there yeah we thats the danger there hes good hes good hes good I think hes all right you know looks like hes got a little bit of hair or something to protect him there but you got to be ready you always got to be your hands ready you know like a baseball game you got to know when those fall balls are coming best seats in the house but the most dangerous seats in the House another kick out hes going to hit this one nope not that time time and a Music foul that one going on Kevin ji you know I think theyre going to look at the stat sheet at halftime theyre going to see that is Marcus Burton we shut him down but you know Marcus Burton has distributed the ball tonight and said you know what if youre going to take away my points Im going to distribute and make passes and so that tells you what type of kid he is hes going to say whatever it takes to win games is really what hes all about four assists also five rebounds as that Runner was short from Wilson going to reach in foul going on Music Yao as a basketball coach you dont want to foul 90 ft away from the basket you know I think thats and now youre putting somebody at the free throw line thats dead deadly from the free throw line so you know uh when things are getting bad they go worse when youre fing 90 ft away from the basket and Marcus Burton at 90 on the season season of course hit some clutch free throws in overtime against Oklahoma State as well yes him and kesn win noted Dame needed those clutch free throws they hit him he makes the front end the one and one you know it was interesting at the end of shoot around today they were playing a little game with the free throws we thought maybe Marcus Burton would win it uh it was not Marcus Burton it was JT Kelly one of the WalkOns who won the free throw shooting competition at the end of shoot around yes it was interesting to watch that that was great contest where you know the players had to make a shot if they missed they were done and so uh isolated down to a lot of the the WalkOns were dominating at the end and uh you know who was excited the the team was excited for the WalkOns and a walkon winning the free throw shooting contest yeah it was a lot of fun but it was surpris Marcus Burton was out maybe after three rounds I thought he was going to make it near the end but he only he only makes him win the TV CR but thats the time that really counts hes done hes done very well this year at that making both there its a 70 run a 142 extended run for Notre Dame pushing the lead up to 19 good switch out underneath Mack Baseline jumper blocked by IMs I am really impressed with the nordan Music defense oer with the hand off to Music booth good patience Burton shot clock under 10 elbow jumper too strong the Hawks need a bucket Mack looking for it cant hit the three and Roper nearly had it poked away Notre D moving in transition Roper to booth for the twohanded Applause slam again a veteran guard taking the ball down the floor not in a hurry letting the spacing take place and a great great find and great flush 90 run its been a scoring drought of 4 and a half minutes fores step back jumper Ellis boy did they need that that they need that was bad were talking about a team that just came off a big win against pen so this is a team thats got a lot of ability Burton down the lane high off the window doesnt get the roll under a minute to go in this first half and a timeout yeah you know when you want to get the ball down the floor I think the key is advancing the ball keeping your head up now he looks to his left then he looks to his right and if I had somebody to throw it to I think going by the 610 guy you know that can flush it so that was a great decision then a step back three and again those are the things that uh bar E from Shore needs to be able to do a lot more out here and in the last minute of this half and then the entire second half theyre going to have to shoot the ball a lot better especially trailing by 18 here this is a team that came into this game shooting the three at just 29 of the Season theyve actually been shooting it really well from outside four for nine problem is theres been turnovers and overall 28 so they havent been scoring in the paint no i really been impressed n Dames length uh is impressive they can put a a group of people out there now that has a lot more length than they had earlier in the year and so when you add length you add make it tough to score inside and thats exactly what youve seen with Maryland Easter sh Ellis has it stolen by Roper head for Burton tried to kick out there looking for maybe KES and its a Music turnover these last two possessions I think are going to be very important you can build that lead you can get up into you know double it or again if you knock down a three here get back into a little momentum at halftime there was kichi oaro who just came on for the first time but Devon Ellis getting another bucket there one shot here coach shuberry will take a time out try to draw up a play here but we talked about Notre Dame had not been able to get out to a fast start theyve done it tonight their season high in the first half no you know again thats something that uh the coaching staff has really spent time on how do we get off to a better start and you know uh its its variables the free game how they look at things uh the Scout reports uh prepractice plans all those go in the impact but it really comes down to players Focus you know are they focused when the ball goes up are they ready to respond today was one of those games where immediately they came out with a lot of energy a lot of focus has carried on now for the full 20 Music minutes Notre Dame getting it done on the offensive and defensive end hit a cold spell here one of their last seven but still shooting 48 in this first half yeah you as a coach youre looking at the scoreboard and youre saying wow weve given up 22 points in 20 minutes you got to be happy no matter what you got to be very happy about your defense an opportunity to get over 40 in this first half look for a high ball screen here there it comes thats it from from Shrewsberry and Burton waits in traffic wow they play on nearly stolen by kesn puts it up at the horn off the back of the backboard and thatll do it for the first half one of the best halfs of the year for Notre Dame they lead it by six rebounds four assists you take a look at the game samary statistics really controlled by Notre Dame and then Burton gets going of course start the second half again I think they hear us I think they hear us and once you mention their name then they score a bucket so eight points for him now heres hupstead and it off to Ellis dribbled off his foot Elijah Wilson down the lane I should say six points for Burton yep uh gave him two more too early yeah but you know hes got a streak here of you know D getting double figures to the Freshman thats thats pretty impressive what hes been able to do and uh you know if he keeps that streak going hes going to be in some Elite company and you can see hes scored in double digits twice in the second half as hupstead comes away with a steal drives all the way and hes fouled by kesn yeah one of those lazy passes but you have to give credit we we talked about the pressure that Maryland Eastern Shore puts on people and youve got to snap those passes any la pass got to get Music deflected so its upstead at the line for two 9 for 17 at the charity stripe on the season Troy hupstead played at Penola College came over toes he said his favorite quote is work like a peasant live like a king I really liked that I I didnt see who was attributed to and I was searching all over I couldnt find out who it was but whoever came up with that its a great quote a great quote absolutely and his work ethic is very very good hes got a high engine he plays hard plays Focus Roper couldnt hit there Chase Davis switch out for the guards for Notre Dame Johnson good attempt on the Baseline it will be Notre Dame basketball last touch there by Ellis yeah thats a frustrating situation when you see these turn turnover starting to mount up here you know um I got him for 12 turnovers thats way too many in this type of a Music game came into this game averaging just over 11 per game Zona for three and he hits it what a great addition when you can have a big that can step out and hit threes consistently Notre Dame has a couple of those bigs that can do that at Zona with seven points on the N upstead double teamed Davis tough shot doesnt Applause fall again a great defensive effort by nor Dame of half Music court Sona up top again working against hupstead and a lot of pressure on the perimeter kesn drives Baseline kicks out Davis open three thats short Wilson and a block there Tay Davis ends up in the hands of hupstead skip pass across for Ellis against kesney nice drive really strong move to the basket again able to kiss it off the glass which is a big Advantage when youre driving on the right side like that Devon Ellis the first player fores in double figures with 11 heres Davis driving all the way to the hoop takes some contact hell head to the line for Music two yeah know you cant keep a great player down very long theyre going to find a way to get their hands on the basketball but heres a good drive look at that thats just a great drive and he was able to attack and use the backboard and thats what you got to do youve got to be able to use the backboard on that shot or its not going to go in well we mentioned earlier this is a team that lost five starters from last year so theyre still trying to find out who are our scores who are leaders and so far early in the season it seems like Devon Ellis is one of those players yes you know he he looks like hes already confident but again it takes time for a team playing together to get a feel for everybody else whos what shots are looking for where at on the floor all those are important part of developing a teamwork no seniors on the roster and I feel like seniors are even more important when youre a smaller program yes you see a lot of upsets in college basketball when you see older players playing for their third fourth and fifth year Well Notre Dame dealt with it earlier this year Western Carolina very experienced team that came in here and took down Notre Dame as you take a look at Jason Crafton continuing to build up this program at Maryland Eastern Shore well one thing about this program they are going to play hard all the way through so its not going to be a situation were going to throw in the towel they will continue to play as hard as they can and thats a reflection of the coaches and the coaching staff just the the mentality is were out here to play extremely hard for the full 40 minutes and were not going to let one possession go by without total effort as Deontay Johnson sinks both free throws the sophomore from the Bronx attended the Patrick School in New Jersey you heard of that one coach that school out there I have not heard of that well some of their alumni Kyrie Irving oh thats pretty Michael kid Gilchrist oh wow yeah not too bad no thats a who whos right there definitely one of the more wellknown programs in that state Music yes foul there win on Elijah Wilson his second of the night second team foul ones in the second half as heres Burton underneath the basket just got an amazing Knack of I guess you would call um body development where he can just maneuver his body and get in there and finish baskets its a unique Knack that he Music has Davis deep three he can hit those but not that time kzne fights to keep the rebound up ahead to Burton Marcus Burton looking for two more and hes got him into double figures become a little bit more assertive on the offensive Bend here in the last three or four possessions 10 points six rebounds four assists for Marcus Burton its a pretty good line Ellis now Johnson spinning his way blocked by Applause Zona now Burton for three offt Target Wilson brings it the other way for the Hawks around a screen just inside the threepoint line as kesn Rises for the rebound another rebound you can see again his length helps him on the on the boards and that just makes everybody better Zona down the lane cant quite finish upand will bring it ahead there Deontay Johnson under 15 minutes to go in the second halfes on another cold streak nearly three minutes without a m field goal again I give n Dame a lot of credit defensively for that HS stead knocks down his second three of the night he said I did that start the game and uh it worked then so I guess well try it again nine points for Troy hupstead and that stopped the you know really a drought that uh they were struggling with HS for Davis turns it over out of bounds itll go back toes it was a cold streak there for the Hawks knocked out a three Notre Dame still leads by 18 with 14 to go in South Music P every year as I carve the annual holiday nut balll I remember a time before people had it to gather around what oh Im hilarious sometimes togetherness is as easy as a nut ball sometimes with Duracell holiday magic comes easy enjoy it while it lasts because in the

in high school Indiana Mr basketball and that says a lot Indiana Mr basketball is a special person special Legacy and he brought that back to Northern Indiana which hasnt happened in a long time but his numbers were just incredible coached by a Hall of Fame coach Al Road and so the transition from from high school to college has went a lot faster because of of his background and his play the alltime leading scorer in St Joseph County which is a pretty impressive accomplishment as hupstead cant finish offensive rebound once again rolled over the rim by nzi yeah we talked about that about three or four minutes ago theres not going to be a a quit and this team theyre going to continue with grind continue to defend and rebound definitely exemplify that right there and this is a challenge for the Nord Dame young players too is this a time when theyre going to step on the throat as You say and say were going to put this game away right nowes with nine offensive rebounds saw a couple on that possession nice dish down for J thats got to feel really good for him too now getting back into the flow of things after a you know preseason an injury his first points of the Season hupstead again are you kidding me he was 0 for five coming into the night hes hit three threes coach shry was even talking to him like this is not on the scou report you have not made a three all year and now you make three three for four yes Zone first Zone look here see how Notre Dame handles it need to get the ball inside rer on the Baseline kicks out Shrewsberry extra pass for Imes and he knocks down the three incredible ball movement against the Zone just like you would script it got the ball inside inside out made the extra pass and had a wide open look Yao driving hard and ji comes away with a rebound little bit of contact there with hupstead at the end but they play on disadvantage right here hes ji shrewbury in the corner good decision adoi harassing him and it ends up being stolen for a moment a foul call will send us to break and Logan Imes knocking down the three noted Dame shooting it well from the outside tonight the Irish ahead by 18 on their home floor looking to celebrate

Hawks continue to battle hard and this is a school that has really notable alumni NFL Hall of Famer Art Shell Clarence Clemens are you a big Bruce Springsteen fan of the East Street Band I didnt think he came from thats amazing the Bruce came from there Well Clarence Clemens that is the saxophone player and youll hear him a lot during the Christmas season because of course you know Bruce Springsteen asked if he needs the new saxophone Art Shell Oakland Raiders days I believe and actually UMES had a great football history they dont have a football program anymore but in Super Bowl 3 they had five players in the Super Bowl between the Jets and the Colts the famous Joe Amoth guarantee game as Max 3 doesnt fall this guy does his research let me tell you you find out all the little tidbits but thats a thats a great one there great post up inside great back door cut heres Roper shot clock under 10 well see J for three he hits it in the corner you know I think right now he can he can shoot the ball better than pass the ball and just looking with the pading on his hand but we were watching in pregame he shot the ball so well and thats a good sign to knock in that three short jumper good off the window from nzi and when were looking at uh another Dame right now the bench has become very solid that he can play you know nine players and thats so important especially with young players as a coach you got to play young people so theres a reach in F and de boy another look at that three from John just very confident knocking into three coach shpr brought that Philosophy from Penn State you know the knock in to three is a big part of the game and so if you watch them in threee game youre watching in practice they get up a lot of shots 10 threes tonight for Notre Dame much better than theyve been at the start of the Season heres another guy that can shoot it carry Booth yes he can for Applause three 11 for 23 from Beyond The Arc and thats so important for this young team if they can knock in Perimeter shots thats going to open up the driving lane for Burton and so its everybody hitting them really makes a big difference ntozi with the lob for Yao nearly at the alleyoop that would have been one amazing dunk that would have been on Sports Zone yes Claxton hasnt stolen by Burton and Marcus Burton is blocked on the other end good recovery there by Boya now the Hawks in transition Claxton doesnt fall little bit of up and down Pace right now for both teams yeah we havent seen this too much tonight no and now Notre Dame will slow it down a bit in the half court you know the key has been the team that creates turnovers has not been able to do it tonight against the Irish well the clocks Frozen right now but the bucket will count for Notre name Tay Davis theyre going to have to adjust that clock issue Im not sure if the officials or players have noticed it yet youre the only one in the arena that has recognized there it goes oh now its moving but theyre going to have to yeah take down some seconds as theres a little Runner and that goes there from nzi I really and honestly do not think anybody no I dont think anyone noticed it it and it was uh 10 12 second maybe 15 maybe the whole possession almost the clock did not move heres a steal for Yao is ya trying to go all the way out of bounds itll be Notre Dame basketball but we saw that near alleyoop I was actually looking on YouTube at Israel Yao hes from Guyana theres a great video he had an absurd dunk I mean he took off from about the free throw line dunked over a guy in a gym in Guyana and people were going nuts its a great if you if you have a chance to look it up definitely check out Israel Yaos highlights on YouTube well again hes one thats going to continue to get better and understand the game as Burton veteran move right there off the window veteran as a freshman veteran move as a freshman 12 points for him now noted aim six of their last seven from the field Claxton with the runner again this is a this is a a setup that M Dame has here of oh my Roper with the law Booth cant finish but there are so long with this lineup kesn no and Yao grabs the rebound you have a lot of length out there especially in the defensive end that really contests everything poked away Burton with the dish for kesn Southbend connection for two and thatll send us to a break

theres heavy duty DNA H DNA its engineered into every aspect of the GMC Sierra HD with the pulling power to prove it tow hitches of the world prepare for Glory my name is Willie Wonka Im something of a magician and chocolate maker hes good too good you should stand up to those buddh we give them the old one too I got an idea where do we start every good thing started with a dream so you hold on to yours I guess its time to change the world Wonka rated PG only in theaters December 15th welcome back to pcel Pavilion again Im darra mabery and I was just listening into Jason craftons huddle despite being down by 26 late in the second half he is still coaching his team every single possession he emphasized getting a stop a score and a stop and to just control what they can control he said dont worry about the refs its a tough to play in youre playing an ACC team and he just kept reminding his team to do the little things and stay positive as they keep looking to chip away in this second half thanks Dara and thats definitely the right mentality to have you said it earlier coach this is not the type of team that youd expect to quit even down 26 absolutely and again uh every opportunity you have as a player to get better you have to look forward to it and I see a new player out there we have not seen on the floor in a long time see Mr Sanders out there yeah Tony Sanders Jr getting an opportunity as theres a turnover senior out of Miami hasnt played yet this season and you know you look at that theres a senior getting an opportunity to play and he has been loyal to the program when a lot of people could have jumped out of the portal I look at him and say hey Im here to get my nan degree and uh thats thats a tribute to the type of person he is not sure if there was another yep there was another clock adjustment there wow weve had a lot of clock I was wondering I didnt say anything because but I said how could they have added time if the clock was stopped so now I I think weve got it all in order I we got it all right sometimes if youre you know Eastern Shore right now you might think lets get the clock moving yeah it can be difficult when youre facing a big deficit yeah but theyre going to play through it not anymore no more hopping Im doing good heres kesn on the Baseline fallway Music Applause jumper again youre getting great play from not only the starters but the bench tonight and that is going to always help as you get into the ACC you know conference play youve got to have more than five you got to have eight guys all on the same page and thats what coach Shrewsberry wants to build is that depth and you talked about Tony Sanders Jr staying with the program and Coach Shrewsberry talked about that a lot earlier in the season is that you know these players had a choice the ones that were here yep whether to stay or go and Tony Sanders Jr one of those players that believed in coach Shrewsberry yes wanted to finish his Notre Dame degree as well and gets rewarded here with an opportunity to get on the floor we need more young men like that that say you know what its not about me transferring someplace to to get maybe a few more minutes I I value the degree Im going to get the portal has kind of created a situation where you have people just you know getting in a portal and a lot of them dont have any place to go once they uh get in the portal as IMS is blocked from behind and Shak violation will give it toes another great example right there youre playing youre down but youre still playing extremely hard you get a shot clock violation havent seen too many of those for the Irish all all night yeah that was a really good defensive possession from the Hawks heres hupstead Davis hand in his face but he hits the jumper first points of the night for Chase Davis and thats certainly hurt the Hawks he came in as their leading scorer with 13 and a half a night Lord Dames done a really good job of finding him you know this is an interesting lineup right now without Marcus Burton at the point you know now youre going to have a variety of different people handing the ball and no matter what theyre going to be Music freshman Booth J Sanders shuberry and Imes in the game for Notre Dame Hees and shury of course Au teammate so they know each other very well under 10 on the timer good pass inside ji backing his way in the hook shot goes I dont need my right hand I got that lefthanded hook jump hook down weve seen knocked down the three we see some nice post moves right there good to see if youre an Irish fan have to be excited to have him back yes uh he just adds another dimension for the team and as I mentioned before it just gives a coach a lot more options when you only have two bigs to work with then youre limited so you have one setting and one playing but right now hes got two bigs on the floor and so Booth can go out where he feels comfortable at the threepoint line and of course then youve got youre big inside so uh its more of a 41 Music look it definitely gives Notre Dame a lot more options for Coach Shrewsberry and and he was the most excited of course mentioned about what ji does on the defensive end of the floor and you know its not just being a shot blocker rim protector but hes very very vocal if youre close to the floor hes constantly talking like a quarterback out there letting his teammates know where he is and where the screens are coming coming from you know thats one of a skill set thats so important in college basketball being able to talk both offensively and defensively to your teammates upstead hitting the second free throw there good night for him as Booth up the top of the key three short but hupstead with 13 points nine rebounds close to a double double hes had a great night and hes a player that came into this game averaging a double double but Notre aame well on the their way the Irish leaded by 25 on their home floor youre about to go viral

points for Tony Sanders Jr of the Season we see a couple of WalkOns getting ready to come in for Notre Dame they added five to the roster so important you know a lot of people dont realize what is a walkon he is a person who coming every day to practice to make his teammates better to know the opponents as best as he can as Alex Wade had it Stripped Away started his career as a walkon earned a scholarship prior to this season as Jai comes away with the board Booth with a turnover and thatll give the opportunity for some of those WalkOns to check into the game well get to see them after this

upcoming schedule pretty tough going at South Carolina in the ACC SEC Challenge and then at Miami one of the preseason favorites in the ACC yeah thats thats a daunting schedule and then you look at Marquette who lost a tough game uh in Hawaii against Purdue by three points so theres going to be some tough ch challenge to the head for this young team yeah thats on the road at Marquette that is going to be a real Challenge and Georgetown as well good to see some of those former Rivals for not today back on the schedule yes isnt that for for somebody that has not seen those two teams match up thats good for those institutions Catholic schools playing against each other and uh you know theres a lot of history behind those uh rivalries yeah back in the old Big East some of those battles the Chase Davis look at to complete the threepoint play hes been pretty quiet Music tonight Deon claxon comes back on fores full court pressure still heres Wade head for Raheem Bron another local product from South Ben has it stolen away for a moment n doy with the dish for okaro focus on getting the ball over half court here got a lot of WalkOns on got PE people open here need to set it up and just run some Applause offense rating out of Mishawaka High School the caveman yes one of the great nicknames in high school sports three on the shot clock Bron with the jumper no and heres Yao running the other way right back to him hes fouled hell head to the line for two yeah another great story of a local young man who comes here Notre Dame a walk on and uh again these guys come to practice every day theyve got to know the opponents uh offensive sets uh they go to class like everybody else and uh you know this is a goal time for them to have the opportunity to play as I look at the schedule theres not going to be a whole lot of time these guys can get actually on the court yeah and you talk about being a student Raheem Braden his plans after he graduates from Notre Dame to attend medical school so you know hes very serious about his studies yes how many WalkOns in the country do you have thats going to go to med school after uh after graduation that is not easy having to deal with the MCAT everything that goes with that its a big challenge so credit to him and credit to coach shury allowing these kids these minutes to play yeah good moment its Thomas Crow underneath pops out into the corner haton for three and he swishes it Thomas Hatton his first career points and the bench erupted heres Yao spinning Wade running ahead the other way into the opposite corner that three doesnt go they were looking to Hatton again oh thats special to get your name in the book nerd a book by hit the three doesnt go there from nzi fores they certainly showed the resolve in the second half trying to hang tough in this one but for the most part its been all noted Dame tonight it has and theyve done a great job of controlling things the starters came out and established the threes you know and so it became contagious so once everybody starts hitting and the bench comes in and starts hitting them so hats off to this great pass here a great feeling for that young man at Thomas hat in a great story he didnt even start playing basketball competitively until high school and here he is knocking down a three AT purcel Pavilion yes great moment for him well thats a great Thanksgiving
