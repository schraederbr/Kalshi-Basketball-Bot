this week Wake Forest will visit this weekend NC State opening up its ACC Golden State Road Trip theyll finish it out on the farm at Stanford on Saturday night Roger SS AJ desde chance more your officials as we play ACC after dark in Berkeley youre going to see Cal looking to go inside the paint as much as they can post touches drives and theyre excellent getting to the free throw line Elon blackshire misses the midrange jump shot Here Comes Marcus Hill and NC State this is a veteran NC State team top seven in the rotation all seniors or graduates and thats what reflects in the starting five this is interesting right away first possession Cal goes into a Zone as it is NC State has a bit of a hard time scoring the ball this year Zone might St him a little bit more oh M Soko crashing into the camera people along the Baseline as California turns it over youre seeing this halfcourt zone defense for Cal and then as they pushing the ball off the floor they turn it over now coming back here NC States now having to force face a fullcourt press into the half court Zone first points of the night belong to Dantes Styles the Georgetown transfer averaging a little more than 10 points per game hes been at his best his last couple of games 24 points over the weekend at home against Clemson a starting five for Cal all five of these guys new comers to the program in Mark madsons second season Wilkinson almost elevated off the hardwood shot clocks down to five picked up by Taylor and he misses his first attempt Soko fouled it will stay here with California that was a big concern for Kevin Keats when we talked to him at shootaround trying to box out mty Soko on the inside well its an issue I mean NC State is not a good rebounding team this year when you look at Cal though theyre one of the best rebounding teams in the ACC as far as offensive rebounds are concerned theyre first in the league about 13 and 1 half per game Buras petritis the air force transfer in his first season with the Bears pass the double clutch powered it up and missed it defended tightly by Styles another rebound for Marcus Hill I think coach Keats would like to see NC State push the ball see if they can get some buckets before cows defense is set thats important cows a pretty good defensive team so we got to try to make sure they dont get in their half court solid de jump shot pops out for Styles hes attempted all three shots here at the outset for NC State C trying to bounce back after a loss here at home against Syracuse ninepoint defeat here Saturday night DJ Campbell picked up by okono the right hand flip off the front rim Golden Bears have missed their first four attempts Jaden Taylor fires a three and Soko as he falls to the floor gets it away to Jeremiah Wilkinson The Freshman knifing inside and couldnt finish it hes getting there right and thats the thing about wikinson the Freshman there is there is no doubt he has a lot of confidence in himself to make shots now hes not a good shooter from a percentage standpoint but hes streaky and the young man can score oh middle Brooks had a step P trus came away from behind to take it away Wilkinson sets up from the corner and buries the three thats what Im saying a freshman who has the courage to shoot the ball almost every time he touches it Wilkinson buried three triples had 11 points in the first meeting in Ry last month just two for 13 from the outside over the weekend here against Syracuse but knocking down his first threepoint attempt tonight Marcus Hill to the Baseline stops and starts tried to wrap it in and a late whistle for a foul its on jovon blackshire and Marcus Hill who was a big time scorer more than 20 a game at Bowling Green last season will shoot the first free throws of the night in Berkeley yeah Marcus Hill has been a bright spot for this NC State team this year you know hes listed at 64 but hes more like 6 6 one and not afraid at all to get inside the paint plays the Ang Les really well in the low post scores with contact gets to the free throw line as we just saw here spent two seasons in junior college at a high school before an allconference run in the Mac last year and a nice Ovation for Andre sto yakovich making his first appearance over the last five games theyve been out with flu like symptoms for one of the games and been dealing with a bad hip ever since last time he played was actually at NC State those five games ago where he had 10 points and five boards St yakovich spent last season at rival Stanford averages almost 19 a game top five scorer in the Applause ACC Wilkinson and sto yakovich on the floor together Andre nearly turned it over blackshire recovers again the shot clock into single digits for the Bears black drives and kicks its Wilkinson On Target from the outside thats a terrific play all the attention on Wilkinson the drive and the kick two trays early for Jeremiah Wilkinson Hail to the glass had it knocked loose and fouled again a Soko picking up his first foul second on California and So Cal takes a 64 lead here to our first stoppage at 1543 uh the first half clock Applause Applause Music time for the start lets take a look at the video Bo to see about area recers I dont know Applause Miss Music Music Music Music Applause Music like Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music all right from blackburg to Berkeley we welcome you to late night ACC hoop Southwest the California Golden Bears NC State wolf pack squaring off for a second time this season inside hos Pavilion glad youre with us alongside the former college basketball coach Richie Schuler Im Chris Sylvester big news for Cal tonight they welcome back their leading scorer Andre sto yakovich who had missed the last four games but the story continues to be the Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson who had been averaging more than 20 a game in his absence and hes got the first six points tonight I hes been terrific hes averaging 13 and 1 12 points per game he doesnt have a great shooting percentage but he does get hot as we just witnessed him make his last two threepoint shooting attempts absolutely no fear for the 10th best leading score as a freshman in division one right now Marcus Hill at the free throw line for NC State out of the timeout wolf pek trying to snap a sixgame skid tonight Golden Bears beat NC State in Raleigh 18 days ago 6562 a tight contest at the Lenovo Center and were all tight at six here here its been 4 and 12 minutes in its been fun to see the contrasting Styles mantoman defense from NC State Cal came out with a Zone press a two3 Zone on their end of the floor this is Lee Dort Off the Bench missing his first attempt Ismail Duff has checked in for NC State wolf pack without Brandon Huntley Hatfield on this trip the Louisville Transfer stayed home in North Carolina so here now you have Cal theyve switched over to a manto man coming out of the timeout it was all zone for the previous four and a half minutes Hill goes right at sto yakovich and nice defense applied by Cals leading Applause score Cal known for getting a lot of points at the free throw line scoring the ball inside the paint matter of fact 75 of their points come from the stripe or inside the paint in some capacity embodies the physicality of their seconde head coach Mark adson do yakovich backing in the Freshman Parker and misses his first attempt Dort had it for a moment but its slapped Away by Hill one thing about this NC State team is they dont have that primary score and often times they have to rely on four or five players to score in double pids to have a chance to win as they have struggled to score this entire season not a team that turns it over very often in fact theyre the best in the ACC at not turning over the basketball 15th best in the country they average only 9 and 1 half turnovers a game Wilkinson with a step through and the Finish hes got all eight for Applause Cal Jeremiah Wilkinson at averaged 21 a gam since his insertion into the starting lineup at a 30 piece here late last month against Miami and its hit three of his first five shots to give the Golden Bears an early twopoint lead Parker connects on the elbow jumper who said the midrange game was gone some people like to play Just layups and threes I love the midrange Trey Parker truth rash from fville North Carolina had a 15point game at Duke early last week St yakovich Wheeling hanging and missing I tell you theyve got to find a way to get sto yakovich emerged back and this is terrific for NC State turn your defense into offense on the other end barely any Defenders back on D and just a contested layup that went in nice crossover from blackshire and he draws contact on the attempt thats where NC State also excels Richie they tops in the ACC at almost 15 fast break points per game well look at this right here so yakovich I I think C needs to find a way to get him back into the offensive flow after missing four games but then its just a rebound and a layup down on the other side for Trey Parker Parker providing some instant offense for Kevin Keat four quick points Off the Bench as jovon blackshire watches the first to two free throws settle in and that shot for sto yakovich goes down as a Miss field goal attempt but its almost like an opportunity its almost like when you turn the ball over and you go the other way and thats one thing that NC state has been so good at is is forcing turnovers its going to be a challenge for Cal to control the ball for Cal you know ball control has been a bit of an issue at times in in Achilles heel matter of fact Cal just had had four assists last game for Syracuse know they were not happy with that performance theyve got to do a better job of Distributing that ball and scoring its Brion pass missing from the outside lead Dort claims it for California TS on the board inside of 13 minutes opening half in Berkeley Campbell finds blacksher and he buries the corner three five straight for jovon blackshire Parker from Up top almost answered back but it wiggled out rebounding is going to be a big big key in this contest cow the best offensive rebounding team in the ACC an area where NC State struggles a Applause bit late in the clock heres DJ Applause Campbell black shirt teas a contested three off the side of the iron dof has his first rebound first season the denc state for the big man after playing a couple of Collegiate seasons in Canada Parker misses this midrange doof had it for a moment knocked Away by Applause blackshire I love how they get the big men involved for C ball goes inside dor gets to go to work great wing span by say that French name doof D doof again seeing the increased minutes because of the absence of Brandon Huntley Hatfield 3on pass passed it out of bounds for an NC State turnover their second of this first half well Joon blackshire with this beautiful threepoint shot I thought it was a great setup by Campbell lur in the defense and got a wide open threepoint shot in the opposite corner en 4 Applause are ready Music this is the ACC Network late night out Weston Berkeley the California Golden Bears 1310 over NC State 1115 first half and another electric start for the Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson has he not been outstanding look he has three of their four field goal attempts eight of their 10 points that is not a carbon copy that is two different threepoint shots and then top of the key Wiggles his way into the paint gets to the bucket this freshman this young man 61 the combo at a Powder Springs Georgia has been terrific and just three games ago had a 30 piece and an overtime win over MI Miami yeah the 10th highest scoring average among freshman in college basketball and whats remarkable hes won the ACC rookie of the week award twice and when you consider that hes going headtohead with Cooper flag each week to to win it twice already very impressive incredibly impressive now you NC State comes out of the timeout in a two3 Zone A lot of times coaches will do that coming out of timeouts when theyre expecting the offense to try to run a play Christian Tucker floats it inside and Marty Soko crushes it through Tucker excellent Court Vision hes a pass first point guard and to see that at the end of the shot clock is quite quite impressive you mentioned Cal only assisted on four of their field goals Saturday against Syracuse theyve assisted on four of their first five makes tonight Michael okell sticks the midrange jump shot for NC State Im just a big fan of Michael okell hes The Graduate player seems to make a lot of right decisions very very well so now youre seeing NC State didnt come out of that zone theyre going to stay into it here but trust me theyre going to be looking on that backside for that Alle dunk at the end of the shot clock if it happens again Joshua Ola Joseph lost the handle its taken away by Dennis Parker sophomore from Richmond Virginia in his second season with the program was part of that final four team a year ago okell couple X Stanford Cardinal Crossing blades with hean sto yakovich going at Applause it now Taylor up top weaving down the lane left the tear drop short and its vacuumed in by sasoko hell push it Cal likes to push to Tempo scoring about 75 a game Tucker lost it and Dennis Parker fouled near Applause midcourt so as you remember NC State was in the zone end of the shot clock thought it was a great heady play by the backup point guard Christian Tucker to see Dort on the back end excuse me sasoko on the back end unguarded beautiful play great pass and just great communication between two players well that is Christian Tuckers strength was second in the American Conference at five and a half assists per game at UTSA last season Jeremiah Wilkinson checks back in for Cal hes got eight of their first 15 well Connell missed this Applause Music Applause one C five of its first 15 on they send three of those makes have come from the perimeter another bad pass from Campbell taken away by Jaden Taylor Applause neither either team especially NC State I dont feel like they really got into a flow and you know you got to credit C came out in the zone and they switched to a man a great pass up the floor look at that two plus one for Joshua Ola Joseph Cal taking advantage of NC States offensive woes which again has been in Achilles he all season with the fast break numbers arent back Ola Joseph not quite wide open but open enough to get the pass in scoring position and dunk it contested from Golden Gopher to Golden Bear the Minnesota transfer his three double figure scoring games in ACC play his first points tonight I tell you under coach Mark Matson whats his second year for Mark Matson here at Cal it average 742 points per game in these last two seasons the previous six years before coach Matson took over it was 10 points less per game at 64 points per game so here in Berkeley they found an exciting brand of basketball the last couple years future is bright out here for this basketball program Jaden Taylors three pops out Marcus Hil has been so pesky on both sides of the glass tonight and has the second chance points for NC State they need to have that again theyre missing NC State that one scoring punch that can really help them get over the top in some of these Incredibly Close games they have I mean think about they lost Mike James before the season he was the Louisville Transfer they were expecting of him to be a guy that can really score the basketball its been a challenge for him on that side of the flo all year sooko missing on the turnaround Music Applause attempt du out of the shot fake rolling to the cup and lays it in isil Duffs first points off the bench that is a beautiful shot F and we talk about perimeter players doing shot BL fakes how about a 69ine guy inside the high post little shot fake got his defense out of position just one dribble to the hole leire thought about pulling the trigger at the free throw line we see if sto yakovich can get on the board missed his first two attempts takes this one down the lane and goes high off the glass but it comes off the front rim all three of his shot attempts have been so close to dropping too I me youre out for a couple weeks just not quite in the basketball shape you were another Miss from Styles hes opened one for five do yakovich Applause spins Wilkinson directing traffic spoon feeds blackshire look at that and he draws a foul its on Jaden Taylor jovon blackshire will take a couple of free throws on the other side twopoint lead for the Golden Bears in h Pavilion Music want at Applause 4 two Applause Music got an ACC Network mens basketball double header for you next Wednesday it starts with Stanford and Georgia Tech at 7 Eastern then Cooper flag number two from duke post Cal at Cameron Indoor Duke another convincing Victory earlier tonight inside the JMA Wireless Dome over Syracuse twopoint lead for California over NC State 643 on this opening half clock Kevin Keats fresh off that run to the final four last season this is his eighth year at the helm of NC States program mark Madson very much has Cal on an upward trajectory in his second season both been outstanding and I talk a lot about Kevin kes ACC Championship a year ago here at NC State and then they go on to go all the way to the final four whens the last time its been 30 40 years since they did that twice in the same season or both those things in the same season but I know a lot of NC State fans are not exactly happy with the product on the floor this year things are different you know in the old age it was recruit develop and retain in the transfer portal era the era of nil you lose players left and right you talk about NC State they are always right there in close games and eight of their 10 ACC games have been by one possession in the final 5 minutes including four of their eight ACC losses so this team is a different team from last year just like everybodys battling in college basketball but I still think NC State and Cal have two Dynamic coaches were going to have a lot of success at the respective programs even though this years a building year for both of them in the future and Beyond T to shoot for Cal Joshua Ola Joseph elevates for the poster Jam Ola Jo Joseph makes it exciting does he not a couple first half throwdowns for Joshua Ola Joseph call him Jo OJ look look at the I me the defense by Cal I mean scoring and theyre preventing NC State from scoring on the other end but okell loves that midrange spot off the bounce foul on NC State willll give it back to the Golden Bears fifth on the wolf pack this first Applause half so you look here there an excitement exciting play Black just great vision we saw that alley dunk earlier to sasoko now how about this pass to Ola Joseph for the slam look at that thats a beautiful play man I dont know if that was a play or if that was a read either way it was great n see State mixing up their defenses we seen man again weve seen Zone both these teams doing that Cal has three dunks this first half at Applause home sixpoint lead for the Bears Campbell floats it in theres different philosophies when youre in two3 zone as a team some teams like to use the opposite guard to take away the ballside high post if that makes sense in this case they gave it up in it Burt NC State there a little jump shot from the high elbow Styles turns and hits a tough contested jump shot he had missed five of his first six attempts but dant Tre Styles will keep on taking them I mean as he should you know hes last couple games scored 18 points at Duke hit four threes in that game then they go and play Clemson had 24 points there hit six threes the guy that has been really really good for Kevin Keats and Company 61 from the field the last two games look at that yeah those are the top two teams in the conference yeah Wilkinson picked up by Taylor leans in Falls away missed it strong and petritis and styles get tangled up but a foul is called on Reed is petritis Mark Madson is incredulous he felt that should have been a tieup well Reus petritis the fan base here absolutely loves him air force transfer I mean look here I mean look just look how gritty he is look how Scrappy he is hes the guy thats going to be hustle play all the time I mean that play would have been over if he hadnt got his arms in there always putting his body on the line and using that fighting mentality to help out the Golden Bears Taylor wide left NC State settling for a lot of midrange shots and most of them havent gone in blackshire kicks Campbell Applause raises a quick one and done for Cal youre saying Blacks name quite a bit right before guys take shots hes always finding the open Shooters nice touch from Hill to kiss it in off the glass hes got eight here in the opening 20 always like when I see a lefty drive right all the way to the basket A lot of times if youre an opposite hand shooter youre a lefty a lot of times when you drive right you pull up for a midrange youre a lefty your left youll go all the way to the hole and vice versa for righthanders sooko kicks theres black shirt wrap around to Campbell five to shoot DJ lets it Go recovered by Applause Doof Doof for three his first of the Season yes he was 0 for four coming in into this game showing that pretty touch young man from Quebec finesse and its NC States first triple of the game Wilkinson misses from the corner and Hill has it for the wolf peek already his sixth board seven straight for the wolf pack the last two minutes hell had it stripped Wilkinson the Poke away petritis the steel and Blacker the Finish great play by the 67 Wing out of Air Applause Force yeah NC State they dont commit many turnovers just their third of this opening half but Cal able to capitalize on that one they have always prided themselves on taking care of the basketball under Kevin Applause Keats Styles out to okell five on the timer blackshire picks him up okell trying to get to his midrange spot but had it knocked away and fouled As Time expires on the shot clock theyre counting that as a field goal attemp before the expiration sh Shard foul on Jeremiah Music Wilkinson threepoint game here in the final two minutes of the opening half its exciting Applause Applause thats 2 home right now Applause Applause buck 59 on the opening half clock here in Berkeley threepoint lead for Cal over NC State in the Golden Bears have found some easy points at The Rim this first half yeah I want to show this play look at jovon blackshire attacking the high foot on his Defender he gets into the Gap now you look at the defender on the left side of your screen not even looking at his man in the corner hes just staring at the basketball so when black Shir looks to attack youre going to see number one Ola Joseph in the corner back door cut and then black shirts do a good a great job of delivering the ball look defense he been looking at the guy in the corner he gets back doored its just an easy d dunk for the long athlete over top to the helps side Defender jovon blackshire has his fingerprints all over this 26point effort for California so far this first half hes got nine points pair of assists sixth year player spent the last five under Bryce Drew at Grand Canyon Michael okells second season at NC State was an integral piece on that final four run a season to goost been his first three Collegiate Seasons not far from here its for and has a big homecoming game on Saturday inside Maples Pavilion thats going to be pretty special for him right I mean he hes an East Coast guy but hes got certainly a lot of friends still on Applause campus Andre sakovic still scoreless Joon blackshire still on an opening half heater hes got a dozen he deserves that hes been Distributing the ball dropping dimes getting guys good field goal shots finally get one for himself another shot fake to bite and finishes at the glass he is so good at the shot pick he looks like a perimeter player with the ball in his hand that high post or top of the key area shot fade gets his Defenders up onew dribbles gets to the gets to the all way to the hoop isil Duff with seven Off the Bench Wilkinson whips it black Shir in and out NC State touched it last second bite at the Apple for Cal is mon Soko checks back in I have to give a lot of credit to the wolf pack because as weve talked about cow is so good at getting offensive rebounds best in the ACC that is only their second offensive Rebound in this game so far NC state has done a great job of keeping them off the offensive Applause glass final minute of the opening 20 Sky yakovich Baseline picked up by Bryce herd the freshman and connects on the short jumper he needed that miss his previous three shots they got to do everything they can to immerse him back into the flow of offense because he is certainly a weapon for them at 19 points per game sto yakovich third in the ACC Kevin Keats use it or lose it timeout 402 when you come back weve got womens basketball for you every Sunday right here on the ACC Network in the ESPN app this weeks double header features the Commonwealth Clash Virginia Tech and Virginia start us off at noon Eastern then third ranked Notre Dame and Hannah hadalo welcome in 21st ranked California and ioana crele should be another great afternoon of Hoops here on acc network of course thatll lead into the big game yeah do you have the three Pat or do you have the Eagles getting some Revenge I think the three Peak okay I think they have a better quarterback I think they have a great tight end I think their defensive Lines probably better Parker turns thats a tough jump shot relatively early in the clock but NC State grabs a second effort I think saquons going to get it done thats true I mean you have a great running game youre right they do have the better running back the Eagles but Andy Reed off the bye is ridiculous oh hes one of his last 17 one possession games its ridiculous and do we just see a bank threepoint shot did while were talking about the Super Bowl thats Trey Parker using the glass black yes sir at the Music buzzer breaking ankles W decorated college career and putting together his best stretch of basketball in the penultimate month of the Season Marcus Hill gliding inside and Scoops it in for the first points of the second half exactly what exactly what NC State needed right away off the top a layup inside B three rebound shy of a double double seven boards in that first half a really balanced scoring attack usually the games they win they have you know four or five guys scoring in double figures shot clock down to five petritis spins missed it off the front rim eight rebound for Marcus Hill theyre going to keep letting him go nice ball screen just scored a layup a second ago off the side of the backboard this time lets see if Cal tries to impose their presence inside the paint they get it by paint touches like that almost to the paint not quite there or giving it to their big men down inside I think thats one advantage that the Golden Bears have over NC State they I think they have more size more beef more strength down low more of a post playay type team nice play oh my gosh that was wide open beautiful play well DJ Campbell the recipient of a perfectly drawn up inbound pass didnt see a ton of Ben Middlebrooks that first half was sideline with a couple of fouls Hill skips it middle Brooks through the contact and draws the foul its on M Soko I mean really middle Brooks who just got fouled and going to the free throw Lane really the only post that NC state has that that is Beefy kind of like we were talking about some of cows guys hes super physical and lean you know they do have another one in Brandon Huntley Hatfield whos not made the trip as you mentioned earlier in this game but right now Middlebrooks is the one and he was out most that first half as you mentioned yet still the Wolfpack found ways to rebound the basketball and keep Cal off the offensive glass hey our next gymnastics meet right here on AC Network in the ESPN app its Sunday afternoon 24th ranked Clemson takes on number 23 North Carolina coverage begins at four Eastern Middle Brooks had 11 points against K and Raley last month he is an ACC lifer two years at Clemson out of high school now his second year at NC State Wolfpack employee full court pressure I like that I like how they switch defenses anytime a team switches defense on a regular basis throughout the course of a game you make your oppon think and when you can make your opponent think and slow them down you take the athleticism right out of them Campbell misses the flip went high off the glass on the Applause attempt State hasnt LED since it was 108 early Hill underneath mushes it in Marcus Hill having a very productive night in the Bay Area thats what he does man he is known for making difficult shots hes really good assist to turnover like two to one but get this at what 6 one Marcus Hill leads his team in rebounding in ACC play St yakovich scores off the glass well good for him he played about 11 and 1 half 12 minutes in the first half was one of four hes had some big second halfes this season 19 points here in a game against Virginia in the final 20 minutes last month Hill Hits the midrange hes got 14 points and eight boards and six of those here in the second half hes not known to be a shooter so as a Defender youre playing him for the drive and if you leave him that look give him a little bit of space even with a hand there he can surprise you and knock down some of the midrange shots do yakovich Wheeling inside sasoko fouled on the putback attempt now were seeing some here remember NC State was down four at the half now theyve got away and scored some bugget got a layup in the opening possession hell get in the reverse layup and then sto yakovich who weve talked about third leading score in the ACC but been out the last four games finding his stride look at the dribble moves all the way to the basket and can finish with hands in his face sooko the Michigan State transfer rolls in the first and two at line third foul on Ben Middlebrooks storyline to watch down the stretch is the top shot block the ACC and we havent seen him much tonight because of the foul trouble weve been talking about how NC States done a great job of keeping cow off the boards but this here believe believe they got two offensive rebounds alone so you see after made free throws C like to do little Zone press in and you know when you play a two press its not really designed to to to to to force turnovers really designed to slow you down so that when you finally get across half court so much times got off the shot clock its hard to really initiate your offense dant Styles just two for eight from the field tonight P trus from the corner off the front IR Applause iron Taylor with a head of steam going Coast to Coast the Euro Step and the kiss off the glass for Applause two Jaden Taylors First book tonight missed his first four attempts help comes on sto yakovich P trius teardrop perfect try to uh set that up by moving off the ball reading his teammate backto back hits for

Gonzaga over the weekend the officials at that last dead ball or yeah its taking a look at Jaden Taylors longrange jump shot we had called it a three on our telecast but it was rolled a two on the floor and call on the floor stance so NC State two made threes as a team and well the game was tied before Andre sto yakovich put in the goahead free throw well I like the way NC States been playing here in the second half five of seven from the field here since the half begun now up to 45 for the game Hill probing pulls up misses this one off the front rim lead Dort checks back in immediately grabs a Music rebound St yakovich has it knocked away and stolen by Hill Racing to the cup should be go tending that should have been but instead it ricochets Off Taylor NC State bench cannot believe it and the officials will count it yeah I think the angle the officials had they didnt see that but from our angle I dont know about the TV angle I dont know if our audience could have seen that but it looked like it was goaltending the ball was tipped on the way up is the ball on the way up I you cant really see from that angle and I dont I mean what do they call whats the official call theyre not looking at it theyre trying to calm down Mark Madson yeah I think I think that was up against the glass okay stovic touched it all right well so they give two more points to Hill whos got a game high 16 all of the sudden half of those since halftime its I mean look the last eight minutes of play last nine minutes of play now for NC State have been outstanding offensively This Is How They have to play in the road to win now wack have been in California since Monday Wilkinson rejected by Styles you dont see many blocks like that at the threepoint line he didnt just block it out of bounds he blocked it like he was spiking a volleyball look at the athleticism on the shot this is like when youre uh youre youre playing oneonone with your 2yearold son just blocking the shots down yeah first block for NC State tonight late in the clock blackshire trying to create crossover dribble Falling Away does draw Iron but Styles is there to grab the Applause Miss NC state has hit nine of its last 12 from the field Hill stops and starts finally gets rid of it nearly turned it over shot clock into single figures Taylor steps back and misses the three but it ricochets to Styles who skips it to Taylor and its altered inside by Dort a great pass on that back door cut off the offensive Board St yakovich for three they got a dunk here ok conell the hit ahead Hill lays it no he missed it Styles oh extremely G yes the stick back and Mark mson not happy with his teams effort the last couple of minutes takes time out ooy yakovich early in the shot clock took a contested threepoint shot fell to the ground so when you have a long shot you get a long rebound rebound is made and two NC State players are going the other way and thats what were seeing here when they get the Miss layup but there for the cleanup duty is our guy Don TR styles Music Fe begin and NC State fresh off a remarkable run to the final four for the first time since Jim Valvano won the national championship in 1983 won five games in 5 days at the ACC tournament to clinched the conferences automatic birth took out juggernauts Marquette and Duke on the second weekend before falling to Purdue and Zack Edy in the final four but NC State a big program an ACC program but boy they embodied that Cinderella role as the 11 seed last year and took that thing all the way to Phoenix fun to watch wasnt it it was a lot of fun and that man right there named the Clarence big house Gams division one coach of the year theyve now been 500 or better in the ACC also with 20 plus wins in five of The Seven Seasons that Kevin Keats has reigned what a great run hes had so far this year not where he wants to be not where anybody wants to be but it seems to be a oneoff oh MC State trying to snap a six game skid in Northern California tonight Styles pulls up and misses the jumper short its actually the second trip to California this season for the wolf pack played a multiteam event in San Diego back in late November petrius knocks down to three bit of a loose ball left a wide open petritis in the corner I I think when you look at what Cal has done they now have 12 assists to just five turnovers again thats been something of an issue for them tur the ball over too much and they only had like I said what it was four assists against Clemson a game ago they already have 12 in this contest oh Ola Joseph sticks the three backto back triples out of the mark Madson timeout for the Golden Bears 21st long ball of the season for the Minnesota transfer I still I still want to keep giving praise to NC State for the way theyve been rebounding the basketball theyre plus two on C in this game okano lets it Fly and petritis runs it down nice pass they tried has slipped on the pass and then the pass slipped out of Ds

been the difference because 14 Point Second Chance points for them seven for NC State got sevenpoint game looking see misses on the front end of the one in one thats our first free throw Miss of the game and were not responsible for it because we never mentioned it I told you during one of the timeouts that nobody was going to miss a free throw and now weve seen it thats the first oneonone free throw all game long if you can believe that Styles straight away three it bounces off and blackshire chases it down NC State just three of 11 from the perimeter in this game went one for 10 against Cal in the first meeting last month every defensive possession is huge right now for NC State they cant I mean this could be a 10point game with a threepoint shot conell knocked over blackshire is open there it is Brook it 10 points now the road woes continue for NC State theyre going to have to score against this zone defense you might have to see some pressure here at some point see if maybe NC State can turn the ball over were close in on about two minutes to play conell misses if youre cow right now the clock is your friend you dont need to take quick shots youre up double digits two and a half to play use that shot clock and get an efficient shot off when the time is right you dont have to rush this Wilkinson downhill kicks Corner popped it bounces in Joshua Ola Joseph with a Shooters touch and Cal takes a 13point lead late and this is not the position that coach Pats wants to be in has to burn a timeout NC State just one two players short from having a better scoring team its been an issue All Season here they are down 13 with two to go Applause Music Music Music couple of threepointers back to back for Cal right here heres jovon blackshire getting the open look from the wing hes been effective all night in the scoring column and then great crosscourt pass from Wilkinson The Freshman all attention on him Ola Joseph with the friendly home Rim bounce here in the second half right in front of their bench to go up 13 n State just went cold down the stretch in this game its another wolf pack Miss Soko grabs his 12th Board of the night Richie been almost 5 minutes since NC State scored just cant do that down the stretch in a tight game certainly can again this has been something thats been plaguing him the whole season coach Keats knows it just dont have that goto guy to get a bucket for you right when you need it you miss a DJ horn or a DJ burns from that final four Squad as season go he did talk about not having a consistent 20 point per game score and how much thats affected his offense on a nightly bases in the ACC it has to be a collective effort and right now you get in a situation like this I me its kind of an equal opportunity offensive issue I mean right now who do they go to who do they turn to that can get them a guaranteed ho if the game is close and theyve had a lot of close losses one possession down the stretch because who do they have on their roster they feel comfortable to say look this guy every time is going to be the player who is going to get uh take the last second shot when needed wom basketball every Sunday for you right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Commonwealth Clash vot Tech Virginia start us off at noon Eastern then third ranked Notre Dame 21st ranked Cal should be another great afternoon of Hoops on acc Network Golden Bears pulling away down the stretch up 15 as Styles misses another one theres three of 15 from the field tonight this is reviewable inside of 2 minutes and thats what the Golden Bears are pleading for and the officials will take an extended look at it Cal just dominant down the stretch 143 run the last 6 minutes no points for NC State the last 5 minutes and change and the Golden Bears not only eyeing a season sweep of NC State but a win tonight would bring Cal to its win total from a season ago as they continue this upward Trend under Mark Madson yeah I think this play right here trying to decide who the ball went off of from that angle it looked like number two Paul mcneel for NC State at last touched his hand but lets see here or two comes in here try to get the Music board looked to me like it was probably off of NC State but thats thats thats really hard to tell what was the call on the floor NC State ball well they might not have enough to overturn that so appeared to go off the hand Paul mcne The Freshman well Wolfpack looking at a seven straight loss here tonight go to Stanford to wrap up this West Coast Road swing on Saturday a team thats kind of in the bubble conversation their hosting Wake Forest right now down on the farm but for whatever reason this ncy State team just hasnt been able to find success away from Raleigh theyre going to drop to 0 and eight in games away from the Lenovo Center this season yeah Tough Run for them no soft spots in the ACC Stanfords next then back home for Louisville Boston College then meeting North Carolina in Chapel Hill Wake Forest will come to town thatll be an ESPN 2 game at the end of the month how about the the turnaround for Louisville under their first year head coach Pat Kelce coming over from Charleston pack and Coach man pack and Coach I you know Ive seen him Coach quite a bit when he was at Winthrop then had a ton of success at College of Charleston after that everywhere he goes he wins championships and Louisvilles a a perfect spot for him hes from Cincinnati Ohio my hometown as well two hours away hes done a great job in year one I dont think theyre going to count that bucket are they well see officials are talking about it its Paul mcneel and count it they are going to count first points in more than 5 minutes for NC State but likely a little too late Paul mcneel to Richmond Senior High School Rockingham North Carolina reason I know that town so well because its a neighboring town to laurenburg North Carolina in Scotland County the big rival when I was coaching out that way now look theyre going to go full court pressure now and try to force a turnover now here comes the traps we havent seen these traps all game long once they break the Trap he just cant give up a layup great job by Cal by keeping composed as then State going to play the foul game or theyre just going to play straight up playing straight up Cal will move to 8 and0 this season when holding their opponents under 70 points Connell knocks it away from Wilkinson with eight to Applause shoot about how about the guy that cleans up sweat from the Baseline hes Remar Ive never seen a guy do this every time he runs on the floor to clean up sweat he runs he slides on his knees to get there faster cleans it up and gets off the floor before play comes back he he might be up for ACC floor man of the week there he is right there he is putting together a terrific performance down the stretch tonight keeping this floor dry this is remarkable hey man its like student managers you have to have good student managers to have a good an opportunity to be a good team but did you see the slide Ive seen like six times its quite impressive its impressive yeah it really is all right so coach Keats in the Huddle talking to his guy all right look you know theyre not going to foul with just second now hes coming out with a different instrument hold on here hes taking the spotlight in the final minute of this game all right well I think what coach Keats would be talking to his team about right now would be to um is is well Im getting distractive because every time I start talking about the team we start talking about the slide and then we go back to Keats then we go back to the slide all right so were hanging out with Keats right now and Coach Keats and Company but yeah look theyre not going to foul with 8 seconds to go but theyre still down double digits on under a minute to go so theyre going to have to uh obviously get a stop here they have to score in a hurry theyre going to go right back to that press theyre going to trap on that first pass and the key is for cow when the when you get trapped in the corner somebody has to receive the pass in the middle third of the floor NC States going to have to take away that middle third of the floor and that press to be able to have a chance of getting a steal if that first trap doesnt work Applause out sure Music Applause sto yakovich late in the clock puts it up there almost banked it in push it fing State push it get to the hole get to the rim maybe you get fouled all right good kick out nice pass you got to hit it Styles been that type of night for him coming off backto back excellent scoring performances against the top two teams in the conference Duke and Clemson but is three of 16 tonight Berkeley well Cal saw a 9 win Improvement in Mark madsons first season and with this victory tonight they will have matched their win total from their final Pack 12 year and plenty more games on the schedule to improve upon that sooko puts the cherry on top K was dominant down the stretch in this game you got to credit their defense and their offensive rebounding great great job with it with 11 closed out the game and so now you got Cal with the season sweep over NC State
