at his teammates this has been the starting lineup for coach laronega for the vast majority of the season for Georgia Tech its their starting lineup brought to you by your local Toyota dealers and this is the sixth different starting lineup for Josh pastner this season and its not like guys have moved in for one or two games eight of the nine guys have started at least six games so uh theyre just looking for some continuity Miami of the traveling green owns the opening tip teams played twice a season ago both wins for the canes here in Atlanta and in Coral Gables Wong to Jordan Miller and thats the play that Georgia Tech went over defensively in the shoot around today and they came up and they gave up a dunk on the first play and Jim larenega talked about recognizing the different zones and different defenses that Georgia Tech will play a great start to the Hurricanes Miller was a thunderous Sally oop Jam to start the game Poplar with pack on the run after the turnover it goes out of bounds and thatll be Georgia Tech basketball back to the jackets see just very little pressure on the passer nobody in the back line to pick that up and the games that weve done Jordan Millers had uh some big big games Georgia Tech tries to go inside Terry trying to muscle his way against packs second chance for the yellow jackets and they get it to fall with Rodney Howard they just moved over his head pack a little shaken up on that play they went right at him had a little bit of a size difference with uh with Terry trying to post them up you got to see them back holding that jaw and some discomfort Mike and that was its a basketball play I mean Terrys going up through him for the shot about Nigel pack at the top of the broadcast 12 points per game omir in the lane he got hit Howard picks up the foul and theyre eventually going to get to a three out two in type of uh alignment Im talking about Miami and youll see OMeara and Miller both theyll play high low post together both of them very good to have in the middle of that zone that is Millers too strong Howard had it for a moment knocks around well take it by the yellow jackets as Kelly brings it up came off the bench for their most recent game against Virginia in a losing effort the 20 points Music Kelly launching a three and its all net and Tom I always look at the guys and how theyre playing in the ACC play and uh boy Kelly is really upped his game 17 points a game but also 46 and three overall this season Mike 40 from Beyond The Arc and thats his 31st made of the season omir on the business end for the second time and this time it works Music they are really trying to work over that uh zone defense with the lobs for the back end and omir is a guy hes such a great offensive rebounder you can throw the lob up and hes going to get it oh mirror the transfer from Arkansas State played his prep ball at Miami prep in Florida the annual angle was calculated there for the bucket for Georgia Tech as it was more good you ready did he seemed to have settled in he started the last eight hes one of those guys in fact hes been consistent and his numbers pretty good Tom 12 points a game they did struggle in that game against Virginia just two points and one rebound the admin in double digits as you mentioned Mike seven straight but they had a lot of people who struggled in that group this is a you know this is this would be a huge mental health win for Georgia Tech and its their basketball you know this is a for the last game of a four game home stand um theyve lost their two ACC games here so they need to start feeling pretty good about themselves coach Pastor in his seventh season here in Atlanta Georgia Tech in the early going 304 from the floor coach Pastor told us they just need to avoid the big run by the opposition which thats easy to say Mike but it really has happened in their most recent losses yeah I mean hes you know hes basically identified 25 minutes of bad basketball and theres Packard our guy that we featured at the top seems to be okay after some contact inside on a previous sequence see guys are never affected on the offensive End by anything that happens I think theyre a little shaken up on the defenseman but its if he gets the ball hes going to put it up a good rotation inside the missing tight for more pack ends up with it the easy Mitch right at the rim back is the leading threepoint shooter hes now made 26 on 71 tries after that three on the last trip down the court for the king thats omir creating space off the backboard Music really does a nice job he can put the ball on the floor if he gets out to 18 feet I I would almost invite him to shoot jump shots out there hes just so much more dangerous inside turn over long up ahead omir did well not to travel and then a little midrange came up short youre right he almost got passed into a turnover Terry missed two layups now that Georgia Tech has missed early on high flying attempt from Terry and he couldnt convert pack does a nice job of driving you down off the dribble and North Chad OMeara averages almost 14 per game hes time for tonights keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer with Mike jaminski yeah from Miami they talked about defending the Cutters Georgia Tech plays the Princeton style offense so they spread the floor look to get back to our cuts on you and for Georgia Tech value the ball Miamis so very good at scoring off of your mistakes especially getting Steals and getting out in the open floor coach Pastor LED this program to the 2021 ACC tournament Championship played in Greensboro with a win over Florida State in that title game that was the last top 25 teams theyve beaten and this year so far as they turn it over Mike for the third time theyre seven and six and Owens conference play had a chance against Virginia on Saturday but lost 7456 Yellowjackets have the ball back long range three Music three to the year I think he could be up around the 1415 point a game range you know and that would really give a big lift to this team hes doubled his average from last year but I think he could be doing a little bit more its right around nine and a half points per game this season for the sophomore from Memphis Tennessee trying to close on Wong thats a long rebound Terry and Miller fighting for it will stay at this end of the floor heres the play just really nobodys stepping up to to stop the basketball he gets to run into a nice shot in Rhythm but after going for those lobs Miami for the last couple of possessions some long early threes over all the canes are the best shooting team by percentage of the ACC long again too strong but its funny neither one of these teams gets a lot of their offense from the three theyre both really good twopoint shooting teams Georgia Tech shoes 44 as a team body at work this season thats 12th in the conference sets from close range and its two more for Howard off to a quick start he got the nice easy offensive rebound to get him started and then theyre showing a little range on his jump shot four points for Rodney Howard Senior is popular another three attempts yeah I think right now you get the offensive rebound but right now I think Miami is bailing them out by taking those long threes yeah theres everybody going to the shooter and you know you set a good screen like that invariably you find yourself open so pack comes out of the game caves have missed their last four field goal attempts three of those have been threepoint tries two of them from long as he looks over at coach larranaga I dont know anybody recognizes it Joseph passed two Defenders that came up short up top for the board Howard yeah that was a rushed possession after they realized the clock was on their back Coleman trying to work against Poplar in the paint Terry spins got a mirror in the air and drops it in hes another guy hes been kind of slow to get into ACC competition a transfer from Gardner Webb its good were good were home were home played three years in that program 43 career starts at Gardner Webb yeah average 14 you know so he can score the ball he just has to get used to this level theres just over seven points per game that is Miller Applause four points for Miller Mike yeah really good find that we talked about him now operating in the middle of that zone Miller had a season High 25 points in a home win against NC State Miami is 40 in conference play and thats a smooth jumper from Moore and hes got four yeah more and Howard doing some nice work in the paint area no real shot blocker out there for Miami turnover Terry On The Run trying to get back double fisted Rim rocker from Lance Terry maybe some shades of Jordan not sure right there from Lance Terry and also they did a nice job getting back in transition after the make Coleman is open for three got it right back reloads he knew that was off and he chases it down he knows where his missiles are going youve got that blocked in Georgia Tech is on an 112 run can you talk about them being on the wrong side of runs early and now theyre on the right side a couple of Threes from Miles Kelly and a Timeout on the court 142 run Georgia Tech and a 10point lead heres the look and we talked about their ability to get out in the open floor nice finish by Mr Terry they convert off of the steel mic in thunderous fashion yeah theyve been actually doing well in the half court and then getting out and running two Josh pastner would like to see more of that but uh really solid there good execution theyre getting some good scoring inside and the threepoint shooting has been on point as well 36 to start the game Georgia Tech has made four of its last five field goal attempts you mentioned Mike the threepointer is not really where these teams find a lot of their points for Miami in its early threepoint struggles their 10th in the ACC in threepoint shooting and across the way for Georgia Tech theyre 12 just 33 percent for the entire season so far from three well and you look at it you know we talked about trying to find some continuity and all the different people who started working the tech hasnt substituted in this game yet and Josh pastner likes what hes seeing and why not you got a 2111 lead hes still got the same starting five out on the floor guys on the floor producing so far for Coach Pastor 45 years old and he was when he started telling me he was talking today about him feeling old I wouldnt go to the pumpkin yeah 45 come on threepointer another Miss Pack and these are theyre not just telling the lines these are t3s that this team has taken and Mir trying to work the interior Howard stood his ground still fouled him from here to the line for the old school threepoint Play Chance the second on Howard heres the look and this is the thing with omir you have to be ready to go up after the ball was good initial defense but hes one of the best offensive rebounders in the country and that is why Mike he is tonights parties star to watch more Chad OMeara we talked about how good a shooting team Miami is put that on top of him getting four offensive rebounds a game that puts a lot of pressure on you you either see the numbers just under 10 rebounds per and 40 of those offensive its our first free throw of the game and a miss from omir 70 from the line on the season hes also the top shooter by percentage in the league 62 percent now granted a lot of those shots are close to the rim but still hes top shooter by percentage Applause Kelly hes got a couple of Threes looking for a conventional bucket the tip no good fight for it several players around the basketball and theyre going to call a foul on omir it was Franklin in the middle of it for Georgia Tech fight and gets three green shirts and Georgia Tech is actually theyve been very active on the offensive glass and there yeah it is you got the call it was the reach over the back first on almir Georgia trying to snap a mini twogame losing streak theyve lost three of their last four and those were ACC opponents Terry has nowhere to go shock Fox at two and OMeara gets a second foul now in 2000 about 30 seconds Tom in the same way going on off getting trying to get a defensive rebound and you know the thing we talked about is with Jim larenegger this he will not play guys with two fouls in the first half so thats thats probably it for the rest of the half for Amir and thats a big big Miss and then Georgia Tech takes advantage of that theres a nice shot inside Applause its obsessive thats a huge foul in this game but Kelly now has eight points the leads all scorers so far in this first half that bounces away taken by Lance Terry trying to Glide in lost the handle out of bounds towards the band itll stay with Georgia Tech and these are uh its going to be all of a sudden very important minutes for Anthony Walker whos out there Aaron is about 10 minutes a game and hes going to get that here in the first half Walker number one in green Applause Moore with the shot clock at six reversing Direction not high enough on the square and the yellow jackets unable to save it there with Franklin and then you know as as well as Georgia Techs been playing and you got to be a little bit greedy theyve missed three layups now inside Applause Joseph with the basketball now long Miamis missed nine if its last 11 shot attempts look how far out that Jones playing pack hes got the range hes been the only one with the range hes the only one whos made it three for Miami hes got two of them hes up to 27 made on the season that leads the club Music transfer from Kansas State First Team all Big 12 a season to go and the most improved player in that League pushing the right buttons in the portal back has it long just turns and fires okay well you know and he did not pack and he kept Guang from the portal so working it both ways a good point Terry in the corner he rips the ropes for Georgia Tech hes had 18 points total in his three ACC games but hes starting to find a little bit of Rhythm here this evening hes got seven now Mike after that three ball and his 14th of the Season gliding in was Miller Athletics six points and youve got to know thats a Scouting Report hes a lefthander he likes to get to that side it was a good finish Music season High 25 and a home win against NC State he had 47 in those two games against Cornell backtoback Courthouse off Cincinnati the midweek game 107 105 Victory against the big red what a game that was when wrong had 36 points thats the most any player scored in the ACC this season its off the backboard and in for more not only that three seconds left on the shot clock as well six points Jalen Moore in the first half look how far out their defense extended nice steal and Josh pastner wants a foul that was born long struggling for the ball Jalen Moore had it knocked away the regatherer in the bucket and the 10th yellow jackets with the 10point lead on their home court with 750 to go in the first half time for tonights Fresh Market discover the best and in his 12th season on that Miami Hurricanes bench Jim larranega and how about this Mike he is a candidate for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and uh will be inducted into Miamis Hall of Fame thats right itd be a doubledouble for him this year and of course uh 709 wins none more emotional than number 700 which came against his alma mater Providence and uh the thing theyre only lost this year is the next day after a very emotional night against Maryland yeah they beat Providence on November 19th 7464 in the Hall of Fame tipoff in Uncasville Connecticut as Mike mentioned the next night was their only loss this season hes got 239 career wins as the Kanes head coach and thats the most in school history theres one other distinction Mike that he holds alone he is the only division one coach with a 100 or more conference wins at three different schools well thats just a and you know what you wouldnt you wouldnt know obviously youve had to play youve got a lot of years on you to get all those accolades and those numbers but still very very enthusiastic about the game about the process about shoot around today which is wonderful to see head coach of Bowling Green and then he took George Mason to the final four in 2006 shot clock winding down Miller able to beat it Id like to see them do over this next stretch is work that defense and get some things inside not settle for jump shots and especially theyve got their best offensive rebounder on the bench gotta get inside omir on that Miami events with two personals the Kings have now hit four their last five after only making one of their previous ten so trying to turn around the trend and getting the ball back and traveling by eight was 7 13 to go in the first half so glad that youre with us for ACC basketball from Atlanta a mirror on the bench with those two personal fouls one of the new faces to the program this season Applause eightpoint lead for Georgia Tech Tom Hornby Mike jaminsky are outstanding PCC basketball production crew wishing you a very happy and prosperous new year as we as we forged Ford in the ACC ENT well Franklin at 67 is the tallest guy out there defensively but he is third in the conference in blocks somehow it got to Miller and it goes in for the jam sometimes you just the ball finds you and Miller you know he knows that his uh his front Court mate is over on the bench so hes picked up the scoring Millers got 11 Mike thats now nine games in a row double figure scoring for him Jordan Miller from the corner that one rattles out for Sturdivant it looked like the offense has really settled down since so Joseph has come into the game its a great option to have if youre Tim learning and then back to the high arcing three you can see no green jerseys at all on the offensive glass there toward Georgia Tech threepointer Miles Kelly and his third of the ball game Applause how about five of ten now from behind for the yellow jackets foreign shoots a robust 40 percent from Beyond The Arc of the season hes a guy you definitely Trust as you might imagine hes the best threepoint shooter for this yellow jacket team shot clock down a four for the kings that three rattles home how about Anthony Walker one for 11 coming in on the year get it right in front of the tech bench and uh in the place of uh nor Chad OMeara too big bonus points Walker makes one three Mike and he exceeds his season average in scoring is two and a half points that was deflected Joseph colliding with the shooter Kelly and Joseph will get the foul his first and theres going to be three free throws if youre going to challenge this he went just went right through his body youve got to have a youve got to have a bit of an angle if youre gonna go buy it Ill tell you what Georgia Tech has had some very good looks from the three and you know for Miami they may be they might have been testing them early seeing if they had the shooting eye but now theyre going to have to defend a little bit more first Georgia Tech free throw of the evening there you go theres the breakdown Applause best freethrow shooter for the jackets as well Miles Kelly Wong getting set to check in AJ Casey is number zero look at that thats some quick work they just updated Kelly to 12 points Id love to see that graphic again with 13 points on it weve got a great crew down here Music Kelly shoots 85 percent from the freethrow line look at that now hes up to 13 points Mike hes now 26 of 30 from the freethrow line Applause so thats 14 total points for Kelly hes going to get a breather sophomore from Stone Mountain Georgia and hes like wait wait what are you taking me out for yeah Im rolling here Im good coach we got a timeout coming in another minute he could be back in soon as we yeah I think they just want to get him down at under four about to cross the fiveminute threshold of the first half Music entertaining high scoring high flying endtoend action Georgia Tech mixing in threepoint shot as well long loses the handle able to recover shot box of five in the corner ax saves it gotta look at that clock did he get it away doesnt matter missed the shot in the corner threepointer Lance Terry they are getting contributions from everybody right now and the thing is last three games theyve outscored their teams 40 to nothing in Fast Break points but Georgia Tech is getting out and running here in the first 20 minutes double digits for Terry hes got 10 points already way over his average of 71 per game long stepping in and he has not scored in the game yet Applause hes missed all his threepoint attempts third chance for Casey right up against Frank Franklin yeah hes going to get called for the foul first on Franklin Lance Terry open in the corner for his second three ball from the corner pocket and high in ACC points in this game with 10 just connected on a threepointer your Chad omear walking back to the laronega bench hes got the two personal fouls he left a few minutes ago Mike well and its you look at it you know a 12 point deficit and uh the Georgia Tech really you know you cant get defensive right now you want to try to build on this lead not let Miami go on one of those runs that theyve had early on in the season AJ Casey the freshman from Chicago Illinois at the free throw line not a whole lot of experience at the line four of eight to start the night made the first Applause youre getting you know Casey will come out of the game right now but uh you know they had him Anthony Walker is going to have to play some big minutes in the first half knocked down a three earlier one of the three main threes in the game for Miami three of 11 Georgia Tech six of 11 on threepoint chances Applause Music Sturtevant dropped it low Up and Under a little too much spin on the attempt from Smith certainly had the elevation that was packed dribbling into trouble but a foul is called in that Sturdivant first on him both teams both teams sitting at uh four personal fouls and talk about the Princeton offense theyre looking for back doors right there but it was actually Miller coming over and uh our Walker coming over and helping to force the miss this is Miller in traffic fed it back out to Long still trying to get in the Box Score long rebound Walker long how did he do that it looked like he lost it on the way up yeah no that was by far the hardest attention hes had he was able to finish through the foul and watch this he misses their first shot and then nice job not settling for the jump shot there but going inside and it was a terrific and one Miami had been one of its last five shot attempts and now long at the freethrow line 83 percent of the season so first bucket and free throw and the threepoint play from Isaiah Wong one of the finalists for the wooden award just announced tonight Mike one of five ACC players in the top 25 in those finalists and one of only 25 in the country so a very elite company the Kanes leading scorer on the season just over 17 points per game for Isaiah Wong that is seventh in the ACC were inside of three minutes to go in our first half cant find it from threepoint distance so far Mike yeah I think hes you know and theyre actually laying off him a little bit and forcing that jump shot its Harry with a quick first step right talked about him taking a little while to settle into ACC play he looks very comfortable right now Terry who made his seventh start of the Season tonight for Josh passner for the tech trying to run they dont have the numerical Advantage necessarily Walker high for the rebound I think they would have been better suited to pull that one back out wait for some help and it results on a basket at the other end yeah its just an easy layup Applause they need those points Millers got 12 Wong is all of five from threepoint tries just like that its a seven point game dont forget coming up at halftime well have highlights and stats well go around the ACC were one of four games tonight there were three yesterday well touch upon those as well knocked away to pack weaving his way past tournament lost it up for one that was a tough chance should have come down with it Terry hesitation Poplar in the passing lane and then he stepped on the sidelines Applause he might have had a chance to hit Wong who had sprung free down the middle of the court but hes stepped to the sidelines I mean a good defensive play and he came up with the steal but his momentum carried him out so coach laronega because of that omear foul has had to Shuffle the deck favor iray comes in number 12 in green with nor Chad omear still on that bench hes at the bottom of your screen there hes been there for a long time number 15 131 to go in the first half time for tonights time for a message from coyote before we continue my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you gotta have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo foreign one to go in the first half now if you consider trying to paint a good picture for Miami here Wong has got three points to this point Tom and Omer has been out since the 10 and a half minute mark so those two really have not been a factor and its a seven point game with a minute and a half right now so Jim laronega you know things could be a lot worse and omers teammates on the floor have gone on a 72 run over the last two and a half minutes close that Gap spend as much as 12 for Georgia Tech as far as its largest lead in the first 20 minutes Music Applause shot clock to 10 for the yellow jackets Sprints up the court trying to share the defender offensive foul lower to shoulder and just uh you know hes just really wants to get some momentum going into the second half but pretty good defense off the dribble watch right here watch that shoulder its going to get a call every time and boy Terrys been having a good game both ends of the floor foreign leads the way with 14 points for Georgia Tech Lance Terry right behind him with 12 a season high in ACC play its been for more Ray was waiting for him yeah nice defense there irres seeing action just his ninth game this season freshman from Nigeria but his prep ball at Bishop McNamara in Maryland in tight Miss from Miller went out of bounds and it went off of Georgia Tech with 20 seconds on the shot clock on the recycle Music Music final 30 seconds Applause Wong who also struggled to the win against Notre Dame he was over four from threepoint distance way behind the line I dont know Mike three or four feet behind the line at least thats been the story of the half though those shots against that extended Zone have been really deep nine points per pack all threepointers extending the defense and committing the foul but you know not a bad situation youve got to recycle with 26 to go you know theyre not in the bonus right now so youre not giving up free throws that is from the connector thats Way Beyond 22 feet one and threequarter inches away final seconds Kelly scissor kick midair side Rim yeah that was a great foul buyer in the end and all the things working against them only a fourpoint deficit for the hurricane its because Miami Mike went on a 102 run in the last four minutes of the half some highflying Aerials some threepoint shot the refurbishments of the Alexander Coliseum lets see if they can start Mr Kelly off again he had a fabulous first half three of six from three and fourteen points for Miles Kelly leading scorer for the yellow jackets this season turn around Second Chance over the ribbon good Moore has it for Georgia Tech and hes got eight oh you got off to a quick start at the beginning of the game Jalen Moore was three of six from the floor in the first half Applause this is by far the most points that Georgia Tech has scored in a half in an ACC game OMeara on the Baseline Doug they would love for him to settle for that shot in this game and uh we you know we talked about those other three ACC games for Georgia Tech the average 25 points a game in the first three in the first half thats number three on omir Mike and he looked a little bit out of sorts right now and uh you know hes kind of looking around a little bit days right now Jim laronega for the moment going to stay with him big first half from Lance Terry with 12 points at a highflying jam knocked down a couple with threes this is for three comes off to Miller Texas flank steps in with a three ball Miller preserves The Possession to Wong hes got nowhere to go to omir and he got undercut and fell awkwardly finished the play but came down hard thank you but its a very unselfish play right thats just theres a real helpless feeling when youre up in the air like that came down hard hes grabbing that right hip so the player that made contact with omir was Coleman Music Coleman got the foul omir will go to the line and the officials are going to take a closer look Music so pack put it up on the rim for omir who was able to finish off the play and so Brent Hampton and Jamie lucky whos on the right of your screen going to the monitor to check the previous play theyre joined by Matt Potter as our officiating proof of this evening and heres a look at what theyre looking at very unselfish play and it well it it did look like Coleman just kind of went right underneath them understand I wonder if Coleman thought maybe it was going to be a shot like and he was trying to box out and then hit omir collided with him awkwardly I just dont know because initially I thought it was a shot attempt but then omir came out of nowhere and grabbed that basketball and that would be you know for a guy whos as good an offensive rebounder like that youre just looking to keep him off the glass as much as you can NFL so were being told this play will result in a flagrant one on Coleman Jamie lucky has just given us the indication Music so what and what the call was is that he made no play on the ball it was just a you know it you saw it he was backing it he just went right underneath him so its gonna be two shots and possession so possibly a big swing right here the key word being unnecessary in the flagrant one definition theres the lab and then you see Coleman just see its that extra little when he stuck his butt out and he just no mirror defenseless in that and you know in that instance and hes going to get two free throws it could be a seven point play Applause this in in a brief snapshot is kind of a look at Georgia Tech season you know this this is a run with no time running off the clock exactly Mike Georgia Tech going into a Virginia run of 25 to nothing I came on Saturday where they lost 7456 right here at mccamish Pavilion most recent game for the Yellowjackets so youre right Mike that amounted to Four Points from the omear sequence and now pack gets it back and so it hits in six points you know just like that theres virtually no time running off the clock back to double digits now hes got 11 after that jumper and thats the eighth time this season for Nigel pack to score in double digits for the Miami Hurricanes working on a ninegame winning streak theyve won seven straight Mike in conference away from Coral Gables and that ties the school record wow what a finish Holmen puts it into the 60 Run yeah they really needed that basket a chance for a threepoint play in there and I think they like about him I mean he knocks down a three but also very strong just a great finish through the foul second foul on Wong Applause threepoint play for the 67 free throw shooter Debo Coleman Music Kinsley Joseph number four in green into the game Applause long stepping back tough shot you see and you know you look at the adjustment coming out of the half and uh and Jim laronega starting benjley Joseph to get get those other two guys off the you know off the ball you get pack and Wong turned them into scores long now one of nine from the floor hes missed all six of his attempts and the one that he made was this toughest shot of the night there was shot clock winding down omir and the outlet to Wong its a half court offense has not looked as crisp for Georgia Tech here in the second half how are you play behind the back line of defense Miller some midair contact and a foul against Georgia Tech thats going to be two shots and now Miami you know you can go back to that lob youve established that the the referees are are looking for the undercut now so Moore picked up the foul for Georgia Tech Millers at the freethrow line Applause get a message from Coyote Tractor Music my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo Jordan Miller second year in the Miami program three years at George Mason omear to the bench one heres the other thing with Joseph on the floor hes got that calming influence but hes now got these uh Garden Miles Kelly and hes uh hes strong enough that he can negate his size 14 points for Kelly Applause three missed from Coleman that goes to the floor more times after it Georgia Tech ball Music Music yeah thats I mean you dont mind Matt those are hustle plays going after the loose ball meanwhile Mike the Keynes have cut the lead to one Georgia Tech led by as many as 12 in that first half brief twopoint lead long went flying Kelly shoots over the defensive misses followed for more following play Jamie lucky on top of it Jordan Miller picks up the foul only his first and Georgia Tech has some success on the offensive glass lets get the finish right there but still good work inside Music again with the with the foul issues that Miami trying to figure out a way without omir on the floor Applause Josh Pastor in a conversation with Matt Potter I dont think he convinced him I dont think he was asking if he liked his tie although very nice you dont see many times anymore on coaches ever since ever since High which I miss Ill tell you what cool old school if they pull off the win against number 12 Miami he might have a tuxedo on the next game Saturday against Florida State at the very least theyll have that same outfit on Applause threepoint lead Georgia Tech High Ray wow Off the Mark okay all right he doesnt play a whole lot to be pretty aggressive looking for his own shot hand off to Coleman plenty of time to operate takes a tough shot off the backboard does not have the numerical Advantage flies in and then hits the stanchion was clutching the right ankle briefly picked up the foul for Georgia Tech so the hustle player from pack is going to result in a trip to the free throw lock in half and that was path who went down and Moore might have caught that right ankle Mike it looked like he caught the back of the foot so it wasnt as uh catastrophic as it could have been he looks no worse for the wearer right there entering the Georgia Tech entering the ACC my senior year wow dude myself alongside the AllAmerican from duke and then two years later Mr cremins shows up on the scene it does a good enough job here to get the court named after him worked out well yes sir Final Four 1990 Bobby kremins and you know hes watching us from somewhere always keeping an eye on the jackets the thing about this half is that Georgia Tech is not nearly getting the quality look of shot that they did in that first half you want to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer thats coming up momentarily a couple for Nigel pack for the free throw line appears to shaking off the ill effects of that Collision underneath and that Poplar he got fouled but how about Bensley Joseph making that play alert just kind of a lazy inbounds pass he gets to steal and they get at the line and Miamis doing a lot of scoring with no time going off the clock thats just great defense right there good recognition and those are the things you know we talk about starting a lot we talked about Georgia Techs starting lineup desert Joseph is a finisher hes going to be it there at the end for this team Smith Franklin Sturtevant come in for Georgia Tech Howard leaves Moore comes out Miles Kelly as well Kelly hasnt scored in the second half 14 points in the first half poplars at the free throw line a Miss from the line for him like he did in the first one and the second one a rarity been 16 of 18 from the line on the season for Wanda Poplar Terry tried to work Baseline and got bumped by Joseph Music and uh its in this half Joseph has been around their best perimeter scores Music and so far we now with Kelly out of the game right now that hes got Terry Music Joseph has not scored so far tonight but he doesnt have to to prove his value to this team Ramirez playing with the three personal fouls shot clocks down to four long rebound off the skirt of it Miss taken by Georgia Tech and Damon Smith and he just out hustled everybody for the you know chasing that 5050 ball down copper with the foul they got him 55 in green first now its just you know just an observation too in this halftime that omir has hes not been as dominant in this game because of the foul trouble he hasnt been the presence on the floor that he normally is its pretty tentative out there right now normally averages about 14 points per game and leads the way for Miami and rebounding with almost 10 fourth in the ACC pack wants it fails to connect jackets on a run Holmen driving right into Amir Joseph grabs it trying to get to the rim Terry knocks it out of bounds some pretty good defense at both ends of the floor on players off the drive and that is a big time block from a wing Georgia Tech needed that defensive play it had missed its last seven shots okay Miles Kelly rejoins The Fray for Georgia Tech Coleman is out Miami doing most of their damage this half at the freethrow line six of eight thats really bailed them out offensively so Nigel pack came out of the lineup this is inside to Miller quick release omir the tip and tap thats his game and thats the first offensive rebound for a score that hes had Applause so me are able to tip that one in hes got 12 points the minutes have been limited almost came up with a pilfer Applause straight away its time 15 points Lance Terry three threepoint buckets boy they they really need that Blossom to continue from him and ACC play he has been fabulous tonight Music Terry with the response in the threepointer 15 points for Terry he is now the leading scorer in the game for Georgia Tech Kelly has 14 and hasnt scored in the second half jackets in search of their first ACC win of the season 03 in conference seven and six overall Miamis working on a ninegame winning streak 40 in conference play and Isaiah long with the ball now still struggling in this game one of nine Applause Sturtevant picks up the foul second on him and thats again right now Miller is the tough matchup for Georgia Tech out on the floor and they tried to work him into the pain area hes got a size advantage so the loose ball goes out of bounds over here and hes looked a lot more aggressive in the last two three minutes touching the top of his head there Mike Im gonna make sure everythings already everything comes in place one on one move and thats what Miami hadnt been doing that was just a pickpocket in the open floor and this Josh pastner told us about burning timeouts to stop runs and he was quick that time look at this this just Sturdivant was looking to see what was going to happen in the play and its just its just great that thats Miami scoring right there off of their defense first basket of the game for Poplar and it ties us at 49 fourth tie of the game Miami overcoming a 12point deficit in the first half Trail by four at halftime now were tied up and 1303 left Georgia Tech One Time Out left in the game Miamis perfect at home theyve won all nine of their home games 141 record number 12 in the nation but championships in this league are one on the road and Miami 20 so far away from home this would be their third Road win early in conference play Notre Dame and its Terry again fourth threepointer and 18 points Lance Terry now you know hes going and they just have to get Miles Kelly going again as well Terry came in averaging about seven points per game Joseph the Miss couldnt follow the shot Georgia Tech four on one for the moments wow broken up Mike and up ahead to Miller and he lays it in Applause 16 points for Miller he leads Miami tonight an opportunity missed on that break by Georgia Tech thank you Music shot clock to 10 Franklin the handoff Smith the jumper Music another challenge jump shot chance to take the lead back for the canes and actually I was watching Kelly in that last offensive possession you look really gassed over on the sideline which wasnt really even part of that play hasnt scored in the second half for Georgia Tech leading scorer in the season for the yellow jackets Franklin defended the Baseline long another missed side rim Smith hustles it up this is Kelly and now finsley Joseph wants to slow things down a little bit Applause off of that set they work in a little high low action Applause popular weak side omir right back out to Joseph ripping roots for Miami and how does it start offensive rebound for omir everybody gets pulled in Kinsley gets a great look at it and the lead is two Music Applause Music first points of the night for Joseph shot clock to seven Coleman wow basket and foul and that one again was a possession didnt look like it was going anywhere and Coleman makes a big in one Poplar picked up the foul Coleman will be at the free throw line when we come back tied at 54 Lance Terry yeah hes just a block from an unexpected Source really but a terrific play on the off the break Bensley Joseph that was in the first half Terrys done it offensively as well 18 points hes made all four of his threepoint tries Music the thing too I mean hes been very efficient seven of ten its been a tough night for one goal Mike yeah he is really struck never really has gotten into a rhythm in this game oh seven from three one of ten overall he does have careerhigh four steals in the game so doing other things he escorted double digits and all but two games this season and his expression doesnt usually change much so you cant count him out as being a factor down the stretch in this game with 10 29 to go well and to this point you got to credit Georgia Tech because whenever Miami theyve clawed back into this game theyve taken leads but Georgia Tech has always answered theyve taken the lead back threepoint play Debo Coleman Applause Isaiah long had just five points against Florida a m earlier this season trying to pick up the slack thats Long offensive glass got two or three defenders in the air and hell earn some free throws well that the zone is extended out so far that he was able to sneak in behind everything and this would be a good way for him maybe to find some Rhythm get to the free throw line knock down a couple of shots if I was on Miles Kelly Longs had one free throw tonight to complete a threepoint play 83 percent of the season Applause Music you can classify that as a concerned look from Jim laronega especially in one of your best freethrow Shooters misses one yeah theyve left some points at the freethrow line but also the new five of 24 from three still trying to knock down shots from Groupon thats hasnt been working for him and then another pick Doppler again puts it up and in Applause Music Poplar for Miami stealing bucket and a free throw coming Ill tell you what time this is you know that ones playing the lane a little bit but theyre just you know how do I left with the ball guys in control and that really and Papa has been the one whos been doing it third foul on Coleman Applause 5855 and inside of 10 minutes to go in the second half Jordan Jim larenaga talks about winning the turnover battle and its 135 right now Georgia Tech with 13 turns difference in the second half of Miamis turning those into points Terry underneath the hookah foul now Wong and OMeara were in the vicinity Georgia Georgia Techs going to find that second score right now its uh really Lance Terry has been carrying the load in this uh its uh omir is that the fourth hes going to come out of the game all right lets mark this at 9 36 this is a big these are Big minutes for Georgia Tech 12 points and seven rebounds for omir on the evening four personals Miller getting set to check in Terry at the free throw line they go a little bit smaller with Miller in the in the game so they lose that rebounding presence up front Applause Music Applause nine of nine from the line for Georgia Tech trailing by one Applause really nice job with Howard were getting at an early question but Poplar really coming up big for Miami in his last five minutes how about seven points in the second half for Poplar and its all been in this stretch and a lot of thats been turnovers 20 points for turia season High and the highflying jam from Smith theres that Princeton offense to get the backfield cut the overplay on the wing back to a onepoint difference Applause Beverly directs some traffic shot clock to seven Poplar checks the line angular rebound easy run down by Wong deflected Papa got it driving Poplar nine points in the second half you know thats what winning teams do they have guys come in and you get a lift from maybe unexpected places and you know the guy cheering him on the most has to be Omer Mike who has struggled with foul trouble tonight out of the corner in and out on the three by Smith Poplar trying to feed Miller Applause he hit the deck clean play with no call Kelly Catch and Release that would have been a big basket for Georgia Tech get him going again seven and a half minutes to go in regulation long got bumped looked like Kelly and so 7 26 to go in the second half we should be going right down to the wire in this one between the teams last season Georgia Tech and won the three meetings prior the last year and this one appears to be a fight and a scrap right down to the final seconds here in Atlanta tonight Mike jaminski well and uh you credit Miami because they have had because of foul trouble to play with some lineups that they probably havent practiced a whole lot with this year and theyve had their main guys struggle but theyve really gotten a lift from other places everyone including William Poplar for six from the floor nine points Isaiah long is at the freethrow line see and you know we talked about Wong and struggling and thats his fifth point but five rebounds three assists four steals you know pretty good line uh you know some people might have you know a lot of younger players might have solved because they werent seeing a big basket but hes doing other things and still time for him to show up and score the ball in the last seven and a half minutes a couple of free throws from Wong makes it a 6459 game congratulations Music largest lead of the night right now for the campaigns Kelly misses again you know who just cannot get going in this half hes over seven from the floor in this halfway thats after scoring 14 in the first half when uh Poplar is hobbling around something to his left foot Applause they basically played that whole possession four on five Poplar was limping on the far sideline was never involved in the play so more for Georgia Tech picked up his second personal and poplars still not walking real well and Amir coming into the game and Jim learning here and said that two words for him no fouls see if we can pick up the popular contact hes 55 in green yeah Neon contact right there and he got the worst moves on the inside of his knee and shame for him because he was having a fabulous half four six nine points so theyll check on Poplar Miller at the free throw line and thats where this game has really turned around too for Miami at the free throw line in this half they had that that flagrant one flurry in the first you know in the first few minutes 17 points now for Miller Kelly I like the aggressive move you know chance for the N1 he gets to that right hand but more importantly get to the free throw line maybe find some Rhythm there Music Miles Kelly 85 from the freethrow line so another excellent part of his game still taking a look at that left knee at Poplar foreign lead down to five coach laronega trying to chase his 710th career victory in 40 years as a head coach officially his 39th season on the bench Applause four point game Applause along with a quick first step into the paint tries to drop it off on beer Applause so if you watch number 15 omir they got Miller up high but hes just lurking behind that defense hes going to do one of two things hes going to make himself available for wrap around passes like that or hes going to try to get on the offensive glass Music two for three on the night for the stripe Applause What a fine for this Miami program nor Chad omir transfer from Arkansas State all right last season Sunbelt Player of the Year and defensive player of the year comes up empty on the second free throw I dont care what league youre playing in Mike Player of the Year and defensive player of the year well and you know what rebounding travels and it certainly has traveled with him into this conference oh three ball s are just when it looked like Miami was going to start to methodically Edge away thats a massive threepoint shot to make it a twopoint game 12 points for Coleman maybe hes the guy that comes up and helps Terry down the Finish here Music Joseph they find pack in the corner Music omear high for the board he got fouled in the process four white jerseys and he comes away with it I mean its just hes got such a great knack for the ball you know thats the point now hes anticipating the ball is going to be and that gets a very friendly bounce for a long jump shot but you know the thing with him and Georgia Techs going to need to do this going on stretch you have to give yourself up as a rebounder and almost face guard him your only job is to keep him off the glass your teammates have to pick up the rebound Poplar working that left knee wants to get back to this ball game they never had something like that like that 15 points omir the other thing Mike is playing with four personal fouls that was a ferocious attempt at that rebound well as he was inside he didnt have to go over anybodys back to get the because the rebound snooping into the mist and Smith everything looked good except the Finish by the way omir is six seven 248 chiseled pounds Nicaragua Joseph dropped it off midrange omir Baseline Music yeah at that time instead of diving he went out through the short corner and had a good look theyre going to give him that shot but he makes them pay now its a two possession game Kelly youre too strong volleyball after Terry go at him Rusty is this you know Howard just take a few dribbles try to get that fifth foul France Terry with the shot clock winding down trying to create contact and free throw attempts third on Wong Mike yeah good spin back to his strong hand and you know what if youre if youre Georgia Tech youre hoping that this is a springboard for Lance Terry and there it is that that short that short Corner jump shot for him but for for Lance Terry you know this would be massive he can gain some confidence from this game and carry it through the rest of the year hes got 21 points now were going to say this after the free throw by Terry Mike lets go 13 for 13 from the line as a team its always the safest route in that regard more importantly draws the jackets to within four and now four minutes exactly to go in regulation Applause the 29th alltime meeting between the programs appears to be coming down to the final seconds long trying to shake the defender could not do it shot clocks at three Joseph really nice defense by Terry on Wong that time to force him to give up the ball and make Joseph take a tough shot Coleman rattles out right to Terry for three he comes up short two really good looks its now nine of 24 on threepointers for Georgia Tech they had a couple of great looks at it to cut further into the Miami lead 55 in green Poplar Mike yeah its been him in the second half and how about this some five steals for him alone most by a hurricane this season and a career high for him and theyve been you know theyve been just playing hes had a couple of ones where hes you know kind of shot the gaps but most of them been right on his guy off the dribble and if he and his teammates can hang on in this one and then weve got a long way to go to decide it but if they can that would be eight straight conference Road victories and that would set a new school record regardless of conference that would be a new record eight in a row away from Coral Gables of course that goes back to last season as well for 20 in conference play on the road this season 40 overall shot clocks inside of 10 thank you Joseph got tripped up through the paint and again and boy thats just the big bailout at that time and Terrys been playing a terrific game but four seconds on the shot clock Music he wasnt even looking for a shot and theyre in the double bonus Music first attempts tonight for Bensley Joseph Music foreign from Arlington Massachusetts born in Miami Applause not a whole lot of free throw experience this season just his 19th attempt and over these last few minutes Miamis been leaving a few points at the freethrow line Poplar missed two youre right there theyre 17 to 24 now on the game those for four and two possessions that could be huge and the lead remains four for Miami inside of three minutes to go Music also trying to extend the ninegame winning streak on the handoff Terry on the Move spinning on Wong hanging and scoring and that was about as good a defense as you could play wrong really had him locked up but Terrys shown that he can produce off the dribble as well theyve been you know denying that threepoint shot but hes been tough in the paint 24 points for Terry its a twopoint game Wong could not shed Coleman omir a threepoint attempt and hes committed no foul on just in a Jim larenegger I cant believe it one and illadvised threepoint shot two a fifth personal foul on a play that he had no chance of getting the ball Applause heres the look I mean that was an early long youre going to force him to do that and then right there just get back and save that foul omir had only made 13 on the season Mike hes only got two made threes in his career and obviously that was the residue of the Mist trying to make a play and knock it away from Coleman instead he foulsem and hes been disqualified with the fifth personal foul and its double bonus down the other end now so two free throws for Coleman so amirs out of the game with 17 points also had eight rebounds you know thatd be thatd be a pretty nice night for most players and he did that with you know all sorts of foul trouble for jackets have tied this game with 2 15 to go and they are perfect from the freethrow line on the night 15 for 15 and uh you know and Josh passers gotten him there with using those timeouts theyve still only got the one but theyve got themselves tie game with two minutes coming back from trailing Miami by six in this half were tied for the seventh time tonight Applause shot pocket three shot clock violation against Miami Georgia Tech basketball really nice defense and really started with Miller and they they played his left hand you see right there was Terry again forcing him to give that up and thats what put the shot clock on their back Applause just a second turnover in the half for Miami and Georgia Tech has the ball and a chance to take the lead but you know what I mean at least for Miami it was a dead ball turnover so now you can get back and set your defense up Applause Music foreign Georgia Tech has taken the lead oh how about getting the thing too now though because of this youre forcing Miami to take some timeouts so thats helping the cause a great you know a good take inside but uh Smith has not had a big scoring night but a huge basket Aaron for him seven rebounds five assists to go with his four points Georgia Tech with an 80 run to take a 7270 lead last lead for Georgia Tech they left 5251 so Miami had taken control of the game led by as many as six theyve missed some opportunities at the free throw line well but and the thing thats hurt Miami as well youve got omira out with foul trouble and Poplar with that knee injury hasnt played in five minutes either Omar is out of the game with his fifth personal just a moment ago after missing a threepoint attempt a productive night with 17 points and eight boards but he only played seven and a half minutes in the first half as well Mike because of two personals in that first 20 Im going to say that he played less than 20 minutes in this game Applause Music words of inspiration from Jim laronega 12th year as the Miami head coach big drink of water to get past this last minute and 17 Music the 72 year old head coach from the Bronx New York how about some big minutes for AJ Casey The Freshman coming in Music Music Applause just six points tonight for Isaiah Wong dot clock has been an issue for Miami games are five of 28 on threepoint tries they just need a two to tie it up theyll try a three win pack straight away Kelly high for the board well you can be real deliberate with the clock right now Applause 45 seconds to go the man whos gonna have the ball with a lot of time wow what a time to come up with your first Basket in the second half 7470 30 seconds to go Miami with the basketball Wong looking for an Alleyway forces up a three it goes out of bounds for a really nice job of Terry laying off that forcing a tough shot Georgia Tech ball Mike and you got to have the quick foul right here but heres a look at the play this would have been a tough night for Isaiah Wong and wasnt able to come up with it and we talked about the last time theyd be the top 25 team pretty good timing on it the 21 ACC tournament championship against Florida State come to the ball trying to take out the number 12 team in the nation Bob Miller fouls so Kelly will go to the freethrow line Applause thank you heres the look and uh thats been hes been getting to that right hand hes just been too strong with it and uh big finish at the right time 18 points for Kelly and as you mentioned Mike his first field goal in the second half on a driving layup still perfect from the freethrow line can they stay that way and make the lead six Applause foreign Applause Music by Georgia Tech to close this one out right now with 16 and a half seconds to go well the runs have been working against them in the ACC so far this year only 16 and a half seconds as Joseph picks it up spins and fires Lance Terry ended up with the ball and he got fouled now theres only 10 seconds yeah thats about it just a huge huge mental health win for Georgia Tech picked up the foul and I dont you know nobody bigger than the guy at the freethrow line right now what a night for him thanks Terry first Miss tonight from the line for Georgia Tech Applause still make this and make it a three possession game Terry is just right now as he stands at the freethrow line two points shy of his career high remember he played three seasons with Gardner Webb prior to joining the Georgia Tech program Applause missed them both and now the last time out utilized for Miami Applause well and despite all that Lance Terry really upset with himself at missing those two free throws I mean its still going to be a steep uphill climb for Miami but it is a sixpoint game it could have been eight obviously with Terry whos played a sensational game as Mike referenced well and you know Music come on here it is and this is where he got off to the quick start and they talked about him getting out in the open floor and running thats where he found his rhythm and uh he really scored at every level in this game Tom hes getting inside made a terrific defensive stop right there hes been knocking down threes very efficient in the game letting the offense come to him and he has been really good off the dribble senior from College Park Georgia 12 in the first half 12 in the second half for military no fouls right here guards a threepoint line pressure up so they dont get so you cant roll the ball up the floor Music Kellys right now hes playing up a little bit and this more a play to see if you can use this maybe at the end of the game situation later on this year you need to shoot it here theres Joseph that should do it Buck runs out on Miami Georgia Tech 7670 over number 12 Miami and they finish the game on a 120 run with Miami missing its last seven field goal attempts a really nice start to the New Year this team desperate for a win 03 up to this point in conference but
