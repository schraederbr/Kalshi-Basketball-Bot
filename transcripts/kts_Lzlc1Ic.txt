But Central Arkansas from Conway cheering Arkansas the Bears who have it first Active hands and a turnover Ken Evans the point guard for UNC coming over from Colorado State where he helped the Rams to a Mountain West Conference Championship Wilson swings it in the corner Trimble the baseline drive and the follow by Henry Vessar Theres the size the Arizona transfer We have seen Hubert Davis use Caleb Wilson a lot in that mid post back to the basket and he shows you the skill set The crosscourt pass that led to the shot and then the follow up the offensive board by Vesson Thats the Princeton offense Its high low Marble the five with the assist to Cole McCormack They run their stuff Central Arkansas there Princeton with really good pace Entry pass and Wilson with his first two points as a Tarheel with a couple of exclamation points Some old school Carolina basketball right there A little high low Very nice delivery by Vesar And then the length right in front of that rim by Wilson That size for Carolina going to be an issue for Central Arkansas Here is Rashad Balden too cheering strong He was one of the top scorers in division 2 last year Jiren Stevenson the Alabama transfer in and out A 610 wing who can really shoot it from three And those wings are running right to the corners They are sprinting to the corners and Stevenson is outstanding finding that spot catching and shooting Balden offline The rebound by Vesar cheering Evans Another guy can shoot at the lob instead for Caleb Wilson Wilson is so good at changing ends of the floor and part of it is hes hungry to score and when those guards throw it to him he knows hes going to get it Its more of a motivating carrot What a find by Evans Thats a Tarheel team this year that wants to run McCormick lines up the three A young man who originally signed with John Schulman the Central Arkansas head coach when Scholman was at D2 Alabama Huntsville Caleb Wilson is feasting above the rim and hes just in that dunker spot and I dont know whos guarding him I mean nobody has put a body on him He is running free to the rim and we get an early foul Hes just camping underneath He is sprinting ahead of the field A really good find with his head up by Evans there And then just you know in that dunker spot Nobody The Le side defender there That guard not come dropping down to get in front of Wilson The foul was on Kenne Evans who lays it in at the other end This is how North Carolina wants to play Granted you know who the opponent is Youve got a talent advantage but this is what they want to get back to It is If youre Central Arkansas one thing you can do though you can control is taking care of the basketball you know the two turnovers cheering the one to start the game and then the run out there I mean these are not really forced A little bit of nerves I think playing in this building watched him come in for practice yesterday they were taking all the videos I mean its such a moment for a school like Central Arkansas to come here and play and be in this building When I talked to their head coach John Schulman last week he said Listen part of playing here is that experience These players he said will be able to tell their grandkids they played at the Dean Dome Three no good Batted around but we get a foul underneath on Central Arkansas You know weve heard a lot Anish all off season about the size that North Carolina has added Yeah theyre starting 610 610 7 ft on their front line The question is how does size manifest Looks good on paper but these guys theyve added I mean they are not in the mold of Bacott or Hanssboro Theyre not the physical enforcers those guys are Bessar the offensive rebound Wilson another stuff Thats four dunks Thats how you inflate the old shooting percentage That one doesnt go and the rebound to Trimble in the lane through the contact and hes got two free throws coming North Carolina early and and weve made the point about the size advantage but they are mashing the offensive glass cheering and the crowd you hear is Luca Bogots coming into the game Here the chance of Luke Uh he played professionally in Europe There was a clearance issue He was cleared by the NCAA but not by North Carolina until 30 minutes before tipoff cheering He didnt play in either of the two exhibition games 22 years old played in the wellrespected Adriatic League where he averaged almost 15 a game and shot 40 from three Well hes coming off his best season as a pro He was their second leading scorer Say that again As a pro Yeah no question I mean thats where we are now man But the fact of the matter is he had a great year last year and it was a great get late for Hubert Davis and hes going to give him a real weapon on the perimeter Javvon Guy King knocks down the shot Hes back at Central Arkansas after sitting out last year due to an NCAA rules infraction Theres Bovance Its poked away by Guy King In terms of first impressions and opening statements Caleb Wilson gave UNC a call me Ishmael Lets music music get over here Lets go Lets go Now back on the favorite chicken presents the world famous alpaca chicken to contest tonight with the 50 gift First up with the chicken Next up is Hayden Hayden has the blue chicken Again these are not real chickens Really Okay next up for the yellow chicken is Tommy Tommy you got a chance to win Congratulations to Tommy The chicken go Lets get cheering Lets go Heat Heat NH Chris Bullah Its year five for Hubert Davis That first season ended with an appearance in the national championship game Theyve had some years on the bubble last year Last team in Not everybody agreed but North Carolina ended up in the field of 68 Well Hubert had a mission You know he had a mission this offseason They wanted to add size and they wanted to add perimeter shooting And they have done both of those things They want to become become better defensively and they want to become better on the glass you know especially on the offensive glass They were 206th North Carolina 206th in the country last year in offensive rebounding percentage And so you could already tell early in this game you go back to that B BYU exhibition game they had 18 offensive rebounds Theyre already mashing the offensive glass here that size is having an impact Thats been a hallmark of the great UNCC teams The three from Evans 45 from beyond the arc last year And thats what he does best Ste its been a he has not been his best so far in these first two exhibition games And I think part of it is hes thinking a little bit too much You know you get these guys who come in a Cayenne Evans Hes making a lot of money Hes you know being at North Carolina is a lot different than being at Colorado State There are inherent pressures that I think hes feeling in the first couple games Just got to settle down play more instinctively And if theres a question as to whether he is a true point guard Hubert Davis said Listen I view the point guard position holistically Bogots down the lane and hes got his first two as a Tarhill Well there has not been a lot of resistance from this Central Arkansas defense I mean thats just a straight line drive untouched Now a turnover ahead to Trimble Look out cheering applause And a timeout by John Schulman cheering UNC dominating the paint getting run outs in transition Off to a roaring start Luca Bogabots making his his appearance here first official appearance and hes a differencemaker You know hes very good We mentioned his shooting but hes very good out of the pick and roll I mean there there was no defense just a straight line drive but hes a connector You know he understands how to play 22 years old Hes got a bounce to him Just watching him in practice yesterday theres a life and a bounce to him and energy about the game thats infectious Your turnover there This is Ty Robinson Now Luke Moore John Schman said hes been practicing better than anybody Guy King for three Back iron Offensive rebound Put back No And the second try is there by Chris Mason Hes built like a tight end Nice job staying with the play by Mason Mason with a block at the other end on Boabots Cameron Hunter won in black former ace son freshman of the year had a couple of really nice seasons with Central Arkansas Then had an injury then last year transferred to Wisconsin and learned a lesson that unfortunately a lot of guys learn The grass isnt always greener Didnt play a whole lot Only scored three points all season but decided to come back to Central Arkansas He is an Arkansas native This Bears team won nine games last year but they did win a conference tournament game for the first time in three years Guy King an open three And thats good This Princeton offense these bigs theyve got a rotating threeheaded monster at their big position Central Arkansas they do a lot of facilitating a lot of passing at the top of the key cheering One poked away by Hunter It comes back to the freshman Dixon Three grazing the front rim and the put back by Bovots to clean up the miss by Powell Hes just active Boabots Hes active He plays hard and hes hungry to score cheering Moore lost it Here comes Powell The West Virginia transfer SR down low lost it out of bounds And thats where Vesar again like how does his size manifest I mean he was met there by Masons body and it leads to a turnover You know Vesar the other night in that Winston Salem State game had one rebound in 21 minutes Sevenfooter Youd think a second rebound would just kind of fall into your hands accidentally I mean thats where you know how does his size manifest as the anchor for this North Carolina team especially on the glass but even on a play where youre trying oneonone to go against other size how does he hold up Foul on Dixon You brought up the point to Hubert Davis before the game You said Yes youve got size but the physicality component matters It does I mean cuz Jiren Stevenson 610 but but hes not a physical specimen Hes not a rebound like the size These guys have not been rebounders at their past stops Mason launches No rebound Dixon cheering Foul on Mason as Vessar tried to carve out space It was cool Mason walked into the building yesterday and he was talking to one of his teammates and he said Im like a little kid This is a dream come true I never imagined I would be playing in this building Its one of the iconic venues in college basketball Theres Stevenson They want him to do that more Take the ball to the basket Bogots Vessar battling for the rebound Its loose and a whistle underneath Saturday the ACC huddle crew will be in Charlottesville where Virginia football is in first place by itself in the ACC Its funny their one losses to NC State in what was a scheduled nonconference game Theyre undefeated in league play and they get Wake Forest at home They close with Duke and Virginia Tech The path to an ACC championship game appearance is right there Offensive rebound Powell a 3 and D guy at West Virginia Now Dixon freshman You have to ask Bogamots twice to shoot it You know this Carolina team this year is going to have a different gravity than last years You know teams by the end of last season were so gapped up on North Carolina They just did not respect their ability to shoot it but they were afraid of Elliot Kadau RJ Davis Seth Trimble driving to the basket Youre going to have to respect this team Its going to help their spacing a lot with the number of shooters that they can put out there on the floor Foul on Hunter his first Theres Bovots again Stevenson can shoot it from the outside as can Powell So can Vesar Parker Applegate pulled down the rebound Ty Robinson looking for help Golden lost it Marble missed the bunny Got to make layups playing in a game like this Powell catch and release Yes And thats the ability to change floors ends of the floor for for North Carolina And again those wings are running to the corners and those guys are ready to shoot cheering Heels want to push Powell thought about it One of the things Hubert Davis has had to preach shot selection Powell pulls the trigger this time and the rebound by Balden Balden fades Rebound Dixon cheering Bogots lines it up and knocks it down Its what he does best cheering applause Tai Robinson wearing the mask because he broke his nose recently in practice cheering Thats a traveling call Luca Bokeabots Hes in the building and he is hungry to shoot Rise and fire Luca service SECU family care and home live every day Community supporters are about our family house countless ways from Thanksgiving to meals and so much more UNC cheering and their families are proud to support the mission of the SEC Joining us on the call tonight are our director of strategic initiatives George is director of public services as well operations manager for SEC Ladies and gentlemen life cycle for SECU and the families that you serve each and every day right here Okay its time for smile presented by Dunville North Carolina Lets see those faces No time Go Look at me Caleb Wilsons off to a hot start I dont think Central Arkansas music has seen a dude like this a maximum problem and its been all at the basket and and if this is the default setting for Caleb Wilson like his opportunity to show that face up shot will come But if his default setting is attack the basket attack the offensive glass be relentless attacking that paint hes going to have a heck of a year cuz hes hyper efficient when he gets there so long and athletic Weve heard of the comparisons and one of the names that keeps popping up Chris is Marvin Williams You buy that Yeah Well its a lot to live up to Marvin Williams a heck of a player But yeah I mean its Look he is in this mold of what NBA teams want now where you can plug a guy in of that size and length and versatility You can plug him in any position You can switch him to put him on the perimeter put him on the block and hes a really humble kid Like he he is all about learning and all about the game The relationship he and and coach Davis have developed already is excellent Guy King misses on a three Tar Hills running again Its Trimble the switcheroo Tap by Vessar Not there Here comes Central Arkansas now Luke Moore the freshman was directed traffic Im not sure if Central Arkansas followed Heres Moore now Marble with five Its taken away by McCormack Intercepted by Vessar cheering He gets tied up and a foul on the floor Thats on JB on Guy King Thats number two And that puts Carolina in the bonus You know its interesting Carolina for so long had been a program that played two bigs and then the game you know kind of went away that the the trip to the final four Carolina found something in in Brady Manic at that stretch four position But you look at the Final Four last year three of the four teams in that final four were playing two base You know Duke the only team that that wasnt doing that What does that tell you You know I think rebounding has become a as Hubert has said all offseason a determining he calls it the number one determining factor in winning games And so I think the the ability to dominate the glass to extend possessions with the offensive glass I think has become a big thing in a 40minute game cheering And for years North Carolina would be amongst the best rebounding teams in the country McCormack way off And theres multiple ways of doing it I mean like North Carolina in ball screens theyre going to switch or in any screen theyre going to switch one through four Theyve had Vesar in drop coverage shown some different looks with him Houston one of those teams in the Final Four plays two bigs theyre very aggressive So theres a lot of different ways of doing it I think with Carolina size they have the versatility particularly with Caleb Wilson at that four position Little bit of a press here by Central Arkansas Starters back in for UNCC Kyan Evans helped Colorado State to the NCAA tournament last year Trimble drops it off Alvesar the 7oot Estonian gets the friendly roll Its good poise Caught it in traffic Caught it amongst two bodies kept his feet and he could finish with both hands in there Very skilled cheering 120 run for UNCC Moores pass deflected Wilson got a hand on it Moore probably an illadvised shot with 15 on the shot and a foul 3313 Carolina in control music Okay we are there So thats is to tack toe Our contestants tonight are Joe Joe is using the Harris Tees and using four points pieces Go Theyll need to make a layup Grab the logo place on the board The first one to get the road wins On your mark set go is in the dark blue shirt Joe is in the camera Heat applause cheering Heat Got you Beautiful Good John Schulman part of a basketball family He says wife Amy is the star of the family a Hall of Fame player at ETSU former conference player of the year His son JC is a walkon currently at Central Arkansas He his other two sons and Max is now an assistant coach with him as well Basketball is the family tie As as John Schulman says hes living out his dream He he is as good as it gets in the coaching profession Hes got a heart of gold Yeah he was saying he he had never been to the state of Arkansas before he interviewed for the job And it was a challenge Jam mean Central Arkansas has not had a winning season or theyve had one in 18 years and that one year they went 18 and 17 So outside of having uh Pippen as an alum like its not a program with great winning tradition he took up the challenge and hes a great guy to do it and hes just a just an all a coachs coach He had success at Chattanooga where he took the Mox to two NCAA tournaments had a great run at division 2 Alabama Huntsville before coming to Central Arkansas See the versatility of Wilson who can guard almost any position on the floor Trimble open back iron offensive rebound Wilson Now Boats Wilsons got a mismatch Shot clock at three and Tremble fouled on the drive by Burn Following our game opening night continues South Carolina State goes to Louisville 11th ranked Cards and Ryan Conwell coming your way after were done in Chapel Hill I know the ACCs taken its lumps the last few years Theres a lot of optimism for good reason this year Yeah I I I think there should be Um you know Louisville is an interesting case this year Uh they had a really great year last year in in year one of Pat Kelsey You know its interesting in their two exhibition games They did not shoot the three well and they were a volume threepoint shooting team They got that in the portal Thats who Pat Kelsey has always been They did not shoot it well in that Kansas exhibition and lost They made 23 threes I mean devastating number of threes in the second exhibition against Bucknell Their backcourt made 18 of the 23 threes So thats theres a volatility there that concerns you and theyre not close to being the defensive team that they were last year yet Pick near the top of the ACC Duke the preseason favorite Boas tries to keep it in bounds and was knocked out of bounds by Robinson Well take another look You know North Carolinas done a nice job in their defense today You know they have been prepared for the Princeton Theyve been prepared for the back doors Theyve been really hard on the basketball Theyve gotten into the ball and theyve been in denial 150 run for UNCC Aiden High kicks it back out and the three cheering good by Kenne Evans Hes got nine his second three Nice relocation by Evans finding that line and a good pass by High who played much better in their second exhibition game Hunter three not there Hes still looking for his first points I thought about it Puts it on the floor turns it over Zaden Highback after a oneyear suspension Former top 100 recruit Mason on the baseline Thats going to play at the Y 20 years from now too It sure is We step aside with Carolina up 3915 Were back in 30 seconds Heat Heat College football Saturday SMU looking to build off the win against Miami last week Miami gets Syracuse music which lost to North Carolina on Friday night The Orange in that game started a true freshman walkon who came to school on a music lacrosse scholarship and then Florida State and Clemson Im not sure many of us saw four and four against three and five in November between those two Your first lacrosse mention of the night Its one hitting the under Center square on the bingo card for you Come to Trimble Wilson misfires We got a foul on the floor against Central Arkansas the shooting development if you want to call it that of Caleb Wilson is going to be a story to follow through this season There are two things with him in in terms of his development Uh the ability to shoot it which is going to come cuz hes got the tools Its a little bit flat but its there The other thing is consistent effort When he wants to play he can play hard and he competes and he gets after it But there are times where he will take plays off Hell job back defensively Hell stand up Its easy when youre matched up oneonone with AJ Deansa to want to get into that dude and to play hard But thats the thing where if Caleb Wilson you know finds that playing every play that motor that consistent motor obviously his ceiling is already really really high That was the marquee in that BYU exhibition game out in Salt Lake City in the bats of the number one player coming out of high school Wilson The number five player and Caleb more than held his own 22 points 10 rebounds Robinson over Wilson who may have gotten a piece Ogavad almost lost it Wilson on the baseline and cheering the hammer Hes got 10 points on five dunks cheering Youre going to shoot a high percentage if youre dunking everything Rashad Balden on his fourth school cheering 24 game at Mississippi College a D2 school last year Thats his first field goal He was 0 for four prior Wilson against Mason Drops it off to high Knocked out of bounds Stays with North Carolina Caleb Wilson I mean not much resistance and he throws a little sizzle onto that What a first half You know weve seen a lot of high low I mean this is again old school Carolina That secondary break flowing into that high low and a nice dive off of uh off of that post pass down to Caleb Wilson by Zayen High Bigs playing together in tandem Ogabotss no good James Brown into the game for North Carolina He and Zayen High Theyre looking for those guys to be their depth on the front line as Marble has the easy flush Marble only a freshman game one Welcome to Chapel Hill One of the things for John Schulman all three of his bigs are really young and they have such a responsibility in that offense You said Marble especially has a five as Wilson draws the foul at five in the Princeton offense often is the orchestrator Caleb Wilson making some sweet music for UNC in half number one Hes got 10 Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the Carolina Girls Dance Team cheering Get around The Carolina Girls Trust Still going to continue today Yeah Hey hey R Anish Shro called Caleb Wilson Valley hooded and in our open he is bi hooping in this first half All five of his made field goals are dunks and he just shows you the length around the basket You know again if thats his default setting attack the paint and attack the rim hes going to have a big time year And you were mentioning his numbers mentioning his numbers in the exhibition games The thing that stood out to me he had 20 rebounds in the two games Eight of them were offensive rebounds He had six blocks in the two games So I mean hes a twoway player like he is is every bit as impactful on the defensive end made the point hes switching out on on point guards and and getting down in a stance and defending that just a multidimensional talent A McDonalds AllAmerican a fivestar the number five player in the ESPN 100 And yeah to your point he checks off a lot of what Hubert Davis wanted in the offseason and he gives you size He gives you positional versatility Gives you rebounding especially on the offensive end Those were all needs for North Carolina coming into the season As we get a foul on the floor well and he gives you a top end top five pick talent that North Carolina has been synonymous with I mean thats a dude and Carolina has always had dudes Its out of bounds to Central Arkansas We were talking before the game 2019 is the last time the Tar Hills had a lottery pick And thats going to change It sure is That was Kobe White and Cam Johnson Its not a long period of time for a lot of programs For this one it is You look up in the Raptors Its basically a whos who of college basketball Dixon picks up his second foul Thats another freshman they have who they have a chance to bring along slowly But when you watch the BYU game he seems to potentially be a guy who can run some point for you at North Carolina this season Hes a true point guard and and I think thats a position that theyre still in discovery phase You know they they lost over 350 assists in RJ Davis and Elliot Cadau So like whos setting the table whos initiating your offense in the half court And the thing you love about Dixon is hes got positional size defensively And thats the one area with Ken Evans I think hes going to get picked on early I I think teams are going to go after Evans to test him Javian Guy King picks up his third foul You mentioned Dixon size 65 200 as a freshman from Vienna Virginia at his high school ball at Gonzaga College in Washington DC And you dont lose shooting with him on the floor He he made 80 threes last year during his high school season at Gonzaga Powell can shoot it from the outside Dixon passes Five to shoot Bovots launches in and out Luke Moore the true freshman and stays with the Bears You just cant simulate in your practice if youre Central Arkansas this length and size that North Carolina has You get into that paint and youre just not used to seeing that length Central Arkansas out of the Atlantic Sun Last season was John Schulmans first at the helm Team plagued by injuries McCormack with an easy two Really nicely done That pass knocked away by Moore and we get a foul cheering Its going to be on Wilson his second Thats the other area of concern for North Carolina Turnovers You know they had 19 in that game against BYU and a lot of them careless you know there are basketball turnovers where youre being aggressive or you know somebody doesnt catch the ball or theres you know theres a bad call but a lot of their turnovers in that BYU game especially were of the careless you know not paying attention to detail variety Thats the challenge for a lot of these teams early in the season You have so many new faces so many teams undergo an extreme makeover in the off season these days figuring out how to play together The continuity that used to be a hallmark of great teams no longer there McCormack finally healthy Played most of last year He had turftoe Took about four months off this summer Tough kid Sophomore from Chattanooga John Schulman used to coach Stevenson driving and fouled North Carolina in the double bonus You know talking to to John Schulman he really likes his guards especially for the Atlantic Sun and he was he was telling us if in the Ace Sun if if you have the best guards youre going to win And that was the case I had a chance to call the A Sun Championship last year with with Mike Monaco that that was the case I mean the two teams in that game Lipkcom who won the A Sun won that game Will Puit Joe Anderson outstanding guards And then for for North Alabama a guard named Jakari Lane was outstanding I mean the the best guards in that league dominated that championship game And you know Lipkcom had the the most outstanding player in the league Jacob Anasovic who really wasnt a factor in the game So it just goes to show you what kind of what Schulman was saying And if you have guards in a league like that you got a chance to win the league Jaden Young of a Virginia Tech transfer Knocks down a three A lot less on his plate this year He was asked to be a shot creator last year for the Hokes Now he gets to come off the bench be an energy guy Final 90 seconds of an opening half dominated by North Carolina Hunter on the drive Reverse layup No good Tough first half for Cameron Hunter cheering Young Another three Bessar offensive rebound and a held ball is the call Possession arrow to the heels I think the other thing that North Carolina is looking for is an emotional leader and Vesar showed you a little bit of that in the BYU exhibition game Like there was some emotion coming from Henry Vesar You did not see it in the Winston Salem State game And obviously in a blowout here youre not going to see it a ton but thats I think theyre looking for that vocal emotional leader out there in game on the floor Evans connects Cant leave him that wide open His third three of the half Hes got 12 He was eight for 13 in the NCAA tournament last year from three Hunter against Bessar maneuvers around the sevenfooter but cant finish Hes getting to his spot now He just like you said hes having a hard time putting the ball in the basket Timeout North Carolina You know Ken Evans again this is what he does He is a shooter And as you mentioned I mean he lit it up especially at the end of last year Colorado State Medv put him into the starting lineup They were five and five at the time They went 21 and five the rest of the way Made the NCA tournament Of course lost in that outstanding tournament game when Derek Queen from Maryland hit that buzzer beater that runner off the glass And Evans was playing alongside a terrific player Ne Clifford So he he really came on and and gave them a spark The question is can he be that that consistent point guard Can you be an ACC night in music night out point guard who you hand the ball to at 700 and he gives it back to you at nine with everything taken care of as Skip Proer used to say And I think thats we know he can shoot Can he defend his position and can he run an offense at Colorado State He really didnt have to be a true point guard here at least to begin the season Hes in that role But Hubert Davis told us Hey we feel like weve got multiple guys who can pass Positional versatility The Switchblade the Da Vinci and High Tops Thats what everybody wants these days Four to shoot Trimble has it poked away by Moore Hes got a run out Hell launch and misfire And thats how the first half ends Are they a sponsor I dont know what theyre doing I dont know Ill stay away from it now The drop off down low and Central Arkansas the first two points here in the second half Its the first two points of the game for Cameron Hunter Couple of years ago averaged 17 a game for this team Yeah hes their best player their best leader That was it was a rough first half I think adjusting to this building and certainly the size of North Carolina John Scholman calls him our Jaylen Brunson Besar thats too easy for the 7 foot Arizona transfer Another big to big pass High low pass coming from Wilson over the top and as you said just too big Robinson over Vesar Grazes the front rim Here comes Evans Now Trimble Nice move to split the D applause You got to know theyre coming I mean Central Arkansas has been caught a little bit offguard by Carolinas speed in the open floor Wild shot Marble grabs the offensive rebound I mean they are running long rebound turnovers they are out and a good look ahead and how athletic and dynamic is Seth Trimble in transition I mean hes so good attacking the basket can struggle at times to finish Had a layup at the end of that BYU game that he missed but so dynamic in the open floor Gets it Marble was called for the foul Wilson goes down hard pops up right away We get another foul Its on McCormick Thats going to be his third Central Arkansas committed 13 team fouls in the opening half Love to see Jiren Stevenson show something here in this second half Didnt hear much from him in the first cheering Best saw again with a good look applause Marble the freshman in the high post Hunters three short McCormick the offensive rebound and knocked out of bounds Last touch Central Arkansas Theres Stevenson Gives it up Trimble tied up Another foul on Central Arkansas already the third team foul in the second half Carolinas done a nice job in the early part of this season You know letting the ball see both sides Dribble handoffs movement some continuity ball wing ball screening Very much an offense thats going to be the sum of the parts You know they dont have that isolation guy McCormack to the bench He picked up his fourth Vasar on the high low Setting the screen Hes got a size advantage Shot clock at five They lob it down low One more Theres Stevenson Thats cheering what they want to see a little more of from Stevenson Hes a 610 guy who can shoot it They want to see some rebounding and some points in the paint cheering Pull up is not there by Balden The lob to Wilson Almost had dunk number six He is running to the front of the rim hungry to score And then he almost ended a life I mean my goodness What do the kids say Catch a body Foul is on Applegate his first You look at a kid like this and again true freshman What do you think the ultimate ceiling could be for a Caleb Wilson Its hard to even know at this point I mean again like hes already a dude who does effortbased things Hes hes clearly been coached to do that I think his processing his feel for the game will come And just like that play there like you can fall in love with your ability to shoot it Look out And you know players of that level man they got a lot of people in their ears a lot of people talking to them And as the year progresses Caleb Wilson has to understand that he is at his best attacking the paint and attacking the basket His ability to prove that face up shot will come Guarding the inbounds with a 7 foot wingspan Hunter spin move Hunter with the three John Scholman said when he got to Central Arkansas his first phone call was to Cameron Hunter Hunter decided to leave and to go to Wisconsin but Schman told him Hey listen Youre a Central Arkansas guy As Wilson knocks down his first field goal that is not a dunk Ends up being a three You were asking about his ceiling If he starts doing that right stratosphere whats above the stratosphere I believe we have uh what is that Apollo 51 Whats Whats out there taking those beautiful pictures out there and out of space Is the Hubble telescope still a thing Were out of our depth Time out Central Arkansas applause Well I dont know whats out there beyond the stratosphere Certainly something Caleb Wilson will probably end up there at some point He has shown you a heck of a night music music Heat Heat cheering cheering Heat Heat cheering cheering music of the truth Hallelujah Good idea Heat music Heat This game pits the alma modders of maybe the greatest tandem in basketball music history Michael Jordan a star at North Carolina at Central Arkansas the alma mater of Scotty Pippen Central Arkansas was an NIA music school when Pippen played there He was 61 when he got there 67 when he left And Jordan taken music third overall in the 84 draft Pippen the fifth overall pick in the 87 draft Horus Grant went 10th in that 87 draft And those three were the foundational pillars of that first Bulls dynasty I was hoping that uh the two guys would use this game as an opportunity to get back together You know the olive branch speaking terms after the whole last dance airrings Uh they seem to have a falling out Held ball Theres the defense by Wilson Possession arrow UNC He is showing you the full kit bag tonight the full arsenal from Caleb Wilson 16 for Wilson Vasar And they say the basket does not count We step aside UNC up big music Lets go Sam Yeah lets go No water rusting bro Lets go Get that cheering 20 Let me know There it is cheering Watch out Chrispola part of the reason the ACC believes better things are in store this year Terrific transfer Paul but also this freshman class Outstanding I mean Cam Boozer has been unbelievable in the exhibition period for Duke Michael Brown had 28 in that exhibition against Bucknell Just an incredibly talented freshman class overall but certainly in this league Well get to see Mike El Brown tonight Louisville South Carolina State following our game No good by Evans Taken away by Balden Wilsons now switched on three players just on this one possession Balden gets the bounce And when you can switch one through four thats the other thing that neutralizes a lot of this Princeton stuff As long as you stay under these cuts Wilson draws yet another foul 13 against his second What is that Dunk number seven cheering Six Yeah And look hes super talented Weve made the point He has also not been challenged here tonight I mean Central Arkansas nobody gets in front of him I mean no Nobody has hardly touched him here tonight Its his sixth to dunk Hes seven for eight from the field 18 points a game high Moore offline for three Knocked out of bounds to North Carolina And Carolinas done a nice job under out of bounds That cut by Vesar you know attracts the defensive attention Then nobody steps in front of Wilson again Wide open When youre a freshman and you set foot on campus you know how you dont take the 500 course right away You ease into it a few 101s Oh your point is that the competition tonight Caleb Wilsons got a 101 102 Now hell get the higher level classes Theyre coming Well and he look he played really well against BYU and so did Carolina I mean to go on the road have 19 turnovers and only lose by two How about Zaden High applause They need a backup to Vessar I I think thats the the other question mark You know is it James Brown Is it Zayen High You know Highs Hes got a good energy about him Hes pretty skilled Hes certainly more skilled than James Brown Zaden High when he was in high school watched his height go from 61 to 610 as Applegate gets central Arkansas was held by Hunter Actually that was Guy King Thats four Yeah thats where Vesar you know only played about 21 minutes a game last year So was only playing about half the game Youre certainly going to play him more if youre Hubert Davis this year But you know foul trouble type of game youre going to have to have somebody behind to be able to step in and and anchor when Vesar is out Rico Bogavatz from Montenegro played professionally in Europe and its interesting a lot of publications list him as a freshman North Carolina lists him as a junior and that was part of the reason why his status was in flux The NCAA cleared him to play cheering Its not the easiest process to transfer credits from European colleges to North Carolina Its not as simple as hey send us your transcript And it was a lot of back and forth between North Carolina and his old college in Europe and they finally were able to get the credits resolved and it was resolved 30 minutes before tip But North Carolina classifies Bovots as a junior Thats going to be an offensive foul Interesting expression there by Boats You know you could tell hes been taught the game well though You know European players they come up in the game differently than the American grassroots player They they are taught the game much more from a skill standpoint more the step back Foul down low on high Thats the other thing with high is foul trouble has can be and has been an issue Got to got to be able to play without fouling Moore splits the D and uses the window Nice drive there Moores had the ball in his hands a lot here tonight and and having to deal with this Carolina pressure True freshman from Little Rock Powell no good Applegate the rebound John Schulman said that since they started practicing Moore has been their best player and its going to be hard to keep him off the floor Robinson in and out Here comes Dixon Powell No good Robinson on the drive over Bogavots snorts More that threepoint shot has just not been there and few of them have been just a bit outside Stevenson Its taken away by Robinson Thats where Stevenson plays smaller than 610 Ty Robinson the red shirt freshman from Hot Springs to the free throw line when we come back music performing for the Bears Thats all for lacrosse cheering cheering Oh my god Next round North Carolina Do you think cheering Hills destination must be shown to win that day Ken Evans was one of the big offseason transfer portal additions for North Carolina Yeah hes been very good tonight You know hes been I think a little more instinctual music Hes let the game come to him and he has shot it well You know thats what I think everybody was kind of hoping for This is what he does best but hes been in control Hes been very good in transition you know driving the ball and and finding shooters Hes talented and and had a heck of a run at the end of last season for Colorado State Meanwhile the free throw by Tai Robinson was the first free throw attempt for Central Arkansas almost halfway through the second half Both free throws good for Robinson who missed most of last season with knee tendinitis originally signed with Dusty May at FAU and then came to Central Arkansas when May took the Michigan job Its the foul North Carolina in the bonus Thats where Jiren Stevenson he can be really really loud or really quiet He was very quiet in that first half And he wants to shoot I mean hes 610 and long and all that He wants to shoot And I think for Hubert Davis you know its its getting some of that buy in on attacking the glass today He only averaged about three rebounds a game at Alabama Reclassified to go to Alabama So hes still young for a junior and has been in some big games I mean they dont go to the final four two years ago without Jiren Stevenson You just like a little more dirty work a little more effortbased stuff from him Youre talking about that Elite Eight game where Alabama knocked off Clemson Stevenson had five threes scored 19 and in the Sweet 16 he was on the Bama team that beat North Carolina as Balden splashes in a three This was a kid who is well traveled Southern Miss McNise Division 2 Mississippi College now Central Arkansas Bogots with seven Left it a bit short Tried to rip away the rebound It comes to Balden Vesar had Cam Hunter on him for the bulk of that possession He has got to get the ball Marble spin cycle cheering and fouled by Vessar Saturday morning at 1000 am Eastern the ACC huddle crew heads to the ground The University of Virginia in Charlottesville Theyll get you ready for a full day of football Twohour music pregame show Virginia is leading the ACC in football undefeated in conference play 81 on the season The lone loss was weirdly a nonconference loss to NC State Theyve had some close calls Tony Elliotts team with a chance to get to the ACC championship if they take on if they take care of business down the stretch cheering Free throw no good by Marble Offensive rebound Hunter too much Last touch Central Arkansas Its not a night that Cam Hunters going to want to remember Hes a guy he oozes with confidence I mean he walked into the gym last night for their practice like he owned the place Dean Smith Center This is the Cam Hunter Center and it just has not been his night John Scholman says hes the hardest working guy on the team First guy into the gym and he says when thats your best player its cliche but theres a trickle down effect on everybody else on the team in this league Anish this asan gets decimated by the portal I mean John Schulman lost their best big last year Went to Minnesota for half a million dollars and hes played one minute in two exhibition games Nehemiah Turner So he took the money ran to Minnesota and is not going to play there I hope its worth it Well we saw that with Cameron Hunter just a year ago right He goes to Wisconsin and again got a lot of money to go to Wisconsin Never saw more than eight minutes in a game He only played 11 games averaged two minutes per game This was a guy who was the teams leading scoreer at Central Arkansas a couple of years before that Former ASON freshman of the year Listen the age of the transfer portal now when guys leave You cant burn the bridge because Cameron Hunter came back and you you start to see some of that a little bit A guy goes somewhere else You know what Wrong choice Grass wasnt greener and then cheering they come back to the school where they used to play Yeah And look Im not bismerching half a million dollars Thats lifechanging money for for for most But when you get old and gray the things you remember are the relationships the opportunities to play the opportunities to be a part of a growing program like John Schuman is building at Central Arkansas And we know about the portal What what I dont know if people realize is leagues like the Atlantic Center getting killed by the port Bessar cheering with the twohanded slam And you think about it right A lot of these coaches in the smaller leagues theyre doing a lot of grunt work finding zero star onestar guys underrecruited lightly recruited They spend the time to develop those players And then a year or two in a big school comes in with a big money offer And again when youre talking that kind of money for some guys as you said lifech changing you cant fault them But then youre a smaller program Youre going Wait we just put all that time and effort into growing you as a basketball player Now youre leaving us and now somebody else gets your best ears Well you have to get creative I mean theres a lot of good players out there like Ben McCollum at Drake last year took a lot of guys from his D2 stop prior to Drake You know John Schulman telling us yesterday they have a lot of D2 transfers on their roster He said Look I dont we dont look down on D2 guys cuz we are cheering D2 guys So you got to get creative I think the student section was bored because Central Arkansas hasnt shot enough free throws tonight Im told that was a promotion That wasnt the student section Thats on the other end If you miss two in a row thats a cookie cookie Okay Robinson hoists and hits How many guys like Seth Trimble are still around Four years one program cheering Good defense there by Moore denying Wilson Robinson tight ropes the baseline Applegate has it poked away Evans with the help TWO GUYS WENT UP for the alleyoop triple and Wilson Two guys who can play above the rim Good ball movement here by Central Arkansas Robinson hits the open three I love it man Two guys fighting over an alley Seth Treble says Not now freshman But how about Vesar What a night hes had Youll find that length down in central Arkansas down music in Conway Im not a lot of great number applause Heat Heat Heat Heat cheering and applause Yeah cheering thank you Thats all Who wants this Chris Who wants it As said Trimble said Im Im normally the big dog around here Stand down freshman You know normally when youre the passer there music too they tell you to call out the name of the guy youre throwing it to Ken Evans wanted no part of that Here you go boys Trimbles like Ive been doing that for three years And Caleb Wilson says Well have you watched me tonight intercepted by Applegate Junior from Murreeysboro Tennessee the Australian Truman Burn That was Ken Evans first turnover of the night Got to put that up at the backboard Bes get it Robinson misfires Trimble Nice looking move applause Hes now in double figures Five Tarheelss with at least 10 points Now if youre Kansas scouting North Carolina your your defensive game plan has to start with halting the momentum of Evans and Trimble in transition They are so much better and so good at creating in transition in the open floor than they are in the half court yet Nice feed high cheering low big to big Wilson to Vessar applause You ever watch the movie with Paulie Shore Sorry Brendan Frasier and Cen Man Yes Yes And Cen Man was from Monia Yes thats right Mike Bessar Good call by you I did not have a Paulie Shore mention coming up tonight And that may be Paulie Shores only good movie 80 to 49 with five and a half to go in the second half Im not hating on it A good Incino man reference I wonder how Inino Man holds up Robinson no good We get some subs in Derek Dixon four fouls The freshman top 60 recruit three in white Chris Jaden Young is an interesting piece for North Carolina because he was a significant contributor last year for Mike Young in Blackburg Yeah he hes you know hes one of those guys who has to stay ready off of that bench cuz he can shoot Hes another one of those guys they brought in who can shoot and hes been well coached to your point about Mike Young You know he comes into this program having been well schooled and taught Caleb Wilson with a chance to get to 20 points at the free throw line Thats one of those things Anish 11 new guys on your roster and they have a lot of guys who believe that they can come in and help and contribute Thats where that discovery process you know the BYU game you got the Kansas game that schedule we showed earlier theyre going to know about themselves by the time you get into ACC play And I think one of the things Hubert Davis and this that staff are looking for is differentiation separation between guys so you know as this year unfolds who those guys are in specific moments Friday a game against Kansas Michigan State later this month Kentucky early December Those games reveal a lot about who you are and who can play The other part of it though we were talking about this pregame So many teams with so many new faces and youre playing these marquee nonconference games early in the year The outcomes of those games shape narratives around teams and conferences And then often times teams improve once a league play starts Oh Uhoh cheering 22 points for Wilson Look out There he goes Elevation but no Wilson with a big grin on his face cheering We get a whistle What a block there without fouling And then what a look ahead And how about that Sharon the sugar cheering applause A standing ovation for the freshman in his Tarheel debut 22 points four rebounds three assists for the fivestar Caleb Wilson Dixon Eight field goals for Caleb Wilson Seven of them slam dunks First career double double Henry Hey USA Hey USA applause and cheering Heat Heat Heat Heat Tyler Hanssbro in the 06 sixth season had the highest scoring average for a freshman in Tarheelss history Thats a pretty darn good list Bill Ford in the house tonight Joe Forte Rashad McCants Cole Anthony Caleb Wilson after one game 22 points Yeah in two exhibition games already at 23 and 22 So hes been 20 plus in all three of the games that they have played And there has not been one shot where youd say he forced that shot You know we were talking about shot selection earlier He only took 10 shots made a three had seven dunks got to the foul line six times It was interesting talking to Hubert Davis about Caleb Wilson and hes talking about how many questions Caleb cheering asks Just a a curious mind about the game cheering You said a lot of young guys especially with the pedigree of Caleb Wilson come in They think they know everything and its a kid who wants to learn and wants to learn how to get better and is very comfortable with the fact he doesnt have all the answers Isaiah Dennis freshman from Charlotte another fourstar top 60 recruit checks in See Dennis has that finger on his right hand bandaged He missed half of his senior year with a broken finger and then reinjured it in the summer Theres Dennis Brown to high Luke Moore That high low has been well executed tonight lot of dribbling by Moore Masons pass stolen away cheering Jaden Young with the twohanded slam applause Moore finally knocks down a three Been a tough shooting night for him Two for nine and just one of six from three prior to that shot off the steel More turbines Rebound James Brown off the miss by Beichum Two minutes to go Young lines it up No good Offensive rebound Brown This is Dixon for three cheering applause cheering Hes going to just get better as the year goes on I I like Dixon a lot applause Following our game we get you out to the KFC Yum Center Louisville and South Carolina State Jay Alter Terren Olesby standing by Louisville preseason number 11 and picked to finish second in the ACC Both teams emptying their bench here Evan Smith a walkon knocks it away for UNCC I go back to what John Schulman told me about why this game was scheduled He and his friendship with Jeff Lebo They worked together at three different stops Scholman worked under Lebo at both Tennessee Tech and Chattanooga took over for Lebo when he left the Chattanooga job for Auburn And he mentioned Lebo taking him to UNC a long time ago for a coachs clinic And he says I cheering I see Dean Smith and Larry Brown and youre aruck cheering and it doesnt fall for Thomas Dennis calls the three Couple of baskets here by Isaiah Dennis in the waning seconds cheering Its got to feel good and all hes got through Get your first points here tonight Pum Now this is a moment for a lot of these guys who may not see the floor Knocking a shot at the Dean Dome on your way out cheering applause Evan Smith will dribble out the clock North Carolina cruises to a 9454 win in its season opener 24 consecutive
