going to force you to play in a half court set Able to run the shot clock down offensively So Stanford needs to box out Get these do not allow a second chance opportunities Tip is controlled by Stanford and we are underway here at Maples Pavilion Here are the starters for Stanford Same starters they had last time out They are 30 on the season 20 and three at home under Cal Smith cheering Thats what the raging cage is going to force you to do Play in a half court set One shot and out See if Stanfords going to be able to play defensively cuz we know the raging cage is going to take the shot clock down Same five for Louisiana from their last matchup They lost 8862 at McNe State A fellow Louisiana program And a nice jumper knocked down by Joshua Lewis Hes the highest recruited player ever to sign with Louisiana Top 60 recruit They never had one before Apar did a great job defensively That was better offense McCory couldnt get the tough one to go And then down low thats cheering a a foul called against Louisiana cheering And pardon me Theyre going to call that against Stanford I was going to say because we know that the raging cages They do foul a lot which plays into the hands of Stanford Initially it looked like the call was going against go against the raging cages There you see Kyle Smith They want to shoot free throws Stanford last year set a program record for free throw percentage That was against the grad transfer AJ Rozi who started as a walkon for a couple of years for Kyle Smith at Washington State went to Claremont Mud Scripts as a D3 allAmerican and now this is his first year a grad year at Stanford Stanford want to shoot free throws raging cinjun teams shoot 24 free throws per game against their half court set cheering and theres an offensive foul first turnover of the game for the raging cinjun First theyre going to play 94 feet that show a 221 pester press Juanis White was talking to us about Joshua Lewis He said Hey I coached Jerus Walker I coached LJ Crier Walker with the Pacers and Crier with the Warriors I know what an NBA player looks like and Joshua Lewis has that potential Keys to the game for Stanford is attack the raging cinjun offensively and create live ball turnovers Stanford plus seven turnovers per game Thats one of the best marks in the ACC Heres a Cororey out to the right wing Akara the Harvard transfer Second year on the farm Warming defense and the turnover from the raging cinjun Thats what theyre going to do Theyre going to shrink the court force you to play in 47 ft So far so good Weave up top Nice move by Woodson Out Lever right free throw line extended Jumper knocked down by Deian Lever Hes from Melville Louisiana Just about an hour north of Lafayette On the other end Leverne trying to draw a foul Gets called for the foul But that is a big key Caught talking to Quanis White He has nine players from Louisiana He wants to own the state and that is the backbone of this program Players from the state of Louisiana Of course Quanis White grew up in New Orleans First up for Stanford Ryan Aggerwall who missed a game because of illness Hes been a little bit hurt this year Uh he was a key part for the Stanford attack last year had 29 starts scored seven points per game This year just four points on the season but theyre trying to get him going A really good shooter from Texas You see theyre jumping out on the ball screens Theyre attacking it cheering Foul will keep it here down low I think theyre going to get Evans on that one And again we know Louisiana will foul Thats something that theyre prone to do Stanford being patient on the offensive end They want to get opportunities to get to the free throw line Thats three fouls early in the first half Paul Cells Michael Greenstein Chris Casey officiating crew tonight Thats one area Tim when you get a lot of fouls play aggressive defense but it your bench has to be long in that situation there because youre going to play a lot of players in this high active defense Came drives it in Thats a really tough shot Roi couldnt get the second effort It went all the way down and out And the raging cinjuns finished New Orleans native gets the rebound cheering defense from Stanford Cardinals still havent scored Geler in transition and he travels But one of the keys to this game is going to be pace Louisianas in the bottom 15 in the country Stanford last year was in the 200s the low 200s in terms of pace This year for Kyle Smith and company theyre 87th in pace So Louisiana wants to play slow Stanford wants to play fast Yeah Stanford gets up 66 shots per game while Louisiana gets 53 shots per game in four games this season Heres Jackson Alvera is a Pepperdine transfer Scored 27 against Gonzaga last year cheering Heres another foul against the raging cinjun Kairen Ratliff another New Orleans native Its the rare returnee his fourth year with Louisiana and already I mean 1640 left in the first half first three minutes and change of this game Theres been four fouls against the Raging Cinjun and thats what we talked about Youre going to get opportunities due to their aggressive defense You just have to be patient offensively Wow Finger roll from Okorei Cory was able to get downhill split the defense and finger rolled it right over the front of the rim Almost got the steal Hes played three games at Stanford 26 points 29 points 21 points Hows that for a start Been outstanding As we talked about at the top telecast three straight 20point games since Tyrell Terry did it cheering and applause Going to the rim was OA call side out They might call free throws there Comes back in They called that one against Geler by the way Second team foul first personal Louisiana much better start than McNe State game They were trailing by 21 at halftime Coach White said that better be a wakeup call for us He said sometimes you get a loss like that will uh get the attention of your team The lefty three long for Woodsy And this is where Louisiana may struggle in terms of shooting the ball from behind the arc simply because they put so much effort on the defensive end They usually cheering takes away your legs Just 30 for the season for Louisiana Apara nice dish Pakori three ball left wing Five points for Stanford and all five from the incredible freshman from New Hampshire Thats to be expected Al Smith called him our little superstar Stanford was was able to weather the storm early The Elite Eight lost to Camaran in Syracuse But uh coach White was telling me he owes a lot to coach Shaw with Stanford and introducing him to Kelvin Samson Bonis White would play for Kelvin Samson at Oklahoma Be a great assistant for me He played in the DLeague not the G League He played so long ago He played in the DLeague was a AAOU coach for 10 years in New Orleans and met back with Kelvin Samson 2017 at Houston and he built that thing from the ground up into right now Houston is as good of a program as there is in the country Theyve been in the top three the last three seasons And uh he said with Louisiana its going to be similar to Houston in terms of it takes time to build a program Well defense is all about effort and heart Its something you have to build You have the right have the right character players as we spoke about earlier Traveling calls and Stanford turns it over You see Louisiana off on defense kind of speeding up Stanford uh making the Cardinal play a little bit quicker than they want to Thats the third turnover against Stanford As we said earlier at the top of the telecast theyre going to force you to play in 47 ft take you out of your comfort zone You have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable playing against this team What are your keys for Louisiana tonight Controlling the tempo and limit free throw opportunities Stanford superstar freshman Becca Cororey with 20 free throws already in just three games Theres a turnover against Louisiana In for Stanford Division 2 transfer Jeremy Dent Smith got a BA in journalism from Cal State Dominguez Hills Twotime first team D2 allAmerican averaging seven points so far this year for Stanford You coached at the D2 level Dr Wallace how big of a jump is it from D2 to D1 It depends on what conference youre going into Its a big jump however but hes doing well since hes got up at this point Camman down low was fouled on his way up and theyll have two free throws for Hayden Camman the red shirt sophomore from Massachusetts Been a lot of division 2 to division one transfers You think about Ben McCollum He went from Northwestern Missouri State to Drake last year He brought a bunch of his players Northwestern Missouri State D2 Drake D1 He went to the second round of the NCA tournament Now hes at Iowa Kyle Smith was telling me he thinks with D1 D2 players coming to D1 the biggest challenge defense The second biggest challenge is rebounding But he thinks you can get a lot of really good players and he would know it He brought up Jaylen Wells from Soma State to Washington State And Jaylen Wells last year for the Memphis Grizzlies was third in rookie of the year voting I mean you can find the diamond in a rough often times you get overlooked He takes the chance to get to the D1 level and it works out Now hes talking about Ben Wallace as well Hall of Famer Ben Wallace Big Ben Agarwal terminates out for Akara Oh nice move What a pass to Den Smith Great ball movement Apara open three That is how you move the rock Hockey assist McCory but nice job to kick it out Nice touch pass by Den Smith as well Hes averaging three assists per game off the bench The division 2 transfer understanding knowing your offense and where your players are going to be trusting that they will be there Vera off balance Long jumper no good Rebound is tipped out of play Well that should go to Stanford and Paul Cells comes over and theyll correct the call Take another look at it And clearly Jones Hes a transfer from Portland Grew up in Boothville Louisiana just south of New Orleans as the number one player in the state of Louisiana in his class and for this Louisiana team That will be big and keeping their best players in state Camman hands off Den Smith at the logo Better ball movement this last stands up for Stanford Theyve made their last three shots Den Smith got a running start on it all the way to the hoop Banks it in Thats a nice job by Den Smith Shot clock is winding down Was able to get a straight line drive Stanford great ball movement Louisiana going to call a timeout Its a 6 run for Stanford four buckets They are up by six How do you beat this stingy Louisiana defense Well how you beat the defense is man movement and ball movement Look where all five defenders are looking at a Cororey and then he says You know what I have my teammate Im going to rotate it out Dent Smith what music does he do All eyes are on him Rotates it over wide open from behind the arc Apara with the three ball Bottoms Stanfords on a 6 run A nice power move and the baby hook from Jeremiah Evans 610 210 from Shreport Louisiana And thats what you want to do in the half court set Run the shot clock down But if you miss the shot Tim you get one shot at the rim Thats the only issue Theres a trap cheering You see the energy from the bench from this new Louisiana coaching staff It is a brand new day in Lafayette Just five on the shot clock Oh nice pass came Thats a Yeah that the ball went in anyways but it was a goal And again how you beat it is man movement and ball movement Step through the double team the trap Find your open man Open man needs to show his hands show his jersey show Stanford Stanford started this game 0 for five from the field Theyve made their last five attempts Well you have to get acclimated to this style of defense Got Den Smith couldnt keep it alive Great defense by Den Smith Outside hand technique was not able to reel it in Stays with Louisiana 11 on the shot almost And they all have to be pulling on one strength Understanding for the common goal Miss Cinjun staff saying they have a very tight team This is a week in California for them Nice offbalance jumper made by OA Did a great job of putting his man in the spin cycle and elevating with the midrange jumper Geler finds Den Smith Three ball just off A rare miss by Stanford Jump ball called They go to Louisiana This is a a great opportunity though Theyll theyll play Stanford then Santa Clara and theyll theyll go up to to Davis But its a its a week together in Northern California for this raging cinjun team Yeah defensively raging cinjun need to do a better job Stanfords five out of their last six But again theyre going to wear you down Geler steals it in the back court Keeler did a great job of picking up Den Smith threw it up for Evan Stinson who uh has been in and out of the lineup He was hurt opening night and uh they tried to go for the crazy alleyoop Did a great job of anticipating get the steal but Collins just kind of stood there didnt come to the basketball to allow Geler to step right in and get the steal Fact this is Evan Stinsons first action of the season Stinson 67205 hails from Cheney Washington in Eastern Washington just a little bit south of Spokane and Gonzaga makes the first Raging Cinjun already with 16 fouls in their three losses 24 fouls they average Stanford is in the bonus for the remainder of this first half Theres 1050 left in the half Last one was against Collins So check that Its updated to 17 fouls Yeah So Stanford free throws here on out Sixpoint lead for the Cardinal This is not where Evans wants the ball but he moved it in Banks it in with contact and counted as he got the Belgian Oscar Hilt to a little bit behind the play Evans did a great job of turning a corner and getting to the rim and taking the contact concentrating and finishing Jeremiah Evans had one point on the season coming to this game This is his third start and tonight hes got still four Couldnt get the free throw to go Fourpoint lead for the Cardinal 10 and a half left in the first half Layups putbacks and free throws are important when youre on the road Theres a turnover in the back court Euro step for the dunk cheering Joshua Lewis he has NBA potential the highest signed recruit by far in Louisiana history We talked about those live ball turnovers There was one for the Raging Cinjun A 221 run and jump Now theyre back in the zone defense Papara power move to the rim Couldnt get it to fall Theres another one of those fouls we talked about Thats number eight Nice pass inside Doc Par puts on the floor Plays off of two feet just rims out See here theres the foul Jump stop Not able to finish Its a great sign for Stanford as they will get to the free throw line Chismakar has already attempted 18 free throws this year He made over a 100 free throws as a sophomore at Harvard Cory got a nice rest there This is where Stanford could take advantage because the raging cinjun and their three losses Tim 23 free throws the opponents are shooting against them So you will get opportunities be patient offensively because they will foul for five for six at the line and again theyre in the bonus for the remainder of the half Ratliff dribble handoff Heres Lewis the talented freshman Thats great defense by Apara Staying solid defensively Geler almost got the steal Geler kind of lurking around Woodson didnt really see him So late shot clock Geler the thief tried to get another live ball turnover Woodson was not anticipating heer coming from behind Michael Collins off balance throws it up no good And an offensive rebound for the Raging Cinjun And this is what Raging Cage are going to do Theyre going to have late clock in their offense If they make it its fine If not theres another foul Thats another turnover Thats the third turnover on this side of the floor Thats two on Dorian Finister one of their starters The finisher goes in aggressive drops the shoulder Heres the 221 again The running and jump to see get a turnover against Stanford Stanford needs to get the ball in the middle of the floor Stay out of the corners Theres 12 traffic areas on the floor Stanford needs to make sure theyre in the middle of the floor Take away the trap Taylor between the rings was really key for Stanford last year Thats an Aaron pass all the way down Michael Collins finishes it Its another one of those live ball turnovers we talked about putting pressure on the offensive end with high hands Michael Collins first commit of the Quanis White era Freshman Akapara strong to the hoop and he got Ratliff to foul Thats two against Ratliff So Ratliff Evans Leverne all with two free throw or two fouls I should say Finished her as well Going to get a lot of opportunities As we said earlier they play handsy They will foul you You have to be aggressive going to the glass Stanford is well on their way to 20 plus free throws Par drives here Theres a foul Easy call and Chisum 682 240 wellbuilt interned at Silicon Valley Commercial Real Estate with Benny Giler and Aiden Camman Ratliff instead of going vertically A to A he went A to B Foul for the official right in front for the call Stanford at this point Tim just need to be aggressive A Cardinal lead by four And the free throws are the difference Stanfords made seven Louisianas made one Par with a game high seven now Ala nice hesitation dribble drive Tough move He gets it to go with the foul on Geler Well Vera did a great job of understanding hes more aggressive going to the glass Turn the shoulder on the smaller Geler See here turns the corner as Geler on his hip plays through the contact Thats two on Geler Stanfords been called for just five fouls but two on Geler Raosi with two Those are two of the the five starters for Stanford and two of their key players So D Smith rechecks in See Louisiana will Florida 221 again Slow Stanford down 18 seconds on the shot clock And I say that Stamper is not even in their offense yet Then Smith attacks reverses extra pass Agarwall McCory five on the timer trying to make something happen Offbalance floater no good It did get the front of the rim skying for that rebound Lewis Now the balls loose on the floor and four for 22 in the first half Agarwal to the rim Couldnt finish Baseline out of bounds plays are huge Lewis goes right to the rim Couldnt get it to go Lewis went up anticipating contact Needed to go right through the defender to force the official to make the call I mentioned the Raging Cinjun were for 22 against McNe State in the first half last time out Theyre eight of 14 So far today Stanford has only got up 13 shots so far They average over 60 Aara is the type of game he likes Hes a really physical big and hes got nine Stanford 3 and 0 Region C is one and three out of the Sun Belt They were picked ninth in their league They did get a first place vote It looked like there kind of fell on his own and Caymans called for the foul That was great initial defense with the deflection here and Cayman the leg stuck out That was the foul St did a great job initially on the defensive side getting the deflection Its the first on Cayman Six team foul So Louisiana is in the bonus as well Lewis off balance free throw line jumper off Aggerwall has done some nice work on the boards He hasnt scored yet tonight but hes got three rebounds already Camman over for Dent Smith The D2 transfer Agarwal Great shooter in the corner Couldnt get it to go Tipped rebound by Camman Ends up with Milan Mahia from Baton Rouge Louisiana four years at Lyola nondivision one program and lays it off for Lewis whos got six a raging cinjun high Lewis was able to get downhill immediately shows his speed and athleticism Hes a freshman He missed three months of practice because of an injury just getting back to 100 cheering And theyll get Camman for a quick second And Camman picks up those two fouls in about maybe less than a minute of game time So now Stanford three of their five starters have two fouls Its called moving screen here Yeah C You can see here he moves turns back into Ala So its going to take time They came in ranked number nine in the preseason rankings in the Sunb Belt Conference but defensively theyre going to improve over the years and get his type of players in Yeah they think defensively theyre a lot further ahead than offensively They came into this game 40 from the field 30 from deep tonight 16 shots 15 of them have been twopoint shots Stanford in foul trouble Heres a zone Stanford came out in a 113 Ammoa and theres a foul by Obera with the bucket A great job of attacking the short corner recognizing the zone You see here with the step back midrange able to knock it down Theres the foul very high They got Aggerwal for that foul which is huge for Stanford because thats the first against Agarwal Kimman was there too and that would have been his third Tipped rebound ends up with Stanford Another missed free throw for Louisiana You cant miss free throws on the road Louisiana retakes Takes the lead Long three Cameron Grant knocks it down from way back there Hes taken 11 shots this year 10 of them have been threes Hera really shifty guard takes the contact too strong Hera should recognize that Cameon just he has two fouls So play pedestrian defense Louisianas done a great job on a Cororey who has five points thus far 12 on the shot clock as it goes out of play It stays with Stanford One thing that Louisiana does well they play with their hands high get a lot of deflections live ball turnover They want to play in the open court but they also want to play in a half court set as well Where you down defensively and Smith has to get that one all the way into the back court just on the shot clock cheering Now Cory looks like he wants to cook Here he goes And he gets the call on the way up And Collins I dont think he thought that was a foul from his reaction Was able to get downhill forced the official to make the call See here he put his hand in there The initial foul Of course hes looking at the official Collins says You know what I didnt foul but the official saw it otherwise Since 2019 Stanfords had now with a Cororey four freshman starts as true freshman on opening night Tyrell Terry who is the 31st pick in the 2020 draft Zire Williams is a lottery pick and Harrison Ingram whos in the NBA as well Stanford has done a great job from the free throw line eight for nine actually eight for 10 I guess thats the broadcasters j so far Cardinal retake the lead 2522 Finister with contact Too strong Stinson giving Stanford some energetic minutes off the bench Got the rebound Camman down low up top A Cororey steps into a long three Buckets Hes starting to heat up Hes got nine Thats his second three ball A nice job finding the open man stepping right in knocking it down from distance 70 run for the Cardinal in the last minute and change Hammond with the rebound playing strong with two fouls Stanford starting to extend the lead You can see Aorei starting to get settled in Grant from way back there cheering Cameron Grant with two long ones in this first half and all of a sudden its a 10 run for Stanford Able to knock the shots down from distance Moving screen against Ratliff Thats his third foul Stanford trailed this one by one and a 100 run fueled by the fabulous freshman music Ibuka Aorei and fueled by the threepoint shots Yeah before the 100 run Stanford was two for five from behind the arc Now theyre three for four Grant with two and a Cory with one as well Grant with a careerhigh in terms of threes movement If you knock down shots from behind the arc it forces defense to extend Then itll open up your driving lanes Cardinal gotten some really good minutes off the bench Then Smith leaves it off Grant three ball in and out Smith had Grant earlier on the twoman game Came back to him I like seeing it get it to him early He had a wide open three Stanford is getting a vote in the AP poll They got one point which means one voter had him at 25 Stinson in transition McCory up for Stinson and he gets it to go cheering Ala lost his shoe They ran the flare screen to him That was the live ball turnover for the lob Evans Stanford now up by 11 Tim Evan Stinson from Eastern Washington He has given the Cardinal some serious energy minutes Heres Chris Stringa 610 forward a freshman from Latvia comes in for the first time Stinson called for the foul Itll be free throws here Heres the alley here Plays it soft off the rim Cory does a great job of leading him to the basket Darian Finister one and one 25 points last time out in 37 minutes Honest White made a point to say in that last game where really Louisiana got blown out from the start against MC State Finister was the guy who had no quit and played 37 minutes He liked his fight Yeah prior to that free throw The free throw line was the the sixth defender on the floor from Stanford One for two three for seven and leaving points on the floor Stanfords done a nice job against Dorian Fister after that 25point effort That was his first point of the game Ken Smith three assists Could he had another Stinson three ball just off Great look by Stinson crosscourt pass I mentioned a moment ago Stanford is one of the the lowest scoring bench points teams in the country Theyve only got one starter out there right now cheering They look to push the pace A Cororey hesitation dribble drive Nice feed Dent Smith off the pass from Grant off the back iron Long rebound Aari flies in for it He has a step back three Rattles down cheering So Cory not quitting on the play and you have a turnover by the Raven Cinjun knocked down this three ball from distance Cory didnt quit Was able to get the live ball turnover Lined up the three ball Heres the initial shot And right here Cory didnt quit on it Lines up the three was able to knock it down for his third three of the game Corys got 12 If he gets to 20 the last Stanford freshman to have four straight games with 20 points Brook Lopez back in 2007 Brook is uh still doing his thing in the NBA Grant off the pick and pop Couldnt get it to go Stins did a great job of playing the twoman game with Grant as theyre trapping the ball screen Grant is slipping the screen getting wide open shots Collins from Pierland Texas runs it up top Seven on the timer Collins took that one from way out there And thats what we talked about Louisianas going to run the shot clock down One shot now Theres a foul Corys going to the glass Hell be shooting free throws Louisianas number Thats three on Lever Kyle Smith asked him does Cororey remind you of anybody Been a very good name from his days across the bay in the East Bay in Moraga with St Marys He said that Cory might be a little bit bigger than him but he really reminds him of Patty Mills who won a couple of championships with the Spurs and had a very long NBA career Yeah like Coach Smith said he he knew it was going to be good but he didnt realize it was going to be this good this early in his freshman year This is only his fourth official game They played five games so far The exhibition against Oregon Ducks victorious in that as well So technically theyre 40 but 30 on the games count Corys got a game high 14 And I think the most impressive thing is Lewis knocks down an offbalance jumper Hes a really talented freshman as well But Cororey is not forcing anything out there Hes four for seven for 14 points The the game is coming to him Yeah Hes playing within the confines of the offense finding his spots His teammates know exactly where hes at cheering Shot clock gets down Hes your best option Hes able to deliver About a 6second shot clock gamecock differential Den Smith He gets to the rim High bank shot No good And the rebound Louisiana cheering Mahia tried to push it Too strong Aparo was fouled And Aparo is trying to argue he was in the act of shooting I dont think hes going to get three free throws but hell get two D Smith did a great job of not quitting on the play Get able to get the tap from behind Theres the foul Aari is asking for three free throws Hell get two nonetheless but Den Smith did a great job of not quitting on the play Well Im surprised theyre letting him shoot these free throws Hes got blood on his right shoulder and all over his shirt Normally you got to clean that up I think one of the Louisiana players Lewis is is is commenting on that You see it right there And you look at his his right shoulder as well Looked like a little cut And I think its Lewis who actually was cut on the play Pardon me Thats not a cut on Aparas shoulder That Thats the blood from Lewis The first free throw is good for Apara who has been to the line quite a bit tonight Hes five for five at the free throw line 14 personal fouls so far here in the first half Camfords led by as many as 15 I mean theres a few differences in this game Free throws are 113 for Stanford Threepointers are 6 nothing Thats 18 more points Far makes the second as well Hes got 11 Collins from half court couldnt get it to go But Louisiana really hung with Stanford for a lot of this first half but the last 532 of the Devon Lever is in with three fouls for Louisiana Theyre called for 14 fouls in the first half Jeremiah Evan trying to bully his way in and he gets the bank shot to go Its a grown man move inside Thats the first play they drew up saying this is what were going to run coming out of halftime Keeler steps into a three left wing and you let him step into one Hes going to knock him down He was saddled by fouls early in the first half You need his shooting from behind the arc Extend the defense I wasnt a math major but Giler this season 9 for 18 I think that thats 50 right Sounds good to me Tip controlled Akara Geler takes a three Couldnt get the roll Theres Lewis the talented freshman from Tampa who gets the rebound Cory did a great job of recognizing Geler running up the right lane Nice pass And Geler was not able to knock it down but it was right on target down Speaking of Geler thats his third personal Finister went right into him And Dorian Finister rims in the first So the point of emphasis coming out of halftime is drive the ball to the rim The first three shots by the raging cages has been right at the rim Finister makes both free throws Quantis White knew him growing up Finister was growing up in New Orleans Went to Washington Carver High School Was very familiar with him and got Finister to come over from Sam Houston State Akara what a strong finish Stanford did an outstanding job of breaking the 221 The ball movement on Carr Put it on the deck Was able to finish in front of the rim Hes continuing to carve up the defense for Raging Cages inside Lewis nice fadeaway jumper So smooth And Lewis has done that a couple of times That midrange shot over his left shoulder has been automatic Camman for Roi down low who has not had to play much because of foul trouble Speaking of foul trouble Gelers out and Dent Smith back in and Stanfords doing a great job of rotating the basketball Kane was able to go up high Yeah Well elbow was they they called a jump ball and thats a situation where Cal Smith could use a challenge That was you know Namchum they just corrected it here in house at the public address announcer It was not a jump ball So the arrow does not move Stanford had it Cardinal up by 14 First effort no good The second effort is down AJ Rahosi can get up Thats a great baseline out of bounds play Raosi was able to get his rebound Initially he missed it Hes able to get the offensive stick back and finish the deal Thats the first opportunity that Stanford has scored in a baseline out of bounds play You know Tim I always say if you can score four to six points on baseline out of bounds plays its like field goals in football Thats kind of special teams Absolutely Got his finance degree from Washington State Got a masters degree from Claremont Mud Scripps here at Stanford as a grad student Started as a walkon at Washington State for Kyle Smith Heres an air ball from Finister I tell you what Cayman did a great job initially was stopping that drive forcing Raging Cage to reset the offense Those are little plays that you really dont talk about but that was a great defensive job of sliding his feet and stopping the initial drive Levers playing with three fouls out from Lewis into the lane What a finish from Joshua Lewis So Lewis is definitely in his bag right to left the contact Took it over his right shoulder for the layup left hand has a Louisiana high 12 Corys got a game high 14 Hes operating Cam up Raosi again He was gets way up He had earlier this year Just a wicked dunk on a drive AJ Rois got some hops Did a great job of playing on the second side A missed shot by Came Im sure Cam will say that was a pass but Roi nonetheless will have an opportunity to shoot free throws Its been an interesting journey for Roi I mentioned walk on Washington State Claremont Mud Scripps picked up his masters degree there This is just his 42nd career game Louisiana number 0 for two from the free throw line Love to have you big be able to knock down free throws Stanford heading into tonight one of 76 undefeated teams in division one Rahosi missed all three free throws hes had so far today Apara stepped out of play as he uh trying to save that one Cal Smith is applauding the effort by Anari as it went out of bounds took a seat on the bench Be interesting to see how Stanford lines up in ACC play They went 11 and N last year That will not happen this year 100 we know it wont happen because theres only 18 games in the ACC this year Last year there was 20 Cardinal went nine and one at home 28 away from Tara Vander Court Winning on the road learning from that first year in the ACC big They went from 20 to 18 teams Theyll play two teams Stanford will twice Theyll play Call and Notre Dame twice and they miss Syracuse Granted a great job initially defense with high hands Ala offbalance left elbow short Another tipped rebound and it ends up with Finister who scoops it in Finister right man right spot allows the raging cinjuns to get into this 221 pester press Would you call it a pester press Pester press I kind of think like all presses are kind of pestery McCory extra pass Grant from the corner knocks it down Cameron Grant has nine Stford did a great job of rotating the ball to the second side of the floor So the Pester press basically just wanted to reduce the time in terms of offensive opportunities Youre not looking to take the ball Youre looking to slow down the offense Grant from deep Oh student section behind us is ready to go crazy Dent Smith Hes long and Cameron Grant last year had 18 points in the season Hes got nine tonight Stanford up by 15 again Jones Jr with a head of steam Blocking foul called So hell have two free throws after the break Cameron Brand three threes off the bench A big reason why Stanford leads by 15 here at Maples off the bench Hes got nine all from beyond the arc Yeah hes three for six Two in the first half follows up one in the second half and pass right there Bottoms 10 toes behind the line And this is the this is a kid that didnt play last game So didnt play last game played in 10 games all of last season And hes almost hes halfway to his careerhigh in terms of points total last season of 18 Stanford they came into this game averaging just about 14 points per game on from their bench That was 347 of 361 Division 1 teams Theyve got 15 tonight and Grants got nine of them First free throw down for Todd Jones Jr transfer from Portland in the WCC from Boothville Louisiana just south of New Orleans Splits the free throw Stanford up by 14 Raing Cage still struggling from the free throw line Par just fell kind of Thats the first misstep hes had all game Hes been fantastic McCory Oh no look pass Grant gives up the three Six on the shot clock Chisumak para taking himself and saying Dont worry guys I got this Par broke out a doityourself kid Came to a foot jump stop I love players when they come to the two foot jump style to gives you a lot of options Hes able to use the jump hook Jones reverses up top Collins a really talented freshman from Texas Rivera Six on the shot clock Right free throw line Extended jumper off And the rebound to Denn Smith Stanford have to be pleased with their half court defense this evening Committing on the defensive end Grant got a look there for a moment early on in the shot clock Gave it up Akara that was a brilliant pass and he was fouled as he went up He was trying to find Oscar Hil the 610 freshman from Belgium Thats a byproduct of his ability to shoot the ball from behind the arc to shot lift drive to the music rim The fouls on the pass against Ratliff Thats his fourth And theres Oscar Hilte the Belgian freshman So thats the second baseline out of bounds that they scored on this end of the floor So we talked about four to six points Theres your four 18point lead for the Cardinals Their biggest of the game Finister off balance and just throws it up and a little bit of a bailout call there So heres the slipping of the screen The baseline out of bounds play Nice recognition Stanford scored their fourth point the baseline out of bounds for you Theres Kote from Bilson in Belgium Right on the Dutch border Checks back in with three fouls Went to Belgium once and excellent waffles which you expect Great chocolate as well Two things that are right up my alley So one area of concern when you look at the RA cage is they do like to run late shot clock Again its its one of those situations If they make it its great but if they dont they get one opportunity at the rim Geler inbound for Stinson Geler senior from Palos Verdis Estates the Rolling Hills Prep is a preferred walkon at Stanford and has been very big for the Cardinal over the last two seasons So as the raging cages are trapping that ball screen they need to flash someone right to the middle of the floor step through cheering you have a twoonone situation Ken Smith trying to beat the clock Couldnt get it to go Hipper trying to get a little bit more distance They are up by 17 but a reach in there Thats against Jeremy Den Smith His first 14 foul against Stanford already Den Smith got his hands in the cookie jar on that foul Ora nice slippery move for the pepper nine transfer did a great job I think he got away with a false step The official didnt see it that way Was saying we we saw Gonzag in the NCA tournament and he put up Jackson Albero put up 27 against them Keeler off balance threes no good Honest it was interesting he got hired before the NCAA tournament So during the tournament hes the associate head coach for Houston who lost in the national championship game to Florida He was also working on his uh transfer portal class and working a late start You ask somebody about building programs I mean you ask Kyle Smith he went to Columbia built them from the ground up brought San Francisco back into prominence the WCC and then Washington State his last year with the Cougars They won an NCAA tournament game which does not happen very often in Pullman And be Hey I think Geler forgot youre not allowed to run the baseline there Ran it and that is a violation And coach Smith will have after the hel ball you cant run the baseline Benny Geler saw a look on his face He was like Oops Corys back in 14 points and three assists for the fabulous freshman Albera collects in the back court Started seven games for Pepperdine down in Malibu last year Blocked by well we thought so by Hilt but theyre going to get a foul on Stiny So it was clean up top but Stinson had the foul down low Well Ver got downhill Two opportunities to call fouls Hell take goes up high I think it is Stinson with the foul on the body Ala now with that free throw made three for five on the day and eight for 11 on the season from the free throw line Plays extremely aggressive cheering He does have experience playing at the collegiate level Cory one one thing we were talking about during halftime thats impressive about this freshman he plays with so much cool out there Hes able to change directions play at his own pace Youre not able to speed him up and thats important Lewis has called for his second personal Hes the star freshman for Louisiana Look at me He puts his hand in there and a Cory knows what to do Plays way beyond his years and hes only going to get stronger Already taken 24 free throws in his Stanford career These are 25 of 26 in terms of attempts That is excellent Fourth in the country in scoring first among freshman makes that free throw Hes got 16 I mean its 26 29 21 in terms of his first three games and 16 so far for the Nasha New Hampshire native And hes not afraid to play defense as well And you like that about him playing both sides of the ball Evans spins onto his right hand and misses it strong Speaking of strong Akara solid 240 lbs to Aorei Three on the way Back iron No good Ala spin move with contact Blocked out of play Not giving up a three Last time Stanford did not give up a three as theyre going to get Rahosi for his third personal before that ball was even inbounded Only the sixth team fell So it is free throws from here on out for Louisiana But last time Stanford did not give up a threepoint shot uh threepoint make I should say November of 2018 against Middle Tennessee State Louisiana came into this game at 30 from deep They havent taken a lot of threes Theyve only taken four taken 33 twos Par gets the board and thats to be expected A team that plays in the half court defensively they have to gain their identity Raosi just bullies his way for two points Did a great job of taking the contact You mentioned dipped his right shoulder jump hook over right shoulder because of foul trouble AJs only played eight minutes Hes got four points and five rebounds in those eight minutes Lewis travels Yeah Lewis with the suitcase violation Cant bring your bags on the floor for the travel Easy call for the official 17point advantage for Stanford Theyve led by as many as 18 Aara drives the baseline against Woodson Nice defense Apara just floats over him Cant get the roll Itll stay here Kosi was working hard down low And I think theyre going to get Evans with the foul They will Thats his fourth And you see the fouls are starting to pile up as far jump stop lane You saw him grabbing the jersey Theres the foul Yeah Look down there Evans has a fist full of ROSs jersey So Evans with four Lever with four and Ratliff with four Those are three of the main rotation bigs for Louisiana We know they commit a lot of fouls so far 19 Spinu from Rahosi trying to get to his left hand He does and he couldnt get it to roll down Rahosi would not be denied Playing inside Junal Step through Tried to kiss it music off the window with his left hand Showed his patience Now lets see if he can knock down the free throws played one year at Claremont Mud Scripps Averaged a double double Free throws have been an issue for Raosi He is uh in this game 0 for four for the season Three or 14 There we go I mentioned earlier you get a big man can knock down free throws of bow as well Pampered up by 18 just feel like theyre theyre like one 6070 run from delivering the knockout punch Lewis nice athletic move This kid is sharp The freshman with 14 Yeah Lewis came off a pin down screen Was able to get inside the lane and kiss it off the glass Grant catch fire three long This is a pivotal part for the raging cages if they have any opportunities to pull out a victory this West Coast trip really a Northern California trip Theyve got Stanford Theyll stay in the same hotel Theyll face off with Santa Clara next and then theyll drive up to Davis Face off with the Aggies Stanford number 52 Its our next broadcast by the way UC Davis and Stanford women on Thursday our next broadcast here on ACC Network from Maples Pavilion Stanford women 50 Stanford men 10 minutes and 6 seconds away from a 40 start It be the second straight 40 start for Kyle Smith who is 20 and3 here at Maples Pavilion They went 91 in the ACC They only lost to Wake Forest last year here at Stanford You always have to protect your home court Like to be at least 90 at home 75 80 on the road if possible That would have been a acrobatic make from a Cory whos going to get two free throws Joshua Lewis Cory gets downhill Really crafty with the basketball Flipped it off the glass with his left hand Shows his ability to score in the painted area as well as from behind the arc First is down for for Cory who came in 85 at the free throw line You see the success for Stanford last year their most wins in in quite some time Now Smith and 17 and three at home as I mentioned 91 in the ACC 21 wins Stanford lost by two in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament to Louisville They won that game and maybe won another I think they would have had a very good chance to make the NCAA tournaments Offensive foul on Finister So another one of those turnovers on a moving screen Stanford now has an opportunity to go up by 20 Cory so smooth What a pass and Cameron flushes it down But Cory did a great job of what they call dragging the man out finding his teammate for the dunk Tough make for Finister whos got eight Accord to coast counter the foul So Cory first with the pass now with the finish inside again with his left hand showing he can use both hands Jumps through Athletic plays much bigger than his size Theres the replay The the free throw was no good but it is 20 for Aorei This one all of a sudden is wide open Finister makes one Its a track meet Grant three ball left wing Cameron Grant with four triples and Stanford leads by 21 And Giler did a great job after the made basket to push the tempo Stanford wants to play it much faster this year than last Finister got it to go Theyve been running that action all evening long Thats the first time he was able to get a layup You bring up a good point Dr Wallace McCory Oh no look pass to Apara who goes to the hoop gets it Took a roll in 17 for Aara But it just was Lets take another look at this team So although Akara was able to score Cayman was the reason why because he screened his man down low who could not come over and help And talking about pace Stanford playing a little bit slower or faster pardon me this year Maxim Renault their their sevenfooter from France who was drafted by the Sacramento Kings You lose a big like that you have a Cory who can move Cal Smith was telling me a lot of these bigs like Apara love to run So hes switched to this personnel and theyre playing at a much faster pace You can see here heres Cayman sealing off inside Look right here He seals off the defender who could not come over on the help side Play by Aiden Cayman Hes had a really nice game tonight down low and he is one of the bigs for Stanford Hes going to be relied on throughout this year Woodson lefty finish very sharp for his first bucket tonight Woodson was able to put his man in his spin cycle Jump hook over his right shoulder Louisiana now in a zone No way Oh man Aorei was trying a wild shot Even he whos usually pretty calm was smiling at that one Another big game from Ibuka Aorei Hes got 20 A careerhigh 12 from Cameron Grants And Stanford has opened up a 20point lead Hes playing outstanding Hes electric He can score at three levels Actually four levels I love the hop over the skip cheering and the finish with his left hand He can take the contact He can play in space He can play in a foam booth 20 points Seven for nine from the free throw line Three for five from behind yards 5 for9 overall 20 points the first since Brook Lopez 2007 to score 20 points in four straight games Congratulations Yeah Brooke in his 18th season in the NBA with the Clippers His first year down in LA with the Clippers He was on the Nets The Lakers won a championship was really key for the Milwaukee Bucks back in 2021 And one thing about Brook Lopez thats incredible I mean hes a guy who like didnt take a threepoint shot for like six or seven years and now hes one of the best threepoint shooters by percentage in the NBA He definitely reinvented himself Whats incredible about Cory is a freshman Hes got 22 points If he didnt score again his average would go down Hes got 25 a game coming into this one Stanford show 32 zone plus off balance Nice smooth jumper from Lever Averages 10 a game That was just his second bucket Hes got four fouls tonight Cameron Grant He had 18 points all of last year Five points so far this year He is 12 tonight And hes open again CR cheering Yes sir Thats five triples Well Cory does a great job of initiating the offense getting two feet in the paint and you see how he drags defenders with him too Thats the key I mean hes able to see Its like he has eyes in the back of his head Woodson traveled They did not call it the first time Theyll call it the second time Yeah he was the official herd You call it thats why So Cory now up to 20 points and he wants more You see all five sets of eyes are on him and that lets a great threepoint shooter like Agarwal get a good look and Kyle Smith is fired up after that one Ran Agarwal is a great shooter and that is his first bucket of this season Hes dealt with illness some injuries and Kyle Smith was really fired up for that three Cory creates a lot of gravity towards him So youre going to be open You just have to have your hands ready in a shooting position cuz he will find you Cory is going to get to the line again as the Ring Cinjun has been past the limit for a bit Double bonus here for Habuka Theres Agarwal who is a really good shooter and I think well see it Kyle Smith was fired up You could say Kyle Yeah he put his hands up and then gave a little bit of a fist bump You know youve been there for a guy like Ryan Agarwal last year He scored seven points per game Those were his first points this season in game four and Kyle Smith sees him day in day out Put out so much effort and you see the coachs reaction here Well he sees how he works hard in practice and hes rewarded Cory did a great job of seeing his teammate in the corner and delivering a pass spot on This is Stanfords biggest lead 25 Woodson knocks down a three Its the second three for Louisiana in this game Grant puts it up again couldnt get the roll But uh down low Camman has put in a lot of work Hes got five points four rebounds two assists but hes been bigger than his numbers tonight Yeah hes been playing on both sides of the basketball Got into the fouls early which took him off the floor but hes been relentless so far One thing too for the Stanford shooters Benny Geler Ryan Agarwal Cameron Grant weve seen tonights Camman is is a really good shooter If youre playing with Ibuko Aurori you are going to get some open looks Absolutely As I mentioned earlier the gravity that he creates on the floor Hes a He does a great job of recognizing he plays at his own pace You cant speed him up doesnt turn the basketball over The other thing we have failed to mention hes got three steals per game That is leading the ACC Stanford as a team has done a really good job with steals Aiden Camman came into the game the only player in the ACC with two steals and a block per game as he made both free throws And hes a willing defender wants to play wants to be great every possession offense and defensively Think Agarwal might have gotten finger to the eye Stamper leads by 24 Good defense there from one of the players off the bench just coming into this game Michael Mutton sophomore from Lafayette Louisiana playing for his hometown team Stanfords bench has been huge Stanford was bottom 15 in the country in bench points coming into tonight Theyve got 26 in this one Woodson three is long and Agarwal was going for the rebound He was fouled So Ryan Agaral gets two free throws here Agaral that was his first made bucket of the year Hes made a few free throws for fourth at the line Stanford still maintain their plus 18 from behind the arc 11 for 28 shooting at 39 Raging Casians two for eight Interesting enough that the Raging Casian shooting 50 from the floor So overall you say thats a great shooting percentage but two for eight has been their demise and nine for 15 from the free throw line Look whats coming up for Stanford I have the broadcast for you here on ACZ Network Extra with Seattle Then well go down to Palm Desert to face off with Minnesota Then potentially the winner of the loser of Santa Cl St Louis Lets see how that first game goes Portland and UNLV also at Maples Pavilion Theyll go to San Jose State of Colorado in Phoenix You know whats also interesting Tim is that the raging cage well talk about after this play here McCory foot was on the line Thats a twopoint shot Its the longest possible twopoint shot you can make And its a 28point lead for Stanford A Corys got 26 And if youre looking at analytics thats a bad shot Get get that toe right behind the line But as I was mentioning on their three losses on the road they give up 80 two points a game Currently Stanford 87 recipe for success for Stanford Just beating the clock Joshua Lewis hes a a freshman the highest side recruit in Louisiana history Grant three ball right wing in and out A par offensive board and it rims in 17 for Chisum Pardon me 20 now Binister into the front court This is the biggest lead for Stanford 28er just 17 minutes tonight Hes had some foul trouble Akara thought about it Hes feeling it Akaro with contact Banks it in Give Chisum 22 Thats a new Stanford high for him So Cory with 26 Chisum with 22 Parr had 26 against Holy Cross when he was at Harvard had 21 opening night against Portland State for the Card this season That was his Stanford high in year two Lever has six all in the second half 30point lead was shortlived Dara why not Heat check in and out You see Louisiana still playing hard And the second effort down for Woodson Yeah Cory is all able to get that steal right in front of us And Cal Smith wants a timeout 215 remaining in the game Itll be our final mandatory timeout as well Stanford well on their way to a 40 start The super freshman music Ibuka Aorei on fire again tonight Hes got 26 music NCA tournament before Houston went on that run to the national championship game We got 6 seconds of basketball and guess what We got a break So free throws for Ryan Agarwal after our final mandatory timeout I lie This is our final mandatory timeout 9165 Stanford Louis leads Louisiana free throws as were down the stretch here at Taro Vander Court First is down for Ryan Agrial who knocked down his first bucket of the season He was a key part of Stanford last year Made 29 starts scored seven points per game Hes a fourthyear junior He got a red shirt Only played 22 his games his first two years Hes a great great shooter Seven for Agawal who did start opening night Hes dealt with an illness and some injuries Mahia fifth year transfer from Lyola New Orleans nondivision one school Agarwal has done a really good job on the boards Thats his sixth rebound for the game Stanford is plus nine on the glass Stanford has been doing on both sides this evening This rugged defense of the raging cinjun defensively Cinjun did exactly what they want to do They want to reduce the opportunities you get to shoot the ball First action tonight for Jaylen Thompson the Oakland native Shot clock violation That one went through the hands of Christ screened up from Ria and Latvia Its been seven Latvian NBA players including Kristoff Porzingis Andreas Beatadrins the Warriors legend Davis Bertton It is we were just told it is Latvian Independence Day Oscar Hite freshman from Belgium into the game as well for Stanford Agarwal its his seventh rebound Yeah hes been relentless on the glass Under a minute left here at Stanford wall try to set up screen That one is just out of his reach Kilte recognized the high low just led his teammate a little bit too long for a turnover And those two freshman from Europe both 610 both will have a role for Stanford this year as Leverne gets to the free throw line 25 Cinjun continue to play hard This will be the DNA and the motto defense first The offense will come around in and out And a big round of applause here Ethan Kit a sophomore from Palo Alto went to Gun High School applause did get to play against Montana And hell get 30 seconds to play here against Louisiana in the student section behind us cheering very excited to see catching the Met in this game Theres a 310 second difference So Stanford will uh maybe get a shot here for Kit Theyre trying to get it to him Twoman game with Agarwal Agarwal hesitation dribble drive catch Hes got a three on the way No but uh Stanford some smiles some laughs That could be the case when you turn 4 and
