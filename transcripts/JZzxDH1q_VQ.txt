winning ways tonight our officials Teddy Valentine Jamie lucky and Brent Hampton we are underway in Atlanta and its Georgia Tech that starts with the ball strong start to the season for this yellow jackets team but now a threegame losing streak how do they get back to winning ways well I I think the biggest problem that they have is that they just got to find Steady PL with that guard play defense on the perimeter but hey finding out whos going to be their second score I think thats the key to both teams tonight they know what their primary scores are going to do whos going to be the secondary guy and who controls the paint take a look at the starting five for the Irish they played really well against Duke on Saturday unlucky to lose that game really you look at their last three games they feel like theyve turned a corner yeah I think they can easily be three and one right now instead of one and three just some heartbreaking losses but thats part of growing up when youre inexperienced two programs with first year head coaches and really a lot of similarities because both coaches have come in and built the backbone of their teams with defense they have defense is both teams identity and both teams again they theyre unsure of where their offense is going to come from so they got to protect the ball they got to rebound now we were talking about the star freshman in Dongo opens the scoring for Georgia te what a surprise hes been Billy knock down that 15 foot range shot capable to knocking down some threes but what he really does is just control the paint on both ends of the Applause Music floor tried to squeeze it to kevi stolen away already two turnovers for this doter Dame team transition three Off the Applause Mark and when youre struggling to score you want to push the ball like that but you want to take good shots you just dont want to take quick shots like that like George just did its one of the plays freshman make cesne misfires from three bounces around offensive rebound kick out strong drive up and in for two thats exactly what Notre Dame needs another freshman Carrie Booth delivers great job there driving to the rim use in his size at 610 in his skill set he can do that more instead of settling for three Kelly hits it Miles Kelly Georgia Tech looking for more of that only 25 from three on the year he struggled from the three and he settled so much for that in years past I think one thing that hes starting to do is put it on the floor get to the basket and Le not great sign for him to knock down his first threepoint Applause shot Georgia Techo the defensive V really want to do a job with Burton if when he gets it out of his hand they want to try to deny him him they dont want to get it back to Applause him heres Nathan George another freshman on the floor to start this game for these two teams great feed but no finish from Music indongo nice step back nothing but the bottom of the net Mark is Burton Big Time midrange game for him I mean he just does a great job of shooting midrange shots off the bounce its really where hes most comfortable at right now in the season Kelly off the bounce pull up pop doesnt fall both teams want to push it try to score before both defenses get set Burton he is so crafty couldnt finish that one though but he can get his own shot on demand he has I I dont think theres a player in the conference that has more responsibility to him because he has to score for himself but he also has to cre for his teammates tipped in danana in perfect position to clean up the spill and as Im saying with Burton he just has so much responsibility to his team and its a small guy hes only probably 160 lbs and hes 511 but he plays so much bigger than Music that heres Burton through contact pulls up it doesnt drop hes gotten a couple of good looks hes only made one doing a better job there theyre trying to get him off on the Move instead of him just coming down and dribbling that time set a screen got a dribble hand off after Georgia Tech been very aggressive out of the gate an early threepoint lead were just getting started in Atlanta when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one

ready Joe I was born ready flyovers check extravagant entrances check Dynamic Duos check nightmare matchups check team of Destiny check all the heart pumping Stadium jumping action of your playoff dreams check please Music well you take a look at the recent history between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech can typically Rand off a really close game for the last five decided by four points or less take a look at the last meeting only a twopoint game the difference being those games were Josh passner and Mike Bray on the sidelines now Damon stamy and Micah Shrewsberry might bring something else to the table in this matchup and they will and theyre so similar and their success in everything that theyve done I dont think its going to change either I think well have a close game tonight and both teams have been built with defenses the primary tool so itll be really who can find their offensive Rhythm first both teams dont know where their offense is going to come from you know they cant depend on it every night but their defense has been reliable Booth tries a three too much on it tapped in rolled around didnt fall Kevin ji stayed with it but couldnt get it to Applause go Reeds goes Baseline dumps it off and Dongo misses a layup exactly what were talking about good looks just no finish yeah Dongo had two easy bunnies tonight I think hed like to have Applause back Booth finds Burton off to Shrewsberry those are the three freshmen and its a perfect freshman connection Shrewsberry knocks it down to tie it at seven yeah Bradens one of those guys he can get it he can get it going you got to find him from behind the threepoint line hes more than capable of exploding from the threepoint line Michel Shrewsberry turning to three freshman on the floor at the same time one being his son Braden and he delivers on his first shot of the night no excuse not to have confidence when you dash the coach right no doubt Reeves the instant answer the other way what a fining hes been Lacy Reed has just been able to score on all three levels put the jackets he can very well be a guy thats capable of exploding himself on the offensive end Applause shot clock down to five Shrewsberry catch and shoot missed it that time not that a wants to keep the ball off the sideline try to get more in the middle of the floor Applause and kick out SD of it he cant connect another offensive rebound and Dong go battling between two picks it up shoots and is Applause Music Applause Music foul R AC PC Tuesday night double header continues from Atlanta Randolph childr Jay alter with you weve got a great one between Georgia Tech and Notre Dame two programs with first year head coaches tough loss on Saturday for both of these programs but a chance to get a nice bounceback win on a quick turnaround yeah you got both teams coming in here desperate for a win one team won a three game losing streaks the other one back to back losses coming in defending well who steps up on the offensive end I think the key for either team is who controls the paint tonight on both ends of the floor will come out with the win both of these teams you mentioned the backbone is defense so who can find that offensive Rhythm right now theyre a combined two of 10 from Beyond The Arc and both teams on the season shoot under 30 from three so thatll be a big key if anybody can get something going from Deep thats the X Factor is there anywhere where theres unexpected offense to come from a guy can he just have a game tonight Marcus Burton one of those guys right on the money drills it from deep well hes a guy you know youre going to get some offense from him hes done it against everyone all year long and the question for noted aim is who else is going to step up for him the reigning ACC freshman of the week certainly leads the way for Notre Dame 16 points a game hes the lead assist man as well he does it all number three in white hes constantly in attack mode so he puts so much pressure on your defense so theres got to be a full commitment by your team to slow him down another freshman Braden Shrewsberry knocks down his second triple and delivers Notre Dame their first lead of the night I think hes someone eventually though the name Jo Tech tends to play in gaps and they not to get they got to get to him high hands close outs on his threepoint shots because hes capable of getting hot from behind the arc hes knocked down two here early its the Notre Dame freshman leading the way right now they have all 13 points for the Irish to start this game a threeheaded monster you love to see that if youre a noted aim fan these young freshman growing up quick in ACC play under 10 seconds to shoot Burton lost the handle tied up with a jump ball Notre Dame with the possession arrow when we come back and the Irish starting to dial it in from Deep great Shrewsbury is coming off showing you hey Burton knocks down this one coachs son knocks down the next two quick threes Big Time game here in Midtown youll love this so much space wait till you see the kitchen oh another door oh another door you can really get lost in this place pretty sure we are oh

wind energy you can get more dont wait Nows the Time to train for a career youre passionate about visit utiedu Music today just getting started here in Atlanta Notre Dame on top of Georgia Tech 1310 you know both of these programs tonight with first year head coaches and both new bosses for Georgia Tech Damon Stout for do Dame mik and Shrewsberry very similar background spent time as College assistants as well as in the NBA both actually with the Boston Celtics kind of in that Brad Stevens tree both kind of relying on freshman Stars which you dont really see a lot of times now in college basketball with all these Fife seniors and transfers in both hey early in our tenure we got a nice key win Notre Dame looked great in that win against Virginia for George attch that Marquee win against Duke well like we said they both have come in with a defensive already in of teams and their teams have been really strong defensively intentionally that way knowing that their offense is going to come around so lets see which team starts to take take shape and brings in their offense and able to help them help out the defensive score a little bit but so much similarities in these two teams relying on freshman bringing those guys in to kind of shake the future of the team rer lost his shoe so Teddy Valentine comes in and blows the play dead and that bailed out Notre Dame because there was only 5 seconds left on the shot clock coming out of this timeout this has been a concern this is the concern I believe for Notre Dame is who else besides Burton can create their offense it put so much pressure on Shrewsbury to draw up plays to do so Damon up set saying why are we stopping the clock for his shoe coming off I think its a good Music call accidentally stepped on his foot there Music and Dame is like let him play without a shoe weve seen it happen before yeah absolutely maybe you get a look for the coachs son Braden Shrewsberry whos already knocked down two threes tonight hes had the hot hand for no Dame all 13 of the Irish points belong to their three freshman into Roper has to let it fly shot clock down to one and thats a violation yeah thats a tough shot youd like to get a better shot with 5 seconds left you see hes coming to the bench coach shury is telling them you had 5 Seconds catch it put your head down try to make a play just held on to it and took a difficult shot third turnover against Notre Dame this first half Georgia Tech nearing a three minute scoring drought without a made shot weve told you offense is the question mark for both of these teams whoever finds more consistency on the offensive end is going to win this game tonight its the paint who controls the paint another Miss great defensive possession there by Notre Dame Music Georgia Tech missed four in a row just one of their last seven Dame defense has been excellent yeah Logan is in the game right now you see Davis with the ball at the top theyre not going to guard him theyre going to sit in the paint his Defender is going to help on everyone else great job by bra shrewbury there drawing a foul but Logan IMS in hes the backup point guard his ability to play to take some pressure and help this team when Burtons out these minutes are so crucial for him for not Dames Applause offense ims another freshman Indiana native just like Burton they really rely on Burton so youre right when hes out of the game the offense just really lacks that flow that critical minutes for him out there now as you can see a foul here Burtons ability because of his speed you dont really press up on him as much IMS comes in you turn up the heat you pressure him quite a bit you got to those fouls are on the guard you turning waight you got to wait let the big let Zona set his feet Zona kind of turns his shoulder in there again draws the foul you want your V you want an experienced guy he knows if his guards moves just stop you stop right where you are you dont have to run to the screen and commit the fourth turn over there for no the D maybe Kyle stur can be the guy that get things going hes been excellent Off the Bench this season number one for Georgia Tech coming off a game Saturday where he was one assist shy of a triple double 11 points 10 rebounds nine assists hes embraced a new role he was a starter last year for Georgia Tech now comes off the bench the one thing you can say about him is he doesnt start but he usually finishes the game and thats the key you know so many guys worry about starting the game and more important wow to a on hand J ban D go I think he heard me talk about him missing those previous two layups and you know what he wasnt going to miss a third he nearly tore the rim off and that gets some juice into the building for the first time tonight Georgia Tech struggled offensively a oneand jam like that maybe some momentum for the yellow jackets and they at the turnover heres sturdivan up ahead knocked away and kept in play by Notre Dame Burton back into the game transition three too much on it offensive rebound keeps things with the Irish both of these guys are going to push both teams are going to push in transition try to get an easy one they know theyre going to have their challenges in a half four sets Zona rattles in and out no good and now the Irish should Fallen ice cold into a scoring drought of three minutes and Don Applause go they go right back to him why not the freshmans been the go to guy all season long and thats why you got to be looking if youre playing against joria Tech they do a great job of after that ball screen they want to hit the pocket pass to their bigs get them moving if they can finish like that like Dongo did if not skip your weak side and Dongo with seven of the yellow jackets 14 tonight and another turnover thats six against the Irish in this first half turnovers have been a concern all year long when you got young youth in your backboard inexperienced you got to live with them you just you just want them to be like that you dont mind live ball turn I mean dead ball turnovers you get to set your Music Applause defense good ball movement leads to a three got to get the Miles Kelly great ball reversal there close outs late and his 66 frame allows him to elevate over the defense and knock down his second three Georgia Tech on a 7even nothing run theyve taken control of this game another turnover Kelly calling for it gets it doesnt connect that would have made it a 10 nothing run to take control of this game turnovers now who else can set sett his team down the way Jord DET Tech is defending I try to get the ball to Davis and allow him here because hes not going to get press right on hes not going to get pressured so theyre going to Sag off of him they want him since theyre sagging off to relieve pressure he can drive and attack that the guy thats sitting in the paint I think if he continues to do that hell draw that Defender out and itll open up things for other players and Michael shrewbury talked about that theyre going to pressure his guards his his back cour and if youre going to Sag off Davis use him as a fresh Applause Music Applause Music release heres Miles Kelly feeds it inside Dongo right up with it Burton in a Attack Mode right down the lane and now boof lays it up and in to tie it at 17 Big Time play not settling he could have very easily taken that three extra pass out of the corner by Music Applause Davis good pass and Nathan George drills it to fire George attch back in front he got to go CR shot by George for his confidence hes only shooting 19 coming Music in but when you take the right shots your percentages will go up I often tell guys your percentages are indicative of your shot selection take the right shots theyll falles answers with a triple of his own Jr kesn after a quiet first half for him ties it to 20 he has the size at 67 to elevate when he catches and shoots the knockdown shots really good shooting when his feet set good defense there just going up tall to deny Miles Kelly theyre putting Davis in the play he just ran by coach and said give me a sub now back and forth we go in this first half tied at 20 Up Up and Away here here penetration throwing it up to the big fella and he is tearing the rim down great start here in the peach Music state what even is this dont touch my things

conference play but at the Midway point you want your freshman to start you want to treat them as at their sophomores you want to depend on them a little bit more both teams have been rewarded with the production so far and how great is that to see for two first year head coaches rebuilding these programs that the young guys you brought in or delivering immediately for you and you want those guys you brought them in you recruited them for Pacific rows and how they fit in your program its great when you get it right theyre rewarding you with their performances so far and both coaches got

know when you make a mistake you dont even go near to coaching you definitely dont go near when its your dad you just walk to the other side of the floor hes standing on the other side of the free throw line and acts like his dads calling him to take out the trash like huh like what like I dont me talking to me you know what thats like because you coached your son Brandon at Wake Forest I did I

trying to clean up the spill had it Applause swiped Reeves goes Baseline scoop to the hoop up and in for two thats what know the Dame cannot have the live ball turnovers leading the transition points

Georgia Tech a trip to Cameron indor at 5 the night cap Miami at Virginia Tech that is a great day at basketball right here on acc Network we were saying before the game R off good news bad news of the ACCC this year anybody can beat anybody which is great for the fans but does hurt the conference uh uh well I dont always subject to that but I understand it you know from a standpoint of thats the narrative the ACC is just fighting against this narrative and to be honest this league is so competitive these teams out here are at the bottom toward the bottom of the ACC and theyre difficult and theyre going to win some games and its going to be difficult to go in their home court and win games because they they have defense and their defense travels and youre right to say its the narrative because you should get a lot of credit for beating a Florida State a Georgia te Notre and yet the country doesnt seem to want to give it and Ill tell you what youre going to have teams like a notre Dame like a Florida State who just beat a good Wake Forest team earlier tonight that gets so much better from the team they were in November to February were sitting here highlighting freshman and and every freshman gets better hammering it home Tay Davis hes growing into the game hes starting to adjust to how hes being played he realizes hes not a shooter hes impacting the impacting the game in so many different ways that time attacking the rim getting a back door cut no communication on joria Tech defense and he slams at home KY has had the hot hand hes fouled Georgia Tech a fivepoint lead Notre Dame getting back in it though yeah just to gets a break door cut big taking care of each other Davis finds that slams at home over re getting Notre name back in this game when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks vol three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30

weve got a womens basketball double header for you this week Kiki Jefferson and number 15 Louisville are in Pittsburgh and then the night cap Miami at number 11 Virginia Tech one of the best teams in the country thatll be a great one in blackburg Randolph childr Jay alter with you a little double header of our own here on the mens side in Atlanta Georgia Tech a 2924 lead you take a look at the way these two two teams started the game compared to now and both teams have found a much better offensive Rhythm and thats what happens with both of these teams thats been Theo so far this year they play theyve had scoring droughts and then they pick it up they get it they find a moment where they find some consistency but its the scoring droughts and how they attacking and theyre Tri when you got young guys theyre adjusting to the how the speed of the game is and Burton struggled with that early in this career and he told us that the game is starting to slow down for him and youve seen the flashes for both of these teams I mean Georgia Tech ranked wins against Mississippi State and Duke an overtime win against Penn State really good performances and yet now on a threegame losing streak so just finding that balance game in and game out stur didnt get it off in time shot clock violation and similar for Notre Dame I you beat Virginia 7654 you play really well against NC State and Duke but just not consistent enough offensively to finish those games and thats what happens with these guys they turn it over at opportune times and this we seeing here not that a has 10 turnovers early in this game and its difficult to rooll they on Pace to have over 20 plus turnovers theyve given up 14 points off the turnovers so far this half theyre defending well you cant shoot yourself in the foot three minutes left to this first half great pass even better finish keev AI on a terrific feed from Burton ji does as good a job as anybody controlling the paint he attacks your bigs and side does a great job finishing he mans the paint and its critical for this noted Ds defense deep three Reeves Off the Mark no good lost their early drag here for Burton in attack mode calls his own number and delivers Marcus Burton has to do that because you dont hes you want to attack as a guard like that because it gets guys off of him and the defense is getting set when the defense is set theyre scheming him he he draws a crowd so much easier to do it in transition so that early drag is always good offense for the fight not by Dongo backing down kicks out ceran working on Burton and now Kelly 3 seconds to shoot to the corner half to heave airball and thats a shot clock violation Georgia Tech out of rhythm its allowed Notre Dame to go on a six nothing run over the last two minutes I Id like to see once they let possess the ball you see the defense possession just let them go you know teams want to get out in transition you run to reward yourself and instead of noted Dame having a possession transitioning and now theyre going to play against a set Jord Tech defense either Music way outstanding defense there about it not that Ain heres Burton looking for the lead floater doesnt fall up ahead Reeves right to the rim missed it couple of layups of Georgia teex left on the table tonight transition three Shrewsberry rattles it in Braden Shrewsberry thats his third three of the night fivepoint swing there georia Tech gets a layup they miss it not the a rebounds it pushes it gets numbered great shury knocks down his third three of the first half tip ball Dongo goes and gets it leads to a wide openen three Cy cant finish it Bou on the floor goes against Burton great numbers there off of Miss you pushing it finds him in Rhythm there pretty stroke there everybody coachs son showing you how well and how sweet that jump shot is of his three threes already and over the last 3 minutes Notre Dame on a N9 nothing run DRS what a momentum swing this is right before halftime yeah we talk about it both of these teams have their scoring droughts its a game of runs and now it looks like for the F for the yellow jackets theres a lid on the rim contested shot no Applause good thats one you want to see them driving there youre youre already fighting against a 90 run put pressure on a rim Burton just having his way around right now draws the foul BT you got to pressure him and dictate him where he goes if you give him options to read his quickness there as he crosses over steer devont you got to know he is so quick he gets on the side keep him on that side not as big but hes got some Blake Wesley to his game hes hes a blur I I think he has a gear about him he has quickness short a quickness hes bigger play sets up a wide openen three missed it and those are the shots you want to get if youre micel Shrewsberry and Notre Dame just cant knock him down earlier in in the first half Davis had that shot and made one more and they got a three out of it that time he took it it was an open shot but he also could cut catch that on the move and continue to put pressure on the rim 7even to shoot George lost the handle swiped Away by Burton the steel cant get the Finish four seconds left in the half tongo Hees it he had plenty of time he let that ball go with 4 seconds left in the half you just saw both freshman make three freshman plays there George with the turnover Burton with the Miss layup and then Dongo rebounds it great job and then he heeds it from 75 ft with time and thats why coaches go B well Notre Dame months ago nearly two years ago February 12th at Clemson what a big boost this would be if they can hang on in the second half that will end this year without a doubt Reeves right on Q opens the scoring in the second half with a long three and Georgia Tech back in Applause front I think buckle up this is going to be a fun second half back and forth between two teams that desperately need this Applause win who steps up on the offensive end for for either team Kellys gotten it going you know Burtons always has this responsibility of creating hes got some help but the still is going to boil down to who steps up offensively but who continues to control the paint Applause and thats not just on post up as Burton does it by getting in the paint off the dribble creating for himself and teammates and Tech puts so much pressure on you with so many different players as well getting inside thrown away talked about the Notre Dame turnovers live ball led to 14 points off those turnovers lets see if Georgia Tech can cash in here and they do count it plus the foul Nathan George turning off defense and the offense is what Georgia Tech is living by tonight and still here and George comes off and probes and gets a slap on the arm and kisses it off the glass for two letting you know like Im a freshman too and Im pretty darn good and that is a third foul against Marcus Burton and without the Freshman on the floor Notre Dame just a totally different team offensive rebound finds Reeves he cant connect another offensive board keeps possession Applause alive now you cant have turnovers like this and give up offensive rebounds especially when youre on the road trying to get that elusive Road win Burton with three fouls stays on the floor you know you cant play long sprits without him you got to trust him kesy draws the foul great job there by keski hes known his ability to face up and stretch the defense that time taken to the rim throwing foul just comes off Dongo doesnt cut him off he gets the angle leans in throws the contact Applause Music hes capable of having scoring big scoring B spurts as well and needs a little help getting it offensive going that time taking the offense in his own hands showing you he can come off the screen with his weak hand get to the rim and make a play those were the first two free throw attempts for Notre Dame on the night didnt attempt a single one in the first first half Dongo didnt have the Right Touch there hes been a bright spot tonight though for the yellow jackets to Star freshman that little pocket pass there is is how they score so much is getting it right inside the free throw line area Tay Davis nobody picked him up right down the lane for an easy two butll be there all night for just driving that close out theyre sagging off it hurts other players from scoring because his man helps but he can be aggressive to play for for himself and others Dango lost it here comes Julian Roper with a head of steam pulls it out thought rer had numbers there gets it back turns around fouled puts it up and in Julian rooper delivers the lead back to Notre Dame thats the basketball God rewarding him I thought he had a chance to score early in the possession here time he wasnt expecting a pass and he got it and drove again we talk about this is why you get in the paint playoff two gets the Freshman off his feet leans into him draws the foul and has a chance here for a threepoint Applause play rer the transfer from Northwestern this was a complete roster overhaul by michah shrewbury when you consider the transfers of the Freshman that have come in so its no surp surprised that with every game they play they look more more together more cohesive theyre going to get better and better I mean its theres just not much here from last years roster at all Nathan George the answer the foul off ball it was by Dongo who was on the floor Jamie Lucky came in to make the Music call they call it on rer I think its roer on a box out put a physical box out there and its going to be a lot its going to be physical play inside both of these Applause teams dont mind putting a body on you so an opportunity for make it take it George the handles couldnt find reeds in the corner yeah thats a turnover on George but thats not his fault he did the right thing he drove Baseline there wasy Reeves got to get to the corner for that driving Applause kick so you see Davis now doing a little bit more ball handling without Burton on the floor Davis essentially is becoming a point guard for the Notre 18 rooper with 5 Seconds to shoot lost the handle great job there good patience coming off the ball screen Jordan ton drops he puts his defender on his hips creates the angle was able to maneuver there getting the rim and draw a foul man who who could continu continually control the paint getting to the rim last couple possessions here Jord DET Tech in particular rope has been able to do so makes the first so after a notre aame hadnt been to the foul line the entire first half theyve already taken five in this second theyve made four of Applause them I bet you theres been with some some halftime conversations there saying just stop shooting threes if they dont come within a flow of the offense maybe acception a few guys just keep putting pressure in the paint another turnover up ahead to Roper right to the rim missed it but the perfect position follow flush

points already tonight and were just started the second half three turnovers and Notre Dames cashed in with seven and as we said many times already tonight theyve been live ball turnovers and they turned the offense and when you struggle to score the last thing you want to do is give a team easy points and theyre just so difficult to overcome and its led to this not that they stepping out

this watch this watch me watch me watch me do well in the first half it was all about the Freshman for these two teams but scoreless in the second half both Burton and Dongo and you have to wonder maybe the one freshman that emerges here in the second half could be the difference in this game yeah Burton has proud trouble already they had him out and theyve been able to sustain his run hes just gotten back in the game here lets see if he can continue to get things is going but his third foul hes come out not the name actually increased the lead with him on the bench and thats something that hasnt happened very often for this group and Dongo has guys around him I think he has more protection when hes on the floor of support from a physicality standpoint and I think thats where his Advantage is in this game and but one of these guys has to step up both teams are shooting 50 from the floor here in it early in the second half and who can continue the hot scoring and Burton just getting back in the game and lets see how they involve him now its Kyle Stan and Georgia Tech with the ball trailing by four 5 minutes into the second half both of these teams eyeing this matchup as a critical conference game both coming off tough hardfought losses on Saturday feel like this is one that they need to have big possession there they tried to go at Burton and get that four five posting him up he held his ground didnt commit a foul Applause and those the kind of plays you want to do when youre learning to trust a player thats in foul trouble Burton on the Move in attack mode step back missed Applause it Georgia Techs really struggled in the half court what do they need to do to break out of the slump yeah Den is where do you want to go here you know you got to go to you try to go to Dongo here inside and noted a always does a really good job of doubling the Applause post so you got to get it to the second or third side try to drive close outs you know throwing it in the post against noted Dame is always difficult because theyre going to come and theyre going to double and honestly one of the biggest things between these two teams is this guy here with the ball his ability to get downhill and make plays Jo detective doesnt have that got Shrewsberry Perfect Touch the floater falls for the coachs son braad and Shrewsberry yeah thats a great job there hes known as his threepoint shooting there but youre shooter that way and teams tend to press you and close out hard he drove that shot the floater great look Coleman cant connect you couldnt ask for better looks if youre Georgia Tech in this second half they just cant finish him cant knock him down and theyre sagging off they struggle from behind a threepoint line and again they dont have a guy that can create for himself and others the way Burton does for his group when everything breaks down like now put the ball in his hand get him going right finds an open guy get an open look Booth he missfires both teams will look back and say those are yes a couple that we should have had Kelly a three that out no good now for two teams that came into tonight shooting under 30 from three they are settling for a lot from Deep right now well that thats a good shot and Kellys a guy thats capable hes shown in the past that he can knock down shots hes knocked down for tonight so you want him to continue to do it you just want the right guys doing it so you dont have no issue with that shot you want him to to continue to shoot those see someone telling them to do it hes like I got you you got you thats what you want to see a shooter with confidence cant Music waiver Burton off to fellow freshman carry Booth Tangled Up stolen away great defense by Debo Coleman yeah Debo just took it just physically just overwhelmed The Freshman there in that possession yellow jackets at a threeminute scoring drought Kelly trying to end it and he does Miles Kelly shooting out of the slumps shoter do what they do theres no slump when youre a shooter you dont care you dont believe in slumps you just keep shooting Kelly showing you that like he told last possession I got you hes not worried at all thats his fifth made three tonight came in just shooting 25 from three hes been doubled that kades tough take gets it to drop like we talked about he has the size gets in there shoots the runner off one foot his size at 67 allows him to get down heel and get his shot off great shot there dong go been quiet scoreless in this second half setss the screen for Kelly Coleman a three its good Debo Coleman and Georgia attch right back in it star talked about he wanted Coleman to be more of a catch and shoot threepoint guy he does a really good job of that all year shooting in the 30s from percentage wise its more than capable of doing so right around a 35 clip great catch and shoot there getting his feet up under him mad Zona trying to answer with a triple cant Applause connect Applause Music the extra pass Reeves the patience the Poise everything but the ma shot that would have been for the lead that was a big shot there but great possession got the ball in the middle of the floor which he wanted to do Dongo Force rotation bigs being able to pass Shrewsberry showing hes not just a threepoint shooter Notre back up by four really impressed with him is the way hes handled himself and knock down a couple of shots early the last two baskets putting the ball on the floor taking what the defense is giving him Dongo going right into Zona thats where you see the physicality of Zona his strength what a pass and the Finish Miles Kelly mamish Pavilion and gets on their feet after that slam thats why Dongo is going to be so special because his ability to pass he defends well he rebounds well really good hands but his ability to pass is something that a lot of bigs just cant Applause do well miles KY injecting some life through to Georgia Tech as they try and finish off this comeback miles Elly here just cuts back door finishes strong hes trying to lead his team to the second ACC Music win we have breaking news right now so we wait to see how this plays out in all my years I never

hold I got two hands on it shots like wide NBA Wednesday on ABC Home of the NBA Finals the most passion the most intensity this is the way basetball supposed to Applause be a Notre Dame that built a sevenpoint second half lead but then Miles Kelly has brought the yellow jackets right back in it he has he struggled shooting from the threepoint line all year 25 he has got his rhythm tonight hes knocked down five threepointers from all over the court even got himself going attacking the paint here off a post speed back door Cuts slams at home doing all he can to get the yellow jackets his victory Miles Kelly averaging 15 on the season which leads Georgia Tech already 17 tonight and Randolph mtion those five made threes I think the biggest cheer though was for that twohanded slam but when you know as a shooter and you get to the rim like that you got to take advantage of it so great job by him and you know you got to be catch a move you cant just stand stationary theyre going to run at you and you know and just great job out there hitting the post just cutting off and the defense tends to turn its head when you do Post feeds not many teams do that anymore great job by him recognizing that Davis lost the handle Falls loose George trying to pry it out jump ball called keevi did well to just have just enough on it to force the the jump ball they play so hard I think George is telling I thought the ball went yeah Michael Shrewsbury doesnt like the call but I thought George got down and grabbed Music it he loses it theyre scrambling for it but George yeah he didnt have a hand on he was caught between his legs yeah so thats the right call Georgia Tech ball trailing by two you want to reward him by going to the floor coaches tail guys dont reach dont bend down and reach for it get on the floor and get it and unfortunately couldnt wrap his hands around it Kelly has had eight of the last 11 for the yellow jackets passes off to Coleman draws the foul we talked about it coar wants Debo Coleman to be more of a catch and shoot guy but when he doesnt have it do a little bit what Shrewsbury is doing hes a threepoint shooter but when guys drive out he has the strength and physicality to put the ball in the floor drow fouls like that now in the second half were seeing contrasting stop Georgia Tech outscoring Notre Dame 12 nothing from three Kelly a Three Fires Georgia Tech in front Miles Kelly knocks down his 63 of the night great job there they they run that play out sideline out of OB missed a couple earlier Shrewsbury is upset because thats on The Scouting Report nothing upsets a coach more than a play that you walk through telling you guys its coming you know its going you walk through it Ive saw them walk through through it and Davis gets caught on that screen and he is hot right now you got to find him but its 63 tonight big moment here for not to name BG out of the game Logan Imes and a turnover Logan Imes is in right now and he has to settle his group and get him in the offense that time that screen was offensive foul was on ji moving on the ball screen thats the second time thats happened tonight great feed the Finish Georgia Tech made five of their last six yeah Burtons going to get back in this game he and Shrewsbury are both at the scores table now and Applause you see now when Burton out they get the ball in Daviss hand and wants to run the offense through him to the corner for the tie off the front rim no long rebound to Reeves goes coast to coast and misses great hustle back by Notre name there Corner three no one rotates back to balance the defense not that a Jordan Tech almost got fast break layup there great transition defense with that foul Notre Dame enters the bonus so one and one when we come back

back and forth game between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech all night long 745 left in regulation whats going to decide this game down the stretch well when youre struggled to score you get a guy thats knocking down shots like Kelly is can he continue and knock down a few three few more threes if you know an aim your advantage is been on the inside you had shooting when you needed it shrewbury knocked down a few but your advantage youre plus eight in the paint right now you got to continue to get the paint Burton got to figure out a way to get himself going back in this game since hes gotten in foul trouble hes lost a little bit of his aggressiveness hadnt scored strong since hes been in and you see the second half numbers here and theyre going to get back they need to continue to get this guy going hes hes a big part of their offense and like we talked about in the open his ability to score for himself and others its contrasting Styles right now Georgia Tech relying on Kelly and the three Notre Dames gone inside as J makes the front end of the one and one would you cons continue to play to your strength if youre noted in continue to go in the pain or at some point you do have to match with Georgia Tech doing Beyond The Arc well theyre going to continue to defend you know when you get into your Scouting Report Kelly has shot 25 all year hes having that type of night its a one possession game right now you dont need to change anything you just need to do what youve been doing and just do it a little bit better their strength is attacking the paint its not from the threepoint line shrewbury get a few kesn get an open look you want him to take it Burton as well the rest of the guys continue to do what they do and put pressure on the rim George uses the screen good ball movement finds Coleman 10 seconds to Applause shoot George fires the triple cant connect they were not going to leave Kelly open to find a three on that possession I can assure you of that heres Burton hes been playing with three fouls in the second half to fellow freshman bradden Shrewsberry kzne just short officials are let these bigs playing inside Dongo and Ja are really battling inside and great job officiating not not having to blow the whistle letting these guys just fight it out miscommunication there Dongo tried to find Kelly but Kelly was already cutting yeah its just an unfortunate mistake there you tell guys not to fake back doors and Dongo was just trying to reverse the Applause ball you never want to make a pass that ends in your head coachs hands no you dont but more importantly you dont even look over there you just walk back and start talking on defense just pretend they didnt happen but the good thing about it is its not a live ball turnover you get to set your D you get to make up for it two firste head coaches that are desperate for a conference win Burton put too much on that layup jump ball and the possession arrow is with Notre name so itll stay with the Irish set a screen there Dongo wants to come away with that clean and its a great job job by Zona using his experience tying up the young guy has a physical Advantage hes that grown senior strength the grown man strength there by Zone able to tie up the Freshman hes made a couple of plays tonight he has the physical strength as strong as donga is hold his ground the officials are going to come over and take a look at the monitor Music here what a crew he got Music at Ted Valentine Jamie lucky and Brent Music Hampton I dont think theres too much to look at there I dont think this should take that long I mean I think this should be blow the whistle get back out and get the plane both guys grab it there as a tie up Im looking for an elbow I dont see think there Music Applause anything well it gives an opportunity for Mikey Shrewsberry to draw something up yeah Music yeah oh checking on the shot clock he said so 16 on the shot Music Applause clock down from 20 so Irish Ball underneath their own hoop trailing by one Notre Dame looking for their first true Road win in 23 months think about that yeah thats thats a lot Notre Dame has not gone on the road and won a game since February 12th 2022 good tonight be the night shot clock down to eight Marcus Burton the goto guy all season long fresh man didnt have the Right Touch there offensive rebound Davis he couldnt clean up the Applause Music spill Davis really goes after the offensive glass and forces you to you may sag off him from a jump shooting standpoint but you better get a body on him cuz he is going to the offensive glass right on the money by Dango they do that as well as anybody in the country that pocket pass getting into the bigs Dongo with the soft touch and ability to reverse it for the tie Shrewsberry delivers back and forth we go in Atlanta I think BR Shrewsbury is heating up himself knocking down another three for him Kelly answers thats his 73 you know I love threepoint shooting so Im loving this right now now two guys stepping up challenging each other from behind the threepoint line making plays and Shrewsbury calls for it there Shrewsberry with a career high 16 after this made triple great down screen there comes off Shrewsbury lines it up knocks it down Kelly comes back and says no Im the hot hand T night late close out Im knocking it down offense is picking up here late both teams are fighting hard to end the losing streaks Braden Shrewsberry up to 17 a careerhigh for the Freshman hes closing in on a career high oh he has 17 yeah and make it 18 and back to a onepoint game with five minut minutes left in regulation we talked about who was going to step up for both teams secondary scoring and Kelly has done it and and and its great fashion so is bra Shrewsbury battle for the board every rebound every loose ball so critical in the final five minutes games like this come down a free throw shooting and just stand out in these are two really good defensive teams who can step up and knock down a a shot make a play kein ji in the post working against Dongo 5 Seconds to shoot and a foul called as Jai goes right into Dongo theyve let him play you said really physical on the post that time they did blow the whistle and and Shrewsbury gives his guys confidence hell go inside to J no matter whos guarding him they will they will you know they dont run a lot of sets for him but theyre not afraid that if end the shot clock or within their offense to drop the ball inside and give them touches little shaking up there but theyve been battling and Music banging this is still one and one shrewbury telling them you walk this off cuz youre not coming out of this game I need you on the floor you take as much time as you need youre not coming out of this game as a bench were sitting next to the Notre Dame and they hear us talking and theyre shaking their head like he aint coming out great job of officiating there knowing hes shaking up giving him time and guys get to catch their breath a little bit thats the thing you do too thats an experience guys hes young but you get a chance you get hit get a chance to catch a breath these are Big fre three throws and theyre going to say that Jai was in the act of shooting so its actually not one in one hell get two Applause here makes the first anyway to tie it at Applause Music Applause 57 and the Irish back in front by one after close losses to NC State and Duke in their last two games can they cling and hold on to this lead down the stretch foul called off the ball were going to call it against Julian rooper thats his third yeah this free throw shooting is going to be a big part who steps up when you get to these situations now were approaching the one one in one you know when you get to these one in one situations you want your better free throw shooters taking Music him leaves almost lost his footing finds Coleman Coleman off the bounce turns around doesnt drop its great job there driving playing off two feet pivoting away just couldnt get it down Burton in attack mode find truberry under 10 on the shot clock Burton pull up pop too much on it offensive rebound was swiped Away by Reeds up ahead Dongo lays it up and in and fires Georgia Tech back in front great job of Rim running there by dong go transitioning from one end to the floor quickly and gets rewarded for running Burton calls his own number and delivers merus Burton the instant answer he does it time and time again just just Fearless smallest guy on the floor with the biggest heart right back to Dongo The Freshman going punch for punch on a Tuesday night in the ACC both of these freshmen are showing you why the futures bright for both of these programs as Burton goes right back down to floor contact no call Georgia Tech has numbers five on four the extra pass Coleman cant hit Music it everything going through Marcus Burton right now it has to because again hes just so his speed changes everything his vision and if he dont make a play for himself again hes going to do it for a teammate here hes coming up with the guard screen he gets the option there if its a ghost screen he gives it to a shooter what a Shrewsberry right in front of dad missed it yeah I thought Debo Coleman got a deflection or was that wayy they got Reed got his hands up on that shot with that option play they run up and either shrewbury can ghost the screen mean he slips it and birdie can drive off it or he just passes it to him by Dongo weve talked about him all night long got quiet in the second half but when the chips have been down theyve relied on the Freshman Georgia Tech up by one Im a guy who lost a bet and my dignity as if watching my team lose wasnt punishment Applause enough and if you have

minutes to go onepoint game between Georgia Tech and Notre Dame two first year head coaches looking for a critical Conference win they are and their teams are battling here defended well theres been sloppy offensive play at times but the the intensity on the defensive end has been there both these teams deserving of the win unfortunately only one team can get it eight ties 10 lead changes in this game and you look at the threepoint shooting Georgia Tech has relied on Miles Kelly he has been their goto guy down the stretch hes knocked down seven threes tonight and Dongo got himself going here as well star Drew up a play to get Kelly coming off a baseline Runner there and committed a foul at the line yeah in the bonus now Music yeah and its been a great shooting night for Kelly but this will be his first free throw attempt 23 points on the back of those seven made threes now hes in a rhythm of shooting but catching and shooting it from behind the ark and knocking down free throws with entirely two different things right now and he missed it and thats why I say you know free throw shooting is a rhythm as well and when you dont take many of them its hard to get in that Rhythm and he missed the front of at one and one time out Mike to Shrewsberry he had three at his disposal so decides to use one there Notre Dame trailing by one looking for their first true Road win in 23 months PGA Tour live on ESPN plus from the Pacific to the playoffs every tournament starts on ESPN plus stream your own way with four unique feeds PGA Tour live on ESPN Music plus the competitions never been better this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESP in and a Micah Shrewsberry drawing something up Notre Dame trailing by one the Irish could very well come back win this game and it would be their first true roadwi since at Clemson February 12th 2022 and maybe it had to be Atlanta because thats the new home of their former head coach longtime Mike Bray he came to the team meal last night met with the coaches and the team of little bit hes an assistant coach with the Atlanta Hawks right now Mike Bray one of the best to do it in the winning his coaching not the Dame history and so much success was glad that hes still involved in the program Shrewsberry deep three got it Braden Shrewsberry a career high 21 and that Three Fires the Irish in front thats such a great play because coach shrewbury told me earlier today he knows is Jord Tech defense theyre going to sit at that nail theyre not going to let you beat him off the dribble right down the middle he wants to spray it get off of it puts his shooter at that spot and the hot hand just got it and shot it and Braden shrewbury is is doing what hes done all game hes knocked down shots been played well and just a great time situation to knock down that play and that is ideally the look that Shrewsbury knew hed get r on the son to knock it down what a shot what a Play What a shot to call your sons number on the road when you havent won a nearly two years on the road like Notre Dame has and for him to deliver yeah big clutch three a careerhigh 21 points but those three are the biggest of the bunch they are and it puts them up and its a big shot and he comes out he gets a break and youre happy for your son when he knocks down shots like that because you know how hard he works and its difficult when you coaching your son because he has to hear it and you know in a locker run with his teammates and then he has to go home sometime and hear from dad there too so you just cant get away yeah you cant get away from it well everybody in the gym and watching at home knows that Miles Kelly 13 in Gray is probably the goto guy here for Georgia Tech lets see if they can give it to him no they go to Dongo battling swiped away Julian rooper what a stop by Notre Dame ran the ball screen there for George and and put their freshman donga and George in the ball screen George has to stop leaving his feet hes tipping his hand that hes throwing a l I think he can turn a corner there and and finish and lay that up and if he gets to the rim then donga can clean it up on the offensive glass he just throwing the L every time and donga unable to get to it that time Burton rolled off no good good offensive rebound do a foul here if your Georgia Tech and they do no you didnt have to there you wanted to get a stop its a one possession Applause game you were you were going to get the last possession had you not foued and looked like Kelly reached in to try and get the ball there yeah yeah but Burtons going to put pressure on him get the foul its didnt have to commit that it wasnt going to go back to 30 Burton makes the first and now to try and make it a twopossession game plenty of time here J DET Tech does not have to have a three missed it so it stays a one possession game 30 seconds left in regulation yellow jackets have a timeout heres Kelly hes already made its seven threes tonight this time takes it in for the layup onepoint Game Time Out Damon Stout Kelly may have fouled on this end great decision there not taking the three make playing hero ball drives it turns the corner on J finishes delay down one plenty of time here for yellow Jacks to get back in get in front of this one thats now 25 points on the night for Kelly Georgia te is now out of timeout Notre Dame still with two remaining the possession arrow in the event of a tie up is with Georgia Tech yeah here know that aim has to figure out who do they want to put at the Line This Is Where experience matters free throw shooting matters but sometimes youre at the mercy of the situation you got guys on the floor its difficult to put someone in that has not played a lot of minutes in this game and have them go to the line for critical free throw so I think theyre going to try even though Burton missed one hes over 80 83 on the year I try to get it back to him kesn is 85 those are the two guys he need to put the ball in their Music hands right now Notre Dame with the lead because of Braden Shrewsberry The Freshman a clutch triple sbur another guy shooting in the 80s had the hot hand here tonight now you got to be strong with the ball here because when they inbounded expect Georgia Tech to try to get a trap and a tie up try to get a steal if they can 5sec count they do not have to foul now usually in this situation if youre going to do that you want to tell the officials not to blow the whistle because sometimes they tend to call the foul thinking that youre going to foul immediately Notre Dame coming off two tough losses that came down to the final few seconds NC State and Duke can they cling on and finish out this win running the double screen for Burton and its not there they get it in its Shrewsberry is fouled yeah they tried to double great job there they tried to double kesn got it held it was strong through the double found a hot hand tonight Bren shrewbury with big free throws here shooting two in the double bonus Shrewsberry 82 free throw shooter on the season shooting right into the Georgia Tech student section knocks down the first now the best he can do here is make the threepoint game so still one possession if you know the Dame you got to put your you got to go off his defense of substitution here and youre going to see even if his if Shrewsbury makes this shot I think hell come out get your a bigger line up in some versatility and it drops in yeah Davis is coming in you need his versatility hes the most versatile defender on the floor r shrewbury with the roll Rim was kind to him here again you dont have to go for a three but if you do you got to get it to Kelly Same rub screen here great defense there now you got to make a play too much time running off 8 seconds left Dongo drills it wow wow Dongo has two for six on the year they tried to get the ball to Kelly it wasnt there he pops out look at this play you see Kelly there both Defenders went with Kelly dong is showing you hes more than just an inside player knocking down a clutch three trying to get us into overtime for free free basketball how about that the Freshman sensation wow I dont know if thats what Damon statamire would have drawn up but guess what it counts all the same tied at 66 our ninth tie of the night 55 remaining and as you said maybe the unlikeliest threepoint shooter in that spot the Freshman Sensation from senagal by Music Dongo plenty of time going to distance you got a guy like Burton in his speed so lets see if they face go him you can throw it into someone else and get him sprinting up the court lets see what Michael shrewbury gets designed you got draw you got so much so many options 55 seconds is a ton of time you can get to the rim in that time you could kick it up to one of the Music Applause shooters you like defense you like toughness you like physicality you like this game and its been everything we thought it would be its been tight for out it has neither team has led by more than seven back and forth all night long in Atlanta and it comes down to the final 5 and 12 seconds of Regulation can Notre Dame find a winner here would be their first road win since February 2022 23 months have gone by was Burton here coming know theyre going to try to get it to Burton on the Move theyre doubling him here theyre going to try to get him on the move into Burton hes got plenty of speed get it Coast to Coast plenty of time pulls up for the win missed it we are going to overtime in Atlanta what a game what a game overtime here in Atlanta for two teams led by first year head coaches that are desperate for a second Conference win on this campaign and foul trouble is not an issue the only one only guy rer has four no one else has more than three everything working through b Burton although he lost it there on the first possession of the extra session its not the time for turnovers but theyve struggled with turnovers tonight and Dongo hes the reason were in overtime hit the game tying three now going to work inside missed it short yeah I think hes better off facing up when he gets in the post I dont know how how much hes going to get by trying to back down ji its really physical and strong tur his face now he has to get off you you showing your touch you showing your range fzi in attack mode turns around missed it grabs his own rebound though leaves it for Ji lets see if Notre Dame can cash in Roper lines it up and knocks it down Julian roer fires Notre aim up by three great shot there catches one in Rhythm great find by Burton hitting the Gap kicking the weak side to his shooting Coleman step back missed the Applause three tried to step back into one I thought he had a rhythm he could have just stepped up and taken it right there tried to step back behind the line and answer that three by rer and couldnt knock it down the ball is getting into the paint a lot more off the dribble than it did earlier in the game Burton right into the paint keeps the dribble alive finds shuberry and he lost the handle and they say it was off of Georgia Tech the yellow jackets disagree theres 2 seconds left on the timer Ted Valentine Jamie lucky huddling Applause up yeah I think they made the right Applause call see the officials get together communicate made the right call was touched two seconds left on the shot clock Notre Dame needs something in a hurry shwb here shrewbury gets it fires doesnt hit and once again the ball awarded the Notre Dame Damon statamire cant believe it hes thought the last two have come off the Irish Ball hits the rim there I think its all d it is Dongo there I thought he hits his hand at the St it away Reeves went up and got that Applause one Nathan George 11 assists tonight giv go here pull up pop hits it big time bucket by The Crafty Canadian Nate George there getting to his midrange game hell have that shot all night just stay on balance keep your confidence as he has he needs to stay on his feet dont jump until he has to hes made some decisions doing that but hes been playing well here Burton fighting through traffic find Shrewsberry and hes fouled The Freshman will go to the line already with a careerhigh 23 points tonight youre going to have to alter your defense a little bit J Det likes to play in gaps to take away penetration but his ability tonight to knock down shots they starting to open up theyre trying to get out to him quickly allowing him to drive and get to the Applause rim a perfect five for five from the foul line what a performance this is for Braden Shrewsberry on the road he has delivered a career high 24 points make it Applause 25 lets see if Kelly can get going here hes already made Seven threes tonight has yet to touch it on this possession though one more you got him there he is Kelly missed it got a good look couldnt connect offensive rebound they try and get it back to Kelly in the corner and its swatted Away by Roper look for Jordan te to try to put Kelly on the opposite side of the ball screen they do a great job of hitting the big on a short roll and when donga does a great job of reversing it the shots are on a weak shot theyre going to take away that roll and its two onone on the backside theyll have that shot all night see if they can that great opportunity here last shot by Kelly lets see if they can do it again oh wow miscommunication and Cali couldnt save it and that is a costly turnover here in overtime yeah thats just an unforced eror there that you when youre struggling to win those are the turnovers you just dont want to have its still a one position game plenty of time shake it off but you got to get a stop Notre Dame with a chance to make it a two possession game theyre going to try to get Burton on a move there great switch by Georgia Tech Applause knocked out of bounds it will stay with the Irish underneath their own hoop 11 seconds on the shot clock great defense there by Jo DET Tech they were trying to create a play to get Burton to come off the ball screen but they wanted to get a screen away a first to get him on the move and Georgia Tech knew it was coming and switched a bigger Defender Debo kovan on Applause him sherberry back it out hes got 25 points a career high looking for two more rattles in and out no good battle for the ball its still loose they let it roll out of bounds Georgia Tech ball really smart decision not to touch that by the yellow jackets great job there I thought theyd pick it up and try to get numbers with J laying on the ground ball roled out of Js hand great job going up theyre fighting on the boards for every rebound every possession now oh wow does it go off miles Kellys foot here wow crowds booing it like why are we showing this on the Laughter monitor I am curious why the officials didnt take a look at that actually its a reviewable I dont think it the way it looked I dont think it you know you you didnt think that they just in hindsight you thats something youre going to question maybe tomorrow but CI for the tie missed it hes gotten two good looks and he has failed to make them both 50 seconds left at overtime this is a big time stop for Jordan Tech they have got to get a stop here you dont want it to go under 30 seconds and be a twopoint game I mean two possession game this play is been given up trouble they need to switch it and they do Kelly on Burton trying to spin his way free cant connect Georgia Tech still with life you dont need a three here plenty of time Kelly takes one anyway missed it ball kept alive and Georgia Tech has to foul no foul called now one is with 131 sometime fatigue gets the best of You Kelly did a great job in regulation in that situation getting to the rim delaying the foul situational fou that time he took the three and when you do that its its youre deciding the game right there because if they knock down these free throws Its Five Points four to five points thats a two possession game with 13 seconds really difficult to make up you drive that and get a layup here with fouling and these free throws of pressure when youre up three there not as much pressure on you well Kelly made Seven threes tonight but hell remember most probably the two hes missed here in overtime yeah had three straight ones had the corner one on the reversal and last two possessions he got threes off and now this is now or never time for Georgia Tech trailing by five time not on their side timeout Damon Stam thats his final Applause timeout yeah Damon start now we talk to his group he may draw up a a play with an option of getting the quick two or three and fing meanwhile for Notre Dame they are 13 seconds away from hanging on to what would be their first true Road win in 23 months think about how significant that is for this program it is I mean for a program is but we talked about it the way they defend but you want to end that streak as youre coming in as part of setting the culture Michael shrewbury is doing that with this group their identity is on the defensive end of the floor this team has held every ACC opponent double digits below their season average and one of the reasons Georgia Tech is getting this tonight is because of overtime and they still in overtime its not at their season average of 72 almost 73 points on the year so understand when you play the fight now Irish they going to be in a physical doll fight now Notre Dame won the battle on the glass plus 14 thats the difference in this game right now the second chance points the points in the paint and in overtime I just thought they were the more physical team they tend to be that every night out of the floor but they got timely baskets as well and and and I think the one guy on both teams that can create a shot for himself and other is and his seven assist was critical in getting in and I thought Nate George did a really good job for his team as well but that guys ability to score and then find teammates the pressure he puts on you creating hockey assists is just invaluable Georgia Tech in overtime has been held to just one for six shooting 0 for four from three so that Notre Dame defense that youve talked about all night it really showed up most in overtime and for Kelly hes played a lot of minutes you know hes played extremely well with 25 points tonight he you know he just hes literally played all but five minutes hes well over 40 minutes into this game so its nothing for him to hang his head down about weve seen crazier things happen and you got to get a decision here quick whether you go for two or three you got to make a field goal here you could try to get a 5sec count if not maybe a quick turnover things are not looking Jordan Techs way someone had to lose but its been a difficult game tonight its been a hard for tough game and what a game what a game really from opening tip back and forth not much to separate these two teams and now Georgia Tech in now or never t with the ball trailing by five Applause Music it was by dong go who drilled the three with 5 seconds left to regulations to send us to overtime hes the inbounder here Georgia Tech has to hurry with a head of steam George got to get the shot off and he does cant connect and thatll do it for Notre Dame the Irish can feel Applause it tried to get Terry there on a ball screen fade screen and then pin down action and great job they knew it was coming they switched it what a win this is for Micah Shrewsberry and Notre Dame after really difficult losses to NC State in Duke two games they really felt like they could have and should have won after they beat Virginia this noted aame team is for real now this noted a team should easily be 3 and2 at minimum 3 and2 and uh they they had to know the NC State game and credit the NC State for finding a way to win that one but they assisted in that and to come here and and also this is one of those things you want to put behind you losing on a road not winning one in two years great job tonight for no that at fighting ours get one on a road yeah the first time in 23 months its February 2020
