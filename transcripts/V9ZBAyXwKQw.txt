hurricanes in white Virginia in all blue our officials tonight Ted Valentine Bill Covington and Tony Henderson oh getting a little antsy before tip nor Chad omir hes ready to rock so are we top 25 matchup and now we are underway its Virginia that starts with the basketball the Cavaliers trying to bounce back after that 6961 loss to Houston over the weekend Applause there it is theyre looking to go right in at that matchup David Gardner does a great job of getting to the middle of the foreign attack Master of the midrange opens the scoring I look for Virginia to play through hit on the second side maybe not the first side but the second side and go right at Miller the entrance you see as this game goes along what type of matchups and changes Jim aronega makes take a look at Miami starting five theyve won seven straight up to number 22 in the polls now theyre ranked for the first time since 2018 this is a big tough test for them here at home perfect position for the tap in its Jordan Miller and thats the advantage Miami in an outstanding offensive rebound and team Miller using his quickness to get to the glass Miller and omir going to be a handful for the Cavaliers on the glass transition three Miller wide open he makes Virginia pay and you see right there the versatility of Miller common enough to shoot the three as the athleticism and the quickness to get to the glass he could also drive him off the elbow he is a difficult matchup for Gardner Applause right back to Gardner Franklin hes been called the last few games and that continues with a missed triple good job of digging down a little bit right there on guard and forcing him to give the ball up Applause Isaiah Wong always aggressive Poplar a three and it goes Miami red hot theyve already buried two threes in the opening two minutes we came in here today to watch Virginia practice who was working out on his own get shots up Poplar get himself ready for tonights game and hes doing it on defense too stolen away Poplar all the way to the rim but he missed it Franklin in attack mode denied nor Chad home here all over him very unlike Virginia to push it like that theyre running a little bit more up long rebounds quick Outlets Id like to see Franklin come through stop show the ball maybe cracks up and try to get the line shed with a really good Defender using his size his length a really good point Nigel pack nothing but the bottom of the net fading away Tony Bennett wants a timeout Miami shot out of a cannon to start this game theyre up on number six Virginia 102 in the opening three minutes all right its a 10nothing run Seth and thats what makes Jordan Miller difficult at the four he can run the floor doesnt run to the block spots up knocks down to three and then get a little bit of a paint touch and right there woogen steps behind and Poplar knocks down that big three he did his work this morning it paid dividends on this stage something that you said to look for Seth Greenberg is that Virginia does not turn the ball over and already woogle Poplar has turned the Cavaliers over Virginia in an eight Point hole in the opening three minutes yeah Virginia turns it over about eight times a game its a Miami team that forces a turnover 14 times the game doing a really good job of running out of that heres McNeely Off the Bench blocked Miamis defense comes up big again Applause time hes been really active defensively good job of tracing the ball contesting shots being active off the ball defensively Applause put the key here Clark to try to make something happen Applause right on cue heres Clark in attack mode the floater doesnt fall Clark does a great job of changing speeds getting in the lane has all different ways to finish little guards need to have a lot of different ways to finish around the ring omir tries to drink too much on it another thing to watch out for Virginias the health of Reese Beacon last three games he has not been a hundred percent Tony Bennett was hoping hed be very close to 100 tonight Applause and go to Beekman and he fails to deliver there all mirror is really terrific Defender seven foot wingspan has great feet has the ability to recover and confess shots off the rims along so crafty and its a 12nothing Miami run yeah hes averaged only six points a game in the last four games against Miami and getting them off to a good start but hes more than just a scorer he is a playmaker as well Kihei Clark drills the three and ends a fourminute Virginia scoring ground Jay when Miami game when Virginia gets stuck Look for King Kong to make plays whether its coming up ball screens coming off screens off the ball getting downhill hes a guy that in that moment usually seizes the opportunity to make a play last couple of possessions Miami settled for threes that have gone begging Music Neely over to Clark 10 seconds on the timer for Kihei Clark and a place dont let him get hot then vanderplas drills the three and just like that Virginia back within four yeah University transferred his dad played with Tony Bennett in college at Wisconsin Green Bay really skilled terrific Hazard has not shot it well this season but is capable threepoint shooting Applause Jordan Miller called for a pushoff theyre just getting started over on South Beach top 25 matchup in the ACC ENT this teams not just to the ACC but the country yeah Mike Grays old line was get old and stale these two teams Arrow youre looking at the Virginia team theyre average age is 357 I mean these are experienced player so wonder who experience players being to a basketball team perfect Virginia get off to a slow start you can wait for the storm youve been in this situation before you know how to prepare for a game you understand how do they adjust the Scouting Report you understand how to travel you have guys that basically have a toughness about them and a shared experience even with the transfer portal so these are two experienced teams youre gonna be able to make adjustments throughout the game and youre going to watch these teams throughout the game theyre going to be Scruggs but theyre old enough and mature enough to settle in back into the game and make those adjustments Kane and Shedrick misses the layup there you mentioned the portal the one and done culture I get wanting to get old its so hard its hard to stay old get old now in in the transfer portal yeah getting veteran players is so good difficult you can get them but to keep them is difficult Virginia and Miami both have done a great job of keeping their players and developing their players and thats a big part like you know everyone kind of Pros well both of these guys have developed Pros but you know what the guys that come into Miami the guys that come into Virginia they understand the process and theyre willing to pay the price and work to get to that point one of those guys is Isaiah Wong fourth year Junior for Jim larenag and look at the last three games 27 points per game 24 assists four turnovers yeah and he shoot 36 percent from the threepoint line last year he averaged two assists to games over four assists the game right now yeah he went through that process with the NBA the NBA people said youve got to prove that you can shoot the three what did he do this summer and all season long he comes in here at 6 30 in the morning with coach Bill Courtney and gets up jumpers working on his game working on his footwork working on with the ball without the ball so thats important example of taking advantage taking the information and working to make yourself better hes put that time in in the morning and it started to translate in the best form of his career projected at The Rim rolls out to Nigel pack what a block by northshadow near right at the front of the rim thats a seven foot Wing spin an active alert Defender a guy that can cover ground and contest without fouling long through the spin cycle keeps it alive for Miami Anthony Miller in the game right now from Miami he had a terrific practice yesterday high off the window no good and it falls to Franklin its a very deep Miami team Jim laronega a lot of weapons at his disposal Jim Ryan will go deep into his bench and I really be a great play by the boss right there that was much more aggressive in this game I really love Bexley Joseph and Harwood Beverly those two guys when they come off the bench theyre almost like starters and I think thats really important Benson Joseph is an elite Defender plays really hard and Carl Beverly was hurt last year had a bad back hes come back hes really done a nice job so the depth on the perimeter of this Miami team is legit heres Joseph off to Walker three seconds to shoot Gardners all over him hoists cant connect but an offensive rebound by omir Keeps The Possession alive averages four offensive rebounds a game youve got to go and find him and cut him out still with it and draws the foul thats just a great individual effort by nor Chad omir hell be at the foul line when we come back Miami Virginia trading punches at a top 25 ACC battle Applause whats up guys the ball finds him he finds the basketball its like a pass off the backboard he gets after every single Miss shot and his ability to catch attack and get to the line off those offensive rebounds are huge for this Miami team what a great story nor Chad omir is for this my transferred in from Arkansas State he is the first person from the country Nicaragua to attend a division one school on a basketball scholarship he was just recognized by his home country by the Olympic Committee there is parents accepting the award got to speak with him a little bit and chewed around hes just so proud of that he joined his time in Miami with these guys as well to be the first person to do something from your home country just just remarkable it is remarkable he spent the year at Miami Prep Art Alvarez whos built a great prep school program at Miami prep he went to Arkansas State uh last year I was 17 points on 12 rebounds but what is he he just plays each and every play like its the last player of the game hes relentless on the glass hes of an alert Defender off the ball and he plays with a drawing and the enthusiasm and a maturity that really helps his Miami team Hes listed as six seven but he plays seven seven yeah he does play seven seconds hes got a seven foot wingspan but look at his feet though his great feet right on cue blocks Vander blasted its Miami basketball he is dialed in on the defensive end right his ability to get out on the floor and defend move his feet watch a state out stay down stay down wall up vertical terrific job Music impacts the game on the glass impacts the game with his feet and his activity defensively does a great job of Defending ball screen situations this is where our lifes long on the second side and thats where his game is developed right on the money densely Joseph lines it up and knocks it down from the corner eventually Joseph is coming off the bench when you have Joseph and you have Harlem Beverly those two guys are really good but Isaiah where his game is improved is we know he can score his game as a facilitated he sees plays early right there simple handoff hes got legitimate size he can defend hes a willing passer and a creative passing hes getting land and score it through the defense and can shoot the three now almost Midway through this first half we were saying at the beginning of the game its a contrast of styles between Jim larenega and Tony Bennett Miamis playing at a Tempo that they prefer and thats tough to do against this Virginia team Miamis got stops theyve created some turnovers on that stops theyre doing a good job of running you know what I just want to talk about running you attacked the flatten the defense but you also have to to run in lanes and theyve done a good job of the dance passing attacking and like this possession for really good Baseline Drive kick open three good execution great pass Kihei Clark right on the money Francisco Cafaro and thats a name change this year for the Argentina and Ill tell you is he proud about the Argentina World Cup he carries his flag with him yeah during shoot around he was having it draped on the chair next to him huge week for argentinians around the world waited 36 years to voice that World Cup time Corner same result nothing but the bottom of the net from Bensley Joseph Hensley Joseph and Harlan Beverly are connected and theyre like the second unit all right and they come in with you theyre curveball or a fastball but theres no drop off when those two guys come in the game and Joseph is an elite elite Defender watch that match up with talk will have a hard time getting in the lane against Jose theres the quickness right there of Jordan Miller Gardner trying to grind through it it falls to Long Miami leading by 10 step back three its good count it plus the foul Isaiah Wong it could be a fourpoint play Isaiah keep seeing it this dude has got a complete Game boom a little behind the back step back knocked down to three possessive chords or Baseline made the dime right here little rhythm dribble a little pullback knocks down that three last year 30 threepoint shooter shoot 36 from the three every aspect of his game has improved why do you come back you come back to obviously have a shared experience with your teammates you also come back to develop your game Isaiah Wong he put into work in the summer you see the development paying dividends hes been waking up each morning at 6 30 I might start doing that if those are the results your your game is not fixing Applause nine minutes left to this first half Miami on a 122 run so where does Virginia go to score Franklin underneath misses the layup itll stay with Virginia fresh shot clock because it hit the rim as well Virginias got to find a way to get Jayden Garden ball when you think about the first possession of the game go right into the block on it and he attacks and scores theyve got to find a way to get him back involved the hell bag of loss is coming in for him what about Isaac McNeely The Freshman who certainly has provided a spark for this team at times hes been quiet just one shot and it was blocked Beekman into the lane cant get it to go draws the foul thats what kaffir does hes a big physical dude I am so impressed with Bensley Joseph I mean Aaron sits down and stands he keeps it in front he can test shots when those two guys come in the game bench the Joseph and Harlem Buckley come in the game theyre big theyre physical theyre experienced they defend and they play with great confidence tomorrow night its another college basketball doubleheader right here on the ACC Network Conference play in full swing it starts with Virginia Tech in Boston College then at 8 30 Notre Dame against Florida State if Jayden can play in a high high level really an elite offensive team Grand basilius voted to take bigs away from the basket so badou has played with so much confidence Hunter Couture is a guard that defends and knocks down shots they share the ball but but people dont talk about enough about Virginia Tech is how physical they are defensively theyve got versatility what they do defensively theyve been at physicality to them another ranked ACC team weve got two of them sparring in South Beach right now Miami has thrown the first punch leading by 12 this is what makes Miller so difficult to defend his skill set never takes a bad shot Beverly pops out for three and misses it where does Virginia go to get a bucket thats the big question turn the corner making plays nearly knocked down and jumper Miamis done such a great job of not over helping keeping Virginia on Perimeter pressuring the basketball and taking them out of rhythms even in their size McNeely the blowby and the Finish but did cathero storm in and get a piece of it thats goaltending that ball is on the rim that basket will not count that that ball I believe was going to go down anyway but kafaro touched it so by the letter of the law it has to be a goal into goaltending theyre going to call goaltend and they can review that play because they called the goaltending but that ball was definitely on the road that will be no basket good job of feeling though getting him Elaine and attacking weve got to step aside well get you the official call when we come back gives you that place because they called the goaltending originally so the cold gold heading originally they can go to the Monitor and do the play obviously they had to foul but basking was waved off due to the offensive goal thats really good of fishing this is a really good officiating pull and a really good job of getting right to it using the Monitor and taking advantage of the situation really unique lineup out there for Tony Bennett right now with Team Murray Isaac McNeely Ben Vander Foss and then Francisco Cafaro to join Reese speaking yeah the reason hes going with the slide him because he didnt really appreciate the effort he was getting out of him something like he wasnt getting leadership from PA cause he wasnt resident leadership can you speak in that he expects uh and they wont get any stops right now Miamis going to flow offensively and then defensively this team will really have a hard time getting into paint and scoring I look this line up here we speak has got to make a play but hes coming off the ball screw which could be the hard Hedge but hes got to find a way to get the lane hurry lost the handle packs there to Corral it goes right to the right misses it really really active alert defense get fight through those screens get hands on the ball get deflections shot creation thats exactly what I was talking about thats exactly whos got to be someones got to create an easy shot for someone this is almost a hangover from the Houston game in terms of what Houston did you did a really nice job of keeping Virginia out on Perm thats bad shot right there and thats the adjustment that quite honestly Nigel Packs got to make he was a volume shooter at Kansas State worldclass shooter now here at Miami great car right there pack the basket good curl good finish right there by Marty so you mentioned Pax he came in with big expectations a big nil dollar attached to his name hes fallen into a slump the last four games he sat out with illness in the last one if they can get him going Miami shoots to another Stratosphere well heres the thing its not getting him going hes their fourth best player right now all right North try to marry is the third best player Isaiah 1 was the best player obviously there hes trying to trying to pull them and make the play and Fort Mill is the second best player so hes got a different role on this team so hes got to pick his spots and hes moving from the two guards to the point guard position right so hes more of a facilitator hes just trying to get acclimated to what Coach Lionel wants so it takes time to to understand a new role in a new team something Ben vanderplas is going through too making that transition from Ohio to Virginia Applause Music how did he get that to go Isaiah Wong thats a bad dude right there let me tell you he comes off the ball screen theyre in drop coverage he snakes it back uses his body so hes knocked down a three hes created an open three he hes got Elaine and finished at the rig dribble handoff to get scoring opportunities and he is absolutely guarded seat of Versatility to Miami defense switching that screen right there Isaiah Wong impacts the game on both sides of the floor but watch it snake drop coverage attack the big put his shoulder into his chest that is just a big time pitch go right into his chest time for his thinking block shot hes thinking nose job Applause Music Wong is a perfect example of if you stay in college you develop you get better each each every year he is playing his best basketball here at his fourth season hes running his own race theres too many guys have one foot in one foot out players need to run their own race it does great pocket pass right there yeah beautiful pass Jaden Gardner to finish Virginia needs to get Gardner going maybe we got Garden going in to play through him a little bit that was a really good curl that was old school Virginia if you were ball screens beastman Carls right off of that down screen they have to show on the screen great pocket pass I I would suspect that Tonys going to try to get Gardner touches and put him in a lot of twoman screening games with Goose Creek sustained run with Kihei Clark and Katie shendrick and Jaden Gardner on the bench now theyre back in for the final four minutes and 36 seconds here trying to close the gap yeah Im Tony Bennett right and we got a 10point game all right weve got to do the next four minutes weve got to win the next four minutes we dont have to win it by 10 points weve got to win the next four minutes by two points four points now its a sixpoint game with 20 minutes to go were fine how do you do it get stopped solid possessions on the other end plates for Gardner all right take care of the basketball long in attack mode swatted by Shedrick there to clean up the spill nor Chad omir the goal fights good offensive rebounder but he pursues every shot like its a pass off the background theres theyre right in their their pairs where theyre basically playing two twobone games on either side I gotta believe theyre going to try to get guard with the ball somehow someway heres Dickman coming off him with the curl again this time he calls the tight to score Virginia looking a lot better offensively theyve knocked down their last two shots and the last two shots of his feet been coming off Frogger the first time he comes off the screen the defender shows he drops the pocket pass this time Defender stays home he has an opportunity to score me or on the Move offensive foul Jade and Gardner putting his body on the line Virginia trailing by 10 number six team in the country in trouble on the road he was the mice Music probably one of the most influential people in my life he was my mentor he chose me thank goodness and I can honestly say I never made a major decision in my life adult life without consulting him including asking my wife to marry me so coach Allen he is to me one of the great men in the history of college basketball that 84 team had a player on in Brent needling whos really been ill and I know his daughter was at Stanford High School in Northern Virginia he was an amazing teammate and he made the steal against Dan dakovich but got us a chance to beat Indiana to go to a final scene wow and uh Kenton were thinking about you to stay strong amazing family an amazing teammate a terrific player and uh what a great experience they had maybe forums at Burger small party rock well coach his impact on me will last with me forever whats the biggest change youve seen from Jim larranaga from an assistant coach in Virginia on our staff to now leading his own program one of the best ever been Tim laronega is some coaches are enablers some are empowered Jim larenake empowers his team he lifts his team up he encourages team he gets them to bloom and expect to win technically Jim larenick does an amazing job of putting players in position to play with their strengths offensively and defensively and setting a system that fits his Personnel theyre small so theyre going to attack and be the aggressive defensively theyre going to have skilled players theyre going to top different Nationals but his ability to uplift his team and and get them to embrace their the best version of themselves is his greatest gift Off the Mark genius buttoned up the defense of the last few minutes theyve cut the lead to eight feet going right back to Shedrick a ton of contact no call Miami a five on four chedrick getting back does just in the nick of time and Virginia forces the turnover but Jake has settled in defense a little bit a lot more alert right now doing a better job in defensive transition doing a better job of containing the basketball theyve had two pretty sound all kinds of possessions twoman game again with who respected Jaden Gardner this time on the ball screen he slips it out knocks down that little 15footer and just like that its a two possession game last battle back that great answer by Virginia getting stopped solid offensive possession with beef been in Gardner Seth Greenberg Challenger whether you never know who youll run into we were walking the Halls here in Miami theres a hurricane he had one scholarship available he said you were my agent you were pitching me a little bit but I mean coach he was so relaxed you know what I couldnt believe him if I was having a pretty glasses as good as he had Id be relaxed too they think its gonna finish anywhere from top three to top five this is his first full recruiting class in Miami I dont know how youre so calm he was calm cool collect raw guy hes focused this could be I mean he says this is what Miamis supposed to do this is Who We Are again Jayden Garden good drive hes got to finish that game tough take a little more than a minute left in this first half explosion from one he gets right to the hoop what has a long done pushes in transition knocked down three great shots for others played off the ball screens big last minute right now for this Virginia team thats fought its way back in the game they really like Gardner righthand side of the floor Applause McNeely can connect Applause changing the defense already Jim laronega on those isolations taken down and digging the ball out scraping the ball out great bucket The Freshman AJ Casey fine Music with under 30 seconds left and this first half as the crowd comes to life great answer by this Miami team being physical getting stopped its a big possession for Virginia to stay forth the way back cut it to a fourpoint game they get it under velvet digits watch for the pick and pop the band Applause seconds got him D3 from the logo off the mark a first half that Miami has dominated a 10point lead and whether the Run by Virginia by answering that run with Wong playing downhill really well at first hit well played first half fighting but again in transition say one get everything you want from an experienced player and came back right he made plays for his teammates to make plays for himself and this is against the team that he was only averaging six points a game against yeah we mentioned Miami has lost six straight meetings against Virginia in the last four meetings Wong only averaging six and a half points per game like you said Seth hes already doubled that in one half playing with a lot of confidence how do the Hurricanes maintain this close out with a win continue to defend with a purpose continue to get good shots and thats a pushoff right there it is hard to keep your Chad omear off the glass you know the most important thing is set your defense set your defense what do you have to do you gotta take care of the basketball you got to take good shots and thats really really important continue to attack the offensive glass and then Force Virginia to be a jump shooting team the only thing that Miami sometimes falls into Seth is they do fall in love with that that deep three they did in the first half and kind of gave Virginia a chance to get back into the start of the first half and then they continue to play downhill and in transition but Virginia is an experienced team they chipped away got it down I think four theyll find a way to get back in this game but I think theyve got to play through Gardner Moore and I really like a gardener and three speakers are in that twoman game on the right hand side of the floor long got Beekman goes inside beautiful feed nor Chad omear does the rest George Im here with that seven foot wingspan goes and attacks the ball on the catch and finish by the beginning of the game Seth Greenberg said watch the battle on the glass Miami out rebounding Virginia by six in that first half and now a turnover Applause that was a terrific defensive play by North Carolina staying down using his body Walling up eliminating any opportunity to Shedrick to get turn and face and the physicality of this game is really really impacting Virginia you mentioned in the first half could this be a little bit of a Houston hangover still playing to Houston hangover I think Miamis a very good basketball team of physical team defensively and they create they cant create problems so you know this is a road game uh and against the team that has terrific guard plays that have done a really good job of attacking certain matchups Applause were ready to take the charge theres no doubt about it I know you were like I said I just stepped up thats good that youre sitting there because if that were me I Id be three rows deep letting you take it I havent taken a charge in 40 years hey Clark rejected again North Shadow Mirror thats now a career high four blocks for the big fella but look how active he is right there the curl he sits back hes patient attacks the basketball thats got to be a dump off right there if you saw the play he didnt guard on the righthand side was wide open Applause thing but the Finish Armon Franklins in a funk y in the reset the clock thats how you know you know as a coach you know a players not confident not in Rhythm when you when you miss a shot like that yeah I mean look I mean he can make that show nine out of ten times he doesnt finish hes got to get to the next play he cant have a hangover for that in the shot right the guys a good player hes had good games hes an experience player hes got to get to the next play and play hes playing against the guy right there because theyre switching with really good luck Applause who changed his pronunciation of his name if you didnt know Music Virginia sports information director Eric Bakker making it clear before the game I know its been caffaro for three seasons but now its kafaron that native country of Argentina winning the World Cup a lot of Argentinian Pride we got to get the name right and his dad wanted it pronounced correctly which is a great thing its wrong contested three doesnt matter Isaiah Wong is on fire thats an example of good better best give up a good shot to get a better shot to get the best shot skip pass make one more Juan steps into three Gardner trying to answer draws the foul its just really good basketball right here bull gets reversed come off that high ball screen they tag the roll skip it make one extra knock that three down thats just really good basketball terrific spacing by Miami thats the one part of Isaiah Wongs game that has just taken off in this fourth season yeah 36 from the three and you know stepping threes are good threes but Virginia did what you have to do thats been a spread ball screen you gotta take it from the weak side when you tag it great recognition great skip pass but the extra pass is what makes that play its kind of like what you set me up with one of those tricky questions Applause Gardners going to get another attempt here for a lane violation as it stood he had missed a ball this is a Virginia team too that hasnt gotten to the foul line much tonight and they on the season out shoot their opponent by 10 freethrow attempts a game Gardner misses again Applause miscommunication there pack and pop Music py blanks gives the ball back to Virginia Cavaliers trailing by 15 South how did they get back into this game first and foremost theyre going to get stops and then Id like to see him go back to the twoman game with either Beekman or kia Clarke on the right hand side of the floor getting bit Garner involved in the game theyve got to get him involved and hes the one guy thats been consistent Applause Music three guys collapsing on Gardner Franklin wide open three still cant connect Armon Franklin has now missed all six shots hes taken tonight Applause heres Juan step back three lines it up misses it that time good solid defensive possession right there by Virginia Music Clark trying to provide a spark Virginias getting good looks they just cant make them and cathero commits the foul yeah when Miamis not scrambling they play a very similar defense they play a PacMan defense their length has been a factor in this game their ability to take away driving lanes and then get out and contest shots Music as that foul now look now sideline changes here for Virginia yeah and mcdealy back in the game I mean Franklin is just really struggling just like to see the kid knock down one shot now Brian Dunns in the game this is a game I think he can have an impact very similar game actually to Jordan Miller just a younger version very good Defender athletic maybe you can get him an easy basket freshman on the floor for Tony Bennett trailing by 15 on the road 25 battle that Miami has dominated thus far and Virginia gets to stop theyve desperately needed after they cash in on the other end standard plus wide open three hell usually make you pay did not there yeah good job but it applies stepping in getting into the window for that Inside Out Pass just got to make some shots and look at Miami going right at Vander Plaza on the other end with OMeara really situational basketball attacking matchups Jim larenegger is so good at it Music seven seconds to shoot heres pack contested shot doesnt fall Poplar picks the pocket of Beekman you never see that foreign Speakman in Virginia all out of sorts Miami up by 15 when we come back well be joined by the Hurricanes athletic director now and before we get into present day youve had the job here in Miami for about a year I want to go on a time machine all the way back to the 80s and early 90s you and Seth Greenberg work together in Miami and Long Beach State so okay lets get the dirty laundry what do we need to know about Coach Greenberg you know Seth has always been incredibly intense and we would my job was to deal with some numbers and facility things and we would get together and we would yell and scream at one another but then five minutes later we would get up and go to lunch together people up and down the hallway at Long Beach are saying what are these two crazy East Coast guys doing but we uh the guy never bought it was unbelievable oh yeah there you go Seths screaming yeah I cant picture that at all oh but it was it was a lot of fun we had fun though so now youre here in Miami youve had the job for a year is it everything you thought it would be absolutely I mean theres certainly you see this great crowd here tonight supporting this team weve got great people on our on our staff within the University Administration a lot of people who really want to see the Hurricanes do well and you know were starting to to move forward not only the great Elite eight run that coach L had in his team last year but certainly starting this year and it was really positive note and uh on the football side coach crystal ball tomorrow national Signing Day expecting an incredible class those guys are just working so hard and looking forward to bringing the University of Miami football program back to where it needs to be really looking forward to signing day we had the opportunity to chat with Coach crystal ball today gonna be a top five class tomorrow which is terrific were throwing back to Seth Greenberg having a little bit of hair coach Foster whos a great teacher in terms of rebuilding the program but then youre here basically to rebuild the identity of Miami Athletics so like when you come here this is a huge undertaking because mine has great Fierce tradition a great history but what do you spend a majority of your time to help change basically the image in a lot of ways to get back to those championship years especially when youre talking about football but I think especially when you talk about football I mean right now there are student athletes have incredible choices because you know they have their iPhones they can go anywhere in the country with sitting at home we have to make sure that they know that when they come to the University of Miami not only are they going to get a great education but theyre going to have everything in their pocket to be able to have a great athletic career here so that talks a little bit about facilities and the kind of facilities we need to build to support our football program and our basketball program I mean the watsco center is 20 years old we need to make sure that it continues to be in a in a positive way so student athletes look at the University of Miami and say you know what they really care about their athletic program they care about you know here at basketball they care about football and they care about baseball so you know its a its a really important thing thats what facilities are people thats the first thing people see and they understand that its important at the University when you have great facilities how do you balance in the new who all the college athletics the transfer portal nil and all the other things that are happening around the university and the athletic departmentlike facilities like upgrading this building right building football facilities how fifth of the bread is to educate your people to make sure that you find the right balance well I think its always been that when you get into a circumstance you know nil and collectives and those kind of things are in some ways you know just fundraising opportunities the same thing with facilities to go out and raise raise money for facilities people are going to go where their heart is you know you cant you can do a lot of homework but at the end of the day someone whos going to give their talents and treasures theyre going to go in in the direction they want some really enjoy the nio world and helping fund that others brick and mortar and facilities are the things that are important to them so you just have to go out and and mine a lot of turn over a lot of stones to be able to find exactly what you need speaking with Miami athletic director Dan radakovich as Kihei Clark steals way for Virginia you know one of the first things you didnt hear Dan when you took the job as you gave coach Jim larenega a contract extension it immediately paid dividends because he rewards you with an elite eight run but you gave him that extension before the March Madness performance why did you do that well first of all you know Jim this past week was nominated for the Naismith Hall of Fame and you know he is just an incredible coach 700 wins he got a few a few games ago uh hes Miami basketball I mean hes been here for 12 years he is a Hall of Fame coach here at the University of Miami hes incredibly well respected we want to keep him here as long as he wants to coach I want to make sure that I wanted to make sure that he was going to stay here and that he was happy here he does an amazing job you know its interesting his style obviously everyone has their own style but I think the magic of Jim larenaga quite honestly is his ability to empower his players

be valuable within the athletic department oh it is you know hes so positive I mean everything about you know his daytoday work is is just being positive you see it with his young men you see it when

hes hes happy his wife Liz is just a phenomenal lady and you know were just happy to have them here as part of our program four offensive rebounds on that possession for Virginia they still cant get it to go the length of Miami has had an impact that their ability to recover and use their length and challenge shots has been phenomenal now Dan we appreciate the time were going to get back to watching some basketball and what a great crowd as well Tuesday night conference play crowds phenomenal is is great its going to be a great jumping off for the rest of the year so guys thank you so much appreciate the time happy holidays brother happy holidays Dan radakovich Miami athletic director has been on the job for a year already an elite eight run under his belt in Miami trying to close the door on number six Virginia hurricanes have gone scoreless for the last five minutes and yet Virginia cant capitalize theyve missed their last five shots Applause McNeely deep three and he hits it Isaac McNeely brings Virginia back within nine this is a Virginia team that is starting to get a little bit better ball movement in terms of getting pain touches kicking it out getting some stepping threes got to the offensive glass a second ago a number of times but theyve got to get stops and this dude right here thats life having mariana rivera coming out of the bullpen to bring a guy like Bentley Joseph Off the Bench he defends to make shots he knows who he is is such a huge asset for this Miami team Joseph has taken three shots tonight hes made them all Music out of bounds itll go to Virginia Cavaliers trying to cut it and theyve done it with the three ball McNeely a deep one The Freshman on full display and then Bensley Joseph answering right back Music to her with you if you like offense ugly second half five of 24 shooting between these two since Miami actually went scoreless for more than six minutes and yet they still lead by 11 yeah and nine turnovers between them so far for seven minutes uh you know right now watch The Daily coming off a stagger screen right here cool gets the look knock it down though Applause bounces over the backboard and thats a microcosm those two plays right there two good looks just cant knock them down good push a good execution in special situations underneath out of bounds look at Jim guns and Joseph defend the basketball I am shooting three of 13 in this second half theyve left the door open for Virginia Applause Cavaliers capitalize commanderplas counted plus the foul we might see another fourpoint play never found a jump shooter never found a threepoint dream seated twice menopausal has not shot well but is a very good threepoint shooter right there really nice job of a dribble penetration and watch whatever Plus come behind that play we can see it one more time you see him relocate and get into a window to drop that past that thats really good we call penetration Reed get a paint touch Defender turns his head Santa Claus moves to an open area and all of a sudden theyve got a game again in the second half where points have been at a premium Vander blast secures four on one possession in the previous nine minutes Virginia only had six points and a seven point game and thats again Virginia what theyre trying to do is just get good solid possessions for some contested shot get a rebound and just get good looks really good job defensive and that ball screamed by vanderplan Jordan Miller has been quiet great defensive possession by Virginia force in a contested deep three and can pop foreign much more active defensively in the ball screen action much doing a much better job of depending the ball individually Applause traveled John would be quick but dont hurry really just a little bit in a hurry right there Music Virginia on a run with Miami in a scoring drought theyve made just one of their last nine shots of Virginias baited a seven point game three but theyve got to find a way to defend the post keep the ball out of the paint and get some interior scoring so Miami has seen the lead go down to seven its Ernest scoring slump continues dialed in defensively how do they break out of it Virginia right now theyve got to get stops the lineup they have in right now its going to be thunderclaws ball screens and postups for Gardner Applause it away Midway through the second half I like done Brian Dunns really active Defender Id like to get Im Tony Bennett I probably want to get theres no deposit to pick a pop Big Time free Ben Van Der Foss hits another one and in their sides even with the ball screen and left on the side of the floor you had Santa Claus going to pick and pop on the right hand side of the floor you had a potential post up for Gardner thats really good action Virginia Applause Casey in the game good hands right there by Gardner Applause lets see way off the mark from three The Freshman nowhere near Amy once led by as many as 15 Virginia with a chance to make it a one possession game has got three fouls I would suspect that Jim ironhors would bring him in off this next time out heat check oh he buries it Ben vanderplas has made it a onepoint game they are doing not a good job but a great job of lifting Vander Plaza in his matchup against Casey Casey turns his head they drag the ball and kick it back Applause to limbers magic packs made some big shots this year from Miami that big three he made against Rutgers out comes alive Miami clinging to a threepoint lead has made three straight right at that match up again right at Casey that would have been three in a row for vanderplas alone Applause swiped in but long in perfect position to put it up and in good answer in this case is potential not that he eat that strip but he has the ability at six nine to put it on the floor for it beak drive and weve got a wedgie in South Beach Applause Im not going there now youre on your own on that one big fella ah Seth Greenberg at the beach Miami moving without the basketball there on the Baseline Drive he relocates that will be a fourpoint play does a great job of moving to open air is a little ghost screen slip out shot ready behind the ball you talking about a guy that was a 35 threepoint shooter at Ohio University doing a really good job of slipping out off those ball screens ghost screaming creating space and stepping in and knocking down big threes in the second half 16 10 of those have come in the second half and he really alone has shot Virginia right back into this game Miami led by 15 that lead down to five Applause Miller great pass the Freshman cant finish but he was fouled AJ Casey to the line for two thats the versatility of Miller right there he catches on the Block they run a double team at him hes poised watch how he gets him but hes going to catch some on the buck feels the double team a great job of Casey right there cutting to the front of the rib late seal down by Virginia but Jordan Millers versatility is really impressive started the Game knocking down to three got to the offensive glass can make plays off the bounce and then if you double him its poised enough to make the right decision surprised we have not seen nor Chad omear come back into this game he dominated down low for Miami big reason they built that lead and since hes been out its allowed Virginia to come back in this game Angela Joseph is a really good set play really good job double back screen right there for Jaden Gardner Tony Bennett throwing something up in that timeout just a quick back screen to get Garden to the left Applause Im on Franklin lets see if he can get going a little bit down the stretch working on Wong right now long Franklin got a piece of it and eventually a foul called Isaiah Wong heads the line for two free throw shooter Frankel did a really solid job of keeping him in front hes got to be patient and disciplined when you get between the ball in the basket stay down wall up Force someone to score over the top Applause back to a fivepoint game Miami decided to extend the defense after the free throw made this dude could flat guard the basketball watch the back screen for Gardner there to the city Franklin wide open from three misses it again Armon Franklin is oh for seven tonight same play they ran a second ago set the back screen for Gardner theyve defended that Franklin comes off a little staggered down screen and foul called against Gardner he does not like the call yeah that was that is a a tough call right there because I thought Garner was vertical theres the slip its pretty hard if I cant see his inside right hand lets look down here and come down with his hand he would have better off walled off and getting both hands and chest and mouth thats a tough call out there Gardner comes out of the game as does Armon Franklin and thats a hard thing here you got an upperclassmen whos been good started off the season really shooting the bow wow its had great games putting him back in the game all inside because you just wants something good to happen for him he got him the perfect look and they got a great look for him and he just couldnt knock it down so now youre coming back with a little bit of uh better shooting team I do like what Dougs doing right now though defensively right now Miamis switching those ball screens straight up with Banner claw so he cant create any separation Clark calling for it shot clock down to five between the legs Kihei Clark a hand check outside good call thats a good call justified by talking to Jim Marion before the game they had a couple of different adjustments they were going to make defense for him right here Clark going Adam lower body Casey gets him but their adjustments were going to be depending on what was happening in the game obviously Ive had a ball started shooting well instead of hard hedging all right now all of a sudden theyre switching all those ball screws with down Applause defender on him which takes away that that ghost screen in those wide open threes Applause applies is going to be only four points on the night gets a big bucket there scoop to the hoop for Reese Beekman you talked about this match at the start of the game Pete Ben and Juan keep it in front keep him out of the lane keep him from making plays for others theres a good hard hedge and a short roll is what makes Millie so good heres a perfect example why do you play ball screen offense play ball screen off to make two defense they made two defense short Roll by Jordan Miller Jordan Miller catches it in that ACC logo and makes the play he is a brutal matchup done misses it I could see them going right back at that type of action little horn set with the two bigs up top theres going to be roll heres the second screen long miscommunication there trying to force it into Miller to turn over Music seven point game has no nor Chad omir comes back into the game for Miami Applause Music good possession right here Tony Bennett wants to dictate the shot coming out of this timeline out of timeouts she has gotten some great NBA or NFL draft it really is and Miami fans are going to be really happy theyre gonna have the number one class of the ACC top five in the nation take a look at our game summary Seth Greenberg Jay alter with you it really has been the Isaiah Wong show 196 rebounds five assists yeah I think Isaiah walks been absolutely terrific and Jordan Miller in his own ways been so effective for this Miami team if you think about it The Village hes got nine points but the other things he does he rebounds the ball he makes the right play offensively he keeps balls alive hes an active Defender the thing about this behind the team is the piece is fit uh and theyve just been so good overall defensively with their length and their ability to force Virginia for tough contested shots in a top 25 battle Tony Bennett leaning on two freshmen down the stretch Ryan Dunn Isaac McNeely on the floor heres McNeely hows the set play a little rescreen play for McNeil tons of contact no call Tony Bennett has livid over there on that Virginia sideline Isaiah along back the other way hes got 21 on the night perfect pass by Benzel Joseph good job of Isaiah Wong running the floor Applause in transition youve got to capitalize against this Virginia Defense really good job over pushing it off the turnover or off the top contested shot Miami with the push good job of pushing getting a piece of Lane and walk with the soft ability to score hes got six rebounds five assists a couple turnovers uh his decisionmaking to me is what makes him different he doesnt Chase shots he lets games come to him he attacks on opportunity its a great example of a guy that literally has worked on his games running his own race listened and heard what people said he needed to work on and and basically Embrace that against Virginia as long as traditionally struggled six and a half points per game in the four previous meetings tonight he has exploded for 21 now can get his team the win Miami has lost six straight against the Cavaliers and they are clinging to this seven point lead yeah we asked Tim larnev whos gonna do anything to get Isaiah Wong going and Jim give me a great answer he said no he said I just dont be you play make the plays that you can play make youre not going to want anything special for you Im going to replay freed up replay fast and just go and play basketball and uh and I thought that was a really good way to say hey trust yourself trust your instinct everything working through Wong they assist almost rattles in and out for Jordan Miller Virginia getting key stops can they string enough together to climb back down seven with under 3 30 to play move draws the foul and hell shoot another two and this is Clark battle test here at Virginia Applause 74 this year right now last five games is what somebody did I know Corey Alexander has beaten me up on that against the Virginia JMU game too coming up ACC pm right before the Signing Day show tomorrow afternoon its Charlotte for the second night of the Jumpman Invitational Tar Heels take it on live from Charlotte thats 4 PM Eastern Time right after national Signing Day show two possession game three minutes to play Applause everything is going through Isaiah Wong in crunch time Applause acrobatic doesnt drop and a foul just a little wedge rebound on the back side right there but no Trevor you look at the lefthand side of your screen this was a kind of a broken possession watching get his lower hip AWS thats a loose ball thats a 5050 calling Mike opinion I mean he took his little bite and tried to wedge and create space foreign Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music just a step Clark tries to get by Joseph and a foul called Applause Music and they call against nor Chad omear thats his fifth foul so Miami without the big man the rest of the way yeah you can see got him right on the forearm good call and now omir done for the night is that that was definitely a foul and that was a really good set because they said a screen where Vander Plaza was a ghost green he slipped out which created a big gap for Clark in his right hand to just drive it and get downhill and Clarks so crafty at showing the ball and craving fouls and with North Shadow Mirror out of this game Miami theyre already a small ball team theyve got to go even theyre going to go small right now because hes going to play popular play Jordan Miller because youre supposed to point thing take care of the basketball spread the defense out floor Gamers shot makers and Playmakers need to be on the floor and then as a group you got to rebound the ball and uh their choice was that Miller will play a young person so I think the goal with experience with two and a half minutes to go most important things dont turn it over and create a matchup problem on the other side Applause Clark hits them both back to a two possession game and look at Virginia Virginias basically playing Five perimeter players that Applause is basically a threepoint shoot but youre not defending postops tallest player on the court is six foot eight and youre playing straight five out of five guys outside the threepoint line I will spread it Applause deep three Nigel pack how about it and there you go spread the floor post up and straight down thats no similar to the threepoint shot and a pack made against Rutgers and Rutgers with making that run so pack has taken big shots in his day but another good decision by Jordan Miller iron unkind for vanderplas Nigel packs first three of the night the biggest one and long draws the foul on the other end thats a this is a shot you can live with if youre Tony Bennett he got a paint touch Watch What Happens defensively you cut down straight you come down and scrape youre late on the closeout good job of packs slight moves left create a little bit of a window he shot right now he did a great job of showing his hands and stepping into that pass but like theres another example of Miller Miller instead he could have tried to get over his right children should jump up he felt the double and made the right play unselfish basketball just like that long gives Miami a double digit lead again a lot of breathing room with under two minutes to play this is a Miami team that beat Baylor in Illinois this is I mean a Virginia team thats beaten Baylor in Illinois this is a team thats very capable Miami has been really really good in this game great job benzo Joseph good pest in that shot Applause no hurry seconds left in this game a 10point lead Wong working on the young freshman Isaac McNeely shot back down to five long goes to work missed it Cavaliers have to hurry McNeely fires the three doesnt drop kept alive and one opportunity and hes Beekman will head to the line with 62 seconds left small lineup obviously you got a really big restaurant and all five guys to come back and rebound the basketball I found the shooter is obviously a mistake that plus got a little bit of weight with coming over the back on that shot you know this small lineup is an advantage youve got small lineup obviously Virginias got to extend their defense most important thing get the ball in bounds good spacing meet all your passes run the ball into your hands catch and turd face look up the floor he strong with the basketball those old things that Jim larenag is talking to his team about on the other end Tony Bennett theyre probably going to try to either face guard with the center fielder or trap the first pass obviously take away the two outlets sideline and middle four something over the top Tony Bennett in Virginia still one timeout remaining Jim larenega and Miami have two Applause in a game where team teams came in red hot 111 Miami Virginia 81 even despite the loss to Houston Seth just mentioned good wins against Baylor Illinois at Michigan we didnt know really how it was going to go two successful teams but they do it so differently do you feel like Miami just the the tempo in their favor tonight its a home game they did a nice job obviously of attacking certain matchups they got good play out of although I thought defensively Miami was absolutely phenomenal their length and their ability to not get beat off the dribble to force contested shots to limit one shot and the other thing is its real simple this Virginia team they had their reading week they just had finals this is a hard time of the year for college basketball players because they have recently they have finals theyre playing games coming out of that uh but a great great performance great job vanderboss in perfect position its a two possession game here comes the Trap full core pressure to foul comes in a hard one on Bensley Joseph Applause force him down to the corner thats not a flagrant foul thats just a fan I I would be shocked if they go to the monitor on this Miami not yet in the double bonus so this is still one and one yeah right there youre looking to trap that first pass that is nothing fragrant about it you didnt come down it wasnt excessive got a sixpoint game critical free throw upcoming for the sophomore Bensley Joseph whos been outstanding tonight on both ends of the floor Music missed him door has crept open for Virginia can the Cavaliers capitalize Applause the Enterprise there he is wide open dunk its a fourpoint game out here immediately or you play it out well they hard foul hit oh my goodness Clark has it Tangled Up possession arrow stays with Miami that was a dangerous sequence for the hurricanes really good job but looking great hands right there by Kihei Clark good job of I cant right now possession hour looks to be like its our scoreboard says Miami it is what I said it must be Miami they just didnt flip the foreign Music fourpoint game Kihei Clark had an opportunity to steal that would have been an easy layup lay it in with now shot clock situation I think you gotta look to get one trap rotate up Jim larenager whats Jim larenager thinking right now Jim marinade thank you night I have to get the ball into the hands of my free throw shooter so he wants to get the ball in Hydro pack he wants to get the ball with Isaiah and it is going to be Virginia basketball so the table off our bugs wrong table right right now look for trying to get a quick a quick two Applause of course youve got to get in balance thats the final timeout Tony Bennett in Virginia have at their disposal so Cavaliers out of timeouts but they do have the basketball trailing by four this is a hard situation because Im Tony Bennett now I would actually think of that Jamie Garner in the game all right Who coming off a back screen can wedge and seal and maybe score and get fouled or use them as a screener and a slipper but theyve stayed with Ryan Dunn in this smaller lineup Rob would have Garner in his room you do score and you have to turn around pressure right hes not a guy that can run through a passing lane or get to a trap quickly Jim Lauren egg is really talking right now about if were going to switch the lineup they have right now this thing could be switching one through five if were going to switch make sure we come together stay tight all right do not foul the jump shooter but contest a shot and if they score Miami have timeouts Miamis got plenty of timeouts number one we have timeouts available number two remember if they score we can run the Baseline all right make sure you run the ball on your hands make sure we know who is inbounding the ball make sure our best passer is inbound into basketball Applause all Tony Bennett is worried about is getting a bucket everything else is and two freshmen on the floor for this Virginia team McNeely and Don those two have been a big reason why theyve made it this close watch mcfeely coming up screening for Joseph coming up to stagger on right hand side right there under 30 seconds left Clark all the way to the rim its a twopoint game Miami with two timeouts and Wong decides to take one and long didnt run the Baseline and a good job of denying that ball side really good execution we can get that really good execution really good patience they had multiple scoring opportunities right here watch right here look at me right on the top vanderplas because Clark basically Drew too but they did not want to foul so Clark goes right into the front of the rent great job defensively making it hard to get the ball in bounds now it is really really important whos your inbounder what are you doing how many people are you gonna have in the back and I was always a big believer the viewers fewer guys in the backcourt the better the more space there is the more rotations are tougher for the defense if they do get a track Music teams historically at least the last six meetings Virginias won them all but Jim larenega and Tony Bennett told us theyre always great games that weve not got another great game tonight absolutely terrific I mean he gave the second half both teams have really struggled offensively both defenses really did a good job of really making it difficult for the other team to get a good look get a paint touch get a second shot really see who is the inbounder the inbounder is the most important player right now because hes got to read the defense defensively youre playing Five on four so you get a lot of ways dictate who gets the basketball I would think theyre going to run someone deep they gotta open up the floor by Isaiah Walker once that balls gets inbounded look for him to make himself a receiver and get the ball back immediately theres the Deep Run right there Applause Music foul comes in against its Jordan Miller to the line shooting too Miller on the season 83 25 and 30 Music um those make both of his free throws excuse me Jordan goes by both of his free throws in this game there are so many situations right now Applause really nice job veteran player experience poised Applause Music takes them both hes just a really good Winger we talk about winning basketball players putting basketball players make the right play and make the right and make three players again in the game dont theres a hammer play Beekman right to the rim through contact no call cuts the lead in half twopoint game fall back to Wong whos fouled and now Isaiah long will shoot two with 148 seconds left remaining one of the reasons said why is Juan maybe inbounder one obviously hes it hes a very good passer and three defense the second thing is if they trap he can make himself available to get the pass back Applause Tony Bennett has one or two plays and probably hasnt won it so far and he needs a quick three hard to go for a quick two right now this amount of time without a timeout Virginia without a timeout 14 seconds to work with three Clark has to shoot and hes fouled shooting three Isaiah Wong called for the foul and with 56 left Kihei Clark will shoot three free throws great pause right there by Kihei Clark that was a rescreen for Beekman he was an opening shot fakes Applause now is that the cylinder rule was that a flop was he creating the contact and that is the one theyre checking to see was it a threepoint shot was he behind the line the second thing hes gonna hes checking is wasnt a flop he wasnt a flop but he definitely created the contact watch right in the end lets see where his feet are first and foremost tough from that angle its a hard angle I cant see if its a three or not its hard Applause the officials just signaled us do we have a better look uh on where his feet are there is no conclusive look that he knows what is online thats for sure they called me the three on the floor if we can get if we can just get that the first look we have maybe we can help a little bit and if we could freeze it right and hes behind the line here lets see why thats three whos the right call yeah he had Clark five of six from free throw line tonight Applause Music continue six of 23 from the 3 22 of 60 from the two 1116 from the free throw line older teams now older teams Step Up made free throws for Miami with Miller and Wong to Clark on the other end Nathan big play after big play good decision after good decision with a little more than a minute left 62 seconds left in regulation this was a 10 point game Virginia has battled back a ferocious finish and now a onepoint game he has a timeout Applause foul well the best Miami can do is make it a threepoint game with 46 seconds left so now 46 seconds left if your Miami level is under five I would not foul in the backcourt though I would pick up the ball of full length of the floor try to turn the dribbler once then give a foul somewhere like at at this side of the U logo the left side left side of the U logo yeah dont want to get it into that front Court wheel and and if if only one free throw is made Im going right at The Rim if Im Virginia like right now Virginias got plenty of time to get to the front of the rim if Kihei car can catch the ball on the Run key right now is to catch the ball on the Run dont catch it twopoint game Virginia without a timeout Here Comes people watch people catching along the line three seconds left Beekman lost the handle Miami survives wow the Hurricanes take down number six Virginia its the first win in seven meetings for Jim larranega against Tony Bennett
