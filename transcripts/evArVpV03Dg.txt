Don Hall the leader of this Virginia squad cheering He will find his big man Johan Brunlow gets it started from the outside Only 30 from three on the year but he will take them And you can see the Florida State defense ve much more conservative than it was to start the year They are in the gaps a mantoman defense thats functioning a lot like a zone Offensively this is a team that can put up some points as Robert McCrae the fifth with the penetration The runner and it rolls in A guy who really this team rides Robert McCrae transfer from Jacksonville You know thinking much more like a point guard though I mean hes a score first guy but as Luke Lax was telling us today hes gotten very much involved in terms of getting other guys their shots Already switching D Florida State in a manto man And the steal by McCrae the fifth as he is knocked out of bounds and our first foul of the ball game First year head coach Luke LS What I was really refreshing when we talked to him today at shootaround he said Look this is my first time being a head coach Theres a lot of things that I dont know that Im learning on the fly but hes already made changes This team was an offensiveminded team around the Christmas break Changed the defensive mindset and its really worked for them And offensive foul is called on Alex Steen Another coach in his first year Ryan ODM six and one in true road games this season You know whats scary As good as this Virginia team is Coach Odum told us We havent played our best yet this season They havent shot it well of late thats when one of the things and you know as good as their defense can be sometimes they have a hard time guarding the ball See Wiggins misses his first attempt as Malik Thomas pulls it down But thats how Florida State right there Thats how they want to play Theyre going to push and they are running for the threepoint line Paul he will try one from deep Off the mark and the rebound to McCrae the fifth penetrating again but miscommunication and its Virginia with the turnover Numbers going the other way Blocked at the rim but the follow is there for Grunlow Thats been the one kryptonite for Robert McCrae Over four turnovers a game That in foul trouble who just you know gets himself into trouble and leads to a run out for Virginia Heres Jones Three from the corner off the mark Backside board by Steen but out of bounds Its Virginia basketball It is fun to watch as the ball goes up the battle underneath the basket as Virginia the best rebounding team in the conference Well Florida State even in their shootound today were were doing monster rebounding drills and and you can understand why Its a Virginia team third in the country tops in the ACC in offensive rebounding Ta Ritter Johan Bruno over five offensive rebounds a game combined in their guards Virginias guards will also crash the offensive glass Here is Derritter Big load at 69 Lewis knifing through the paint and the layin is good He has shot it so well from three 14 of 28 50 in their last four So you know teams are going to run at him Shows you there the ability to put it on the floor Finish at the rim The fifth He is bumped Hes been able to get into the lane anytime he wants so far early in this game Yeah hes got a scores mentality You know 16 points games at Jacksonville last year Theres Sam Lewis breaking down the defense You know Robert McCrae the fifth Dont cons confuse him with the fourth Started his career at Wake Forest you know then ended up at Jacksonville and again was a scorer Hes the one guy on this team who can create his own shot You know the rest of these guys are threepoint shooters straight line drivers The problem for McCrae and we saw it in their game against Notre Dame the other day Foul troubles been an issue Like he can get hyperaggressive He fouled out in that game against Notre Dame with two minutes left It was a onepossession game and his fourth and fifth fouls were not good Not the type of fouls that a senior who was in foul trouble should have committed off the made free throws Florida State setting up a fullcourt press as Virginia easily walks it up the floor Chance Mallerie the freshman from Charlottesville first time checking in the game Ditter off the bounce Five on the shot clock for the Cavaliers Thomas a deep one If its going to be that kind of night its going to be a tough game for Florida State And its a bailout shot They never got north south I mean thats the one thing like this this contained man can can stand you up Youve got to try to get into those gaps Pick and pop Wiggins off the mark and Mallerie the smallest dude on the floor with the rebound But both of these teams John theyre putting four shooters out there at a time Jones just rips it away Does not have numbers cheering but he gets to the bucket and he will be fouled Virginia you know again its a high volume and theyre kind of tossing it around the perimeter but when you got four or five guys out there who are locked and ready a little bit east west and weve seen a couple bailout threes at the end of possession Solj Jones before we went to break drive to the bucket He will get to the line to shoot two Nicked up in their last game and hes sporting six new stitches above his eyes Head coach says Yeah hes got a little character now Finally finally makes him look tough is what he said I wouldnt say that to Liers face No No Those looks loud That was not from us Jakari White suited from Orlando in the game for the first time for Virginia with the ball in his hands and its taken away there by Tomas Bong Bas a rim run rejected by White excuse me Lewis but the three is good as the hot shooting for Florida State has helped them win three in a row these turnovers by Virginia leading to these runouts and just switching I mean Florida State just switching everything out here on the perimeter Again its functioning like a zone Virginia having a hard time getting inside of it Now he comes to get the ball with six on the shot clock Picks up his dribble cheering Whites got to get it up He forces a deep one but theres the offensive glass D Ritter with the board and back up and in And thats you know thats a big part of Virginias offense On the other end its Jones with two hands And thats a big part of Florida States offense So you get a look from both ends Offensive board leading to a put back and then Florida State they will run and they are so good at pitching it ahead up that sideline cheering Aenso in close and the sevenfooter from Nigeria finishes McCrae the fifth trying to back down the smaller defender No whistle as Florida State back within two I like it McCrae 64 190 lbs Mallerie 510 McCrae went into the back down game and uh the refs were not buying the flop Officials tonight Ron Guber Brian Okonnell Michael Greenstein cheering Trying to work the pick and roll steals the bump and hell get to the free throw line You know it was interesting talking to coach LZ today just about their improved defense that if you if you watched Florida State early in the year they were out pressing they were gambling they were trapping and and just got overextended And I think what he figured out is is you know they dont have quite the depth and it was burning them down back And so theyve gone as weve seen early in this game much more conservative cheering in their mantoman defense You know theyre inside that threepoint line Theyre switching you know basically one through four one through five when Chanty Wiggins is at the five The goal being to keep teams out of their paint because again they are last in the ACC in shot blocking So they just dont have that second level protection It was interesting when we spoke to coach LZ about it He said originally when I formed this team wanted to be athletic He wanted to put up a ton of points He quickly realized that wasnt working He said yes this is my first year Im willing to make an adjustment And theyve started to dig in defensively cheering Lewis goes one of two from the free throw line cheering Heres this pressure from Virginia And they dont typically trap out of it Its you know its just body blows Its like a boxer you know wanting wanting to get your jabs in throughout the course of the game have a cumulative effect and utilizing their depth Virginia plays nine guys and all of those guys give them production Martin Somerville off the bench back a point guard His first shot off the mark Kick out Thomas three cheering for Florida State doing a nice job on the defensive glass in transition as Leger Jones with the stitches starting to heat up and theyre going to take some shots sometimes youre like man thats not a good one but thats who they are They made 15 threes in that win over Notre Dame and you know there were at least four or five of those with a hand in the face White slipped keeps possession and a reaching foul is called on Somerville We saw Virginia throw the haymaker the first punch in this ball game but Florida State coming all the way back to tie this one up Well and its their tempo you know when they when they can rebound that initial miss from Virginia and even on the make I mean theyre theyre pitching the ball ahead and Virginia caught a little bit on their heels Having trouble getting in as Tillis is doubled in the corner INSIDE REJECTION AJ Swinton where did he come from cheering Hes a big time athlete The three way off but it is Steen on the offensive glass as hell be fouled Its a big time block AJ Swinton only a sophomore an outstanding athlete And look at him come from the corner He was involved in that trap off of the inbound and comes over to make a play Thats a heck of a backline save there by AJ Swinton That is 66 blocking a sevenfooter at the rim He He had a big time block in that in that win over Notre Dame in the second half of that game Jones off the inbound pullup three aggressive See if Virginia can find their offensive flow here Turnover there by Hall We played almost eight minutes here in Tallahassee Pick and roll Somerville dumps off to his big man but Ste cant finish through contact Virginia numbers Extra pass Tillis now the corner Straight on Three ball Virginia just so hard to keep to one possession cheering In close The big man missing Another opportunity Tillis is blocked Somerville probing in traffic Throws it up Gets it back Broken play and its pulled down by Grunlow He should have shot the first one Lucky he got it back and just kind of short armed it Open is Thomas cheering Virginia shooting just two for eight from beyond the arc to start this game And some of these are clean looks You know when youre guarding a team that shoots a lot of threes it starts with guarding the ball and you cannot overhelp Jones on a mission plus the foul Must be the stitches A little toughness from Le Jones 220 lbs coming at the rim attacking He has been on the attack And then heres Swinton That block coming across What a winning play We sure do And theres a vibe around this program And Luke Lax has a lot to do with it You know I think the fact that hes an an alum Hes a great hire It was so refreshing talking to him to him today and how candid he was about lessons hes learned this year You were making the point earlier First time doing this in college About half his staff you know came from the NBA And of course hes got a Hall of Famer in his corner A guy that he can call at any moment in Leonard Hamilton who is as respected as it gets in the profession A guy who coached Luke who can kind of you know point in point him in the right direction when he needs it So it was it was great talking to him today I need to know his barbers name because Im telling you the fade that Luke Ls sprocket is tight man That might have been one of the tips he got from coach Hamilton because him Leonard Hamilton has been my cheat code here in Tallahassee Penetration by Mallerie Kick out Ditter three off the mark but cold shooting continues for Virginia Theyve missed their lack seven from the floor Swinton open and Ritter with the board Said Virginias been getting looks just not able to knock them down early on Yeah and they had not been shooting it well going into that Syracuse game I mean in conference play theyre only shooting 32 as a team from three Theyre making nine because of the volume Good head fake by Mallerie way off on that attempt Florida State with an early threepoint lead Swinton will try again This one in and out Seinals doing a nice job getting back in transition as Derritter will not be denied What a load he is at 69 coming downhill He really is I mean hes you know they thats why they call him LeBron Ditter I mean hes got you know the same sort of physical frame 69 240 lbs This is what hes got to do Like I think sometimes Territter can settle for perimeter Jays Hes only shooting 25 from three in conference play And when he settles he bails out the defense You know I think hes got to put his head down more and force the defense to have to guard him And then if he misses at the rim hes so good at following up his own shot Hes so good on that offensive glass Was into the game tonight 11th in the ACC in scoring over 16 points per game That one rolls out Steam with a hand off to McGee and hell be fouled Shooting three So the second foul called on Chance Mallerie This is the mortal sin of defense I mean you you just cant foul a threepoint shooter Its a freshman a little bit overaggressive and again the scout coming in Weve got to you know take away threes A lot a big part of defending the threepoint line its not the makes its taking away the attempts and its about being there on the catch but you cannot foul a threepoint shooter So Valerie will have to take a seat with two fouls for Virginia as Shakari White comes back in McGee makes all three Virginia in a scoring drought over three minutes from the floor White a lot of dribble Shot clock winding down cheering And ono unable to bail out the Cavaliers Pick and roll Onenso tips it And Virginia ball How about that length How about that play by Onenso I mean thats where again that wasnt a a block shot but it functioned in the same way I mean thats where youre getting they platoon Johan Bruno and Oniansu Thats almost five blocks a game between the two of them And you know theyre playing about half the game each So youre getting 40 minutes of shot blocking And its one of the reasons why Virginia is so good or has been at defending that threepoint line Theyre the best in the ACC at doing that And you can push out when you know youve got that shot blocking behind you Florida State say settled into this matchup zone Lewis trying to penetrate find a soft spot White catch and shoot And the scoring drought from the outside ends for Virginia Jakari White starting to find his his feet You know he was out missed a about a month Hurt his hand back in December Hes got that protective wrap It was his nonshooting hand but hes starting to get back into flow Craig the fifth How about that answer in the eye of White Lewis right back cant get the reverse and McCrae the fifth trying to push the pace for Florida State Back tip out of bounds Immediate timeout as the Seinals controlling the P too much dribbling and too much standing around which plays into the hands of of what Florida States doing Virginia just one for the last 11 from the floor as Wiggins in close Had that one affected by Aneno cheering There they go to Derritter back to the basket Waits for the double Gets rid of it Ritter now on the drive and a wild shot Theres a turnover Yeah I mean he he drew the double but again nice recovery out of it defensively by Florida State Theres no cutting Theres just not enough off of the ball Everybodys kind of watching the guy with the ball dribble or play with it And give Florida State a lot of credit Theyve been on the spot tonight Their rotations their ability to defensive rebound has been on the money tonight Theyve been the more physical team to to start this game Craig the fifth trying to break down this man Gets back the rock high up off the foul on the floor his first and yeah hes just kind of playing playing bully ball there against Don Hall and able to get that shot off Onenso kind of caught no mans land there to affect the shot So Chance Mallalerie will come back in for Virginia with two fouls This foul line you know has also been an early part of of this game for Florida State You know this will be their will be their ninth and 10th free throw attempts Are you surprised how Florida States been able to control the pace here early on I think Florida State off of their three straight wins is playing with a ton of confidence more confidence that I have seen them play with all year And I think when when you are drilled you have it in your head and its been drilled into your head by your head coach in practice the last couple days that this is going to be a fist fight I think Florida State came ready for that Seinals largest lead of the game up seven Very similar possession what weve seen all game from Virginia Wild shot and its a one and done Extra pass Wiggins straight on and good board by Thomas And Wiggins hasnt even gotten going yet and Florida States up seven Everything on the perimeter for Virginia Under six minutes to play in this first half Mallerie open knocks it down Big three for the Cavaliers And all three of their threes in this game have come or four rather all four of their threes have come at the end of the shot clock where theyve played east west and then somebodys had to bail them out with a three McCrae trying to get his own miss but bats it out of bounds Saturday at 8 Eastern on ABC in the ESPN app the womens college game day crew will be in Baton Rouge to get you set for the biggest game of the night Number three South Carolina taking on number six LSU Saturday on ABC Pray the fifth will get a much needed breather for Florida State This hesitation baseline lowers that shoulder cut off and he traveled with it Theres nowhere to go again Nice job by Florida State not overhelping Once he picked up the ball everybody got back to their man And once theyve gotten you know closer to the basket Virginia has not showed a lot of poise in there I mean theyre you know there you just kind of you travel be theyre just collapsing on the ball Florida State is And you know again Virginia just not a lot of poise once theyve gotten it towards the basket Fifth turnover tonight by Virginia Wiggins trying to get going and shuffled his feet Travel Thats turnover number four for Florida State Chant Chanty Wiggins a guy you know had a a much smaller role at Clemson than than he does here You know at Clemson he he was this 610 spot up shooter and thats really all he wanted to do He is starting to show a little bit of an ability to post up here in conference play and he came into this game smoking hot from three Florida State on the switch Nice drop pass by Mallerie and its finished at the rim by Tillis and a nice cut off of the ball You get into the paint you carve up that defense and you get a nice cut along the baseline there by Tillis Wiggins Another attempt from deep In and out And Tillis will draw the foul on the rebound Wiggins just two points tonight 0 for five from the floor This is a guy coming off double figures in six straight games including 22 points scored in the last game the win at Notre Dame on Saturday Virginia chance to tie or take the lead this possession Thomas and he travels with it Florida States playing small you know like Alex Steen is hes not this massive force So theyre theyre just switching everything So that ball screen I dont think its giving you the action youre quite hoping for You know again I think just got to be you know driving your matchup and getting that offball cutting kind of like we saw on the last possession Jones crossover trying to get by Tillis Help D is there but the follow is good by Steam Hes done that so well this year Three offensive rebounds a game from the D2 transfer in Florida Southern College Mallerie a tough spinner in the lane This freshmans got so much poise and hes going to be on the all freshman team in this league and hes playing with two fouls Ste with a high ball screen as Jones is bound is bumped on the floor The freshman Chance Mallerie having a heck of a freshman year Heres that offball cut Thats how youre going to break down this Florida State defense Good look there by Mallalerie And then again getting into the paint 510 right up over the top Fifth national championship for the womens soccer team Third in the last five music years Well the men are feeding off the energy cuz theyve been stepping it up defensively They have They Theyve been on it man They they have guarded their matchup music Theyve been in that contain manto man Theres a travel area forcing Theyve done a nice job collapsing up collapsing on the ball when it gets into the paint Theyre in the gaps And then the other thing theyre doing a really nice job of is keeping Virginia off of the offensive glass Only four offensive rebounds so far from Virginia They havent really been able to convert off of those Florida States really been their defense cuz theyre only shooting 30 from the field So their offense you know has not really gotten going yet They have they have a twopoint lead because of how theyve defended One and one for Jones And he left it short Poundounding D there by Vong just staying in play I mean that thats just a really nice job there by Tomas Bang the freshman who was out of the play got back into it played from behind Hes been one of the keys to turning this team around defensively Hes long He has a 7 foot2 frame in terms of wingspan And he knows his role Hes the disruptor on the defensive end Pass deflected out of bounds Five on the shot clock for Virginia And that help is coming over early Its coming over low and early I mean there Martin Somerville was right on the spot Don Hall to inbound as Malleries got to go Shot clocks at three Kick out Pump fake Leaning in The refs are not bailing anybody out tonight And thats a shot clock violation And thats your center Alex Steen closing out on that play And you know Virginia you said it best John Virginia just kind of looking to be bailed out here Like you know Florida State have been the aggressors Theyve been the tougher team in this first half The fifth back on the floor as Jones leads all scorers right now with 12 Throws it up Does he need to play with stitches every night He might He might Its an unlocked something there in Le Jones And I I tell you you know the foul line is becoming a big narrative in this game I mean this will be the 13th free throw attempt by Florida State Only four on the other side for Virginia And again you get rewarded when you are the aggressive And I think thats a big part of them going to the line as much as they have Tomorrow nights ACC Network basketball double header at number 20 Clemson hosting Virginia Tech Thats at 7 Eastern And Wake Forest squares off against Georgia Tech Well the bandaid above the right eye of Lee Jones is now gone So those stitches exposed even more intimidating cheering Whats the key here for Virginia with just over two minutes to finish out this first half You know I think theyve got to show some more points You know I I think in the half court here theyve got to the guys off of the ball have to be more active Lewis hes going to get fouled at the rim Trying to get some penetration into the paint Maybe got his hand after that looked like a good block initially St Louis a guy showing his versatility last win against Syracuse Knocked down four threes 16point effort but realizing got to get the ball inside tonight here against Florida State They do not have a big front line cheering No Florida State does not And when Alex Steen goes out of the game which he is now theyre playing Shanty Wiggins up to five But thats again where they can switch one through five And that switching has really bothered Virginia It has really stood them up Tillis comes back in He replaces Hall for Virginia The fifth BLOWS BY HIS MAN OH MY ROBERT MCCRAE THE FIFTH JUST BODIED SOMEBODY cheering This place is buzzing in Tallahassee because this is a different Florida State team Ditter blocked from behind What did we just see How about the power of flight That do anything for you The power to kill a yak from 200 yd away with mind bullets A microcosm of the first half Taking the fight to Virginia cheering Coach Locks got in the community say we just need some atmosphere here tonight as Jer will be fouled going up Maybe he needs to open up the wallet and offer out some more beers each game I mean look at that fade hes got going there Hes got a be I mean hes buying beer for the fans Hes got an unbelievable fade and a and a beard trim I mean a beard lineup thats cheering whole thing just well put together by Luke Lax Look at this Look at that lineup on that beard And then the fade Got the burgundy jacket with the open collar You got Robert McCrae take catching dead bodies on dunks threepoint game One minute to play here in this first half Trey the fifth showing patience running clock He just elevated and yammed it on him Now the pass off the mark McGee fighting for the board Its one by Lewis Dillis lost his man but cant finish Ditter looking for help Lewis will try Knocks down the three We are tied at 32 Offensive board You know thats Virginia basketball And a nice spot up there by Lewis off of the board Shot clock turned off 14 seconds to finish this first half And a timeout is called by Florida State Redith music is on the floor I mean I I think he kind of lined him up and and let him attack You know its its so weird I music mean it feels like Florida State and they I think they have physically dominated this first half and yet its tied And I think some of music those threes you know the two threes more than Florida State has has has music you know certainly helped Virginia Virginias defense has been you know pretty good overall So as he called it Craig the fifth rocking his hand Nine seconds to play in this half Gives it up Jones rises in and out Virginia with three seconds Tipped out of bounds 16 to end this first half And Ryan Odum will call a timeout for Virginia Virginia All right were going to step aside here in Tallahassee and come back after this quick break Well Chris you talked music about it As much as Florida State has controlled things in this first half Virginia a chance to take the music lead into the locker room here See what Ryan ODMs got here The officials have added more time 21 seconds now on the clock Side out of bounds from 34 court Tillis to inbound Throws it deep Picked off SWINTON IS BLOCKED BY Derritter and thats how the first half will end a competitive battle You know obviously hasnt hit a three They got to get some other guys I mean two guys you know Le Jones and Robert McCrae the fifth going for 27 to the 32 versus the balance that Virginia had Thats got to change for Florida State Heres Wiggins as they got the switch McCrae the fifth with the big man deritter on him and he nails it in his eyes Hes shown you everything I mean dunk at the basket shows you the three his ability to handle back door cut and a nice finish by music Sam Lewis And theres that cut off of the ball You know you isolate that side play out of halftime A designed back door cut three off the mark Rebounded by Thomas That is now Virginia looking to push the pace Its swatted McCrae the fifth with a block as Jones coming the other way Lane opens up and the dish to Steen who rocks the rim Its just not well defended I mean they ran into that ball screen that early drag and Virginia completely caught off guard That middle was wide open Just right in the face of Tester Ritter there What a sequence by one man as Ditter double team gets rid of it Thomas lines up a three Too strong The Ritter gets thrown off of him as Jones keeps it possession for Florida State Well Ryan ODM asking for a hooking foul there And I I dont I understand where hes coming from I mean in order to throw that off Ditter Jones had to kind of hook around him Watch this You cant see it from there He that right arm of Jones hooks around Der got away with a little push off there as he used the screen from Steen blocked but contact and the whistle called on St Louis Thatll be his second personal Jay Jones is a guy who has been able to turn his season around Early on he was very much dependent on making shots if they werent falling you could feel his energy drop But it shifted when the whole team decided to buy into defense He bought in with them And hes a defender a rebounder and his offense kind of follows along now Yeah Leads them in blocks Hes their second leading rebounder I mean hes a guy he shot 38 from three at St Vonovich last year and he just hasnt shot it as well percentagewise but he to your point John he has found other ways to make his impact All calling out the pray for Virginia They played almost two minutes here in the second half Setting the feet is Lewis but left it short And a foul is called as Lewis cant believe That is his third Thats two quick fouls on Lewis A foul on the possession before And yeah thats a foul Thats a good call The refs in the stands My man in the front row was all over it This is one of those environments when when this place gets packed it can become a tough place to play Jones draws two defenders and Virginia with the steal Thomas bumped but they call it on the floor No basket Theres a well executed trap on the other end there And you know both teams you can tell early in this half have tried to play ahead of the defense the other teams defense There was not a lot in the fast break in that first half Both teams did a nice job getting back and and setting their defense Chance Mallerie had some nice moments in the first half penetrating for Virginia but threw that one away Pray the fifth one on two just calmly behind the back as the shot clock did not reset and the officials will pause it and get that cleaned up Over the course of the win streak for Florida State theyve won three in a row against Cal Stanford at Notre Dame This is a big test tonight A step up to see is this team really for real Yeah no question about it Can you validate the wins against teams in the lower half of the league Steen sets the screen for McCrae the fifth Draws the attention for Jones and he knocks it down What a pass You know Robert McCrae the fifth shoots it lefthanded but hes really righthanded His dad who was his high school coach taught him to shoot with his left hand but he throws a dime a skip over the top with that right hand and finds Le Jones in the corner Again hes righthanded on a rope to Jones with the help all the way over And Jones and McCrae stay hot in this second half Hes got a season worth of highlight reel plays in this game alone tonight Hall open knocks down the three A much needed bucket for Virginia now down four CR fifth off the mark Backside board by Jones Stripped away by Derritter And hes bringing it up the floor Oh probably got away with a travel there Thomas three and its Jones ripping it away cheering to fifth up top as Steen is fouled hard and will get to the free throw line Alistine plays so hard He just he plays so hard Here he is running the floor going after it played at Division 2 Florida Southern last year and he was going to have to be a presence today because of the size up front for Virginia He looks certainly looks tired but he just never stops playing and gives you everything he has So many different ways to build a program these days with the NIL the transfer portal but you can tell head coach Luke Ls effort is his calling card early on in his tenure at Florida State Finding a guy like Steam who just kind of gives it everything he has Uh its a big jump obviously to to go from where he was and he averaged 18 and 10 at Florida Southern last year but obviously jumping up here to the ACC as as Luke Lax was telling talking to us about today and hes obviously a big big jump but hes been so I mean hes got more offensive rebounds on the year than defensive I mean thats how active he has been especially on on that end Second one in and out as Tillis corrals the board Virginia down five Thomas caught in the air and he threw it away Somerville Virginia catching a break there Almost threw it away but it goes off McCrae the fifth How about this dime from Robert McCrae the fifth crosscourt finds his guy Le Jones and music its Florida State up five What a classic cheering Carrer in the game for the first time as Florida State unable to get that turnover You know you mentioned it earlier about Tomas Bassang the the freshman He was not starting from for much of the year Luke La finally went to him for his defense You know you see it there on the ball Hes got about a 74 wingspan very versatile very switchable on the defensive end cheering Pass is picked off Florida State with a twoonone break Oh Florida State is getting up and down the floor here tonight these turnovers You know I think when Ryan Odum looks back at this game I mean they have 10 turnovers in this game so far and a lot of them have been really sloppy I mean thats just sloppy basketball Cant inbound it Throwing a pass that you know starts the break for Florida State And its kind of you know again 10 turnovers and the bulk of them have just been careless Swing cant convert on the first free throw The lead is now six Largest lead tonight for Florida State was seven in the first half No der on the floor Whos going to step up for Virginia Heres White High elevation and he rips the net from deep Look at this But back the other way and Chanty Wiggins is now on the board off a made three I that just cannot happen You know Florida States coming You know they want to attack in transition off makes or misses White step back three Two on HIM AND IT DOESNT MATTER Jakari White backto back threes Hes got the Jakari out tonight making the trip here to Tallahassee Hes got some bounce on him He sure does And and hes a microwave you know He Hes shooting 43 from three He is a specialist And when he gets it going he could start shooting it off of the bounce like that last one he just made Second unit on the floor for Virginia trying to come back into this game Down two A tough fadeaway and knocked out of bounds and its going to be Cavaliers ball And heres this white three and then watch Florida State They get the ball up and this pitch ahead They are so good at that Nice job by Chanty Wiggins right the middle of the floor Count just one dribble I dont really even know if he needed it Oh Oh I thought about it Got caught in no mans land and turned it over Its another careless turnover You know again thats their 11th They only average 11 a game And you know he he wanted this again Hes going to stay aggressive And a nice job by Le Jones getting that stick hand just kind of reaching out and taking White off of that shot See the turnover numbers 11 to six tonight up in close Fight for the rebound One by Florida State Jones push off and hes going to get called for that offensive foul Thatll be his third personal White has been the offense with Derritter on the bench for Virginia Kick out to Tillis and on the Enso backside offensive rebound Penetrating kick the three off the mark and its Jones settling it down Jones starting to feel it And a good box out by Mallerie cheering White in close Had it taken away by Jones Turnover number 12 tonight for Virginia Jones coast to coast but cant finish at the rim Youre right there You got to get that to go Trying to pull off a win like this against a a team like Virginia you got to make layups Mallerie felt the contact Felt it should have been an and one as he ties the game at 45 Ryan ODM has gone with both his point guards Mallerie and Hall in the game at the same time and I think for their ability to get inside of this mantoman Florida State defense Theyre both doing a nice job getting paint touches Shot clocks at eight Somerville uses the screen Fade away midrange And here comes V Virginia in transition Tillis cut off and a spin move rolls out Neither team lighting up terms of field goal percentage tonight Open from the wing McGee and Florida State from downtown five for 24 tonight And thats the shot that Virginias willing to give up I mean theyre coming They are shrinking the floor big time Coming all the way over Those two players opposite were wide open Mallerie throws it up but too high for Onenso McGee turning the corner high off the glass and its Florida State back on top Timeout Virginia as the Cavaliers look to make a hockey line sub The ability to get inside the other teams defense to play in the paint Really nice touch off of the glass there by McGee Keep up that pace And they certainly have Theres a cheering two two3 zone out of the timeout by Luke Lox First time weve seen this two three tonight Starters back on the floor for Virginia cheering Heres Ditter way short on that three And thats a settle And thats why you come out of the timeout in a two3 zone You know Ryan ODM drew something up you imagine against man and Virginia never really got into anything Ball just kind of moved around the perimeter Ray the fifth forcing the contact there and he gets the whistle Foul called on Virginia You see that Charlie Woods Tigers son committed to Florida State golf How about that Big deal Big deal How about this How about these numbers You asked if Jones and McCrae the fifth could keep it up They have been carrying the load right now Oh wow Sneaking free is Kobe McGee What a set Little screen to screener and McGee shakes loose and nobody there in the front of the rim Paul left open bricked it tipped out and he gets his own miss cheering Thomas cant hit as McGee skying in for the board Quickly coming the other way is Swinton finds the Trey the fifth Lewis in transition off the mark Its not a good shot You know he thought he was open It was a really good contest Steal that back flow by I think it was Swinton I mean just a nice job getting back into play Its not a good shot Virginia 3 for 12 from beyond the arc here in this second half Gray the fifth steps into it and its taken away by McGee challenging the big man and finishes up high Florida States gone right at the shot blocking of Virginia tonight We saw the dunk from McCrae in the first half right there against Brunow Virginia keeps keeps taking it from the outside as Florida State has been packing it inside defensively McCra the fifth WITH THE SPIN PLUS the foul Florida States plus eight in the paint and theyre doing this against the leagues best shot blocking team in Virginia and Grunos there Hes just not into play And Robert McCrae has been a man amongst these boys for Virginia in their back room I mean he has just gone to work screaming Fourth personal on Sam Lewis who goes to the bench for Virginia McCrae the fifth converts and its a nine nothing run for Florida State cheering cheering Heres to Ritter has not been able to get going tonight Shot clocks at seven with the crowd getting it into it cheering Paul gives it up White rises knocks it down when Virginias in trouble It has been Jakari White with the bail out tonight Well theyve been short closing out Theyve been in the gaps leaving guys all night long Hes one of those guys you probably got to adjust course cuz he has been smoking hot in this second half Bumping the smaller defender Virginia rips down the rebound Theres Onenzo altering that shot Mallerie gets rid of it finds Hall from the corner and White keeps it alive for Virginia Got to be able to guard the ball and they have not been able to do that Virginia against Robert music McCrae the fifth Dont got it well especially from deep in this second half Just four for 15 Thatll be Don Hall will inbound Mallerie on the drive Kick out to Derritter Side step Hell find White Shot clocks now down to five Virginia in scramble mode and Dwight to bail him out again Its a closeout drill for Florida State as the ball kept moving around the perimeter Finally Jakari White decided to go north south and get into the paint and able to score 14 points tonight for Jakari White as Jones curling rises knocks it down Jones now with 21 to lead all scores Mallerie as White out jumps everybody to keep it alive Mallerie head fake Push shot short Rebound to Ritter Third chance for Virginia cheering cheering cheering Onenso with the chin up on the rim Good pass Good roll by Onenso and good poise there Taking his time Fivepoint leads as Jones finds steam White cant find this one but Onenso with the rebound He will reload and rattles it in His fifth three of the night Thats Jakari White bringing Virginia all the way back You know Florida State for the most part has done a good job keeping Virginia off of the offensive glass until the last couple minutes Some offensive rebounds and Oni Enso doing work Here he is on this roll Two on the ball Good job using that pivot foot And then here he is on the music offensive glass You know just fighting for this Using that length over Steen Good one extra pass by Don Hall and Jakari White music stays hot Even with the rough shooting Virginia music finding themselves down by just two with over 5 minutes to play here in this second half Florida State youve been led by Jones with 21 and McCrae the fifth with 19 But I think what youve seen John over the last couple possessions is Virginia getting inside the paint They are playing inside out And thats where some of those threes for this guy are coming from You know its easy to settle with the way that Florida State is playing against you Its easy to settle for threes and just kind of move the ball around the perimeter When theyre able to go north south Virginia is creating stuff White guarding McCrae the fifth Now the switch with Ditter on him Derritter bonning him as McCrae the fifth and is going to be bumped and called for not like that one Just his second personal tonight And thats now the seventh team foul and will send Florida State to the line for a one and one And Florida State conversely only has three So if youre Florida State down the balance of this game the ball in this guys hands and putting your head down and forcing Virginia to have to play you without fouling What an edge at the foul line here today for Florida State This will be 21 and 22 attempts at the foul line today to Virginias eight One of two from the line and the lead is three White He finds the ball Hes been the man for Virginia in this second half cheering cheering Oh nothing doing Shot clock winding down He put White in a tough spot and a shot clock violation He sure did And how about Robert McCrae Im not leaving you Jakari White I am not leaving you for anything Really well done by Robert McCrae the fifth Look at him in the far corner on Jakari White I am not leaving you And how about that contest without fouling Coach L said McCrae the fifth has been the most consistent player all season long for Florida State He finds Swinton and the offensive rebound And Florida State wants to run clock here Oneonone against the Ritter McCrae the fifth with the blow by kick out Now the switch Swinton on White White from the corner rolls off the rim Chanty Wiggins got lucky allowing him to catch that You got lucky that he missed That goes off pre the fifth The good hands by Dorito Just 310 to play We will step aside with Florida State up three Weird at times the games flow but both of these teams laying it out there Just a threepoint lead for Florida State with three minutes to play cheering Heres Ditter Rattles in the free throw jumper for Ditter Just his seventh point of the night That was the second time out of a timeout Luke L showed zone Virginia prepared for it You put Ditter right in the middle there Seen Ditter on the switch on the Trey The fifth kick out finds Somerville Blocked Seven on the shot clock for the Seminals What a close out by Onian And that was a really nice design by Florida State AJ Swinton set a screen You see him setting the screen there to get the shooter to the corner And what a block Thats a big time play Shot clock winding down McCrae the fifth with three seconds Gives it up Somerville backside board to Jones Florida State wants the ISO It is Jones now backing down white Onenso lurking Comes with the help and he swats it You know theyve got Oni Enso is kind of playing a oneman zone Theyre in a man obviously but hes kind of hes not guarding anybody Hes just there to do that Florida State needs a quick one Four seconds on the shot clock Heres Swinton And thats the guy that Oniansu is guarding And hes obviously not guarding him They see him as a nonshooter It allows Onensu to just camp right in the middle Virginia a chance to take the lead with under two minutes to play And a reachin foul called on swing Got fouls to give in Florida State Virginia has not led this game since it was 152 in the first half Heres Derritter with the push off Got away with it and the rebound to Jones Thats what Ryan ODM wanted Ditter going to his right hand using his strength Just couldnt finish Florida State for their last seven from the floor Trey the fifth off balance No whistle and its Virginia with numbers THERE GOES WHITE JUST RISING UP AND THE CAVALIERS take the lead What a burst What a burst by White to attack the rim He has got some kind of bounce Under a minute to play here in this second half McCrae the fifth short rebound on Yenso cheering Theyll have to foul obviously Florida State led this the entire second half until Virginia just took the lead cheering D Ritter in close off the window If youre Florida State do you need a three here I mean at this pay yeah I think Luke Glass wanted a timeout You did You did not need a three And you still dont need a three coming out of this timeout And how about Tesa Ritter I mean you know him going to his right hand with his 240lb frame is really hard to guard And he does a nice job on that last shot there playing off of two feet I mean you just This is really hard to guard Plays off of two feet goes glass What a big and Jones Everybody else is over from the floor Yeah but you have good shooters out there I mean thats obviously I think thats an anomaly You have other good shooters Chanty Wiggins being one of them And Wiggins has the Ritter on him They love pick and pop with Chanty Wiggins Here we go McCrae the fifth with 17 seconds to play in regulation Here is Jones man in the air Throws it up off the mark Ditter with the board and Mallerie will be fouled I dont like that look Once it wasnt there you you go to shot Its got to be a clean in on rhythm shot Once you go shot fake and he doesnt bite and hes really well defended This is a nice job here by Sam Lewis kind of kind of jumping but not fouling Florida State still just five team fouls 82 seconds to play Oh WAS THAT A TURNOVER YES IT IS FLORIDA State will get the ball back Now you need three And you do have a timeout just careless turnovers for a lot of this night It is Virginia calling the timeout here to set up the defense What a game here in Tallahassee And these turnovers thats the 14th turnover And again the bulk of them have just been careless by Virginia Now heres the question Youre up three and youre Virginia Do you foul or do you let Florida State get a look Yeah I I would foul but again you know coaches it it it differs but but Im definitely in favor of fouling especially music cuz you know youve got a better rebounding team so you you feel like youd be able to secure a defensive board McCrae the fifth two of five from downtown music tonight So you want to foul somebody as theyre getting into that shot Remember Florida State still has a timeout remaining Right to fifth gets the ball Brings it up 5 seconds to play and he uses the final timeout for Florida State Looking for a chance to tie it here with 44 seconds remaining Wiggins inbounds He finds McCrae the fifth off the rim Derritter with a rebound and he is fouled It looks like there is still time on the clock Shes well defended even up to that point And there was a lot of stuff going on A lot of movement by Florida State A really good job there by Don Hall So the officials going to the monitor to determine just how much time should remain on the clock Theyre going to have to inbound it as that was The foul called with3 Virginia has to inbound Length of the court and thatll do it What a comeback victory for Virginia to stay red
