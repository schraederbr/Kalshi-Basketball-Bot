emphasis in Dukes practice today app will be the transfer from Florida hes been around in ACC plays averaging seven assists per game one assist less than that or fewer than that overall this year but about 18 points as well just about ready to tip it up our officials Ron Gruber Jeffrey Anderson and John Gaffney theyre underway and Duke will control it first with the Freshman from Australia Tyrese Proctor with the ball thank you mantoman defense from Wake Forest there is Phillip Palestine weve mentioned here he has played extraordinary basketball Blue Devils again tonight Debbie without Tariq Whitehead fabulous freshman battled injuries all year long another freshman Derek wifey misses the first three the Duke gets multiple size in their offense and theyve got to find phillipowski early hes got the smaller demandes Monsanto on him inside Jamari Monsanto is a shooter that is fearless as cam Hildreth left his man in the dust and got the easy way up in the first bucket of the night Blue Devils going with Jeremy roach at the point guard and outside of that The Four Freshmen Applause why is a shot blocker drive but he did not play in the first meeting between the two Lively a little contact inside the call is going to be against Wake Forest and Cameron Hilder draws his first personal foul Wake Forest is on a threegame losing side lost a couple of close wins behind Steve Forbes in his third year Wake Forest has done an outstanding job on the way and its good from Jeremy Roach one of the reasons why Wake Forest is elected to go small early is for this right here to drive to the paint and try to score off Dukes defense roach not hesitating offensive rebound and put back by Lively and theres the problem with the small lineup its Duke on the glass the top rebounding team and the best offensive rebounding team in the ACC you know Debbie in the first meeting Wake Forest out rebounded him in fact in terms of rebound margin it was Dukes second poorest rebounding performance of the season over Wake Forest where I partly Purdue out rebounded boot by more than Wake Forest did children thats not really his game to step back three and its an air ball and here come the Blue Devils I believe Lively got a piece of that Lively again he brought contact with one of the freethrow line footer pass him to another inside Applause this is the offensive rebounding by Duke the offensive rebound almost 39 percent of their misses that is a very high offensive rebounding percentage theres a lot that comes with that too if you see the starting lineup average height size Reese the block that comes with that offensive rebounding they take shots in their offense that they know theyre going to take and they have a lot of long athletic that can rebound out of their area just over two minutes into the game and Cameron Hildreth who had the first bucket for Wake Forest also has two fouls and Forbes will put him on the bench hell be replaced by The Freshman from Sweden Bobby Clinton number 34 whos the guy that Forbes is telling us today that Wake Forest is going to make a run it could really use some production out of him hes got a little more size has some experience playing for the Swedish national team as he rounds into form as the Legion in the States this is Andrew Carr and the transfer is a good shooter for the perimeter so to his Appleby and Appleby rims out Applause Mitchell going to drive it uses that big body but its knocked Away by Monsanto Williamson lost his footing and the basketball turnover Wake Forest Roach really good decision making nothing run from the Blue Devils and roach has five of the Blue Devils eight points you can see why roach is so valuable to organizing them playing in Pace playing with decision making at a high rate of speed and Ruth Parr with the three so this is the five out offense for Steve Forbes trying to pull Lively away from the bucket trying to make him guard on the perimeter the Top Shot Blocker in the Ace second best job Locker in the ACC Ford trying to hold his own on the boards tonight and hoping to get enough from his perimeter shooter you see what hes been able to do in his third season they have lost their last three but the last two losses by combined Four Points theyve lost to NC State on Saturday Im just a brilliant performance and DJ Kerns who had 31 and really had his way inside against that demon Deacon defense you know they elected not to double DJ was able to be crafty and creative on the inside an MC state with a twopoint win survived her quavion Smith being in foul trouble most of the game subject to fouls that last one was called unlikely his first Monsanto went to climb well say that many times tonight damari is a guy after my own heart he has zero conscience when it comes to shooting basketball hes the 21st century from downtown we love watching him play right I mean hes got a fire from all over the place but the important thing for Duke is to make him make shots moving his feet dribbling the basketball dont let him catch it soon he almost won this thing from 75 feet when the Demon Deacons were in here last year the game that you and I called into the course of the other in a twopoint game and hit the back of the iron so Im clear to watch also hes coming out from the killings injury really didnt expect him to play last year and had his weight up last year hes down about 25 pounds and hes really improved his play this year into the shot clock weight gets a block cars hit one hell try another top and itll be Duke basketball and off to a quick start expecting an up and down game here tonight Blue Devils with an early threepoint lead ESPNs exclusive last night blowing a 23point lead in the last 12 or 13 minutes gets a lot easier with Kent is coming to town Auburn and Tennessee will follow up the volunteers under Rick Barnes now up to number two Zach Edie and boiler up at Indiana Florida Kentucky at 8 30 inconspicuous by its absence the 6 30 game North Carolina and Duke rare meeting between the two when they will run ranked Debbie during practice today John Shire in his first year at the head coach but hes been around Duke forever a long time Mike assistant played here for four years and I asked him about the danger of knowing Carolinas on the horizon where the Eagles come out flat and he said it was a real thing except for these guys are so young they dont really know what they dont know they dont know whats coming up this weekend theyre just trying to focus on what they have right here to deal with and thats way for us so those that thought this might be attractive you can forget about that because John moved clear to us that that would not be because well the thing that helps too is the Wake Forest beat them is Winston Salem earlier is Philip house he puts one in the basket so it felt like they owed Wake Forest a little business on the boards particularly not to mention getting a victory Dukes alternating wins and losses over its last five they mentioned the Peaks on a threegame losing streaks for both teams going to leave a victory here Blue Devils have got to lose the ACC play on Coach K Court Williamson getting in the pump and coming off that time now Wake Forest stays with a small lineup car at the five foreign another bounce pass and great defense by Wake Forest to recover and Keith Mitchell from getting that shot up Applause dont be surprised to see Duke continue to try to score on the paint right here to use that size Proctor with a pullup his first bucket you know he ate eight assists and no turnovers against Georgia Tech you can see the growth in that young man inside the Duke system Applause 43point win against the struggling yellow jackets on Saturday Monsanto part three I mean you got a really close the space on Monsanto so quickly into the rhythm of his shot thats why you got to make him dribble if you let him catch him shoot this percentage of scoring goes up Applause first three ball on the board of an idea three of them in the first move scored 22 on Saturday in that losing effort Against the World Cup heres Rhodes High handoff excellent read by Carr to step in there and not only get the steal but draw the foul on lively as well watch how quickly Monsanto gets his feet set into his catch and shoot three second turnover leads to the second foul on lively which brings Ryan young graduate transfer from Northwestern into the game and there is come on sent over his last six games hes getting a quick rest theres really shot the ball in a foreign Applause from England draws a foul hes stationary in that dribble handoff he could be calling that a lot more its been perhaps a point of emphasis I think you have to call her otherwise its a huge advantage foreign Applause fights for it and now I think theyre going to get Young on the reach thats his first so the Duke big men have drawn three fouls in the just under seven minutes of play Applause also into the game is Jalen place number two for the Blue Devils right in that mask both his nose and practice a couple of weeks ago foreign Music ER floating creating gets his own it didnt hit the rim theyre gonna have to get it back up Clement knew all about it and Bobby punchman knocks down the three thats that production that youre talking about Reese Clinton has to be ready to score he wants coach Forbes wants him ready to score thats a big shoot the defensive hit three from Beyond The Arc in the opening moment and the bulk of their offense Roach tangled up with Applebees perhaps either that or has spent some time in theater class has Applebees first foul well you want to contest the jumpsuit that you definitely dont want to foul and Appleby knows as big as it dropped coverage so hes got to just contest and try not to let him turn the corner Jeremy Rhodes the team captain 76 free throw shooter misses the first youll get John Shire in his first season as the Blue Devil head coach had a lot of close gains philipowskis played very well for him put his own mark on his death bringing in someone from outside the big family to be on his staff Jay Lucas who we visited with earlier today too veteran assistant coach coming over from Kentucky so Shire highly competitive energetic guys stepping into gargantuan shoes obviously no place hes very comfortable with Builders back in the game playing with the two fouls so hes going to drive phillipowski theres an example of Hildreth playing off two feet like youve talked about youve got to play on balance who when you get enough or lurking you got to be ready to make a play to your teammates before tip off tonight and Cameron into our moment of silence for the legendary Billy Packer guard at Wake Forest he took the Demon Deacons to the final four in 1962 but made his greatest impact on the game as the voice of college basketball he called 34 consecutive final fours not only working for CBS but also regionally here where basically he was a c bet ACC basketball as it pertains to broadcasting on television Steve Forbes grew up in Iowa wasnt necessarily always familiar with all of the nuances of ACC basketball the Traditions but he knew Billy Packer and when he got to Wake Forest job Steve went on the radio show with our friend and colleague Mark Packer whos Billys son only Steve didnt know it at the time and Steve said that he blamed Billy Packer for getting his first technical foul as you see Mars with another high percentage shot which is what he does but even watching a game that Billy was broadcasting when Indiana was playing bob Knight was hosting him Billy talked about how coach Knight was really working those officials and that would pay off later in the game and get him some calls so so he was a junior college coach 24 years old he said hey thats a good idea Ill work the officials tomorrow night so he goes out starts working the officials at about a minute into the game gets banged with a t and decided maybe that doesnt work for everybody he said he blamed Billy for that and he didnt realize at the time that Mark was Billys son such a great story I can tell you for growing up in this area that I learned a lot about basketball listening to Billy Packer Packer and Thacker phones McKinney Marty brennaman Jefferson pilot broadcast of ACC basketball how about that play from Clinton to slow down the Duke fast break just a reflection why coaches charcoal is the deflection is slow Duke but didnt slow philippowski from getting into the paint but powski was held to single digits in the first meeting against Demon Deacons one of them only two times thats happened this year and Appleby has not scored in the game yet so Im waiting for them to call his number see if he can get something here on a ball reversal Applause Granderson number 13s into the game for Duke hes a graduate transfer from Illinois he was the one charged with watching the sharp shooting Monsanto so I wasnt sure this might happen in the game but Duke has countered with a smaller lineup as well Wake Forest has made him play a little bit smaller lets see if that neutralizes them on the glass A little bit look what they were even on the glass of the last media timeout so thats a pause for Wake Forest to check and boost column is it Appleby have yet to score Nora had he gone to the freezer behind his both points have been assistant Point shooting and getting that going when something Duke would like to do Proctor misses young gives roach another chance and hes got his second three ball I always think that offensive rebound kick out to the three is a momentum builder for the team Applebees lost him it chases it down now working off the marsh screen the floater and the foul and good thing I got that noted about him not being to the fruit going to the freethrow line or scoring you know what Rhys I mean he has an incredible change of pace and acceleration especially coming off screening action heres the offensive rebound the kick for the three roaches second and then watch Appleby he comes right off that Marsh screen to the Elbow Wake Forest likes to play through those elbows through the slot areas might help him see a big basket and get going it might be a little counterintuitive but Duke wants to make him a scorer tonight right as opposed to pass right hes third in the league and scoring they want to make him a score when he gets in the paint they want they they think he goes into the paint to make a play if they can keep him out of the paint and make him make shots outside the paint thats part of their game plan tonight young defroster and an offensive foul Hildreth playing fearlessly playing with two fouls and getting in Proctors path getting his position and drawing the offensive foul is it Fearless kind of Cameron hilders middle name I mean this is a tough dude right here he plays hard and you got to referee the defense there and Im not sure that he had positioned I I dont think he did I was going to say in watching the replay Fearless is one way to say it maybe desperately trying to catch up as another heres Appleby getting by roach now fading and it wont go Proctor for the Blue Devils were awake doing a good job of getting back Putman knows active hands again another deflections time to steal app will be Corner three and a Wake Forest takes the lead 1918 Applebees got six thats the race to space Sprint run hard score quickly in your offense before dukin gets set and take advantage of your ball screen offense Im gonna get Andrew Carr for a hole its his first I mean watch this right here head out to the Deep corner he is ready to catch and shoot he knows that Balls going up before it gets in his hands and he gets his feet organized 610 Clinton with really good feel and timing on that pass too Monsanto has it taken away from him by Granderson good hustle Illinois transfer and theres Applebee with the steal and the flush Appleby has scored eight in a row Wake Forest is back on top and Duke would like to visit about the most recent turn of events Tyree Appleby with eight demon Deeks on the road up three theres a knack and a beauty to being able to just settle into a game Tyree Appleby put up big numbers all a year this year in this eight nothing run is courtesy of the veteran guard you could you could fly Wake Forest leads the ACC in scoring thats 78 points a game he has the ability to play with Incredible quickness and explosion at the same time now roach motor and nice soft touch from Jeremy Roach hes into double figures with 11 Applause Penny roach will definitely be right here to try to trust the approach roach wanted to he was failing it Proctor instead thats why sprinting the floor hard every possession is so important because it opens up space on the top of the floor and thats exactly where Proctor was trailing in that transition Id have gotten a little glimp from The Crazies of the Australian flag which is just next to the baby which Finds Its way amongst the crazies every Duke home game fightman his second three of the night boy hes really provided a lift off the bench on both ends of the floor these minutes are going to keep going up if he plays like that so Lively has returned for the Blue Devils playing with two and and they will call to travel I was waiting to see as our officials talked it over whether they were going to call the foul but instead they call it a travel and its a turnover getting business done from Beyond The Arc he adds this to his game and Proctor is going to be a major problem and Clinton has been playing extraordinarily well and nearly going for the deacons are up one you come out over there with a win especially when you lost three in a row and now theyve got another tough game coming up Iowa state has lost three out of four they needed to get things right Kansas State tonight or what a job Jerome Tang has done in his first year Manhattan meanwhile Wake Forest just hit seven of their last 11 shots make it seven to 12 for akowski clears it away for Duke Applause s development has allowed roach to get off the ball a little bit more Grand is removed closed out by Monsanto to keep him from pulling the trigger a lively size advantage on car Andrew will be called for his second foul Applause postup game here tonight they like the empty block The Cutting and trying to get some stuff going through the paint through the elbows very much a motion game Applause Lively with the soft touch hasnt shot a lot of free throws this year its been an average freethrow shooter well hes definitely a great rim protector and they like to keep him in the parent number two in the ACC or block shots I think from watching him in practice today and then just in as he gets more tense gets healthier hes at earliest part of the Season dealt with some things hes hes a good shooter hes got a really nice touch we saw him out doing early work before practice today and then Lively had a ball to select right off his Noggin after the whistleblue you know a lot of hes a great defender right hes very good in ball screen coverage he can play in the drop coverage he can guard on the perimeter hes got incredible length hes got great timing on the defensive end that is the part of his game that that will continue to improve I dont think his percentages are really good right now but I agree with what youre saying watching him in workouts today he was really working on extending his range Debbie that last foul was on Proctor its his second on Santo ties it guy that could give Duke a lift in Perimeter shooting has checked into the game The Freshman Jaden shoot from Northville Illinois number 14 Monsanto makes both of them and Wake Forest Back on Top by a single really entertaining first half in the early going Duke and Wake Forest we stand as Debbie Antonelli Cameron Indoor Stadium weight trying to snap a threegame slide and win in this building for the first time since Tim Duncan was their star in 1997 heres philipowski and he lost it on the way to the basket and the foul is going to be called on Bobby Clinton how about that ball fake and hes going straight to the rack what incredible footwork what skill filipowski leads his team in scoring and rebounding has 10 double doubles on the season I mentioned right off the top of the telecast seven times hes been ACC rookie of the week and numbers like this not only in the ACC but in the nation and you see just why he has been everything they could have hoped for its the three he runs in transition hes excellent in their ball screen offense hes a good cutter as well for a seven foot guy most seven Footers cant cut from the perimeter into the basket and then exit cut and get your footwork squared away so you can knock down shots he can do all of that at seven feet Applause not sure exactly what all they were straightening out but finally give the ball to Kyle for his second free throw maybe they iced him a little bit 26 all inside six minutes to play in the first half Applause three ball on the way Mitchell clears it away for the Blue Devils Applause Here Comes Jeremy Roach goes into double figures in the first half hes provided the sparse to Blue Devil Captain roach again hes got 13 this is a slight thing but I think its a really important Adjustment John Shire moving roach from the top of the floor over to the wing I think hes an excellent decision maker and he can make plays because its a he can play on one side not to play in the middle of the floor where theres help Davion Bradfords in the game goes and sets a giant screen for Appleby who finds Williamson left it short Mitchells been very active on the boards physical presence taking it himself now leaves it with roach will pull up again ball was knocked away but it will go to Wake Forest and the captains doing work look on the twoman side you can see the little screen and then get to the elbow and pull up jump shot hes probably done that a million times Applause right by roach and scores to tie it hes into double figures with 10 dirty doubled his field goal output from the first meeting at 13 to 14 free throws in that first meeting Applause Dukes kept him off the line oh its at one time but hes on his points elsewhere and kolapowskis going to go back to the free throw line how about this Blow by from Tyree Appleby I mean here comes the change of pace right right at the hip high off the glass you talked to him today about playing in Steve Forbes system as opposed to some of the other systems hes placed his third stop in college most recently at Florida Freedom freedom to play Freedom to make plays coach Forbes really trusting you know he brings great joy to the game is what we were told everybody wants to play with a guy like that right hes unselfish he can score he can make plays he can make a play for you even in their offseason Trip Steve was telling us how the players sort of gravitated to him it was obvious he was going to assume a leadership role in short order and hes done that now has seven Duke has a twopoint lead headed toward the fourminute Mark in the first half Appleby pull up again that ones no good and I think theyre going to get Tyree for the foul it was a little frustrated with himself and picking up a cheapy theyre in the one in one I have to check who the foul was on momentarily he had super duty presented by Progressive will take us to the SEC Kentucky and Ole Miss tonight at nine oclock Eastern time and beg your pardon been corrected on the Falcon Tyree did get caught up in the Collision but the foul was called on Bobby Quitman thatll be his second I beg your partner Ill get it straight in a minute weve got fouls going back and forth everywhere you know Clintons got to raise his hand to take that one remember when you used to do that yeah did you have to raise your head good for you Im gonna stand up to this power hungry referees trying to make you raise your hand for public scoring and Jaden shoot picks up his first round all of a sudden uh the whistles have gotten a little loose here you get two whistles on that the lead and the trail had a whistle on that one crazy is reminding Cameron Hildreth that he failed to touch iron at an earlier attempt foreign touch iron then either but this one he put in the bottom of the net Applause hes got three he had 16 in the first meeting between these two you gotta enjoy watching Cameron hillbill play as well what a competitor and he plays hard every possession hes wanted more improved players in the ACC his scorings up about nine points per game from last year hes doubled his rebound total now some of thats productive ladies playing a lot more but hes also shown a great deal of improvement one three one zone a little switch by Steve Forbes here heading to the break its a twopoint Duke lead under four minutes to play in the first no conscience shoot it every time you touch it you should you remember the name there was a a coach at Troy named Don maestry and this was back when everybody read newspapers and basketball camps he used to tell the campers shoot the ball get your name in the paper no I passed it Im the best nonstat starter in NC State basketball history are you kidding me roach again speaking of stats hes putting up gargantuan ones 15 on six of eight shooting youre in the first half what a night for Jeremy Roach well Cameron Hills is going to back that down look at Ryan young ready to help they worked on doubling Mildred today and shoot around pretty good catch by Williamson shot clock at six heres Hill lets put two fouls and he gets him away and scores so Im expecting Dukes gonna run something on this end of the floor for shoot because if youre going to leave him on the floor and we know that John Shire wanted to get some minutes for him and wanted to get him involved youre going to see Hildreth take advantage of him on the defensive end so you might as well find a bucket for him I cant read shires mind but Jalen blates is waiting at the scores table so he might want to hurry Bradford is guarding Ryan Young and foul is called on the big fellow its his second Applause and Blakes returns for shoot the Shire told us today as he tries to work that rotation maybe find a little bit more perimeter shooting although Duke has shot it better here than it has on the road and he was going to get shoot in in the first half well one of the things he also told us is they were sharing the ball better in the last three games on the season Duke averages 57 percent of their baskets assisted in the last three 68 that is a very high number that means youre really taking quality shots youre moving the basketball and youre also getting to the offensive glass off that and a whole lot of that is the is continued growth and development of Tyrese Proctor is it not ever said and the other thing is you know system that zero turnovers against Georgia Tech when coach Shire goes back and watches film there were really 14 assists because he calls them potential assists Crocker does his job they miss a layup Proctor does his job they miss a dunk those count when the coach goes back and watches film that will be creating just rolled across the basket and refuse to go notes working off the double and Appleby got a foot on it to keepowski from potentially lining one up Applause not back to that zone right now see when they try to spring it on him again Rose Has it blocked away but itll be goaltending and now Jeremy roach has 17 points season I have 22 earlier against Iowa that is well within reach its the glass first at 22 not only the season high but the career high Char wanted him to be aggressive feels like that as much as anything else can help open up this offense Jalen Blakes is called for the foul though hes claiming that he was blocked down himself hidden Shire backing up his player telling him hes grabbing him Im not gonna mess with John Gaffney out there Applause are other officials tonight Applause how many coaches do you think are really scared of John Gaffney Applebys second free throw of the evening both have been good he has 11 here in the first half Applause laughs who might notice Applebys surname is that of a noted restaurant chain and the crazies are chanting that they want the competitor thats not necessarily feeling good in that neighborhood and here is the one three one zone from Lake Forest again Applause Music oh and one from Ryan Young when you go back and look at Wake Forest they play three possessions of one three one against the wolf pack but it came late in the game what Steve Forbes is trying to do is change the rhythm of the game here thats why you change defense but you go to the zone you have to make sure you can block out Music young completes the threepoint play hes got five graduate transfer from Northwestern he had 10 points nine rebounds in the first meeting played a little before because Lively missed that game with illness now Wake Forest trying not to let this one get away right before halftime under 90 seconds to go Blue Devils with a seven point lead in the ball a roach off that drag screen so good I think Bradford playing with three fouls I mean Jeremy roach has basically had any shot hes wanted tonight Mitchell gets a hand on it and gets the Steal on the push and roach will settle everything down yeah two for one here thank you and another whistle inside and I caught it the three second violation Applause boy that thats thats a rare thats almost like a unicorn three second violation code what else are you gonna see from Cameron Indoor on a Tuesday night final 498 of the first half and a couple guys having big first half Tyree Appleby and Jeremy roach now what Steve Forbes gonna do here with the ball 498 in the first half I think this is a great time out right because he knows he can get two for one right here and every possession matter so Im looking for a quick downhill Tyree Appleby and maybe a kick to Monsanto for a three philipowski is on Clinton Mitchell is on Monsanto Applause there it is Monsanto lines it up that one hit the net unfortunately for damari just didnt go over the top of the rim first will get it another shot at about a nine second differential shot clock game clock Duke 73 the ball Applause it is blocked by Bradford Monsanto and it knocked away and maybe they wont get that shot in fact they probably wont John Shire calling out to take the final shot of the first half is there an over and back there is that what the officials are looking at and you cant stop the clock for that unless theres a clock issue Applause the Wake Forest bench was adamant that it that it might have been a kick or an over and back yeah well have a look at what their seeing momentarily Jeff Anderson on groover John Gaffney our officials Paul never hits the rim oh thats it okay all right there you go were gonna look at a timing issue here thank you in possession yeah thats what thats what I thought live is that he had possession had it knocked away can we have another look at that and say well put 97 on the clock it might be going with shot clock violation lets see no I guess he didnt really have possession I thought he had a little better hold on than he did excuse me thats it get the time right shot clock possession or shot clock violation so they got two for one the hard way if in fact they get the shot off Im still thinking Monsanto Applause of course hoping to go in on a high note Santo Rams out rebound Mitchell one second left and thats how well go to the half as duke finishes the first half on a sixth team to eighth run and basket suddenly became hard to come by for the Demon Deacons 23 straight times theyve beaten Wake Forest and Cameron Indoor 22 out of 20 kind of what the Blue Devils want to do in the first half the best offensive half of basketball and Jeremy roachs career and hes only five points away from a career high 22 points scored against Iowa this year Wake Forest closed the first half without a field goal in the final three minutes in the Demon Deacons have it to start in the second half Applause Steve Forbes staying with that smaller lineup Andrew Carr at the five position to whipped it to Hildreth making it tough shot clock at five Wheels into the lane car got a finger on it but Duke will make it a one shot now I mean thats Cameron Hills game 64 and hes taking on Kyle filipowskid seven foot off the bounce into the paint Mark Mitchell weve talked at halftime you and I did about how active he was in the first half stats didnt indicated at four rebounds as dude doubled up Wake Forest and rebounding and Mitchell has another rebound there monsantos shooting woes tonight continue yeah one for eight hes not going to lose his confidence though Reese hes going to keep shooting because he knows his role is very important to this team that theyre going to have success in here approach this is his first shot in the second half he didnt miss Minnie in the first half its seven to ten from the fourth of those 17 points car on the transfer from Delaware Monsanto tries one from inside the arc and damari just really continues to struggle now one of nine hes asking to come out Music Applause Tyrese Proctor into the paint he draws to foul fouls called on Damian Williamson thats his first looks like hes not a hundred percent looked a little slow getting back in transition he asked twice to come out he wasnt paying attention and Proctor was driving right at him he needed to be in help position first Bobby Clinton a freshman had a good first half as he turns Music now theyre looking at Monsanto and if Wake Forest is going to stay within Striking Distance itd be nice to have him on Santo on the floor and healthy hes a guy who can score in bunches and score quickly he makes both of them he now has seven and Duke has its largest lead nine Music Applause chin the left Santa Im sure if it cramped up or he got clipped car for three and hit the top wouldnt have counted if it had gone and Wake Forest has now missed its last eight shot attempts oh great camera work there as we see what happened to Monsanto in the pullup you just saw it Shin a shiver a little bit and they were working on that over on the bench hopefully hell be back in there soon Applause Im looking for that half hook right there for philipowski hes already done the work to get that deep in the paint couldnt get it over the top of the trees and here come the Blue Devils Proctor the lebowskis thought about it I mean youre growing all the way to the rim against two seven Footers and theyre both really good shot blockers Mitchell step back behind the arc over the top is Lively as Appleby was giving up a foot or so I mean Mitchell has to look inside there Appleby is stuck on the post with Livelys trying to sit on his legs in front look at the size differential well Appleby did his job the foul was called on Clinton reached in its his second foul Music Applause I always used to tell you it doesnt matter about the size just block them out Im not sure they had in mind 511 against 71 Mitchell offensive rebound Duke is dominating on the glass another opportunity perhaps knocked out of bounds then theyll stay with a glued up I mean we mentioned the activity level of Mark Mitchell at six eight hes not just rebounding balls over his head hes rebounding out of his area hes pursuing thats hard to check on the glass quickly to Proctor from the corner and Wake Forest worked on that and shoot around today knowing that that was the play when Proctor inbounded it a 12point lead Proctor has nine and Wake Forest is in a massive drought and maybe a bucket quickly and Applebees the guy who delivers 4636 boy to Wake Forest need that Rhodes trying to answer he leads it short neighbor can chase it down in the corner for the moment Wake Forest has averted disaster Williamson to three offensive rebound by Farr well try to go over the top of Mitchell and wont go good job by Mitchell holding his grounds I mean Williamsons got to knock down that triple right got a queen look at it hes had some back issues this year theyre on and off in recent games theres limited some minutes from him Proctor with the Finish is just starting to get warmed up long way to go here but you know whos coming in Saturday dont you know Blue Devils trying to get into another look at the play that since the crazies bananas how about this move before and a high handoff to Lively from Proctor well its a great leave by Proctor and he was weaving in and out of the Wake Forest defense and thats what Lively does you know thats listed in the box score so far as Proctors only assist of the night if youre gonna have one might as well be like that Lively now has seven points Wake Forest needs to get somebody some help or Tyree Appleby is at five of eleven from the four the rest of the team seven of 27 728 you know the plan was to put Lively and ball screen off uh defense and Carr has a great look and doesnt knock it down Livelys doing a really good job of keeping players in front and contested Monsanto has returned to the game because while youre trying to pull him away from the bucket Rhys Duke wants him in drop coverage because of that they want him around the rim and drop coverage to protect inside because he can do that block shots 12 point lead for the Blue Devils in the Duke North Carolina rivalry and also the two teams were unranked now its happened three times since 2020 but prior to that go back to when the ACC started it was founded in the early 50s it only happened three times before and still to speak to the magnitude of that rivalry it doesnt really diminish it because both of the teams still obviously have great opportunities and aspirations for March but more than that the Rivalry is a wise man once said always seems to deliver memorable moments ranked or unranked is that wise man Jay billis and he is the one who first coined the phrase you know what its the series is 50 50 theyve played a hundred times North Carolinas won four in a row I mean they came in here last year and won in Cameron 9481 on Coach Ks last home game that was such a thick emotional night in North Carolina came in and played brilliantly and it really you know theyve won a couple games before that but that was the one I feel like it really sparked their run that carried them all the way to the national championship game and another victory over Duke along the way in the final four North Carolina had four players that scored 20 points that night in this building we were both here it was phenomenal it was amazing this environment itll be amazing on Saturday on a way to escape our notice that that last Bucket from Tyree Appleby found some friendly nighttime banking hours here in Durham and Vince Monsanto is back and one for 10 half of these tried to carry this team offensively klentman with the turnover hell back it out phillipowski had it in mind to pick his pocket Here Comes Appleby again oh acrobatic a little too much but Tyree gets it back now lets keep an eye on the shot clock hes got philipowski on him theres a switch thats a big dish give it in time slotted Away by Livelys car couldnt go over the top heres Mitchell on the drives contact its a block and one Mark Mitchell might not be on the top of the scouting report for Duke before you got a plan for him because his activity level is exactly hes a change of pace hes a burst to speed hes long and athletic thats an aggressive finish with contact out of high school has seven rebounds tonight and now its good point of the evening and Duke has extended its lead to 13 before its desperate for offense from somebody can it be caught cannot Mitchell another rebound I think as a team five for 20 from the threepoint line tonight and its not a recipe for Success when youre getting worked pretty good on the boards too Proctor penetrating again tried for that lob this time Wake Forest all over Applebees thats Hildreth if he wants it and hellraith a muchneeded three ball for Steve Forbes team cam now has nine Factor 10 point game Wake Forest teetering on the ropes taking a lot of punches but theyve yet to buckle well you can get three stops in a row and you can get three scores youre right back in it right I mean thats what you got to be thinking thats your mentality right here go hard youre going to get another break at the next meeting with timeout his way inside crazies with a little rhythmic bouncing rattling the bleachers Applause and theres a whistle I think theyre going to get proctored for a foul thats his third Thursday night 10 30 Eastern Time Oregon and Arizona ranked fifth in the country he had to pick a team from the West the best chance to make a run would you go with Arizona sticking with UCLA Carr working on lively he draws the foul you can see the Ducks and the Wildcats search tonight 10 30 Eastern time I like Mick Cronin I like the approach to the game I love this skill set the guard play tiger Campbell is tough hes like Tyree Appleby I mean theyre very similar and Jeremy roach very similar as Andrew Carr goes to the freethrow line or that cam holder bucket was much needed Appleby has been hes done the majority of the work offensively Lake Forest has 14 field goals on the night Tyree has six something when we spoke with apple being this morning he was excited about being in this environment please have a little chat with Ryan young I mean he knew it was going to be fun he knew he had heard how exciting it was to be a part of playing in this environment hes delivered on it car hits a couple with free throws and its a 10point lead headed toward the 12minute mark to play here in Cameron young avoided the temptation to give the good chance and pays it all for the layout that is a deep double Berry two feet in the paint two points Ryan young gradually transfer from Northwestern we have a couple of Veteran guys to supplement these star freshmen from Granderson came over to Illinois in the first half and Youngs giving them good minutes off the bench tonight as well Applause cars got a size Advantage but he put it down low and Blakes reached in there but aint got a piece of the arm Jalen Blakes called for the foul the Under 12 media timeout and the Blue Devils are up by 12 demon Deeks trying to hang on between the two here John shires team stretched it out to a 12point lead during the break the officials went over and had a look at a shot Tyree Appleby made and they left it as it was a two ball and look how Duke has played hitting five of his last seven shots to try to build this lead Applause maybe on Bradford back into the game big number 20 the guy in the physical presidents picked up three thousand first half thats what Hiltons done he finds Bradford Bradford can get the shot up a notch now the shot clock is at three Appleby gets fouled on the way up what a smart play time and score Appleby late clock Applause foul was called on Jeremy roachs second roach who had 17 in the first half as you have to score here in the second and were gonna give Tyree Appleby a chance to go to the freethrow line where wake has hit havent shot it well from three theyve been perfect through the freethrow line at nine for nine are they checking to make sure he was behind the arc I would imagine so I think when he went to the freethrow line I saw John Gaffney signal would be three free throws but again he was right on the edge much like the shot that they checked during the break when as we looked at the replay it looked as if yeah thats going to be a two um thats an easy one the other one was far more difficult theyre just a sliver of daylight it appeared but they didnt overturn their initial ruin on the court on that earlier one and this one may have confirmed itll be two free throws for Tyree Appleby its a good job by the officials gotta get it right both teams have shot it well from the strike now Forbes team is scratched and clawed out you know look you have Monsanto and Carr being a combined two for 17 and over youre getting crushed on the boards youre only down now 11 I mean certainly could be its not great but it certainly could be worse well I think those storms went with that smaller lineup for as long as he could and then here in the second half now hes going back to the adjustment well car at the four and Bradford playing the five Applebee is now matched to his output in the first game against Duke the one that Wake Forest won by 11 theyre down by 10 here 18 points Rhodes looking for his first points in the second half get out of there soon Jeremy turns it over good defense by wake Applause Hildreth goes in and now Rhodes will compound the problem by getting the blocky call against him its his third and you know Hildreth is a hard driver roaches looks like hes holding his his hand Applause Music holding that right hand it looks like well keep an eye down at the end of the Duke bench and see if he shakes it off if they have to attend to a Jalen plates back into the game Carr gets it right at the basket good coverup by philipowski and by Young and Carr scored anyway Applause back to a single digit game wait wont go down Applause Andersons checked in as well for the Blue Devils hes got the ball Fires at three the Wake Forest with the rebound Here Comes Appleby I returned to Corner kicks it out three ball on the way and it wont go but a rebound by Bradford and new wife for the Demon Deacons big Collision there on the side no call Carr tries to keep it alive therell be a foul called underneath the wakes got a little life right here theyve gone on D and gotten some stops I mean car cars got to keep shooting Reese I mean hes open hes capable of making it you got to believe the next ones going to go in I I always say this you dont have enough time in college basketball to lose your confidence if you put the Reps in and youre taking shots that you practice at game speed you have to keep shooting them and in the meantime keep making the game easier for your teammates set some screens get some rebounds cut hard that foul was on philipowski his third and the Duke staff working on Jeremy roachs right wrist so he throws our good and just when it looked like wake was about to get knocked out its a sixpoint game Applause I have Liam Mitchell have returned from Blue Devil Applause Granderson to Mitchell good luck can he get it up Mark goes up strong and Bradford poses a jump ball at the top its a big play by Bradford its a great basket cut where wake does a good job of collapsing inside Applause I dont know how that pass got past Hildreth a possession arrow is with dude theyll keep it and roach has returned to the floor Purdue Proctor for three 15 for Tyrese Proctor and the Freshman really starting to find his game in recent weeks guarding Monsanto Applebee for three no good driveway cleans it out of there what a great job by Rhodes defensively on that twist action by Wake Forest Bradford switches the screening angle its a Twist action but Livelys in drop coverage Applause return for Duke he goes by car uses the left hand and it just touched every bit of the orange but wouldnt go in see monsantos got to get high if quakes going to really make a run here step back keep firing Monsanto no one of 11 a little bit of a head hang yeah I cant have that cant have that kind of body language right now theyre still in the game 5849 Tyrese Proctors been outstanding he scored 10 points here in the second half so youve got roach in the first half Proctor in the second and wake is sort of kept it together with duct tape and bailing wire a little bit to try to stay in this game so far Dukes been able to hold off the charges well one of the reasons why Wake Forest has stayed in the game is theyve made all their free throws theyre 13 for 13 but theyve only turned a ball over four times the Duke has not been able to generate off their defense in that way offensive rebounding theyre staying with Duke on the offensive glass Duke has eight offensive rebounds Wake Forest has seven Blue Devil men hoping to get back into the rankings in the not too distant future Carol Lawsons Duke women ranked 16th in the country Thursday night on the ACC Network they will take on Pittsburgh Panthers looking for their first conference when Blue Devils trying to bounce back after losing to Florida State on Sunday coverage begins at six oclock Eastern time on Thursday Duke women tied at the top of the ACC with Notre Dame and they got hammered against Florida State Brooke wyckoffs team did a great job tonight latsons a player for Florida State just so you know keep your eye on Applause Music Applause is 11 wake is in just four of 21s from the floor here in the second half switch phillipowskis on Applebee car cut off by Lively guys just skip it to the corner and instead found a couple of guys wide open on the Wake Forest bench fifth turnover tonight for the Demon Deacons and youve got the kind of foot speed that Duke has with their bigs and Lively and phillipowski you can switch one through four sometimes one through five but they really dont like to switch Lively but hes capable Applause he said his number one job was to protect the ram hes done a really nice job of that tonight by his lofty standards a little bit quiet so far theres still time to finish Roach two straight buckets and Jeremys up to 21 thats just one off his career and season High when its winning time or game deciding time for separation Jeremy Rhodes wants the ball a for me inside wont go and follow and flush from Bradford big transfer from Kansas State I wonder if wakes getting a little fatigued Music well find out these next few defensive possessions maybe timeout is coming to corner so rapowskis got Appleby Bradford comes to help thats excellent defense step in there and anticipate that pass by Andrew Carr 13th turnover for Duke Institute hes had to carry a lot of the load hes got his hands on his knees in the corner this is not only the shooting but hes hes been carrying 300 pounds Monsanto hasnt been able to get the shot to go through he takes it to the bucket and hell have a chance for a threepoint play hell shoot a free throw when you come back Dukes under your home and car insurance at progressivecom 6 48 to play here in Cameron Indoor Reese Davidson Debbie Antonelli with you Duke with a 6263 lead on Wake Forest Jeremy roach has led the way offensively for the Blue Devils with 21 tonight backboard make Tyrese Proctor with 15 tamari Monsanto whos really struggled shooting the ball for Wake is at the freethrow line trying to complete a threepoint play and draw the deacons back two within eight at last foul on the Monsanto Drive was against the Duke big man Derek Lively he now has four and he is resting on the bench with John Shire so Wake Forest has taken 25 threes out of their 54 shots its almost 50 percent theyve only made six Duke is best in the ACC Gordon threepoint line but Rhys its not how many you make its when you make them they still have a chance here so theres an eightpoint game in a game and it really feels like Duke is largely dominated and there is philipowski scoring hes up to nine saw in this ring of 30 percent of Duke allows in the threepoint line and even been better than that tonight Ill be quiteman has returned Illinois Force Monsanto trying to get one off Proctor does a great job and then the turnover roach steps in for the steal he goes in cant get it to go but Proctor is there to clean it up what a play by Roach and Santa uses the screen Crawford is wont give him sliver of room for oxygen and thats another turnover and I think Wake Forest has all the year March is starting to run out of gas here yeah I mean backtoback turnovers coming off the time now when you know you get it to eight points pop the free throw Applause ski a great foul pass to Young and heres what happens Rhys when you start to get fatigued you start running into screams you cant get over the top and Duke executes foreign Music line Applause how about this play from Jeremy roach done it offensively but heres the defensive anticipation play against an up the line overplaying defense that is a long flat lateral pass and roach makes it look easy with a steal what an incredible move Music 21 tonight after hes stepping to the Applause Thompson out in the first meeting hes five for five and now six for six this evening he makes his next one hell be up to 20 what a competitor right I mean hes a little gassed but he has played really well Applause hes been a oneman show for much of the night and not to wake the other guys are playing hard we just have a little trouble finding the range making enough shots and Apple has been fighting to keep pennant philipowski trying to deliver a dagger Appleby Edwards for all the world and Ryan young certainly thought could happen to be knocked it out of bounds oh Tyree should have gotten that ball down were gonna talk it over you oh no theyre getting up a wet spot on the floor Tyree is talking to John Shire over there know that you need the proof serum I think Apple even I think that he was the last one to touch it Applause sure is what John thinks Applause young had a hand on it too employment lets see who the Ty call goes weights way Applause might have been a break but with 448 down a dozen struggling to shoot the ball you could use one every now and then when it comes through the door screen on the top of the floor that pass was just out of his reach to shoot the three and Zano stepped back from behind the arc there it is soft touching Jamari Monsanto back to single digit Forbes uses the timeout maybe thatll get Monsanto going theres time three of 13 from the floor tonight he leads the ACC and made threes per game he is one of those shooters who is not particularly bothered by what the previous shots have done whether theyve gone in or out super Tuesday presented by Progressive continues nine oclock Eastern time from the SEC Kentucky going on the road to take on hottie toddy you can see its also streaming live on the app theyre gonna tip that off in just a few minutes on ESPN Oscar sheepway rolls out of bed gets a double double averaging 16 and nearly 14 rebounds per game 12 double doubles lead to Nation very similar to his numbers last year where he was the national Naismith National player of the year Music Ward like that following year not only are you held to a higher standard your team has to deliver and Kentucky I thought Kentucky played really well Saturday night in Rupp Arena we were there for the night nightcap version of college game day after starting the day in Tennessee well Kentucky played well Kansas is just better than that made a few more plays Jalen Wilson hit some big shots but Kentucky played well Braden dick made some big plays Applause speaking of good freshmen Ive seen tonight who has the balls tied his career high was 17 a couple of highlight real passes through and theyll call Youngs would be a legal screen I mean thats kind of the break that Wake Forest needed right there get the ball back oh just over four minutes to play its still just a nine point game shes been an unusual game its probably largely due to the fact that outside of app would be Wake Forest and struggle to find offense from other guys it feels like Duke has been in complete control and that pass a little too much for Andrew Carr and maybe they still are but wake at least by deficit is still in the game I mean its a great counter to the door screen action right because Monsanto looks like hes coming through the doors but he sets the screen and its a great backdoor cut pass was just Out Of Reach its a big swing right there you get the ball back then you have an opportunity a big defensive possession for Wake Forest and perhaps an opportunity to drop a demoralizing shot or Duke approach and Wake Forest has it again just over three and a half to play Applebee Carr rolls out and phillipowski with the rebound so many great looks for Wake Forest tonight that would have put a little game pressure on Blue Devils had that gone down Applause who do you trust here late if youre a John Shire I mean I think Jeremy roach is the guy right 4 30 in white and Louise played tonight Proctors a good choice bounced around and came out Wake Forest still with a Chance Appleby this time Mr and this time its on Target and its a seven point game here comes that game pressure youre talking about 11 points for Carr an assist from Applebee and now the crazy is going to get behind their Blue Devils oh they love that up screen what a great play thats a slice play they worked on that today what a great call by John Shire and with that bucket filipowski has a doubledouble his tenth of the season the lead is nine to shape Monsanto free but hes 45 feet from the basket Kamari for three got it live in the present tomorrow dont worry about whats happening before its not how many you make its when you make them pressing on to what lies ahead its a two possession game inside two minutes to go Applause heres Jeremy roach shot clock inside 10 Applause off the screen from young looking for help to Lebowski for three Wake Forest has the rebound 90 seconds to play its a sixpoint game Applebees driving scoring and fouled Applause a beautiful drag in the middle of the floor the fourth foul on roach Applebees made every free throw hes taken tonight baked one when you come back and well have a one possession game and were having that finish Kevin because Wake Forest is on a 122 run theyve made six of their last seven shots what about these plays to get back in it Debbie I mean look at the way Tyree Appleby pushes up the floor its the rebounding in the defense that gets them up in the open floor Monsanto has been cold all night but he made a huge three there and this is the and one opportunity for Appleby who got his second win right around the five six five or six minute mark Applause hes at the freethrow line now to try to complete that threepoint play and make it a one possession game he left it on the rim his first Miss of the night seven of eight Duke with the ball in a fourpoint lead I mean that slice play worked they saved it till the end well pass through the handoff and if youre going to call the foul on Appleby its his second trying to beat roach to the point of contact there on the dribble handoff not yet in the one and one only four fouls against Wake Forest here in the second half and while Duke weve mentioned a couple times that theyve controlled the boards overall in the night thanks to a flurry played here in the second half in the second half Wake Forest is out rebounding the Blue Devils by one you mentioned rebounding defense some Timeless shots hes giving them a punchers chance in the last minute and five seconds and the switch back to the big lineup for Steve Forbes I think that has made a difference thank you Applause Music Applause had a knife and thats who you trust here late has been outstanding two inside a minute to play oh a big big screen set by philipowski on Monsanto now Kyle for three Applause foreign Applause Applause looks set and clean to me it was clean philipowski throws it back to Tyrese Proctor who does a great job philipowski plenty of time to catch and shoot that was a good time for his first three balls inside two stretches that lead back to seven five double doubles in the last six games threetime reigning ACC rookie of the week being smart too because he saw the switch its what you call Boomerang cast you know you pass it you pass it right back because you know youve got an advantage he didnt have anybody guarding him on the top should we hand off to Monsanto and now theyre going to call a foul on the handoff against Appleby wow I thought he was set you got to be set on the dribble handoff thats a really tough one to go against wake at this point in the game well now 426 Forbes in fact the blood pressure might be up a little bit and that call is officials shoeing the players back out on the court as they try to sneak it free timeout itll be Duke basketball up seven and Wake Forest in Desperate circumstances now still have a foul to give probably go hard for the steel early not behind if they get it and I cant get it in bounds and Mitchell has to use the timeout you go hard for the steal you try to get a trap you tell the officials thats what were trying to do so theyre not anticipating that you automatically want the foul since you do have one to give you might be able to get a deflection now you have to assume that Dukes going to go to the freethrow line a bit theyre a good freethrow shooting time with the team and theyve shot it well tonight Music we take a look at our rewarding performance brought to you by Capital One Jeremy roach largely on the strength of his first half performance so he hit a couple of clutch shots in the second half just went off his career high with 21 tonight 17 first half points nine for 16 a couple of triples a couple of assists playing here late with four and with the number of young players that Duke relies on having roach whos your leader for Captain come on really set the tone in the first half as he did but its really important if the Blue Devils are indeed able to hang on for this last 426 to get the victory to set up the match with North Carolina on Saturday you know Reese I thought last year Wake Forest or excuse me Duke had trouble with some smaller guards right Charlie Moore in Miami RJ Davis is coming in here on Saturday smaller guard Kihei Clark Virginia and they lost those games in here Jeremy roach gives them a chance to play Applebee had a big night but hes got the kind of quickness that can stay with him and challenge him theyre gonna need him to do a really good job on RJ Davis from North Carolina all right 426 lets check in quickly with Kevin Connors yeah and Reese want to let you know theyre underway right now Ole Miss Kentucky over on ESPN news youll see it next here on ESPN after we go final Applause Kyle has shown that finishers mentality making a couple of big buckets late Monsanto for three and the one thing you couldnt have happen is get beat over the top its a great read John Shire has done a great job calling sets late pressure on the ball philipowski does a good job weve praised Mark Mitchell tonight he was the one who couldnt get the ball in bounds and called time out no fault it is good defense but did you notice Jacob grandison then inbounded the ball the veteran transfer from Illinois he hit phillipowski on the runout pass Toms a little veteran Savvy on the cut of games I mean coach Shire knows that theres a foul to give gotta cut hard you got to be strong and then always that back door over the top option available 7566 Duke appears to be in firm control despite repeated surges and efforts from Steve Forbes team barring a miracle rally theyre going to fall for the fourth straight time they have some work to do if they want to get into NCAA tournament consideration theyve had some tough watch theyve lost some close games theyll need to turn it around turn it around quickly Santo guarded by Mitchell takes the contested three thats no good Monsanto with a scramble and Music see what the what the call is of on the Baseline Applause you put 20 on the clock youre going to give the ball to Wake Forest on the side I think they had a kicked ball thats why the clock resets to 20 Applause the Wake Forest not going to be worried about the shot clock thats for sure they gotta get some shots up quickly Applebys going to knife through lay it in seven point game a quick timeout with 205 to go reminder Ole Miss in Kentucky coming up just as soon as we finish Duke 205 away from being able to turn their attention fully to North Carolina not that it hasnt fully been on Wake Forest tonight thats something Shire and now all coaches have to emphasize but youre not human if you dont peek ahead to the whats uh whats coming up but it doesnt get much easier after the Tar Heels come in here you have to go on the road to a good Miami team and on the road to Virginia well Virginia has been the hottest team in the league theyve won six in a row well she heard Kevin and guys in the studio talking about Clemson taking the loss tonight thats a huge loss for them who is the best team in the ACC right now in your judgment into Virginia I think its Virginia right now yes I mean they just going about their business right doing what they do and doing it well three Speakman you have to play his best basketball he had Clark does his thing I like Virginia I like the way they defend Ben benapos has been a great addition see the seeds according to Joe Bernardi our certified practologist Pittsburgh plays North Carolina tomorrow night in Chapel Hill among the last before in I love that you always call them certified he he took the class he took the course he wrote the course too and then created the syllabus then took it himself certified himself wrote a book about it in case you didnt know I do know If he if you dont remember its at the bottom of his daily emails Music Joe is hes great he knows the man hes terrific Applause Music Im Im told by our producer Joe McCoy tonight that Joe winardi will be part of the broadcast in the temple Houston game on Saturday or Saturday Sunday a bigger pardon Houston might have a little something to say to Temple after the towels cooked an earlier meeting grandison worked once throwing ahead in phillipowski again and Philadelphia gets his pocket pick whos falling before I guess hes first down there Mitchell thats Mark Mitchells not afraid to do some dirty work or a highly touted freshman this dude plays hard Applause that is four on Bobby quentman who freshman who I think has shown well for Steve Forbes tonight are those managers on the clock they always are who are the hardest working people in all of college basketball the coaches think its them but its actually the manager it is the managers I forgot to check on who won the manager game last night yeah I know I think you couldnt check on that either theres a hole culture surrounding those manager games a lot of pride goes into those games and also their work this guys a relentless Music oh finally 11 seconds over its going to try to make it a little closer lays it in Music so every time wake brought a push Duke had an answer Music John Shire is going to be really pleased with his teams rope inside this game and how they battled to hang on took a couple punches but found a way I thought his play calling late was outstanding depending on your perspective even if he makes these free throws might not be quite enough enough for the victory but sorry youre gonna be gonna be home free no matter what Applebee knocks down the three to make the final margin a single bucket close but not quite enough and Duke wins again still havent lost to Wake Forest inside this building since 1997 24 in a row Derek Lively had some great moments and the Blue Devils now get ready for North Carolina who will come in on Saturday our final score from Durham Duke beats Wake Forest 7573 for Debbie Antonelli in our entire ESPN crew Im Rhys Davis saying good night from Durham and we send you now to Oxford Mississippi Kentucky
