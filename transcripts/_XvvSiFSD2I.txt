a a bit has he no he still look like he can lay him up one of the gems of this sport we are off and running at the JMA Wireless Stone Florida state in the black controls at 11 and S overall and yeah coming off that loss against Clemson 7867 its sna the fivegame winning streak youre going to see up to 12 different guys for the nolles thats been the norm through the years for Leonard Hamilton heres Jaylen warley the 67 point guard gets it to Watkins and the L to deat Green got tapped away and then judment is out on the Baseline with six left to shoot Watkins does a great job of curling in the elbow off that pin down and cuse defense stepped up and tried to throw the log Baba Miller to put it in timer at five for warley warley not known for his perimeter shot thats only his third threepoint attempt of the Season we get our first look at Syracuse offensively in the starting group led by Jud dipped in the ACC in scoring at 18 a game second leading scorer is JJ Starling and nobody gets to the free throw line more in the ACC than Jud Min got to stay in front of Jud Min he just change his Direction so quickly and he gets to gets to the basket he cuts Cuts Watkins off he gets here you cant give him a back b ball you basket drive and hes going to force you to come through his body there and draw fouls no one does it better than judment sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland with his 151st pre throw attempt of the Season second most among power conference players only behind Zach Edy who leads the entire country at about 200 attempts at the free throw line and he can shoot more he gets foued the heck of a lot more than 0 oh that guy is just a a monster inside Matt payter nodding somewhere in West Lafia to your comments Now Syracuse 86 man this year wonder if you might see some Zone in this one because Florida State not known for it shooting from the perimeter theres the green on the drive in the starting lineup for the gos he missed it hes out there with warley Darren Green Watkins and the sophomore Sensation from Spain Baba Miller L States going to have to Corral guys off the bals they got to do a really good job of keeping the ball in front of him here its another Blow by by Starling for two early here theyre not containing the dribble the back court of dor man is getting wherever they want and thats got to be frustrated for Coach hand because thats the focal point of this defense is to keep those guards out of the paint nice swarm you in the paint heres green had it blocked by Malik Brown Malik Brown plays as if hes a sevenfooter just such a quick jump Starling no dice in the midrange Florida State offensively the keys are what for them against an aggressive defense well when they get stops like this they want to they want to get out and score and get in transition before the defense is set because theyre going to lag off these guys and force them to drive the Bas I mean just slay off them they got to eat up the space to drive it but theyre not going to contest jump shots other than Darren Smith Darren Green theyre going to know where he is theyre going to yell out youre going to hear them yelling out 22 find him all game long in mandoor zone the rest of the guys going to Sag off so need to try to score before the defense is set yeah how many times did we hear from Red Entre yesterday locate green that guy right there Darren Green one of the best Shooters in the entire country he connects on 40 from three Miller on a high low from Deonte green and the Stu Boba Miller is just so talented does so many things for the similar group its able to switch one through five handles it Min another Blow by and you said Florida state has got to stop the ball and stay in front yeah its got to stay in front of him thats you know thats third time already in first couple possessions theyve gotten to the rim heres Miller played a really good allaround game the last few weeks that got poked Away by Chris Bell its got to be frustrating for the seminal because thats thats the key to this game is guarding these guys off the bounce and weve seen Judah men get there twice JJ Starling gets there early as well thats a key tenant for Florida State theyve been a top five defense in the ACC in conference play according to kentom business as usual in Tallahassee cam corn is checked into the game sophomore big turns it over trying to connect with Watkins Bell pushes Bell on a Euro lost his foot and its a turn over right back to the nolles these teams are really similar they play at the two fastest tempos in the AC see they force a lot of turnovers they generate a lot of steals theyre going to flip the call here and keep it with Syracuse well one of the reasons they play that way is because there theres not a lot of perimeter shooting on either team and theyre best when theyre pressuring you when the defense have into the floor and they really want to push Pace because they want to try to attack you before you set your defense Syracuse sets up the offense with Jude amense at the controls theres Justin Taylor the strong sophomore gave it back back to Mint Taylor Pro goes spinning on cam Cory top ball away not there and a block out from Watkins this is what he can do a little bit of everything for Florida State lot of contact no foul is called and then a late foul is whistled by the trail official Clarence Armstrong and red atrey thinks thats of the late whistle I dont think he likes it and it was late but I thought there was some contact there did a great job trying to squeeze through and that was contact there yeah all right so were talking stylistically in this game yeah were going to see the aggressive defense like we just mentioned were going to see a lot of fouls between these teams as well its rare that a Florida State game fits within a 2hour window they spend a lot of time at the free throw line it will not fit within a this game will not end until 915 so lets just forget about that so youre saying were going for another 2 hours and 7 Minutes easily easily itll be between 91 915 you want avoc or Jo absolutely din on that I love it all the money youre making I love to get nice after this yeah thank you because both teams are actually doing it they theyre really physical they want to attack off the bouncing if theres a concern youre only concerned for serce because their bench is not as deep as Sim rocking at 79 miss both and now men try to muscle one up that is a classic Malik Brown offensive rebound to steal a second look for Syracuse at this end you can see the shot goes up and Malik Brown just has his imprint all over the game since hes hes been implementing a starting lineup four games hes has four starts and they won three and ay feels like he has more to give he has more to give this group on the offensive end of the floor sophomore from col pepper Virginia mince is going to have a second effort at getting this in against 61 Bon Miller and he just found Starling Bell for Starling straight up knock down six threes here on Saturday against Miami in that buzzer beating win Watkins D the contact gets it to go against JJ Starling thats exactly the way Florida States wants to play Push Tempo before you set your D before you can set your matchups and this is got wat Watkins leads this team in so many categories hes a big guard hes a big wing and its difficult to put anybody on him in the post if not hell face you up take you on the perimeter his size an athletic ability makes him a matchup nightmare he told us today after transferring in from VCU where he was a three and D guy now with Florida State told us hes getting to Showcase his full game hes doing everything else really well except shooting threepoint shot I think the motion and the spacing with this team makes it difficult for Music guys Corin on Starling kick for Bell at 39 from three and its kept Alive by Applause Taylor they got a crowd around Jud Miss hes got to be crowded cant leave him one on one mens with it and its a Syracuse turnover just over four minutes in in Syracuse New York where another Legend is going into the Ring of Honor this weekend well tell you about that when we

here of course in the naith Hall of Fame as well back in 96 named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history the 22 already hangs but on Saturday is going into the Ring of Honor here at the Dome had the pleasure of Meet Dave Bing when I played with the Pistons and he lived in Detroit at the time just an amazing guy and you know where hes from correct I dont but Im guessing its around your part so DC just I just asked I just want to know if you knew uh by the way Jim beheim is going to be back in the building for the first time because of course State Bing his old college roommate co captains in beheim senior year all right so what do you see defensively from Syracuse well you know Syracuse now was going to the zone and I think they should I mean this team is simal will struggle from behind the threepoint line and you got to expect him to mix in some of the Pat in the Syracuse Zone Taylor and Bell combined to swipe it or rather Brown over there and itll be Syracuse basketball so he told you its 86 man under first year head coach red atrey but we asked him yesterday how much Zone would you like to play against a team that does shoot 33 from threepoint range he said some of it depends too on just how our legs are he felt like they were really tired in the game Saturday against Miami yeah theyre not as deep as Florida State as well and so you got to monitor the pace of the game and how your guys tough shot for Starling on a step back in the midrange Darren Green pushing Tempo to cam Corin underneath What A Catch running and catching that over hit like that not traveling for a big is not a not an easy thing to do really talented sophomore big cam cor who was the top 100 recruit in our ESPN 100 Miss five games this year with a broken toe he picks up the foul hey well have the womens basketball matchup of the night Thursday 8 Eastern 5 Pacific on ESPN in the app South Carolina number one only undefeated team in the country against Angel Reese and number nine LSU and Baton Rouge our college game day crew will tip off coverage at 7 Eastern ticket prices by the way for that I dont know if youve seen they are outrageous four figures to get into the marovic center worth every penny last two national champions Florida State by one about 5 and 12 minutes in Bell backs one down from Deep great job hitting the Gap there by Benny Williams but Chris Bell you got to find him hes the one guy the best threepoint shooter on the orangeman roster and you cant cant lose him and four of them on 10 attempts as jir Watkins answers to KN us up at nine something to monitor here the full court pressure and the amount of bodies that Florida States going to throw at you good thing about the orange man they have multiple handlers and now you see JJ Starling initiating the offense sliding Min off the ball Min drives on the big core and it with the left hand scores great drive there again he gets the angle we saw the coaches telling the guys inside dont foul him on his Drive dont foul him and such a crafty finisher around the rim went off one of his best floor games in two years here in Syracuse Taylor bold Bowen tried to Triple hes only hit two of them all year the freshman in from Vermont M does a foul on buoen got B Bo sticking his hand in the cookie jar there and soon as you reach on him he just changes speeds and brings the ball right through your arms you got to know and I know the coaching staff are frustrated but hes a freshman and got to keep your hands off all smiles for quader copelan and a nice Ovation from the locals here at Syracuse because he was the hero Saturday at the buzzer against Miami drilling only his seventh career three to get a win for the orange ironic were sitting there at practice yesterday and he heaves a shot from like 80 ft yes it hits nothing but the bottom of the net and react celebration and runs to the score table stood up on it pull the who was on the call for us here with Kevin Brown on Saturday and they sag off the Bell the ball Bowen closes on him high upside freshman we mentioned who Leonard Hamilton has been raving about with us yeah hes just such a coach ham player 69 length athleticism and skill level hes trying to shake Bell gives it up to Primo Spears Georgetown transfer number three scorer he gives it up for green deep one goes for Darren Green and his first points tonight its a big shot for green just getting confidence and stepping into one 346 career made threes now Benny Williams swirls one out and then a foul committed by Copeland on green Copeland just checking into the game and I think green took advantage of that hadnt quite got going and wasnt expecting green to shoot that because they spoke about green shooting and against the Zone but you got to guard him literally at the logo in manto man as well more than 1600 points in the 5year career of Darren Green originally from Charlotte and the number two scorer for Leonard Hamiltons NOS here is Spears loves the midrange and now Chandler Jackson sophomore Guard from Memphis with a tear drop that goes Applause down great drive there again who controls the pain in this one offensive foul out Copeland drawn by Darren Green Hey Hey Hey so two quick ones on quader Copeland thats a good call cant dip that shoulder so Copeland right to the bench for red arrey yeah hes picked up two quick fouls and what a blow to the depth in rotation Jackson off target battle on the boards and Benny Williams secures it its switching one through five from Florida State its a deep bench as always for Leonard Hamilton for a ton of turnovers much like Syracuse C cff on the drive and thats what I think the Syracuse guards are going to do theyre going to pick the match up gy jits gets in and you can see him playing with that big brace on recovering from a knee surgery and can he stay in front of these guards on on the ball switch green goes driving on Bell and now gives it up to Spears ball screen from gainy Green steps in one gaining the Applause follow great job there set the ball screen he rolled Malik Brown had the Hedge and gy was able to get inside of him and heres minz navigating and through the shot clock Brown got three good hands from Primo Spears forcing a turnover great job by Primo Spears green Hoy cant hit both Bowen tried to follow it up and run down by Min this is the pace we expect from both teams they want to try to score before you set your defense M attacks too strong and a follow from Benny Williams you dont get an assist for that but Mitch forces r rotation and great job by Benny Williams closing closing speed on on his Defender running up his back and tapping it in and then Kos ding on the floor for it and weve got a foul that is called first at a stoppage Midway through this first half Florida State by one on Syracuse both teams with the arrows pointed up Jud Min set up quader Copeland on Saturday we relive it next after 51 years Popeyes is crashing the wings

five to shoot mince its cland for the win yes yes R dear is your hero I knew I was going to hit that one that one felt good off my hands and it was just like it was either game or not so I had no choice yeah hes confident he knew he was going to let it fly Jud told us yesterday quader Copeland always has been talking about hitting a gamewinning buzzer beater like that he said so now of course hes talking about hitting a second gamewinning buzzer beater like that he did but he came out tonight and picked up two quick fouls I think somebody the adrenaline excitement and get back out there you know they used it against him and see arrey telling them hey Im probably going to try to get you back out there you cannot foul but he takes Pride its difficult for him because he takes pride in guarding the best team perimeter player on the other team and lets see if he can calm his nerves down because theyre going to need him to get back you know just continue to stay in this game hes a big part of them on the offensive end and and being their best defender looks like theyre working on the right hand perhaps of Jud Deens on the sideline so right now its styling Williams cuff Chris Bell and moner Kema the 61 big from Niger hes only played 22 minutes all year 55 and white Starling turns it over Watkins on the run out contested by Bell and then he rips it down foruse Syracuse with numbers Starling thought about a transition three Florida State bench wanted a walk will Williams shut off by Corin and hea turns it over to Watkins hes already making an allaround impact in this game as promised yeah theyre going to always gravitate toward the ball so when youre playing against a similar group you got to drive to pass theyre not going to allow you when theyre really doub in defensively to dribble to the rim with a block of Chandler Jackson so you cant be thinking get all the way to the cup you got to be thinking about spraying it B too strong particularly when youre not a Dynamic ball handler Judah Mitch is real Shifty with the basketball the other guys like to spin and when you turn your back on this defense theyre dangerous Watkins draws another foul here Midway through this first half its the first on Kyle cuff you see he coming in hadnt play doesnt play every game but hes coming in and got to find minutes to get rest with these guys because simol are going to go 11 or 12 deep and this Pro tonight Syracuse has settled in on like a sevenman rotation so I think alri realized early here that I got to get my guys in and and this is what he talked about about the zones backman in the zone showing it again here weve seen it for a few possessions already in this first half Baba Miller yeah you like to flash a player like Baba Miller in the high post wrong one goes for jir Watkins only 29 from three this year and what a start to the first half for Watkins yes hes having an overall impact in every phase of the game creating scoring and rebounding heres Benny Williams C it up its another Syracuse turnover the sixth already Miller sprays it for Watkins too strong this time and a block out from Malik Brown I was going to say expect Judah Miss to touch the ball here he moved it to starling spins one out Watkins already a third rebound hes got eight points couple of thefts in this first dozen minutes as well the DCU transfer with a l for gainy S got to be careful offensive end of the floor right now whats hurting him is theyre taking quick shots C and you can run on a simal defense when they dont get back on defense cuz the guards go to the offensive glass great job by keep in transition there NOS by six and a l just great penetration and gainy gets up finishes strong cinal was up six early andz let me ask you youre using head and shoulders right only when I see flakes then I switch back to my regular shampoo you should use it every wash otherwise the flakes will come back hes right you know is that tiny Troy the ingredients in

South Music Charlotte we got the whole Squad with us only focus was spectacular is G Florida States got the lead at Syracuse and the NOS have been one of the hottest teams in the ACC over the last few weeks before the loss Saturday against Clemson it had been a fivegame winning streak were chatting with Baba Miller earlier today at shooter around and he said to us it was after the lipsum loss and that was just a confounding home loss for Florida State trailed that game at one point by 21 points in Tallahassee he said after that something really just clicked at us as a group where weve been more attentive weve been bought in the chemistry with our team has been better and theyve been playing great ever since they have and unfortunately sometimes it take a loss like that to get you motivated and get you going and I think also getting Creo Spears added back to the group I mean hes come in and adapted well and its kind of a closer and and the more games that Baba Miller gets with you know hes a full season into his college career unfortunately his Midway through the season he gets to that point but hes starting to impact the game and figure it out and this FL St system doesnt just feature one guy the ball just moves it its built off defense and and volume of efforts and here youre trying to get a play run to play H or run it in the post he didnt get it now youre playing theyve got 10 Deep already in this first half and here is Spears sinks one he went over a th000 points for his career at three different schools over the weekend its a deadly midrange shooter there and youve got to get to him and you definitely dont want to get to his right hand on that midrange shot started at Duane they went to first down and now Florida State as mince draws another foul going to the cup youve got to Corral him because he does a great job hes in know horn set there he just kind of rocks you to sleep crosses it over and goes right down the lane and once he gets his shoulders past you hes going to cut you off and force you to foul again the accs fifth leading score at 18 points per game and he frequents the free throw line about as much as anyone in the entire country he does you heard me picking on him yesterday tell them you got to stay off the ground yeah thats a coaching point you always give to guards in particular yeah I give that to guys and for him just to stay off the ground just from a pounding standpoint of a smaller guard taking the punishment that hes going to take throwing all the contact that he does Miss free throws here for the orange from cuff and then mince who miss both lead is seven for Florida State inside a seven to go in this first half Taylor ticks away the Watkins log and the orange runs with Min oh a hammer thats how you get put on a poster cuz I know he was thinking trying to time his Duncan he got his steps together and hammered that home judt has eight to lead Syracuse Jamir Watkins with post entry for Jaylen gainy started his career at Brown had it roll off and then over the back its a foul on Baba Miller watch the gear he comes from out of nowhere last play there and just look at look at where he is where he starts Just Hits an extra gear right there and without a dribble Watkins makes a business decision there and just leans out of the way A Min showing you his bounce his burst and Watkins with no because last week yeah he put an opponent on a post he did he knows how it feels when a guy has a run and start like I did you might want to concede it yeah one and one for Syracuse and Justin Taylor that was a big possession defensively there for Syracuse just being there prior to that steal by rud just get back into this game down by seven and a lot from Spears for Miller who can distribute quite well going to work down low and he draws a foul uh Taylor and thats Taylors second as well joining both Starling and Copeland with two Baba Miller talked about he wants to get better he thinks hes stronger now where he can take advantage of smaller guards than a post and great pass just reading Taylor had his head turned and just throw it over top yeah I thought that was interesting hearing Baba Miller say that to us today that Im still trying to work to make it click yeah on offense he said I know I can do a lot Im versatile but right now off the dribble he said Im not creating very much so I got to go to work with post touches and post guys up well its different because hes 611 and what youre doing is you put smaller guys on him to kind of get up under him so that makes it more difficult for him uh to to attack you off the bound so thats why he needs to go inside he start getting on putting smaller guys on a block and drawing fouls like this then theyll put bigger guys on him and then hell be able to drive you on the perimeter be more effective well he splits leads at four for Florida State with six to go in the first half Starling got a switch from Cory not on the same page with cck who rescues it in our kitchen but throws it out of bounds and it belongs to the seals and thats a seventh Syracuse turnover coming right into your living room he was coming right to us I was hoping he was going to let it go I would have I would have took my chances and shot that one I like my chances man from here from here I call Glass yeah okay at this angle yeah thats enough out of you its out of six to go first half alongside Randolph childish the Wake for his Legend Im Mike Monaco and our entire crew behind the scenes now a skip for Spears does more work in the midrange than from three thats area for this guy Darren Green who rattles one out and brown clears it Starling accelerates off the bounce and gets it to go plus a F just great job there just JJ stalling just getting it jjing getting downhill realizing he had oneonone there its not much green could do but fouling with his size and strength and hes got it high off the glass just doing what he does best just getting downhill getting in the paint getting to the rim good finish there the Notre Dame transfer had 17 against pit last week followed it up with a season High 22 against Miami red ay said to us last night two of his three best games hes played this year in year one with the orange well I think what s done with these guys hes demanded that they play on a defensive Bend theyre not sitting in zone as much as they have in the past and when you defending this way it takes something High b b and no and then Starling went up for the rebound Syracuse with a chance to Tire take the lead and inside the opening and draws a foul on Darren Green who picks up his second on these last couple possessions thats you get the foul there but thats more on your defense in general when youre playing against Judah Mitch all five guys have got to come back whoevers trailing the play you got to help Corral the ball and you leave him oneonone hes going to finish it or hes going to draw a foul M at just about 80 misses on the front end surprisingly early here orang have missed four free throws here is jayen warley and Spears was on the cut had it kicked Away by cuse two teams in the top half of the ACC red As orange at 4 and three coming off back to back League wins Leonard Hamiltons group at 52 tied for second only behind North Carolina who last night against wake for has got to 80 tipped Away by brown but secured by Corin Jackson moves it orley slicing Jackson found it and it rolled off the Finish na his second turnover there off the Baseline out of bounds in that zone I expect Ary to go back to the two3 at some point C gets wrapped up and its a foul on Jackson Syracuse is running quite a bit thats something we knew we were going to see from Florida State but Syracuse really doing that as well both teams want to get out you dont want to play against the set defense of either of these teams so when you get a missed opportunity defensive rebound push Tempo try to get try to get to the rim and finish more run here in the first half for K cuff Richard sophomore from Harlem Kansas transfer who shed a really serious knee injury with The Jayhawks last year torn MCL PCL and a busted kneecap to boot during practice and he sticks both from the strike hey two of the top teams in the SEC square off tomorrow night over on ESPN and the app number eight Auburn against Alabama with our coverage starting at 730 Eastern what do we need to know about Auburn just a deep team and and I think theyre team that has final full potential and really talented pressure and Aiden Holloway who joy to watch and as he continues to mature that team becomes even more dangerous than they already are they are really fun to watch 50 in the SEC perfect for Bruce Pearl Syracuse down two its Benny Williams Line Drive triple doesnt go but followed by Brown and were locked at 26 we going to say B beny whbs threw an Al of you there thats yeah hell take it we put in in his scoring but is a a n Watkins backing down cuff hes got the size advantage and cuff wraps him up and commits his first foul inside of four too in the first half at the dome in Syracuse we thought it would be a good one

early on playing in their eighth conference game and what what the orang has done better than anyone else is theyve taken care of home court theyre undefeated at home and thats that goes a long way and they were able to go on the road and get a conference win at at pit and when you can take care of home court and then build confidence that way and tonight theyre going to be in a dog fight with this semal team thats just coming in who just lost a game at home so theyre trying to get that back and but this the orange group is playing with a bunch of Pride theyre defending well theyre theyre adjusting to theyre still adjusting to the manto man defensive principles and we talked about that with with coach and theyre a little bit late on some of their weak side actions but I think one thing that people dont discuss with this team is that theyre young this is a start five is all sofs still has a woman BR well they turn it over its a 10 count jir Watkins forces that on Jud mint we step aside for 30 seconds and thatll right back to Syracuse we do not step aside for 30 seconds we will keep it right here after the turnover from Judah Min so thats eight Syracuse turnovers against this Florida State Defense Spears slashing and its a go on Malik Brown Primo Spears thats what he brings just put the ball in his hands in a middle ball screen we need a basket at times and he can create that same as Juden do for the orange you know when shot clocks running down or you need a big possession just put the ball in those guys hands and let them make play you said hes been one of the big differences Florida state has turn around yes because he provides his group with with a guy that can get his own shot off the bounce and and there not a lot of guys around e team that that does that as well as he does Connecticut native who has a dozen family members here men drives more contact as he got Jaylen gainy up in the air you have to be so disciplined in guarding him and you knew once you cannot leave your feet so coaching staff talked about any contact on Judy hes going to hit the deck and once G he got in and you knew he was going to lean in and get the foul missed three tonight gu shooting 80 got to figure that out another yeah Syracuse is 7 of 13 at the free throw line half dozen misses fla state two of six at the free throw Applause line and theyre not the best threepoint shooting teams the orange shoot free throws better but theyre struggling mightily right now Watkins attacks in transition and a rolled off Benny Williams down with his sixth rebound man pushes the transition and its go tending on Baba Applause Miller Baba Miller was coming he tried to time him you can see him getting his steps ready he was coming in from behind here Applause and wow unless youre going to tell me that was in a cylinder maybe that was the call which I dont think it was that did not appear to be the call Watkins drives for two more and muscles it up to 10 points and hes had a big first half he has when they were rning that little Baseline Runner I think you need to cut that last screen and take away that tight curl theyre curling into the middle of the lane and with walking size and athletic ability was just just tough to you got to cut it and make him pop to the corner mint turns the corner a green and gets bumped again and Jud to minz draws yet another foul here in the first half got to Coral him in cant leave him one onone its just what he does it just creates a ton of fouls its not rewarding himself from the free throw line here in the first half but fouls are starting to P up for the simers Judah was telling us last night that he remembers going up against Florida State last year as a fresman and remembers what Jim beheim said to him when they press up on you just go he told us Jim beim was saying to him whats wrong with you just go thats the way you want to play yeah because theyre not going to let you run all your sets so you have a guard like him a lead guard like him that can create for himself and others just go and put them in rotation and then you find your teammates and hes made that adjustment this year because his creativity in his vision and finding his teammates you can see hes worked on all 30 a piece with two to go Josh nickelberry started his career at Louisville and Off the Bench the 11th different null to check in Watkins a hand off for Baba Miller came up short rebound Bell Starling pushes mince gets a switch from green and you know he wants to attack gives it up to Starling Starling crosses up nickelberry Starling tough shot on the Baseline and one JJ staring just he tried to give it back to Jud Deens and he gave it back totem oh ISO clearing out that right side form and the angle to step back great defense initially and just nicoby didnt give him a chance to land really good defense just better offense he moved his feet did all the hard part and just didnt let him come down told you how good the last couple of games have been for JJ Starling a Beville native Baldwinsville just 20 minutes away from here he said I feel like my again after his performance in the last week couldnt stamp it Buck 20 to go until halftime Florida State now down by two and Watkins got it back muscles it up and draws a foul Jamir Watkins is doing Yans work Benny Williams did a really good job of blocking on the strong side but Walkers didnt give up on the play and I know Benny doesnt like that foul no one in the dome likes it either predictably yeah so Watkins to the line an asserted first out what Leonard Hamilton say to as a shoot around today hes an attack dog hes just the guy we talked about no ones talking about him and what the way he plays and he just does a little bit of everything for this team and hes a matchup nightmare I think he just takes takes bigger guys off the dribble and hes not many wings that 67 has his length and athleticism to defend him on a perimeter and in the post knocks down both 32 all with 114 to go in the first half here at the JMA Wireless though the pressure the full court press here giving the orange some troubles there a little bit tentative theyre worried about the Run and Jump you just got to beat it and get it across half court whats the Run and Jump theyre setting up in man and sometimes theyll leave that and then theyll go to manto man and theyll just run and trap the Basketball Baseline reverse fell off for Bell kep alive for Williams that is a heck of a play there by Malik Brown couldnt get it saw Benny Williams there just tipped it to him and saw his teammate underneath the rim now Baba Miller gives it up to Jaylen warley a ball screen shot clock inside of 10 corner kick Miller yes Applause sir got to know when warley gets in there hes driving hes looking to find teammates but hes 67 he looks over top with smaller guards rejected the ball screen in the middle of the floor put the orange in rotation bab Miller stepped up made the corner K Big Time shot final six seconds for JJ Starling and he draws a foul with 28 to go in the first half well kind of as we expected yeah two teams plan some of their better basketball here in late January Florida State at 52 in League action Syracuse at 43 now we do step aside for 30 seconds right back after Music this hi Im Jeff from nutscom when my grandfather started this business in

good position here in a onepoint game in the first half yeah they are tar Hills have seen to separate themselves with a big win last night over the deakes and still undefeated in conference play they are among the best teams in the country let own e ACC I mean the way theyre defending and theres not a guard in the country playing better than RJ Davis I mean I think hes put himself in not just ACC player the year conversations I think hes in a national play of your conversation right now hes been that good he has been hes been very hes been fun to watch and very impressive Malik Brown checks out only one foul but theyll avoid risking that so Pete Cary checks in with 28 left and JJ Starling put Syracuse up by one Corin gets it in the nickelberry from half court no dice and that does it for the first half in central New York with Syracuse up a point back and forth Randall just what you expect just teams going back and forth only thing hes struggled with so far is just knocking down free throw surprisingly no hes not happy about that but everybody knows about that guy three and white matches up up with jayen warley Florida State makes a change to its second half starting lineup thats a rarity for Leonard Hamilton Jaylen gain is in there for deont green g gave good minutes in the first down Baba Miller gets it to go with the left hand you can see the infes must have been the go inside they putting gain in for his physicality but for Baba Mill there to start off poting up remember Syracuse though with a lot of foul trouble in the first half Taylor C Copeland and Starling with some foul issues and Syracuse counters right away both team emphasize what they were practicing on for for the orange slipping screens coming up slipping and practiced that all day yesterday second bucket for Malik Brown who had eight rebounds in the first half orleys directing knce into the paint and a foul is called on the floor cant give Wy his right hand cant give that middle Drive there see the foul issues for the orange in the first half these three guys with two AP piece for red ay lets see if kopman gets in there now and settles in hes only played one a minute early so when he gets in I think theyre going to Zone a lot more give we second out yeah to protect their guys they need to stay in zone and Worley lost it and it will stay at this end of the floor with the Noles I think its going to happen to do that because its just to protect his guys and theyre not shooting it well maybe save some of their legs running around Miller on the Baseline out of bounds n Syracuse getting out and running behind the back to mince thought about a skip for Starling mince playing off two feet now Starling mismatch with gainy turn around jumpero love to drive left and spin back to that right hand Watkins had it tipped Away by Brown King of the deflection men in transition keeps it and another goal tending violation you can attack this similar team again when their guards go to the offensive glass they dont get back and I dont think theres no doubt about that being a block me a go in there they looked at both from the first half during halftime Tomy morresy came over and told us both confirmed his goal tending so its Syracuse by three in a game that has been tightly contested on both sides largest lead for the Orange has been four largest for the seol has been Applause seven Watkins turns the corner again was met by a couple of Syracuse Defenders and it belongs to the orange its been this kind a choppy feel to the game what we expected and Leonard Hamilton like he did on

State at noon number three North Carolina against these seminal and then Clemson against number 12 Duke at po Eastern on ESPN and the app now look at this NCAA tournaments by conference the last couple of Seasons ACC has been as successful more successful than any other conference in in the entire country and there are coaches in this league who say you only need to look at that and they feel that this league is being undervalued nationally whether its in the net rankings or in Bracketology predictions and that Mark success needs to get more weight carried for how this league has been and we talked about that and then Joe lardi comes out and not saying its just he but in this report theres only three ACC teams in the tournament that started today and you know its its always an argument and I think theres a fair argument definitely for the ACC and I think there needs to be a criteria of what they expect and what theyre looking for and there just so many seems to be so many different narratives about how do you get in and brown on a nice feed from mint great job there on a slip but coaches what if its if its scheduling then they want to know this what we need to do is schedule some lower D1 teams low major teams and beat them by 50 and thats not always the thing you want to do for sportsmanship in that Nation but if thats what it takes then youre going to see teams trying to do that and not schedule so many competitive games that we saw early in the year bell with a block of gainy theres a lot of coaches in this league who would tell you that there are more than three NCAA tournament quality teams in this conference and the eye test might support that as well yeah I think well get there without question just a great job coming in Bale comes in from gain preventing a dunk its great timing on that block big fow didnt see it Syracuse by five Florida State operates Florida State 92 in the net Watkins has been there Star had it Roll Off Taylor clears it for C 68th in the net this is a quad three game for them its a quad one game for the seminal minz gets downhill Again Taylor moves it well if Gs in the game I think youre going to see teams theyre going to run a ball screen to try to get him in the back him off the bounce aen green force the Malik Brown turnover Miller sails it green saved it but then hes stepped out of bounds thats what Miller like to have back he had green wide open with his feet set hes pretty much automatic when that happens he doesnt get a lot of open looks like that and all right so Gs out right now for Florida State so how does that change now based on what you were just saying how Syracuse will attack offensively well now you have more guys who you can attack green is a little bit better at defending on the perimeter Syracuse went right to the ball screen they were hurting them on slips now theyre just going to ride you up and switch Brown sets the screen short roll mince PR and mince what do you Applause know now he just got to do the hard part and make the free throws we know hes going to draw the fouls and great job by Judah Miss they switch yeah thats what Im saying crossed over and went right back downhill just changes Direction so quick hes just putting pressure on you constantly all right you talked about though playing off the pick and roll with Malik Brown and the short roll is a big part of Syracuses ball screen offense at this end of the floor what does brown do for them that makes it so successful well its not as much tonight because Florida state is switching usually teams are going to help theyre going to hedge the ball screen with a guy like Judah Mitch and then Browns comes in is that hes short rowy he catches it hes really skilled at catching it and and putting pressure on the rim or skipping it and putting your defense in rotation and theyre not getting that as much tonight because Florida State just switches five and theyre going to look to wear you down so its just not there thats why hes not a big part of the offense well this is an 80 run for Syracuse up by seven Florida State needs an answer Baba Miller getting into the post battling with brown and Millers got two more doing exactly what he told us was going to do more he has hes come out the second half and thats his second basket of trying to catch it in the post or the mid post sometimes he can just turn around and just shoot it over and no ones going to block his shot just turn facing elevator hes got 10 career high is only 14 Min draws another foul this ones on Miller and thats three on Baba

app we would love a chance to frame it for you true story when big nation rolls in its time to dial up the Halls number six Kentucky Total Domination by Kentucky takes on Arkansas wow what a play experien number six Kentucky arkans Saturday at 6 on ESPN Florida State and Syracuse separated by a game in the ACC Baba Millers got three fouls Florida State able to withstand foul trouble more than most teams in the country they are they theyre capable of going 12 guys deep and the problem is that Baba Miller came out the second half starting asserting himself inside and now they lose that offensive option and theyre for a team thats struggling to get the ball in the basket so they got green they got Primo Spears out and walking still there but now they got to worry about rebounding against this orange front line theyre trying to slow down Judah Mintz who had odd free throw misses like we saw on both sides in the first half of this game but hes course corrected since again we told you in the first half second among power conference players in free throws attempted this season only behind Zack Edy and entering tonight Jud de men had attempted 53 more free throws than anybody else in the ACC I dont think anybodys catching I think that wow really bold statement by you I think Im going jump out there and say that no thank you watch your footing on the left you know Im jump on ESPN bet Place me a bet I think you know I like my eyes I like my return on my investment bosses are pleased sevenpoint game jayen warley in Florida State needs a bucket jir Watkins off the green screen turned the corner top pass green finishes and the foul how about Jamir Watkins wrapping that thing around just a great job great find and its warley in the weak side corner so you got to help and suck in and pull off we just a difficult de you got to get over there Malik Browns got to be upset with himself youre guarding a non shooter you got to get in and rotate just a great pass though just a great wraparound pass green Strong finish again Watkins told us today you made the point in the first half he was a three and D guy at VCU and now being in this position L offense where youre flowing and spreading things out at Florida State he is showing off the full tool belt hes doing everything JJ Starling off the bounce for Syracuse gives it up for Bell off a shot F into the midrange for two got to go for the shot fake Bry mbell he shoots the three so well good for him to get himself get himself going orley Cuts finishes got it from Green and thats what Wy does he doesnt shoot it well from behind the threepoint line but he moves and cuts off the ball how do you think Syracuse has handled the full court pressure of Florida State they got multiple handlers I dont think that would be an issue I think what Florida States intention is just to wear their guards down they dont want great defense here and a turnover Watkins poked it away from Taylor who picks up the foul and thats three on Justin Taylor thats what you want to do you want to get it in a non ball Handlers hands and then pressure him like that thats with Florida State how they want to play the guards you got to get the orange probably got to get Jay JJ or Judah Minch bringing the ball up the court now but this lineup they have out there theres Primo Spears trying to get green going just one M bucket its a three took it off the bounce that time followed underneath by Watkins and he draws another foul and its on Brown and thats three now on the big for Syracuse Malik Brown what youre not used to when you play against the seminal that as a guard when they get these lineups it doesnt matter their guards go to the offensive glass so the the game doesnt start till the ball hits the rim because their guards are crashing and if your guards AR accustom to boxing out you give up offensive rebounds and you cant get out in transition but if you rebound it you can actually run and weve seen orange do that a couple of times in the first half red atrey said it to his team yesterday at practice he pointed out the exact number of offensive rebounds per game that Florida State averages and he told his team thats the game guys that thats the game we got a rebound neither team is great rebounding they actually been out rebound both teams have been out rebounded by their opponents all year long but Florida state does a great job of making that up by their guards passing the offensive glass so Watkins pulls Florida State back within two and Min lead ball handler breaks the pressure attacks follow rolls up for Applause Williams J Jud Mitch though he got another foul there Spears comes up to get it around the screen from the elbow the leaner ties us at Music 48 and then turned over by Syracuse on the inbounds theyre trying to run out quickly and this a great job turning the corner there he snakes the screen creates space and gets Benny Williams off his feet he just comes in as instant offense with this group then on the inbounds there and green in the corner was out on the sideline so these teams just swapping turnovers the orang have to do a better job of handling this full court pressure Judah gets just clear out everybody and just go and you had just said that for the most part you thought they had handled it well you wanted to see him keep it with Min and Starling o dra are foul I think Judah Minch is giving it up a little too early its Zone pressing you see there he picked his dribble up anticipating the Trap and they backed away instantly so hes got to eat up that space against the Zone Zone pressure and got away one there finding copel well weve had 35 made buckets from the floor in this game had 30 fouls as well thats kind of the way it goes with Florida State off thats what we said we talked about that and we knew it would be this type of game and sounds like I was right about eye a little bit and sounds like its going to be an expensive dinner for you my friend okay all right if you werent with us in the first half this genius Rand Childer said this game will reach 9 15 before its over yes just their styles of play these teams are physical they foul they they theyre downhill driving teams and theyre going to force you to blow the whistle and thats just what were getting two Point Syracuse lead Watkins with a hand off for Spears Spears gave it Applause up and away from the ball its a foul that goes against Syracuse theyre going to get Benny Williams and and thats his second so with brown and Taylor both on the bench with three Williams now with a couple but a good thing is its a baseline out of bounds play and the orange go in zone when theyre Baseline out of bounds so theyll stay in their Zone through this possession do you think thats a smart decision oh the fouls are ping up and if you stay in it it gives you enough time to kind of stay in and help with rebound thats the fear though that you get Darren drains some space Syracuse Dodges a bullet and now the orange runs with mint attack and finish it and thats what you can do as well you can get it out get that back court getch the ball downhill when you rebound it weve seen that time and time again out of that famous two three Zone Spears gives it up for Watkins those down by four long way to go here in central New York Spears hoist Primo Spears only five of 23 from threepoint range this season barries one for the noes its a great job there just reversing it finding him in the corner Starling finishes through the Conta its good no call there green just went vertical just the Brun of the punishment though on that drive but good no call Darren Green with a runner thats short and then a foul on the rebounding action goes against deatte Green and thats three on the big for Florida State T corn coming in to replace him simal just going to throw bodies in they have the depth hes got to watch this back for they got to handle this pressure by Judy Mitch needs to keep the ball theyre not theyre not trapping it keep it until the Trap comes just dribble up theyre just going to retreat and go to manto man Just patient dribbling in the back up just dribble up V is trying to summon starling instead Midway through the shot clock its of Benny Williams ball screen and mince finally gives it up 20 ticks Into The Possession and now Starling five to shoot JJ Starling on a hop well defended by Spears great job the defensive in there by spear standing in front of the ball he moves it Watkins STS it onepoint gain the one concern that you have about the orange in his back court particularly with Judy I wonder how does he fatigue right now he has a lot of responsibility to create for himself and others because hes picking matchups and then just driving it last couple times he didnt get a foul call trying to force one there maybe the product of all the responsibility hes on the deck seols whisk it away Spears ho cant hit and then Corin wraps up Copeland and its a foul on the rebounding action against cam Corin inside of 12 to go in the second half between a couple of teams in the top half of the ACC and its been back in fourth Starling just comes down takes the contact and finish back and forth game here onepoint lead for the orange5 duo at Burger King double up flavors when hunger dings warer Jun and Royal crispy wraps for lunch L

about Florida States pressure look at this fifth most in the country in frequency that they press you one of the leaders in the country as it often is for Leonard Hamilton year after year Syracuse theres always the threat you get worn down from all that pressing and I think Judah men is starting to get a little bit of that just so a little fatigue and hes deferring on the full court pressure trying to get the other guys to to help him out and then he gets it in the half court set and then tries to attack and something to monitor if hes forced to kind of break the press and set the table on the offensive end once they get in the half court and here full court pressure here I think he needs to wave guys out and come at it see he first a little bit too too quick for me gave it up to Starling lets go and now takes it yeah just get it and go hes played all but a minute and 6 seconds in this game could bury the three and the rebound secured by cam Corin quick shots like that are like turnovers you dont get a chance to set your D and this is what happens Corin on the receiving end from Spears and Florida State BS back in front yeah quick shots when no ones expecting it Applause and state takes advantage of it youre not able to set your defense and get your matchups Florida state has won seven of its last nine Sy has won eight of its last 10 Midway through the second half Starling escaped Spears rolled up and Williams couldnt stuff the follow Nolls run Spears Watkins oh Watkins says Ill show you how to do it R turning starting to wear down this orange team orange team they trying to speed him up a little bit in the defensive end and Coach AR cars time out want to sell his trop now Florida State by 3 in the second half at Syracuse build the pool yourself what

smartassetcom then youll be matched with up to three vetted fiduciary financial advisors to get started take the advisor match quiz now at smartassetcom terrific Florida State up by three it popped out on Williams and the ns off and running yeah theyre doing a great job of that and just get out of good numbers and seems to be you starting to see Florida straight where the orange down I think they got to try to to get some Zone and something to keep this the momentum slow this team down they theyre getting from off the defense and the offense so fast and theyre not even playing against a set defense maybe Judy can get Jud min needs to get off it then get it back later in the shot clock on the second of third side and you see now with starlings handling the ball lets see if they run an action to get it to Judah later Menon the top of your screen shadowed by Primo Spears as the shot clock dwindles on Starling finds who had it blocked by Green sh clock un reset Copelands got to realize it does and nearly hit from the same spot as his winner on Saturday and then a Florida State turnover the pass too ambitious for Primo Spears theyre doing a good job of defending this back court now theyre pressure theyre extending their pressure theyre not trapping theyre doing this just to slow him down milk the shot clock great job here by Mitch just beat it get up the court give you more time in the half court orange offense has gone more than 3 minutes without points mince on a step through gets the roll and two to Mintz fifth leading score in the ACC is 22 tonight now they get to set their defense settle down Worley turned the corner on Brown Corin second effort boy got the angle got to the rim did a really good job after he missed get his hand on it plucking it into a teammate you wondered where points would come from for the NOS with Baba Miller on the bench its been no issue for Leonard Hamiltons team and now Baba Miller is getting ready to come back in nice follow there from Brown great job by minz getting to the rim and brown just continue to stand after the effort on the offensive glass hes not getting no short rows but thats a way to impact the game just attack the offensive glass Watkins d draws another foul hes drawn seven of them tonight thats on cuff and its his third see you look at the orange couple of guys the hands on the knees you got three guys on the court right now sloped over jir Watkins some deep breathing of his own calming himself before hes good on the first so hes up to 19 points you saw seven rebounds couple of assists hes got three steals in this game as well and now he gets Baba Miller who was punishing on the Block early on in this second half he en chantle Jackson enters the game and theyre going to keep fresh bodies in it just the way to seals play this is what they got the healthy bodies back thats been a big quad their T just wearing teams down full quot press attacking the paint had some injury issues this year Primo Spears has a multitime transfer didnt debut this year until December 16th for the seminal so that added an explosive score and another warm body for Leonard Hamilton its tur it over Darren Greens Off to the Races and finishes critical moment here for the orange men oh way how about you just get him the ball to get out of the way I think thats the game plan for the next 8 minutes here hes got the orange within three inside of eight to go Watkins not about drives on C Watkins on a step through yes sir how about 22 from jir Watkins matching a career high Watkins is answering the call ball here Brown turns it over to Florida State turnover number 14 for the orange that time mince didnt even he took one step across half court and stopped Watkins draws a foul but its on the floor well he spotlighted these two off the top jir Watkins for Florida State and judin for Syracuse and they have delivered 22 for Watkins 24 for mins on the big stage in central New Music Applause

Syracuse we said 22 for Watkins matching a careerhigh and 24 for Mintz fifth leading scorer in the ACC his ninth 20point game of the season only RJ Davis of North Carolina has more these two have been outstanding he guys and like we talked about in the open Min has been a score since he walked on campus yeah the issue with Florida state is that they switching is not allowing him to create for his teammates and hes going to have to put the orange on his back take him home these last seven minutes and can someone else step up and help him finish his game only JJ Starling is also in double figures with 10 foul trouble for Syracuse and under the constant pressure and the wave of reinforcements from Leonard Hamilton and Florida State can the orange withstand that pressure for another 720 down by one thing that stands out right now in this game is the bench points Florida States plus 12 and and for a team that these teams were one and two coming into this tonight hadnt gotten a lot Off the Bench from Syracuse Florida States been super efficient offensively in this second half theyve outscored Syracuse by eight since halftime and it built the lead to seven thats as large as its been on either side with seven to go Mintz shot clock winding down Spears all over Mintz tough shot off the glass this a difficult shot hes hes putting him on his back and hes trying to carry him home just initiate offense and now they fall back in the zone well see if lets see how FSU responds to this Zone youve been kind of clamoring for this yeah yeah you can see it coming just back up you got to find green green is the one guy you got to find 22 in black bottom left of your screen he cuts flashing green for warley back to green left alone gets it to go hes the one guy you got to find you can not make that mistake credit to Wy dribbling in and throwing it back out finding him setting him up for the corner three but had the right defense you wanted and cred at to Florida State they got to shoot it to the guy that they needed to get it to his 347th career made three darling no and now Florida state with as large as a lead has been for either team running green wats another no and a big block out from Brown tries a fourth foul on Baba Miller with 548 to go thats a big foul by Baba Miller here because now his length on the defensive end of the floor playing the five right now and allowing him to switch the orange back court was picking on the fiveman attacking gaining and cam Corning these guys in green off the bounce and Baba Miller is much more than that to move his feet on the switch like right like now you surprised he stays in no men driving on Miller lost it Watkins on the bench right now for Florida State and its Miller in attack mode the lead is 10 and red arrey needs a timeout hes playing too well I think you got to leave him in and Trust he got away with one there hes left his feet and Mitch bailed him out by not leaning into him I thought hed draw the foul well Miller steps up while jir Watkins went to the bench for a breather and welld deserved because hes been Sensational with a career high 24 yeah hes answering the call on the other end there just stepping in lining up that three and just getting out in transition here just showing you his athleticism finishing getting out on the break just a difficult matchup just youre seeing why he leads this team in so many different categories for this Florida State team that is you see 11 s overall 52 in the ACC have won seven of their last nine and before Saturdays loss against Clemson one of the best teams in the ACC it had been a fivegame winning streak where is Florida State headed you think the rest of the way well lets throw the metrics out theyre a team you just dont want to play because theyre healthy they they have their the roles of their guys the Finish is so versatile so dep like now you can put Baba Mill at the five and and he can switch and your defensive and youre pressuring and what theyve done is like this like the orange they wore them down and this is what theyve done during that streak theyve gotten healthy they ended up getting Primo Spears eligible and he provides a scoring punch and hes also an underrated own ball Defender those up by 10 still five plus minutes to go for Syracuse remember Syracuse had been down seven inside of eight to go Saturday in the comeback win against Miami Copeland moves it to the corner and off the fingertips of Chris Bell and a 16th Syracuse turnover now the orangs have to extend their pressure theyve got to pick up full court here theyre been games this year where Syracuse applies full court pressure and works its way back into games they got to do it against the nolles cor from warley and this is part of the adjustment with the orange because theyre so accustomed to being in a Zone they dont have theyre not great with all their rotations there and that time you set your full court pressure you still got to rotate back protect the basket its go time for mint and the orange move for Bell the Sharpshooter lines one up can knock it down Cor in the re rebound the lead at a dozen and 4 and a half to go from Florida State on the road Ary yelling at his guy to come up extending pressure and guard the Applause ball and Worley content to soak seconds you got this possession yeah you got to be careful here because you overextend your defense and now you open yourself up to all of all the driving angles you give to this group Corin on the Block warley follows it up thats your 67 point guard doing that yeah you just like we talked about before its the guards the guards get on the glass and youre not accustomed to it and if you can rebound it you can run on the seminal but if you dont their guards will punish you on the offensive glass Starling needed that and now Florida state with a chance to swell this lead approaching three and a half to go yeah theyll take this under 10 probably under 6 seconds before they come up run a flat ball screen here its a 90 run for the seals they get it to Primo Spears they summon the ball screen from cam cor Spears tried to snake it turned it over Copeland runs copelan draws a foul Florida state has authored a 14point lead here in the second half trying to wear down Syracuse the orange with three and a half to go trailing at home ESPNs

upset is complete in Columbia absolute clinic by South Carolina an embarrassing effort by Kentucky but South Carolina that is a fast developing legal Court storm Mike and Randolph they were ready for it what a win for the Gamecocks Kevin coach I love it the Arbiter of our court storms across the country Seth Greenberg uh were here the JMA Wireless do in central New York Randolph CHR Mike mono our entire crew with you and jir Watkins has powered Florida State as they wear down the Orange Lake yeah theyve limited them orange have struggled from behind the threepoint line theyve only one of 13 and that guy there Judit has not had much help tonight on the offensive end of the floor and you couple that with some untimely turnovers that have led to transition points for the seminal and orange found themselves in a difficult situation still 323 left quer Copeland was me in foul trouble in the first half at the line that he misses the first that also has been an issue for Syracuse Tonight free throw shooting especially in the first down missed nine free throws here tonight Copeland just couldnt get in the game he got in literally in 1 minute and 20 seconds and picked up two fouls and they dont they dont just need him offensively hes a leader of this team and they need him because hes the best defend is the soundtrack of any Syracuse practice or game the vocal lead of this orange team Florida State content to run some clock here Copeland tried to commit a foul on warley whos not a great free throw shooter now C nearly picked it off Worley underneath for Cory attached rocked by C and Watkins pulls it out shot clock at five Spears off the bounce oh the the rack and a foul Primo Spears just comes in and this is his role for his teams he he provides a need a basket give me the ball Ill get you a basket hes done time and time again since shes been back and with 12 family members in attendance with his folks watching him for just the second time in a Florida State uniform hes got a dagger through a foul Florida state is different in part because of Primo Spears theyre healthier the rotations have stabilized a bit and this team has found its rhythm in late January well that that because theyre so versatile in what theyre doing I mean warley knows his role he comes in hes a ball mover and a big time Defender and hurt you on the glass Spears knows his Ro green comes in and then you got the the Swiss army knife and Baba Miller that does a little bit of everything and gainy understands his physic physicality he needs to bring and playing inside as he continues to get healthy and trouble that with Chandler Jackson coming off the bench Josh nickelberry coming in its just not a team you want to play trying to get to 6 and2 in the ACC they would stay two games back of North Carolina at the top and it would be a quad one win for Florida State as mens fouls Spears near midcourt with 240 left Music second you saw Primo Spears parents like we mentioned watching their son and feeling pretty good hes got 11 points five assists he hasnt turned it over yeah Mama Like thats my baby out there all smiles on the floorida state end of the stadium started his career at Duan last year at Georgetown 16 a game a guy who was so athletic that in one year of high school football Primo Spears generated football interest from several Power five programs as a Applause cornerback oh wow his size he could have been an elite elite Corner lock you up Mike norell maybe get some ideas seals here on a 131 run here styling misses from Deep Syracuse one of 14 from long range last time Syracuse only made one threepointer in a game you got to go back a dozen years to 2012 when the orange fac Louisville struggle tonight and you couple that with the turnovers is just just difficult to overcome J I thought they run a little bit more Zone than they did tonight I know but when youre trying to change your culture you just stick to your manto man principles and keep working at them hey tomorrow the Huddle crew will reveal this seasons ACC football schedule speaking of Mike Norville theyll break down each team new members Cal Stanford SMU included in that coverage of this 2hour special begins at 5 Eastern you can watch it over on acc Network also right here on ESPN 2 and the ESPN app lot of Buzz as well with what Fran Brown is doing on the recruiting Trail for the orange already 218 to go Min has been tked with a lot here in the second half Copeland draws a Applause fou see Florida State still playing a hard swarming the ball thats just their style of play you doesnt matter how much time left on the clock this team is built on a defensive end of the four you know where youre going to get with that end right from Florida State more often than not because theyre always switching theyre aggressive theyre pressuring they run all these bodies at you as everyone knows by now offensively what do you think about them the rest of the season thats we talked about both of the they the same theyre going to attack the pink they want to get downhill and Greens the one guy that tends to hurt you from threepoint shooting he was two of seven tonight they only made made five theyre five of 16 from behind the threepoint line so if they get any help consistency and their offense have been to the floor from behind the threepoint line then they have everything they have it all because we know theyre going to continue to defend they have length their size and they all thinking theyre starting to make their free throws as well this was a team that was the worst free throw shooting team in the ACC and these guys are gaining their confidence theyve been in these moments theyve been in these close games and Watkins an exclamation point out of the Applause corner why not hes just played so well tonight career high 27 hes got 11 rebounds as well and thats matched a career high for the fourth year player in VCU transfer tough shot of men who got fouled by Darren Green all right lets spin it the other way here with Syracuse 131 left for them staring down 4 and four in the ACC theyve been better recently what do you make of the Syracuse team and youre one under red arre I think they still been a surprise team in the E ACC prior to this headed to their first defeat at home and to be honest they just played against a team thats a little better at doing the things that theyre doing right defending and attacking the pink 131 to go here in central New York still to come weve got the big 12 TCU and Oklahoma State coming up once were done here at the JMA Wireless Dome TCU trying to respond after backto back losses last week at Cincinnati in overtime that against Iowa State you see the record for Jamie Dixons team at 135 overall 2 and3 in the Big 12 yeah they had a major upset over Houston and just dropped those two games after that and they need to get back to their winning ways and keep boering that resume for the tournament and is still to come on super Tuesday presented by Progressive Music Jud with 26 points tonight three assists he has supplied a ton of the production compared to the rest of the orange I thought he got a little fatigue rightfully so hes we talked about hes adjusting to team scheming him and did a great job early and hes going to draw a crowd hes the guy when youre playing the Orange you got to stop him and Florida State still couldnt stop it you know tonight Vince has made 10 free throws free throws matter as Bren ax would always say 120 to go Florida State by 18 that they do well North Carolinas at the top of the ACC and then it is a glut of teams behind the heels including Florida State theres cuff out in transition and he lays it in yeah theyre not going to foul here going to let the clock run out some will keep the ball and probably Primo Spears hand and run a run up ball screen attack and carry in the switch off the screen a turnover a third 9 seconds left is it Carolina and then everyone else in the ACC or do you put duke or maybe Clemson playing I think theyre playing better on both ends of the floor I think theyre the best defensive team in the league and and when you combine offense theyre the best theyre the most complete team right now theyre showing it showed it last night over on ESPN against Wake Forest that RS out for Bell and that will do it here at Syracuse Florida State comes on the road and with an explosive second half takes down Syracuse 8569 and Florida State just keeps on coming at you they do they coming at you in waves and rebounding from that home loss versus Clemson and came to cuse New York and got one on the road 6 and2 in the ACC and a third straight win at Syracuse for Leonard Hamiltons team for our entire crew behind the scenes led
