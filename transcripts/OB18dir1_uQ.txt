winning ways and uh theyre good players theyre going to help Utah Valley so here we go just about underway at Maples Pavilion and Maxim REO wins the tap officials Michael Greenstein Darren white and Jason garrettson and the clock did not start that wasnt a turnover that was just a mishap theyre going to go to the scores table and uh redo this but not not the tip but inbound I see how many seconds they take off the clock there are not 1 minute and 95 seconds remain I dont think so not 1957 I can live with that yeah all right Ill get it right yeah that looks about good heres Jaylen Blakes in the starting lineup alongside sellers agall r no and Aiden camon pass a little bit behind R know theres Carter Welling hit in the deck yeah like that pass he was open Dominic Nelson no Ethan Potter yes yeah and you know I love that they went right inside of Maxim Reno he was open they instead of throwing a direct chest pass they went in under the underneath with a bounce pass not the way you want to feed Maxim Reno hes seven foot plus lenhardt Nelson tulson look out for him Ethan Potter and Carter Welling the starting five for head coach Todd Phillips Ryan agarwall floater a little short agall starting his third straight game for the Cardinal know Kevin when when Stanford struggled theyve struggled sometimes at the beginning of the game and beginning of a half at just getting on the board and getting an established Tanner tulson too strong from straight on watch the start here I think KY Smith and his staff really concerned about the starts of each half jayen Blakes whos been really good this year transferring from duke little mid is going to roll around and drop in I like the roll in the AR Kevin thats pretty good too but Jaylen Blakes can do that thats his really his bread and butter if he can get two feet in the paint and go up over you uh hes pretty steady hes hes money from there averaging 15 and a half points and five and a half assists just about top 15 in the country in assist a turnover ratio at 5 to one Trev lenhardt this is a good player right here and so is Carter Welling oh were going to have a blocking foul in oah Cel yeah the officials didnt want to call that but when they saw the shot come out thats kind of a pro NBA kind of officiated call you just you go back and you get the call but you can see the roll there and you can see that the last second sell steps up he was outside of the The Arc in the circle in there but I thought they they must have felt he was still moving it looked like that shoulder wasnt completely Square might have been moving a little bit as Welling hits its the first of two free throws now you look at some of these guys for Utah Valley coach they do not look like a mid major team they have some real dudes who could be playing after college well they do and theyve got some guys that you know experienced their program has been successful anytime youre playing in a successful program it carries over your newcomers pick up the culture and your returning guys are used to winning Todd Phillips was an assistant under Mark Matson at Utah Valley his second year on the job youre one of the Kyle Smith era for Stanford Rayo so proficient at that time well he can do that make no mistake Kevin uh you know hes done that in each game hes played but hes also drifted out sometimes and hes got to get back on that block but and establish himself but boy he sure has range versatility for big fellow aing 234 points 116 carams Coral per contest Potter backing his way down scor 20 at North Dakota this year and looked like camon kind of pulled the chair on him well and I like that you know Cams a a pretty good Defender at six at 610 but you know go back to Max Reno hes got the ball out on the floor and you forget as a sevenfooter to get out there and challenge him hell knock down shots on you if you dont get in him and then when you do get very aggressive hell Blow by you to the basket he is a 40 threepoint shooter as well Blake strong take well defended theres welling with a tough rebound thats good defense by Utah belly Dominic Nelson really good in transition lenhard good pass and Nelson hits the three just a 177 threepoint shooter but that one drop well hes wide open and you know I thought they had Stanford rotating on their rotations just couldnt quite catch up with the ball and open People Todd Phillips saying a shooting around today they want Dominic shooting that open three even if he loses confidence in when its not dropped and sers to the line I like josea Jah sers you know but uh driving it but there theres a wide open shot and thats out of rotations Kevin youve got to get your rotations down anytime you fly and you put two guys on the ball good teams are going to find the open guy and I dont care if youre shooting 177 most college players are going to make that shot Z sers first undergrad transfer at Stanford alongside of para chamok para and uh Darren Saron since 2009 when Andrew Zimmerman came over from Santa Clara but Sellers from USC having a great start to the season well and and hes done well I think hes been a little unselfish you know to his credit hes not a selfish player but there are times when Stanfords going to need him Kevin to step up and kind of take over hes capable of doing that uh and and I think as the season goes on youll see him assert himself more a onepoint lead here for the Wolverines Nelson defended by Anthony Batson Jr really good on ball Defender The Freshman great take Nelson the Finish Well I was on a short clock I was going to tell you say that was a great defense by Stanford but you got to finish the job knocked out of play from behind by lenhardt thats so frustrating Kevin when youre playing great defense at the last minute team exhaust end the shot clock to scor camon inside pivoted into a double team and gets held yeah hes got to go up Kevin Im you know Im not being overly critical but and hell know that hes got the ball inside when youre one foot to two feet from the basket thats not the time to be unselfish you you got to go up hes 610 and if nothing else challenge a team to block your shot or get to the free throw line but that was a great he got the ball inside just got to finish possession arrow to UVU Music tulson looking pull up didnt go Outlet pass a little too far but saved in by sellers who gets it back cant finish around Potter what a great play by Maxim REO to save it and in one motion get it back to sellers I think he was caught between a dunk and a lamp maybe uh it was a little indecisive Potter drawing a crowd catch and shoot tulson yeah thats a little late good Shooters you got to get out there that was a challenge but it was not a challenge up it was a challenge out and youve got to get up and strish hard but uh Utah B doing a good job early up six nearly forced a turnover on Blakes there that does not happen often raino drawing two good kick Blakes powering into the paint and hell shoot a free throw on the other side of the timeout good take by Jaylen Blakes so thatll send us to the under 16 a good start for the Wolverines leading Stanford by four in enemy territory here on acc Network extra yeah their starts they got to step it up a little bit Utah Valleys Scrappy theyre tough they are Brandon and I worked together though back then I would have told you he worked under me I was the head manager here his freshman year despite my best efforts to instill unhealthy and insane working habits in him he really thrived in his role became a great CEO of the manager position as an upper classman he had a Swagger about him that I dont think Ive ever seen from any other manager he was hilarious and he will be missed great tribute from you too Kevin its tough sorry for your loss yeah back to work here it is a fourpoint lead for Utah Valley H boy chakar checking in you cant shoot going to Hayden Welling the defense and they dont exactly secure the rebound but Stanford will get the basketball well I I did think that was a better possession defensively I thought the pressure on the ball was good their rotations were better they seemed to be talking communicating more I I mean Kyle Smith is and his staff are pretty good with their teams coming out of timeouts I think hes knows what to do and what to direct what they need to do and they they did pretty much did that on that possession Benny geler into the game coming off a really nice performance against Cal Paulie 17 points and five steals go inside Reno good catch hes doubled giler strong on the three 39 three point Sho wide open its Stinson Evan Stinson hadnt played all season this is Collegiate debut thats a pretty nice first touch of the rock yeah hes making coach look good Kevin I I used to put guys in when they did that I said hey get help me get a race and he gets a steal and loses it right back Nelson ran into raino who really altered the shot Applause stellers in the open court we get a foul I like the up and down play theres a lot of transition basketball but you know so its so refreshing to see a new player get in his first touch just shoot it with confidence I mean there was no hesitation youre a shooter Kevin the worst thing you can ever do is hesitate you know youve made that shot youve practiced it thousands of times stop thinking about it for GR out loud go up and shoot it thats what he did the Freshman from Cheney Washington thats Eastern Washington territory three star recruit 255 and five nice as agarwall hits the three the rer sophomore from Texas theres something about that corner Kevin thats a pretty familiar corner for Stanford but you can see Renos ability to pass I mean you get open shots open looks I think Stanford will knock those down cinal regaining the lead currently on an eight nothing run get him some get some kylin green setting up toson who drills it it shows you his range I mean might have even gotten fouled on that play I think referees deemed that was after the shot but my goodness what great range hes a really good player Reno the touch inside now thats what Maxim Reno has to do and you know Benny gerer is a ventor and he knows how to get the ball to the big fella theyre CL close theyve played a lot of basketball together and thats what you want to do get the ball to the big guy when hes open not after the fact four points for maxim still looking for his first rebound is Hayden Welling around it out Tapped Out Cory Wells trying to keep it alive again oara and out to Utah Valley well thatll take us to the Under 12 timeout Stanford and a tight one with Utah Valley through the first 8 minutes and 16 seconds Ry nose bucket giving the Cardinal the lead back here at Maples Pavilion Cardinal nursing a onepoint Edge early on here against Utah Valley Wolverines out of the western Athletic Conference pi to finish fifth in whack play this year nice feed to Welling but wow the defense from marara thats a big time stop right there Kevin and here comes the Harvard transfer hard to the hole well how about that for a stop on one end and a just a really tough finish on the other thats what they need from Chism mokara he gives them that and Stanford is another level basketball team yeah still kind of finding his way here he AED more than 16 a game for Harvard last season and hes yeah you can see I mean his ability watch this I mean he just is all in is the space of Utah Valley now he gets the ball on the offensive end in transition I like his ability to just get to the basket just doesnt you know cuts through the defense and scores it nothing fancy just decides hes going to put his head down to get Music there Cyrus Brady with the rock into the Ball Game Reserve big coach Todd Phillips Welling thats good look H hell no Wells the rebound nson got hit upside the head yeah you got to D grab that again you know Kevin its thats not what Stanford wants from their players is to get the ball tipped on the defensive end you got to go up they had a chance to close the deal theyre playing good defense now the shy goes up off the glass and they have guys tipping the ball thats what you do on offense you dont do that on defense uh because if you can get two hands on it you youre off and running the other direction I saw Kyle Smith first year head coach for Stanford Todd Phillips and his seconde coach you know both these staffs pretty well well I do and and theres a lot of familiar faces on both Sidelines obviously for for Stanford to see Jim Shaw and you know to to see Derrick roel whos my assistant back at when I was at Cal Eric Revenue the longtime Stanford guy thorn in my side by the way when I used to play games here Eric and his own head coach as well at at uh you know at Portland and was assistant Georgia Tech hes been around but hes just a great coach Ive known that staff really long time Ryan agall wide open Benny geler yeah hes saying its about time I mean Bennys just hes such a good shooter hes able to you know knock down shots his percentage has been down the last few games but you do not want to leave him open he can he can flat out Str its six threes against Cal State Fullerton earlier this year as Ethan Potter shows some nice touch inside yeah theyve been pretty good about getting it into the paint on Stanford uh they you know Stanfords allowed the ball to get in deep Utah Valley plays more of a a traditional game if you will to go inside as AAR is fouled and I like that I like the look inside uh right there you can see it I mean theres theres the theres the look inside theres the swing to Benny giler and I mean Benny giler hes just got a great stroke uh you know maybe he lost his confidence uh after a first couple games but boy hes hes hes got it back he started his career as a walkon just so good and practice and became a guy you couldnt take off the floor gave him a scholarship no and hes got you know hes had the opportunity now and when when you get the opportunity sometimes thats all guys need and hes gotten a lot of opportunities to show what he can do and hes been very instrumental in their early success Cara going over for too just a 59 foul shooter on the seat yeah you can tell hes frustrated little upset with himself but um I might have to go get him after this game and explain to him that you can fit two basketballs in the rim side by side and front back yeah thats one of those things you you dont necessarily believe but it is a pretty wide rim I have a theory on that Ill try to get back to it when we have a Music break Welling face up Bo what the hell boy Blakes on the Baseline reversing it up and in yeah it didnt look like there was much real estate down there but Jaylen Blakes does doesnt need a lot of real estate Kevin he just you get him around the rim hes pretty Adept second bucket for the former Duke Blue Devil graduated Duke in three years using his grad transfer year here at Stanford pretty impressive yeah graduating from Duke in three years not easy to do Nelson amongst the trees well to just get that to far in transition Blakes on the drive draws the foul I like the lane that that Jaden Blakes used right there youre you know you got to hug up you got to hug up but watch what he does when hes got the ability to get to the rim with no help uses either hand but now hes got Reno standing next to him youre not going to come off of Maxim Reno because hes a great shooter so Jaylen Blakes is intelligent he said look youre not going to have a help guy Im going to attack and thats what you have to do sometimes Uh Kevin you got to put the ball down and try to find openings on the floor and when you have the ball in the middle of the floor everybodys a pass away you have opportunities to drive it uh and and thats what Jaylen Blakes did yeah Kyle Smith saying a pleasant surprise who scoring you never know guy played nine minutes a game at Duke so didnt get a lot of court time they knew they were going to have a hardnosed Defender but 15 points and five assists thats pretty good too and I like the 5 to one assist to turnover and how about the two two and a half the steals game I Ill give me those stats any day of the week lead is five hord left some points at the line just three of seven from the charity try Wells played NAIA ball for four years goes out of bounds great Hustle by Stanford they turn the screen down I like that they pushed the ball to the Baseline two guys attack the ball at the Baseline forc at Baseline its almost a triple team youve got the Baseline as a third Defender ran out of real estate they choked off one side of the floor and came up with a loose ball great team defense by Stanford Blakes was in the middle of that sellers off his screen they post up R now fading away off one foot overcooked it I dont think Kyle Smith liked that shot selection Choice from Rex r although he gives the Big B lot of leeway as he should Strip by camon AR Welling first to the deck big Collision good hustle both ways sellers on the leak out Stanford does that Kevin theyre a different team when they can scrap on defense come up with loose balls forcing again now Todd Phillips to use a timeout but you get it out on the on the break Isaiah sers knows what to do he streaks and he gains momentum with the slam Stanford up look at that 15000 miles total Plus for this past month you not been there done that uh Kevin mid Majors you have to do that but Todd Phillips a great job how about a win at Murray State they dont give up many wins at their in their gym great job by Todd Phillips and his staff one one game at the sford Thanksgiving Invitational and almost beat sford as well whos a pretty good team Kev lenhard Wells wide open that is not close Music tulson got called for the loose ball foul yeah Stanford again fortunate they they still couldnt secure the Miss shot rebound youve got to go up there and grab that just seems like maybe need some glue on those uh on those Paws uh but Stanford came up with the ball and theyre coming back the other direction but you mentioned Murray State and Ive been impressed with Coach Phillips and you know familiar face over there too Todd oasen veteran coach coach muton but Adam Jacobson Casey Jacobsons brother veteran coach for the uh Utah Valley uh Squad and uh you know Adam Jacobson a longtime player at Pacific and also uh great coach there for the their great teams and uh its good to see him back on the sideline and known him over his years over the years right qualify that foul from Cory Wells as a bad foul on a 20 threepoint shooting Jaylen Blakes yeah you want to make him prove himself um Stanfords been able to get to the line thats been something theyve done this year they I mean theyve gotten their little under 200 I mean you know I mean with number of times a little under 200 both did these teams have lived at the foul line thats why theyve been successful uh and theyve when you can get to the foul line so many things happen your foul guys up get bonus like it hit the first two missing the third boys seven straight for for Stamford over the last two and a half minutes C some pretty good ball pressure Hayden Welling good take cant finish raino the rebound Renos Way Up Above the Rim to snatch that rebound now takes the three offensive rebound here for Blakes Stinson fakes the pass good look just a little short Wells H oh block but a foul ston it looked pretty clean up top might have got him with the body yeah Kevin I think youre right the ball was really I think defended well but I think youre right it had to be the body because that was a pretty clean block honestly I didnt see a lot of body contact there either Smith is making to the officials Wells missing the first free throw and Todd Phillips say hes made a nice adjustment theyre talking about it now yeah and you can see Todd I mean coach Smith just saying look Darren white veteran official by the way you know you guys might have missed that one oh my God youre so bad well ball dont lie is what Kyle Smith might say well Darren pleading his case and so is Kyle Smith but the officials dont have to plead their case the calls made wello for two made a nice transition from NAIA ball to division one r no tapping it out through that one right to lenhard might have taken a deflection along the way Trevon lenhardt and one yeah thats a tough play because you know there are good turnovers Kevin and there are bad turnovers thats a bad turnover because it leads to a direct breakout and score the hesitation you read the defense and now youre already on the break maybe take a foul a little bit earlier youre Benny giler dont wait for the shot or you let him go and youre kind of in between right there and now you get a chance to maybe a threepoint play bur really good allaround player Trev lenhardt give you almost eight points five and a half assists four rebounds two steals yeah theres something going on Kevin I dont know what it is but theres just a lot of tip balls youre at the free throw line youve got guys blocked out and if you just secure with two hands it shouldnt happen but Stanford just giving up Second Chance opportunities for Utah Valley theyre too good to do that yeah the Wolverines out rebounding Stanford by three right now as tulson takes off if you just thought he was a shooter think again hes a driver hes explosive hes a competive hes a future Pro somewhere hes playing basketball for money and his 20s and 30s Blakes the spin got off balance and turns it Applause over aen Welling attacking geler fifth rebound for Reno only had five rebounds all Saturday against calply in and out we go we good tson catch and shoot in transition yeah both teams not afraid to get up and down and and see if they can get some shots you know think about it rather than playing against the set defense try to beat people down the floor and get some open looks both teams have had him Stenson trying to drive on Nelson mid short I know was kind of falling away there have a cold start for Maxine now two for seven and one Tanner tulson well you can see Utah Valley getting their confidence Kevin theyre getting out in transition theyre attacking the rim with a force and theyre able to get to the basket I mean most of their points now are coming at The Rim theyve hit a couple threes but they are scoring inside its Stanford thats got to find a way to stop this Utah Valley team from scoring well be back Music e e e e well lets take a look coming at Tanner tulson and his skill level I mean hes a highly skilled player he catches it drives spins splits and finishes I mean and draws the foul I mean you couldnt do it any better than that hes a a real load hes tough in transition hes tough in the open court but also in the half court youve got to get out to him and try to uh get a stop early uh and maybe get it out of his hands comes from a long line of tools since brother Conor played played at Utah Valley from 2016 to 2019 and played for Todd Phillips at Salt Lake Community College where he was previously a head coach for eight years his cousin Ryan tulson played at Utah Valley in the 2000s cousin Jake played at Utah Valley from 2017 to 19 his father Andy was a 10year Pro played a couple years with the Utah Jazz and averaged 18 a game as a senior at BYU thats a family affair yes it is he completes the threepoint play in Utah Valley has scored the last seven yeah they were you know Stanford was in a really good place until Utah Valley uh just came storming back with a run of their own Darren San is checked in for the first time in this game its his fifth appearance of the season the UC Irvine transfer is there UC Irvine with the Welling Brothers Ryan agrawal off the bouns to the hoop yeah I like the aggression you know dont settle for threes your shot hasnt been going down uh you know at a great rate so if youre Stanford lets get out there and lets attack I like that aggression AGA wall with Five Points one of four known players in division one of Indian descent poter no theres another Second Chance opportunity for Utah Valley good pass fake Welling soaring to the hoop took off a little too far though from the bucket he he had a shot Kevin I think he was trying to posterize somebody and wasnt quite as close to the rim as you thought sers and there sellers sers yeah that a that was a sky in the free throw that that was almost like a dunk contest shot but how about sellers coming right back and answering six points for sers good on ball defense Jaylen Blakes yeah look at Ryan Agarwal Kevin hes able to now he doesnt like the post up so theyre hugging up on camon and as I mentioned last time previously he just drives it to the middle because theres no help everybody glued up made his third start of the Season tonight Ryan nice deflection oara I got you thank thank you coach ball coming over this way Kevin you can get out from under the table now I got you it its safe now yeah I was kind of moving a little bit the other direction too I didnt want to get hit lenhard good kick out Nelson a lot of time to think about that one yeah too much time you can tell some form work probably be worked in the off seon step through aara no that was aggressive move to the basket I okar almost with the with the Finish Maxim Reno on the bench right now getting a rest probably come back uh at the scores table with Jaylen Blakes both players leading scor is ready to come back in next next whistle team doesnt sit much hes averaging 35 minutes a game late clock Olsons going to have to make something happen here Brady agal might have got a piece of that well I like the defense by Stanford I mean they made Utah Valley who is a patient team when they dont have transition really exhaust and I I think thats just a good possession C Smiths team can put a couple of those together and manage to get on the board that theyre capable of a run youve got two minutes left in this half I know if youre Stanford you dont want to go in the locker room tied up or or trailing you want to try to extend this lead and get yourself a little cushion led by nine at the break against Cal ply gave up 63 in the second half lost by seven Reno was at the Block and its got it punched back out now he has to get a deep post up agall gets tied up possession will keep it with the Cardinal you know postfeeding is really its a tricky thing because if you post feed on one side of the floor theres a lot of help theres double teams high lows are sometimes the easiest way to go into your post guy with no help in other words you front REO you lob he goes for the lob and scores it if you play dead behind him hes going to go over either shoulder so wouldnt be surprised to see that there sellers my goodness hes uh hes going to step up for for Stanford here uh Kevin because he he can do that he can get this team going the coach you got to love that the quick hitter off the inbounds pass no its a great play and great finish post up Grady Blakes not giving an Music inch Wells now great defense by Jaylen Blakes phenomenal defense Wells thats two straight shot clock violations and and you said this but I mean look at jayen blaks what he did defensively my goodness hes all over the place he switches out hes right there I mean he he was singlehandedly causing Havoc against Utah Valley hes a tremendous Defender Kevin I mean hes a guy if he can stay out of foul trouble that will really wreak havoc on on the other team AES more than two steals per game have one yet today they go inside Ray no mag well theres the high low I was talking about Kevin you cant stop that you get the pass from Blakes down low no help side makes it a 10point lead 80 Run for the Cardinal not stopped by tulson no real numbers about a 7 second difference between shot and game well if youre Stanford now you probably want to go down on the shot clock and see if you can just get the last shot maybe an offensive rebound and give Utah Valley as little little time as possible to come down and try to convert Blakes a l for maxim or or get a dunk from ma REO if that happens first that works too coach lenhardt going a little too quickly and Stanford nearly forced a turnover yeah its too bad I think C has had a chance to go the other direction I just I always see players bouncing a loose ball instead of grabbing it but but Ill tell you that was what a sequence down there my goodness is if Stanford can get a stop here theyve accomplished their goal I mean theyve gone in the locker room with momentum a pretty comfortable lead although I said that last week and KP came back but theyll take it if they can get it well and hes got to make something happen and its well contested incredible defense over the last four minutes from Stanford as they finish the first half on a 10 nothing run to take a 12point lead into the break yeah Kevin if Stan tulson and you give them open threes I dont care what his percentage is hes a competitor hes going to hit him and hes able to rebound and and do what his team needs him to do now if youre Stanford you want to start this half the way you finished it in the first ended the first half on a 10 nothing run Hayden Welling getting the second half start Nelson rattles out for him not a badl looking shot I thought defended well but certainly a shot he can make Ethan Potter start of the first half will come off the bench here in the second chis AOK para no good Reno good tap and Blakes will get back to the line for free throw attempt seven and eight already yeah I like the way that took place I right away they went inside to Maxim Reno he was able to get the ball across the play the way the ball got rotated and I thought that that Blakes does what he does he gets the foul line four for seven now tonight hes a 78 foul shooter coming in yeah hes been there a ton but the balls in his hands Kevin and hes able to you know draw fouls hes strong uh hes able to absorb contact doesnt mind contact a lot of players do he doesnt but this is what he really does he defends he gets your grill nice give and go with lenhardt yeah maybe a little too aggressive that time just you know for a second he lost sight of his man as man he got back cut good defense on the ball but now you got to drop the level level of the ball sellers off the screen fading away tulson the Miss theres Blakes save it to a teammate agrawal gets the deflection but man Blakes gets his hands in there almost saved it yeah Im Im you know Im a pretty safe guy when I go out but Im going to keep my valuables right in my back pocket because he hell pick your pocket now Jaylen Blakes is tremendous it uh with his hands hes got quick hands but even better anticipation K thats how he gets so many steals Stanford recruited him out of high school used to go to Duke got his degree there in three years Ive only had one player that did that that was Dennis Gates who by the way is coaching at Missouri and had a big win over former standout at at Stanford Mar Mark Mansons team at Cal great great game high scoring Affair part of the SEC ACC challenge yeah they they had to come back from 16 down Cal had things going their way until Missouri made a tremendous run in the second half Cals good this year oh theyre deep its going to be a barn burner this Saturday but lets not get ahead of ourselves yet like that missing the lob and heres raino such good footwork with the Euro Step foren he should do the Euro Step hes from France thats a Euro Step hes used to it but you know thats a great play in transition how about a sevenfooter that can get up and down the floor and give you that kind of finish hes playing in the NBA next year I think so but yeah we you know were were looking the accs had some pretty good uh wins this year um well get back to that in second but theres the step through I mean he just kind of let the defense go by but if you look at it uh you know this is going to be interesting year in the ACC I cant believe it starts this Saturday with call Stanford scoring off yeah thats fast man yeah theres Reno by the way SEC unded undefeated in the SEC ACC challenges chisaka takes it to the 10 well SEC having a pretty good year as well was a time that that you might not have seen that with the dominance of the ACC yeah thats a good point Nelson kicking it out tulson off the catch yeah good challenge they there we go they they had Reno inside deep just waited maybe a second too long heres Blakes gets the screen drills the three Kevin he adds that to his repertoire and watch out because he has not been on fire from three this year but if he can knock that threepoint shot down its lights out Maxim the defense this is a 192 run going back to the first half a little quick on the trigger by raino he could could have got to the rim tulson short but theres lenhard yeah Kyle Smith is just you know hes hes a coach hes going to be upset he likes the way his teams playing but he just doesnt like those little slips and they really their mental errors more than anything theyre just you kind of give in a little bit now you take your your run and he just takes a little bit of the sting and puts puts you you know gets you upset because you could have done a little bit more Fara good head fake yeah great job by Chism aara of keeping his pivot feet down Kevin I mean he he can do that hes been quick theres Blakes and again watch out oh and hits the deck you got to love Jaylen Blakes is it theres just nothing safe when youre around him in the basketball my goodness heres Jaylen Blakes you know you think Im a driver how about me from free I can do that from Deep count it lets get this out of here Stanford up big you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research its an extended 214 Stanford run to pull the lead out to 19 in and out nearly 22 on the lead but theres loose ball foul down low but Chism mokar is doing work I mean hes out there pounding the glass uh hes been aggressive this game Kevin and when hes been aggressive this year thats been thats been a good sign for Stanford but you see hes hes in there he just got shoved to the ground I mean theyre theyre worried about him on the glass ball hits the floor Blakes catch and shoot Nelson on the run out oh okara playing that perfectly well that was a really good defensive play by Chism okara I me watch the the break here he just splits the difference anticipates uses his wingspan and breaks up what looked like a sure two quick note Utah Valley mentioned Ethan Potter start of the game hasnt seen the floor in second half looking at the bench looks like he might be a little ill hopefully hes okay but judging by his posture and had a towel over his head for a little bit might not be feeling all that great well if youre playing against Jaylen Blakes I dont youre going to be feeling pretty good pretty good anyways how about Jaylen Blakes thats only his first foul and hes had games this year where hes been in foul trouble but now you dont you hope players uh you know arent injured and and but the way the way he looks if theres something wrong uh but you got to be impressed again Jaylen Blakes weve talked about him and and hes done well offensively this year but wheres made his Mark and really dominated is on the defensive end kyland green backup guard heres tulson Runner no the legs of osiah sers great Euros upep by Nelson you know Utah Valley has a way Kevin they just seem to make something out of nothing you thought that was Stanfords ball going the other direction and they managed to keep it alive and come up with the loose ball at a steel and uh got the two points and got rewarded plenty of time for them to get back in this game 17 points aint what it used to be coach no and and Cal Smith and his team know that better than anybody Faris strips thats off him out of play Nelson the swipe down now but you can see what we talked about just you know Stampers got it they just it doesnt seem like theyve got the glue I mean you know you got to you got to stick somehow and then Utah Valley keeps alive but on the other end its Utah Valley again thats coming up with the ball so youre right theres no lead is safe Kyle Smith knows that as good as they played in this half he knows that teams have come back on his team he hes concerned and he wants wants the momentum to stop G Stinson in well defended there by Ray no who is now one rebound shy of his eighth double double this season double double in all but one game and that was the last game pass a little too high for Stinson there well I like the back cut by Stinson and the pass maybe could have been led a little bit more to the basket but bro actually found him again though you got to you got to grab with two Kevin thats a onehand grab unless youre Jerry Rice and you and I know Jerry Rice well you grab with two he can grab with one hes good enough je that is a rebound and a half theres the double double for maxim he went high in the air for that I went to camon rather yeah thats a good look good looking shot for maxim Reno hell make that shot more than he misses it but but he got it changed it back to raino I thought that was raino on the rebound as that layup goes in so 10 and 10 for maxim REO with two steals to Valley making a little push here yeah youre concerned if youre Stanford because they have the ability to come back Stanford a little bit of a low right now havent got good looks last couple times down Reno guarded by a guy about a foot shorter than him right now in green they get it inside to camon whos fouled well you can see Maxim ra talking to you know his his team uh they got some good high low action going theres this pass over the top again thats the oneand grab Id like to see two Im pretty tough on guys but Ive had a number of post players and they just for whatever reason Kevin they love to grab with one you go with two and then you secure it all did Devon Harden grab with one hand or two uh we had a lot of guys that like they always told me that well if if they grab with one they can go up higher I said yeah how did that work out for you when it went out of bounds and you didnt secure the ball but you put two hands on the ball Kevin you might be a couple inches shorter but youre for sure going to get a chance to get a foul or a basket its just a habit and you know if youre a post player you want you want good habits Makara couldnt keep it in play so thats another turnover yeah and again great execution back cut of par wide open stops at the Block but the pass goes you know a little too far and again though oneand grab not too there must be something about this oneand catching I dont Jerry Rice maybe the Bay Area started something bad cuz I think he he just made it look so easy but I think he still put two hands on the ball L as well green no good there yeah they got Rao right to the rim hes got a guy dead on his back double comes and nearly is but Kevin that Balls got to go in sooner I dont know if we had a chance to see that but REO runs to the rim he gets a guy in his back and you got to be watching there he is hes already been hes down there that he was down there for for eons yes and by the time the ball goes inside hes got two guys on him you got to look at R now when hes first open not after the fact R know working on the perimeter here Gaylor catch and sh oh halfway down you can tell hes got a pure shot that was every bottom and out Nelson Coast to Coast well you talked about this Kevin you said you know Utah Valley is still in the in the game and look at this theyre theyre creeping back in this game and you know what Kyle Smiths calling a really well advised timeout but its Stanford thats hanging on theyre up by 13 but dont go anywhere this games threatening to be a good one 13 points and six rebounds and Coach hes already there in this game with 12 minutes to play no hes done a great job and you know hes a guy that has not shot the three very well this year but he does get to the rim he does some good things for his team so with the effort hes had you can see how really agile he is how Adept he is using both hands and and how quick he is so if youre in Stanford you got to know where hes at uh uh you Elli in a little bit of his own right here geler gets to the elbow and sticks the Jimmy now I like that shot for Benny geler hes obviously a threepoint shooter but when you get pressured and you can go buy somebody you know pull up and take what the defense gives you thats exactly what he did Theres Nelson jco transfer from Hulk State College yeah that takes us to that pesky extra mandatory timeout in the second half well take a break Stanford up 50 a great Utah Valley contingent here at Maples Pavilion this seven game Road Trip more than 15000 miles traveled how hows that catch up to it it does I mean but theyve done well by the way theres a green out here in the red territory yeah there ad is here Dr Jared sumption as kylin green just cut this to a 12point game well Stanford doesnt score Utah Val gets a stop the scores theyve now made it a single you know single digit game thats not what Kyle Smith wanted to see after having his team lead by almost 20 so we just had two timeouts in a row coach you and I were talking about this and that extra mandatory in the second half I think something we could do without and I think once upon a time I know the NBA does it college should do it too you you dont want to talk to your team for 5 minutes uh you know theres a timeout call that should that should designate be designated the TV timeout and I think all would be well but they may review that as time goes on theres agell wide open from free cant get it to go down Blakes the offensive rebound goes right down Broadway and takes a hard fall you see thats what what what I referred to earlier Kevin Jaylen Blakes is not afraid to give up his body I mean a little rattled now but he goes inside he knows hes in the Land of the Giants he gets knifed kind of uh by one Defender into the other but you know hes a tough kid and you want kids like that it rubs off on your team when you can go in and just know that youre going to absorb contact and get two points maybe the hard way they you know when theyve needed baskets this year when Stanfords been struggling theyve looked at Jaylen Blakes to go to the rim and oah sers and get it the hard way thats by earning it going to the foul line 10 free throw attempts hes hit seven thats thats pretty good hes up to 16 points his sister Michaela its a freshman for Vanderbilt averaging almost 20 points per game shes a McDonalds AllAmerican as theres Dominic Nelson right back at you well we couldnt talk about him enough we just saw a highlight package by our producer and he did a nice job highlighting what he can do but he does it again he turns the corner the help is late he hesitates I like the give and go the I mean the kind of hesitate lower the shoulder and then get the ball off the glass with a chance for a threepoint play and you know they just arent going away Utah Valley that free throw cuts it to 11 with 11 minutes to go and heres a full court press this is something that that the Utah Valley is now going to extend theyre going to go to a little bit of a trapping press see if they can get Stanford off of their Rhythm the ball out of Jaylen Blakes his hands and they force a turnover green single digit deficit Applause couldnt get it across half court last time and struggling Applause here high up this time in possession arrow to Utah Valley yeah theres a lot of dribbling Kevin and uh you know the ball in in uh Jaylen Blakes hands is good but hes trying to split two guys or three guys there you got to look down the floor and also its up to the guys down the floor FL not to stand theyve got to come running back you run as far as you can run through the ball you come to help your teammates youre getting double team three guys are in the back court that means theres three guys open in the in in the four Court here front court and they just have to keep coming back to theyre open now you see Stanford going to a little bit of their matchup Zone see if they can slow down Utah Valley Nelson off for Welling misses right at The Rim stop allows Stanford to not face a press that would have been a big BK if Utah Valley gets that one power dribble aara too Reno thought he got fouled probably did but you know what for maxim Reno go do that again duplicate that play they need him heres Stanford back in the zone see if they can keep Utah Valley off their Mark they did the last possession raino 12 and 12 defending Welling misses the reverse sellers slaps it away and sends it in with a foul that is a bad bad foul from K green thats a bad foul but thats an excellent play by osiah sers my goodness I mean Stanford had this thing I mean you Val had this lead down to six or seven and look what just happened I mean thats a really good tip out but whos around the ball jiah sers gets it takes it up and theres the hand theres the push great call by the official you know you you cant put your hands on somebody and theyre trying to protect players because youre Airborne you dont want a hand in your back I I like the call I me coach at that point you just got to let him go you dont yeah you just take you dont you just get out of the way youll take the two points it was a turnover but now if youre if youre Stanford you got a little bit of a lead but you know they havent done well with prosperity they they got to show that uh they can handle this good look inside Welling feeding Nelson car Welling pretty good passer yeah great passer but that was a Gamble and it it got burned for gambling har thought about it hell drive Grady agarwall bottoms of three well those are good shots Kevin with Stanford getting those kind of looks two guys stopping the basketball and penetration and just making the simple pass simple shot fifth made three for Stanford fifth made three for Utah Valley courtesy of Carter Welling and he can do that he can give uh Reno a little of his own medicine step out to the threepoint line and drain it thats his first made shot hes one for nine oh hes capable theres no doubt and he just he hit a big shot 12o game game Reno yeah theres a double team on the on the dribble there it is from the Baseline side agal Music again off to Utah Valley I like the way that Utah Valley and other teams so far have played Maxim Ray now but you can see this heres the threepoint shot that we saw theres a drive you draw two and thats just a simple shot but getting back to Reno if you know and hes going to get double team this year hes probably going to get Triple team does he get double off the catch or off the dribble you dont know and does he get doubled from the middle or the Baseline hes seen both this year so you got to be ready for those those double team schemes and pass out of it lard gets the screen shimmy inside with the left nicely done yeah I think as a Defender you you got to stay grounded make guys go through you the pivot has really paid off well for Utah Valley theyre very good using their pivot feet what were you saying about Stanford not doing so well with success back to 10 no its been a you know its been a challenge for Stanford the good news is theyve gotten there but they have theyve just given it up and a run out here for tulson with AAR a beat who says Ah what a block Reno yeah that was unbelievable I mean they went for the the poster shot instead of maybe the sure layup I know if he had that one do over again I might not have gone for the poster shot maybe the maybe the twopointer yeah there are going for an uppercut okara knocked it off green Chism okara here it is heres the play and he goes up for the dunk not here get that out of here this my house Stanford holding on here theyre up by 10 its he has not had monster stats but youll take his blocks youll take his ability to assist you know he gets on the glass has had some good rebounds and postups Blakes work his way inside find sellers right at The Rim Yeah I I so like to see oiah sellers just around the basket uh and they had the presence of mind to find them now theyre in the zone Kyle Smiths playing The Zone delling great shot fak and he punishes the rim Aid camman has got to stay on his feet he want to challenge out there but you cant just leave your feet and open up the floodgates that was a ftic d lead is 10 again marar good pass fake trying to Slither his way inside and he draws the foul Stanford in the bonus though I believe theyre going to say he was in the ACT anyways how about how about the pump fake in the slam you got to stay glued you cant get up off the floor just theres no help when you get beat that bad on a on a pump fake but I I like again getting back to chismo par and and what hes meant to this team especially this evening hes done this in his career he did it for Tommy Amer at Harvard as you mentioned the transfer got to the line there hes starting to get his you know his feet wet a little bit hes you know struggled a little bit from the line but I think the more you get there the better youll shoot but he did a good job there of just going through his Defender and drawing contact thats what good players learn how to do Jaylen Blakes is a master at it the second in his family to transfer from the ivy league to Stanford his sister chadima a tennis player at Dartmouth and transfer to Stanford play on the tennis team well thats thats means youre doing pretty well academically too yep Stanford switching out now theyre switching rotating out Welling couple of shots at The Rim cant hit the three AAR on the glass again thats another rebound you can see when when uh Maxims out on the floor aaro picks up the slack I know Finding agal good look inside Cara he was open momentarily Lakes setting up raino a step back he thought it was going down what a rebound agarwall sers the midi a good looking shot just didnt get it to fall but Stanford had some opportunities there to try to extend the lead going inside to Grady has the mouse in the house but couldnt take advantage now he heard him hurry to shot now Stanford no hurry I think to see if they can set get something going just to kind of salt this game at least get an extended lead here try to shorten this one a bit an illegal screen called moving moving screen you got to get set both feet have to be Set uh you cant turn into somebody and uh officials right on it good call but again Stanford every time they make a run uh you know and its early in the season but every time they make a run the good news is they get the lead the bad news is they kind of open the the door so Cal Smith and his coaching staff still searching for that consistency that maybe its Killer Instinct maybe its just discipline but uh and its also some of it its usah Valley they just dont go away theyre a very good basketball te and to your point coach they were up seven with seven minutes to go against calau and then lost by seven Nelson cant hit sers grabs Music it sers getting downhill strong take and finish I love that finish by oiah sellers I mean he used his body hes hes got ability to go up to the glass and really stretch it out there great move by sellers 15 for the former Trojan Blakes the rebound and I think Stanford can sense it a little bit now well theyve been in this position so I know Kyle Smiths standing up and not not uh ready yet and maybe you know just a basket away maybe just from kind of getting some comfort some Breathing Room couple of buckets or stops Mareno giving it away Nelson lowering his shoulder takes the contact there well jayen Blakes got the steel Kevin I mean thats another Jaylen Blake steel I mean hes just remarkable in the way he gets his hands on balls and so you think theyre going the other direction Maxim Reno gets his hands on it then turns it over so you know for every good thing that Stanford is doing theyre just trying to trying to give it right back theyre is this this is the holiday season maybe season a giving in a giving mood right now its not Christmas or Hanukkah not yet you know I mean dont can wait a couple of weeks to get in the giving season yeah I want to say Hanukkah starts on Christmas Day this year yeah that doesnt happen often but its going to be a dual celebration for a lot of folks in this area and around the world but Kyle Smith I mean hes I think he likes what his team has done but he wants just to get a little more consistent with it and hes got some some pieces that hes put together when theyve been good Kevin this year theyve been awfully good I mean not just good they theyve just dominated at times this year theyre a goodlooking team Kyle Smith has this program going in the right direction know flipping in sellers the step back fets gone a little dry both ways as yeah I think I think again theyve had some good looks but Stanford doesnt have to be in a hurry and so now youre playing you know from behind youre playing on your heels thats a good call wasnt all the way there um so you got the lead you got to really you know settle in but you dont want to give Utah Valley a chance to get this thing in single digits and then make it a three possession game the way they can knock down some shots I think fatig setting in a little bit you can see Utah Valley a little tired having been on the road Kevin thatll happen yeah and so theyre theyre a little short on their free throws if theyre a game group theyre going to win some games this year yeah thats for sure I and then you dont see Nelson I mean thats just thats thats unfortunate um but heres that press again reaped some dividends last time missed his last three free throws Nelson youre Stanford you dont need to be in a hurry you you need to get as many seconds off that clock and just try to get it in your scorers hands Blakes gets around Wells rotations defensively from the Wolverines geler tough shot Utah Valley playing the requisite defense to give themselves a chance here wa Jaylen Blakes just doesnt make it easy does he its eight pass another oh that could have gone either way thats another Jaylen Blakes uh play but oah sers Kevin how about his move how about his his lift to the basket his finished hes put his staford cardal up by 14 its a game effort from the artists formerly known as Utah Valley State back in the day Wells catch and shoot good inbounds play thats not a good in play C but thats a great inbounds play and heres the press this turned Stanford over a couple of times and they almost coaxed to travel out of gerer there great pass Denson cutting along the Bas slide from R how about R he could have pulled it out he said you know what Im going to take the two and he delivered great assist Wells missing the three agrawal the rebound but off him out of bounds theres the play up Reno and the ball did not stick in his hands that was a great look I mean he knew that his teammate was there he had to know he was there with his periphery and he got it there and the two points is uh needed two points good feel from s this is his first Collegiate game yeah amazing freshman from Washington three star recruit played well tonight yanked down by Rayo that is his 17th rebound but he has not had a big scoring game Kevin but if you can not have a big scoring game and you can go for 17 rebounds youre uh youre earning your weight double double number eight that leads the country good kick out to Stinson agaval the rebound and follow there Stanford on the glass theyre a lot bigger right now theyve got some guys long inside and thats a big offensive rebound by agarwall Ager wall in double figures with 10 oh Blakes thought he got it clean but bumped green and free throws coming up for kylin green yeah you can see really you know Kevin if youre watching this Utah Valley team when theyre fresh and theyve got their energy and you know they are difficult group to contend with theyve got guys that are quick to the basket they play well together they they did a good job I thought defensively until Stanford made their run but theyre going to get some the job done this year I think as the season goes on yeah Ill admit Ive only watched Grand Canyon in Utah Valley out of the nine wack teams but theyre picked to finish fifth in The Wack preseason poll I think can be hard pressed to find 14 better as a coach I always looked at defensive field goal percentage they hold their opponents to 42 43 now if you have a good offensive game and youre holding your opponents down you got a chance to win games and and theyre doing a good job and by the way theyre only giving up 28 rebounds as a team I mean teams arent coming in and dominating them on the on the glass theyre 39 to 28 uh on the on the glass think about that differential the problem for them today theyre only shooting 35 as you just and thats going to happen youre youre not going to be able to especially when youre tired youve been on the road youre youre a little fatigued but the stat that I like is the defensive field goal percentage and 39 to 28 you are dominating your opponents by 11 on the glass if you can use those stats to your advantage and you just have a a normal or a decent offensive night youre going to be in a position to win games talked about them winning at Murray State defeating UTEP earlier in the year by 29 well and theyve also you know theyve shown you the ability to to press watch The Press here theyre getting the the Diamond press and they wanted this travel here Im not so sure that there might not have been an extra Cha Cha Cha in there uh and so you know they they were fortunate Stanford that they got out of that one because they have turned it over a couple of times against this press by uh Utah Valley so Utah Valley is going to go back to it again probably more of a Man Press dont think they want to get a double team and then give up a wide openen layup so heres going to be a trap coming off of a picked up dribble and there it is raino knows what to do powers it down and thats why I mentioned Kevin the two on the ball gives somebody an opening and its dangerous if you go two on the ball and then and you you deny everybody else you got a guy at The Rim you give up the twoo 14 and 17 Taps the rebound out to agall there stord could start to Salt this away Blakes to the bucket we got a palindrome score 7557 theres out yeah you can see a little bit of the frustration now with Utah Valley they theyve been close they KN they were knocking on the door but here it is heres that pass great look by agal down the floor if you have your head up against the Press good things happen if you turn your back to the action you dont see your teammates down the floor youre going to get pressed and continue to get pressed Nelson at the line of course after this for Stanford they got cow ACC opener should be a fun one they do and Ill tell you if you havent seen that Cal team play and I know uh the Stanford staff has weve talked about it theyve got some depth this year theyve got some players they played Without three stars for three straight games and still found ways to win but you know Stanfords with the veteran staff you youve got guys that have uh been around the you know in the Pack 12 as coaches and Jim Shaw and uh and derck Robel and youve got guys uh you know obviously that have done the job and and um you know Steve frankowski and Wayne Hunter those guys have been around so theyll get their theyll get it together and Ali exception from raino to Stenson now wait a minute I thought he was the shooter not the dunker had some dunk and donuts great feed big fella to his teammate senson with seven points in his first Collegiate game good take by hul Jackson hul the Richard freshman I like Utah Valley continue just to play you know theyre theyre theyre hustling they really are 50 seconds to go yeah they just pull it out they dont the clocks on their side posting up raino yeah he wanted a foul call with the referee said look we got a plane to catch and here heres the the pass how about R hes throwing some diamond tonight I be be careful if youre a point guard on this team R may want your spot for a few minutes he has really been good with his assist this year uh sometimes Max seems too unselfish a player but he has really done a good job getting his teammates the ball when they needed him so his point production went down but hes he still gave his team a huge lift today huge lift with his rebounds yeah three assists as well average under assist per game each of his first two years two assists per game last year 18 per game this year Blakes could he get to 20 the snatchback rebound there for major Sullivan leading to that nice finish from Nelson yeah great finish I think youre going to see hopefully well therell be some pressing I think Stanford will try to just beat the clock and play catch I dont think theyre going to try to score theyre just going to hold it and uh good sportsmanship but you know if youre Stanford you like the Finish you like the way his team your team came back you battled back gets a game effort for Utah Valley and Stanford will take this one its a good bounce back win after their disappointing loss to Cal poy and uh they came back big in this game so Stanford snaps the
