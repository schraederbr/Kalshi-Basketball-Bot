uh neighboring Bellarmine last month last Wednesday and then a onepoint loss of the Buster against Wright State on Saturday Coach Payton trying to get his first Victory as head coach he is and again Kenny Payne is intense hes about these guys learning how to win he says that is job number one is teaching these young men how to win and no better way to do it then try to get something going here on their home court this evening Jeffrey Clark Keith Kimball and Tony chiazza are referees today App State comes in 20 you see their starting lineup Tyree Boykin is their leading scorer so far number 30 they come in off a couple of wins they played a division three school to start the season called Warren Wilson scored a School record 142 points in that game won by almost 70 and then beat North Carolina Central the solid team on Thursday in overtime and when you look at this Louisville team there is Talent here but in talking with Kenny Payne earlier today this is a talent that hasnt really won at this level as we see coming off at three Tyree Boykin knocks down the triple to start the game yeah and Boykin was highlighted in shoot around this morning for the cards they know that hes a knock down shooter knocked down four threes in each of their first two games so they know his number they recognize their scoring a building came into the game at 50 from Beyond The Arc Louisville down to five on the shot clock he turns it over a problem for the Cardinals so far this season Applause Music Boykin stops on a dime and scores and boy get off to a great start transfer from division two Union University his first action on the road in division one basketball and right now hes showing that he belongs grad student from Clarksville Tennessee the first five points of the game Music Applause Music Applause Music Brandon Huntley Hatfield had a chance for three App State coach by fourth year headman Dustin Kearns you see his record three straight winning seasons at App State came in after they have lost had eight losing seasons in a row turned it around in year one and led the Mountaineers to the NCAA tournament in his second season 2021 then Coach Kearns talked about the size and athleticism of the cards when we talked with them pregame and its going to be a concern for them throughout this entire one how do they handle that and I believe the way that they go about battling that is being able to knock down to three which is a staple of what app state has done over those three winning seasons Music traveling will be called against Donovan Gregory we talked about the Turner list for Louisville being a real problem so far this season 16 turnovers a game not a lot of assists either compared to that the only nine assists to 19 turnovers versus Wright State in their most recent onepoint loss when you think about that away the basketball and not getting opportunities is whats held them down Al Ellis who comes off a careerhigh 29 Points offensive rebound enough and in Sydney Curry and thats the most encouraging sign thus far for the cards Sydney Curry getting involved into action only three points this season and only that position third field goal attempt on the year hes a young man that really needs to be an anchor offensively and defensively for this team sliding to the rim wide open tournament Gregory Applause Gregory who was a preseason second Team all Sun Belt selection comes in averaging 11 points a game team best five assists Music Applause Music this is L Ellis a senior from Durham in his second season with the cards has taken on the leading scorer role at 21 and a half a game its at four on the shot clock and a foul and Boykin bailing out Jalen with us on that possession really an empty possession for the cause nowhere to go Withers is trying to make it play late shot clock Boykins coming in committing the foul and bailing Louisville out we talked about how Louisville has lost two onepoint games to start the season a little bit different Bellarmine really controlled the majority of the first game uh up double digits for a lot of that game luzo made a late run to lose by one but Wright State that was the game Louisville felt like they had and then a shot at the buzzer after a turnover led to the victory for the Raiders offensive foul Withers once again getting downhill but out of control picking up the offensive foul and again with App State being a much smaller team even though they are a great shot blocking team one of the ways to defend the rim is to step in to take charges so now Pearson a fifth year grad student from Chicago first year at App State comes in from Western Illinois drew that charm Music plenty of time on the shot clock here this is Gregory Boykin contested three Applause no question about it he gets a look hes going to let it fly I can appreciate that well he was the player of the year in his League last year a division two League uh out of Union universe you mentioned in Tennessee he was an AllAmerican he scored almost 1700 points there averaged 18 a game in his career so he can put the ball in the basketball well the way hes starting off this season hes got a chance as well so might be in contention for that award Baseline jumper offensive rebound for the cards and then kids that will be a trivia question not only has a player won Player of the Year in two different leagues in consecutive years but in different divisions division two I need somebody at home watching to send me the information on that releases to mentioned the Sun Belt App State picked in the middle of the pack in the Sun Belt this year seventh out of 14 teams Louisiana was picked number one Applause Music Withers has played well to start the season threepointer Mike James the offensive rebound Tapped Out to the Mountaineers long skip pass out of bounds just under 16 minutes to go first half app state with the early lead Applause thank you in the middle of that huddle with his back to you as Kenny Payne the first year head coach finished his career at Louisville in 89 came back in the early 2000s to finish his degree was part of the 86th National Title team as a freshman comes after two years with the New York Knicks and spent a long time in Kentucky prior to that hes determined to get this turned around he really is and again its its home for Kenny Payne so he has a different feeling about this place than he would anywhere else and he is determined as you mentioned to make Louisville the same successful place it was when he won a national championship in 1986 alongside Purvis Allison the greatest freshman to ever play at Louisville won the greatest freshman to ever play college basketball coach Payne they mentioned was the only coach in the country that was in the NBA draft pick and then one National Title since a player and a coach he won the title in 12 as a coach at Kentucky thats an NBA first round draft pick where he actually was drafted number 19 to the Philadelphia 76ers down to three on the shot clock Withers gets it away as the buzzer and its an air ball a shot clock violation thats one if youre Jayla Withers Just catch it and shooting Kenny Payne telling them the same thing as six foot nine he can Elevate and shoot over top of Defenders coming at him on a closeout and not knowing how much time was left on the shot clock thats one just catch and shoot and Let It Fly Louisvilles getting late into the shot clock a lot coach Payne talked about his team wanting to play with more confidence well the confidence comes from seeing the ball go through as we see davazzi Walker knocking down the three son of another Louisville break so Maki Walker whos supposed to be in the building here this evening first three in the game for tabashi Walker who averages six and a half over the first two games this season its extended into a sixpoint lead Applause James is fouled Terence harkham is first and like the attack by Mike James getting downhill trying to make something happen at the end of the day is not always about settling for jump shots you want to try to attack that pain Kenny Payne told us earlier today games are won and lost in that painted area he wants for his team to be an attack mode getting downhill not settling for three points Music freshman season in October missed the entire season a redshirt freshman from Orlando who started well this year scored 16 points against Bellarmine in the season opener one of the most the highest totals of freshmans ever scored in his first game although he misses everything on the second free throw yeah Kenny Payne just confused as I am after a guy knocks down a free throw air ball on the second one and again you were very rarely calm you know when you were talking about that see I cant do that calm talking about an Airborne free throw line that one would have kind of got me a little unraveled just confused they say a pictures worth a thousand words okay yeah well we got the picture of Kenny Payne and he was that was definitely worth one word confused Music App State to shot the ball well so far and a foul Applause trainer is first and weve talked about Louisville in the first two losses this may be the best team that theyve faced here on this floor when you consider App State and success theyve had I know they were picked seventh in the in the Sun Belt preseason Im not sure who had anything to do with that I know I didnt because Im not picking against this team to win the success that theyve had and the players that they have on the squad good action leads to an open layup for Terence harkham and also that coach on the sideline when you think about you know coach Kearns he knows what hes doing talked about the way he elevated Presbyterian of course and what hes done in this program already app state will be a good basketball team once again this season another turnover half State on the Run Xavion Brown attacks the rim scores in a foul Applause Music and make no mistake the Mountaineers are not here to just play theyre here to win and you see the attack as Brown gets downhill through the contact able to finish with the left hand off the glass you can tell theyve come into this building with a tremendous amount of confidence hey coach Carnes talk to us about the fact that hey we need to win some of these games this doesnt mean again its not about just coming in and playing and participating were here to win and they feel confident enough that they can come in here and get a win today theyve been the aggressor so far without a doubt in attack mode from the start especially on offense turning Louisville turnovers into easy baskets coach Kearns has led the Mountaineers to three straight winning seasons first time thats happened since 97 to 2000 we mentioned they had had eight straight losing Seasons before he got here thats building the program quickly and back to back post Seasons NCAA tournament after winning the conference tournament two seasons ago last year nit team so when you look at this group you know theres confidence in there it may not be the same players but at the same time as guys who were part of it in that winning culture who have now developed into playing even much bigger roles yeah to your point they lost three of their top four scores from last year but havent missed the beat starting this season brought in a lot of new players and transfers Applause once they get down to five on the shot clock Mari lands off to Miller barely grazed the iron trainer put back tipped up a couple of times Huntley Hatfield is found Applause and its a very small thing but when you look at these two teams you can tell app stays playing with much more confidence early in this game he told us he said he cant shoot the ball and be like oh boy I hope that goes in or gee I hope I can guard my man he doesnt score on me you gotta play with that confidence coming up next Armando Bay cotton number one North Carolina host Gardner Webb as the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill thatll be after were done here tonight eight oclock right here on acc Network and the ESPN app my guys WD West Durham and Dan Bonner on the call for that one in Chapel Hill what have you seen from the hills so far this year um I saw them a tale of two halves last time out Mondo baycott had one point it was in foul trouble the first half comes out scores 27 points in the second half so uh you know but I think Caleb love looks stronger he looks you know more physically capable of dishing out punishment attack in the basket of course RJ Davis will be one of the top point guards in the ACC this season I believe that is North Carolinas League to lose this year especially with all the returning talents they have back in the veteran experience so the rim and scoring aggressive take Again by Terence harkham and one of the things that were seeing from App State is the fact that you know coach Kearns talked to us about they didnt want to be a team that had to rely on the three as much as they have in the past and they have been getting the job done attacking the pain and finishing Applause Music Louisville passing it around the perimeter again and a foul a handshake Huntley his second in the game go check out of the game hes a junior Michael Eads Jr in for head coach Dustin Kearns and we mentioned that tough start oh and two first time in 23 years the cards have started Owen two if youre wondering the last 03 start happened in 1986 okay that was right after winning a national championship so thats the second year Music they went to the Great Alaska shootout and lost all three games that were checked in just an absence ninth block of the season offensive foul on Tavion Brown Music and thats a leadership play by Elle Ellis right there baby can change the tide for the cards as you see Music Ellis doing a great job recognize ball handler out of control absorbing the contact and thats what you need for your senior leaders to do is make plays like that on the defensive end of the floor to get everyone else involved oftentimes that type of effort can be contagious Applause Ellis attacks the rim and is fouled fouls piling up this is already going to put Louisville into the bonus with 12 minutes to go that one it also takes a number of the starters off the floor and foul trouble so brown leaves with two fouls Carvel t7 first sophomore first year at App State after spending two years at Northwestern State where he scored 11 points a game and shot 38 from three in fact he said had 613 pointers last year at Northwestern State so he can shoot the ball as well Ellis through two games the turnovers have been an issue but scoring has not averaging 21 and a half points per game you know and its a young man whos moving over he rarely played in the point guard position a year ago and now having to take on that role the running the offense and balancing it with when is the time to score it will be a learning curve for him as this season goes along but he is the guy that Kenny Payne is going to need to have the basketball in his hand to make decisions and make the make plays for these cars seem to be successful Dallas averaged nine points in 20 minutes a game last year mostly Off the Bench and hes the leading returning scorer for this cards team first Percy Miller just picked up a second foul and thats a big foul simply because it puts Ellis back to having to be the primary ball handler and oftentimes taking him out there scoring role and right now coach Kearns is happy with what his team has done here on the road in Louisville Kentucky Music no head coach Dustin Kearns and App State have started the season well played a division three School Warren Wilson out of Asheville North Carolina 142 points that was a program record they won that game by 64 points then they beat North Carolina Central theyve really defended the rim very well we saw absent with a block a moment ago yeah playing the doing the job defensively at The Rim but and I know many people will look at 142 points but you get some division three school but I can tell you right now its going 142 points against anyone is an impressive feat and the ball still going through the basket 50 60 times right I mean the balls got to go through the basket somehow to get that many points yeah they have 20 more assists in their opponents on the season the 17 less turnovers theyre sharing the basketball extremely well shooting almost 40 percent from three and close to 50 from the field and these are all the makings of a very good offensive team gets the roll seven points for Tyree Boykin eight out of 11 shooting perhaps state so far two out of 12 for Louisville but that shows you how good offensive team this app State team is they come on the road and still shoot the basketball very well five different players have scored for the Mountaineers so far Kamari lands at the top of the key a very highly sought after recruit Ellis a three and a foul JJ trainer his second Music time what do you see from Louisvilles offense so far what needs to improve well right now Louisville is is content to move the basketball around the perimeter theyre not getting into that painted area no one is able to beat their men off the dribble and get downhill and at some point I believe were going to have to see El Ellis just get into attack mode and start trying to break down his Defender to create opportunities for himself as well as his teammates Music Applause quick spindle Music Applause Music Off the Mark with the three for Boykin Applause Ellis clears the glass almost turns it over does turn it over loose ball to Mel Pearson and thats in play right there you jump to pass the basketball leaving yourself no other option and a foul as Boykin had a lane to the rim Withers his second Music an app state will shoot free throws the rest of the way with 10 20 left to go in the first half starting with the next foul heres Brandon Huntley Hatfield back into the game highly regarded fivestar recruit when he committed to Tennessee transferred to Louisville this past off season six foot ten hes gotten off to a good start for the cards offensively Boykin came up short Applause and the rebound to Zan Payne the coachs son and zambe spent four years at Kentucky I understand winning and picks up the offensive foul and right now Kenny Payne just trying to get someone into the game that can give them some type of positive momentum as you see Zan getting downhill lowering the shoulder but thats just a great job defensively getting yourself in legal guarding position and taking the contact knowing that the defender is going to try to get past you absorbing that contact getting the call Midway through the first half Louisville has nine points and another foul and this will put App State at the line Mike James his first crowd doesnt like all these calls but its a physical game you know earlier today in shoot around Payne talked about switching that screen and roll action and Mike James told him no were not switching it Ill fight through it comes Payne said hey are you going to fight he says I will fight through but that time he fought through a little too aggressively picking up the foul and Louisville is prepared to switch those screens if need be and if they keep picking up these fouls at some point theyre going to probably have to now Pearson is now seven out of seven from the freethrow line this season no no you did that on purpose just stating facts my friend Ellis attacks the rim kicks it out to a wide open three its good and that is L Alices game thats how whos going to have to play for this team to be successful its not him taking the shot but its also him being aggressive getting downhill creating opportunity for someone else and that shot energizes this Cardinals crowd a little bit its building seats over 22 000 this program annually amongst the nations leaders in attendance tough feet away Gregory scores nice play by Gregory and the patience to see if there was going to be a double team coming and then getting on balance off the one foot knocking down the fade away jumper Applause Curry offensive foul okay I need to see that one again that looked like a flop and again Sydney Curry is the biggest guy on the floor and so oftentimes these calls will go against him I I think that that should have gone the other direction I think that should be Sydney Curry getting the opportunity at the free throw line on that one and flopping is immediately a technical foul this year One Shot technical fast yeah and there was contact but there can be contact and a flop also Sydney Curry weighs in at 270 to Mal Pearson 225 same matchup at the other end Pearson gets the better of it biggest lead of the game Music this is Huntley Hatfield going one on one nice move to the rim off class couldnt finish rebounded by the Mountaineers jabashi Walker and those are battles that the cards are going to have to win especially when you get the basketball that deep into the paint youve got to come away with something positive whether its points or free throws tabashi Walker about one of the travel Applause foreign Applause Music Applause Music laying it up hit the rim to reset the shot clock offensive rebound and they found and I believe thats going to be another foul on Curry Music its about your sin and App State playing well doubling up the cards in their home court 12 ACC Network college football lineup and noon Eastern 73 Duke has won three straight they square off against six and four Pittsburgh who won two straight then NC State down the road and Louisville to take on the Cardinals on campus and the day is capped off by our ACC Network Prime Time matchup wait for us oh Syracuse at truest field and WinstonSalem the Yum Center is downtown in Louisville the football stadium Cardinal Stadium is on campus is about 10 minutes away Louisville has been playing well theyve won four in a row before losing in Clemson last week certainly want to kind of look at their exciting quarterback Malik Cunningham Pearson makes two 14point lead for App State on the road and right now if youre the car just simply about staying disciplined in your approach start trying to find ways to get in the painted area whether its through the post or getting LL is attacking downhill six cell run for App State Music lead on the shot clock Ellis will have to do it himself a five L Ellis splits the doubles goes down the lane lays it in no missed the shot but hell go to the line but thats what normal needs more of the problem is is coming at the end of shot clocks theyve got to find a way to be able to make this happen much earlier in the shot clock Ellis is as good as you get getting downhill finishing against much larger Defenders and has the ball handling ability to be able to get there but hes drawing so much attention on the offensive end of the floor when he has the ball in his hands remember because abstain is a fearful of anyone else on this cards team making plays off the bounce hes now four out of six from the freethrow line this season Music check out make that hes made all four of his points from the line today cuts the lead back to a dozen with 7 20 to go in the first half Applause Music three from Arkham and the rebound Tracked Down by James Music all right Music Applause Music shot clock once again winds down to 10 Music down to six Ellison the one on one again down to three Ellis from 27 barely graced the iron and out of bounds two out of state but at this point if youre gonna keep Sydney Curry on the floor playing with those two fouls he needs to get the basketball there was an opportunity right there to get the basketball inside to Curry allow him to take advantage of his matchup he did not get his hands on the basketball and the reward has to be bigger than the risk if hes going to play with two fouls here in the first half Walker 200 where is dad used to go to work samaki Walkers son has two threes today hes got six hes comfortable here in Louisville right now hes playing with a lot of confidence Music Ellis are trying to answer him he knows Music because thats one of the very few times weve seen this season someone else making a play for L Ellis its normally Ellis having to make the plays for others and for himself nice play there by James Gregory before the shot a foul whats going on Epson his second Applause Music Mike James getting downhill attacking that paint causing the help getting LL is the easiest look hes had here on this evening thus far LS shooting 38 from three in his first two games and 49 from the field played very well offensively so far as you mentioned averaging 21 and a half leading the team three and a half assists per game Withers back in the game with two fouls could it be three it is third foul on Jalen Withers but Jalen Withers is turning and looking at the bench as though he didnt commit the air thats one if youre with us and you know you have two fouls dont put yourself in a position to where youre gonna get that contact as you attack the basket its easy pull up shoot a jump shot dont try to get deeper into the painted area or play off two feet and find one of your teammates get rid of the basketball and Live to play another day foul trouble for Louisville Withers with three a host the players have two and I think thats at least two charges that number three to Mal Pearson has drawn Walker fell off the mark But Pearson the rebound pivots couldnt finish tipped up and in and right now app state is beating Louisville to all the 5050 plays offensive Rebound in the putback loose ball everything that you the coachs stat as far as the hustle points right now has gone to the Mountaineers Ellis lost it saved by harkham out of bounds for the Mountaineers another turnover talk so much about them have state offense but given the defense a tremendous amount of credit for the way theyve come in here and played on the road stifling Louisville and staying in those gaps making it difficult for the cars to get to the basket eight turnovers already for the cards who are shooting 24 from the field have four field goals and eight turnover moves Applause Gregory pulls up and scores theres a different level of confidence these two teams are playing with half States confidence is hot it is not hot but the cards here even though theyre on their home court just Kamari lands knocked out of bounds you know we had a conversation with Kenny Payne earlier today and you missed it at times he feels like his guys are hoping his shot goes and theyre wishing the shots in theyre hoping that their man doesnt score on them in comparison is going out and taking action and making shots and getting stops trying to get over the top to see some things happen in a positive manner and find some success Music feed it inside for Huntley Hatfield stolen away oh and then knocked out of bounds its tamel Pearson again with the steal on the post defense well Pierce has been special on both ends of the floor offensive and defensively his presence has been fell for the Mountaineers does a great job defending here and more importantly not allowing the defender to knock him off as Mark used his great hands to strip the basketball Ellis a long three and Pearson there again for the rebound Applause trying to extend the biggest lead of the game Applause Music wide open Walker three over the back Pearson its his first Applause Pearson App State up early on Louisville hey Peloton step into your power lets Five Points now for James app state has never trailed in this game coming to the name 20 Louisville off a positive momentum headed into halftime that can happen offensively also with some defensive stops zone defense now for Louisville Ellis has 10 points mantis another three he was well long earlier Gregory he follows it up and in timeout App State well step aside for a few moments App State leads it by 15 Music what makes for a great story a great story has magic power and every once in a while it has Miracles its an opening that sucks you in and a mindblowing ending that has you hanging on every snap thats what makes for a great story and as luck would have it thats our story Applause just over two minutes to go and El Ellis has heated up its up to 10 points yeah but hes heated up but his teams still struggling to find a way to get back into this but with Percy Miller on the floor it allows L Ellis to be able to play off the basketball and start to cut shots he is the best offensive player for this Louisville Cardinals team still trying to find that balance between win to score and when to distribute as almost half the teams points tonight Music here he is coming from off the ball lefthanded push shot hunting field follows it in but Applause but when a shot goes up Louisville should have the advantage of being able to get to those offensive rebounds hasnt been the case thus far in this first half Gregory kicks it out wide open Boykin hes out all night here come the cards in transition Ellis slices to the rim bodies hitting the floor and hey go over to App State I dont mind LL is getting out and attacking even though its a one on two one on Three situation but I would prefer to see him use his true athleticism and go over the top of the defender he has the ability to do that and mantis was on his heels backpaling thats one L Ellis can actually dunk that basketball and not only get a bucket but also get the opportunity for the free throw coming up on the final minute of the first half for the record I did find out where Jordan Cornett was and why hes not on the bracket it will be at his son swimming the state championship as a freshman this year so cant miss that as a dad you got to be there definitely not so you know the young lady by the name of Kelsey Riggs I guess its okay for her to fill in it very informative yeah I like that my people its my family heres James and an offensive foul if that is tamel Pearson youve got I mean this is at least four or five charges this young man has taken it is see that App State this is what theyre going to play you for and you see Pearson once again being that guy hes not the shot blocker on this squad so hes going to take charges hes going to step in and right now defending the but the rim very well get a double double with points and charges strong down low guess who to Mal Pearson missed it rebounded by Louisville JJ trainer clears the glass Applause Music Applause 11 turnovers in the first half for Louisville we talked about the 19 turnovers and theyre lost to right stain and right now Kenny Payne trying to figure out a way to get this back on track Music Stars Applause Music Applause Applause foreign seconds of the first half that has been controlled by the App State Mountaineers they have led right from the start they have never trailed in this game and theyve led by double figures for at least the last 10 minutes or so Music and theyll look to extend this lead which has gotten as big as 16 the hold for the final shot Applause its Donovan Gregory 10 seconds left gets going downhill to the rim shut off by Lands tough Fade Away jumper halfway down rebound to Huntley Hatfield lands one second left desperation three App State leads it by 13 at the half State looking to go to 30 on the season for the first time since 9798 25 years ago theyre halfway there Louisville regrouping in the locker room lets send it back to the studio Your Girl Kelsey Riggs Dallas cops whats her name Music the KFC Yum Center in Louisville Kentucky Louisville trying to avoid an 013 start for the first time in 36 years and you see the change for Kenny Payne getting Hershey Miller in at the point guard position to allow L Ellis to be off the basketball and become more of a score and you see him being aggressive on the first possession of the second half and this is a line that coach Payne is probably going to have to play a lot more tonight and for the remainder of this season to take advantage of Elliss scoring a building Louisville showed some signs of Life offensively towards the end of the first half Gregorys all along and he scores but two Defenders pick up Gregory and both leave him for the wide open layup under the basket just miscommunication which cant happen if youre going to try to get back into a game stolen away Gregory On The Run four on three Applause Harker midrange Jumper in and out and Sydney Curry the rebound Music at the 10minute Mark of the first half Louisville had nine points so they did finish with 25 Ellison on the three and the rebound out of bounds off of that state but inside out basketball if youre Kenny Payne you take that three you like that three Applause this the Louisville team that comes off a 19 loss season this is a very proud program that was a losing season for them last year coaching changed midseason it was their fourth losing season in the last 77 years its a very proud program this is one of the true I hate to say Blue Bloods thats because theyre red and black but theyre that level of program you also consider National Championship final fours they rank at the top the college basketball and a voracious college basketball Market in watching television the ratings they just love their college basketball here spin move Boykin flips it in and Boykin not just a shooter you can see has ability to get in the painted area make plays amongst the trees another nice finish for him Music coach Kern cited a player they had last year a player named Michael almanacy for App State who came from D2 21 was the MVP of the Sun Belt tournament a couple of years ago hes now playing pro in Portugal as Miller Missed The Three he said that was really helpful for them in recruiting Boykin who came from D2 said look we just did it with this guy we can do it with you too yeah I watched him honestly go for 17 points in the first half at Duke last year and again if I got to see somebody do that I want to sign up for it threepointer by Huntley comes up while short may have been blocked but Ella slowing it down this is one where you need to push take advantage of a transition opportunity gets going downhill for the down does just that Kenny Payne wants the cards to play faster they spent a lot of time with their conditioning in the off season he wants them to be able to exploit that in game time Applause blocked Curry comes up with a loose ball Ellis stumps it down low to Huntley Hatfield goes to work Huntley Hatfield flips it up too strong rebounded by Pearson and Huntley Hatfields had a number of those good looks hes been unable to finish right at the basket in this game Boykin its gonna dump a town load for tamel Pearson rebounded by Hershey Miller Applause Music found Applause out Music awesome his third a score would do wonders for the cars on this possession if theyre able to get this lead into single digits it would go a long way for Kenny Payne and his great staff including Danny Manning and Nolan Smith on the bench when they get there with the under 16 timeout and they can be in single digits thats an encouraging sign Manning Ann Smith in their first season here at Louisville both national champions as well turned over Gregory Music Applause Music like James sister Music and Gregory just plays at a pace and all of his own youre not going to speed him up hes strong enough to contend with much taller players but has the skill to be able to beat them off the dribble and when he doesnt beat you off the dribble he turns to back you down a very good passer a facilitator but you have a comparison for the coach has a comparison for okay for the record Dustin Kearns the head coach said hes a Draymond Green type player I did not say hes a Draymond Green hes not a 12time NBA champion or however many draymonds up to now you repeated it I heard you say it dont shoot the messenger all right I was just reporting what coach current said all right player uh he had 288 field goal attempts last year four of them with three pointers you dont hear about that very often these days thats very true and you can see he has his skill in the playmaking ability similar to a guy like a Draymond Green where you can run him as a point forward and oftentimes facilitate your offense through Gregory Ellen slept along for three and he carries it foreign Applause score the final 13 points against Wright State for the cards and right now hes on one of those runs where he can maybe put this team on his back and get them back into this game could be a oneman offensive show the rest of the way Gregory nice speed blocked oh and a foul and if its on Withers it would be a sport Music four fouls on Jalen Withers Louisville has cut into the lead theyre down by 10 Music but Jalen Withers averages 16 points per game coming in is scoreless they got a lot of basketball on that possession but thats the way things have gone for the cards in this game thus far right now theyre going to have to make their own fortune moving forward they can surround and wait for anything to happen and theyre going to have to do it without Damon Withers but the majority of this second half didnt start the second half because of battle trouble had the three fouls and only played about a minute before picking up that four and the second lead score on this team saddled with foul trouble on this one Louisvilles going to have to have someone else step up hes only played nine minutes in this game Junior from Charlotte Applause Xavion Brown at the line well off the mark on both the offensive rebound Brown attacks the rim again couldnt get it to go bullied up and out of bounds two more more and L Ellis dirt but before the first free throw ran in clapping his hand as his teammate saying box out box out app state was still able to come up with the offensive rebound just unable to finish it off Music Applause Inside Out game tough feet away jumper is good Brandon honey Hatfield in the double figures and thats the toughest opportunity that honey Hatfield has had but he was able to finish that one off missed some easy ones maybe that gets some confidence going for him first time Louisvilles been in single digits since the nine minute Mark of the first half chance to get closer here Miller on the Run Ellis wide open Applause foul smart play by Ellis I know he could have easily taken that three and he wouldnt have been wrong for taking it but stays aggressive trying to get down the hill and gets the free throw Ron allowing his team to set their defense Applause L Ellis coming up next Armando big cot and number one North Carolina host Gardner Webb at the deans home in Chapel Hill itll be right here on acc Network and the ESPN app L Ellis now has a gamehigh 16 points comes off a careerhigh 29 against Wright State over the weekend 17 points for the senior from Jerome down near Chapel Hill second year at Louisville after starting his career at Tallahassee Community College crowd coming to life 70 Run for the cards 10 on the shot clock Louisville Applause Music the momentum has swung it has that was the stop the cars needed and now they need to get a bucket here to try to continue to build that momentum and possibly Force coach Kearns to take a time out to out to a group The Mountaineers Music Applause Lance thought about the three instead its Ellis a strong rebound there by Huntley Applause absin kicks it out for harkham down the lane hangs in the air and scores a smart play by harkum right there recognizing momentum was not in their favor getting downhill using his body to score it at The Rim welcome average two points a game last year up to 14 a game in the first two this year wide open lands pushed it up there Huntley the board and you can tell land struck him with the cop has turned down what should have been a three film on the last possession down the lane laying It Up in Justin Epson just like that doublefigure lead once again for ab State Kenny Payne calling the timeout doesnt like the way things have gone here over the last couple of sessions Music so where do you think this pressure is coming from the Mountaineers have enjoyed themselves here in Louisville especially in the painted area Terence harkham getting downhill Justin absence getting downhill and right now the Mountaineers hold a 2610 Advantage points in the paint you mentioned the coach currents before the game but you saw outstated Duke last year and he said in some no uncertain terms that he was much more confident in their ability to finish around the rim today than they were at Duke last year and he told us that you know they were going to have an emphasis on driving the basketball they felt they could get to the paint and they really werent fearful of shot blockers for the cards even though they were taller more athletic team they didnt feel like they would get a lot of resistance at the rim and it hasnt been much at all here today see what kind of adjustments Louisville made out of the timeout but they end up turning it over again 14 turnovers app state has five Music just giving away possessions down by 10 Music Applause to the ramp Gregory scores again but you see that there is no fear at all for the smaller Mountaineers to be able to attack the basket they dont even look to see if theres a shot Blocker in there theyre just going and on conversely Louisvilles having a hard time even getting into the painted area after Louisville cut it to six now a 60 app state run to double the lead to the rim strong Huntley Hatfield Hundley Hatfield starting to exert himself here in the second half much needed bucket for the cards but right now when they had the game to six its no balloon back to 10 off the mark on the quick three Huntley Hatfield somehow lost the rebound it was knocked away before the shot they foul foreign Music Applause Music since halftime shooting 55 from the field after just 38 38 actually below that even in the first half but I think the shot selection and the shot quality has really improved and you can just see the difference when the Louisville offense it really has but the difference is the turnovers have really hurt the cars even when theyre making the comeback they get it to six they turn the basketball over a couple times giving the Mountaineers a great opportunity and another chance right at the basket unable to finish it for absence but the Mountaineers have gotten better shots in this game than have the cars theyve gotten shots that theyre used to making that theyre used to taking they get reps in practice taking those shots Louisville had to play a little out of character to get his looks and coaches can just tell a good shot or a bad shot its not three rattles home for Hershey Miller the son of rapper Master P whos in the house tonight dead p is in the building hes excited about seeing Hershey knocked down a big jumper to get this game to seven points and more importantly Hersey being a part of this rotation looking as though he will be relied upon and he definitely will be if he can make shots like this the nice fine from L Elvis Baseline Drive Baseline drift Kirsten Miller does a great job relocating to the spot necessary for him to be successful and I tell you what they dont sell that Louisville sweatshirt that hoodie that he has on in stores just for the record that is custom key could he afford it again thats why its custom only for Pete and the chance for Louisville to pull within five or possibly four another big possession right here still a lot of time remaining but it would do wonders for the confidence of the cards if they walk away from this possession with a bucket Music start the action with 12 on the shot clock Applause down to five down to two backed away oh they reset the shot clock questionably because I dont think out of state Ever Had The Possession Applause but in this scenario does that become a possession basically a jump ball Applause or a shot clock or a shot clock violation because again doesnt a shot clock violation have to be called within the action I dont think you can go back and retrograde so we see the shot clock reset well before yes there definitely was no possession for abstain I think thats clear and they are signaling shot clock violations Applause Music Applause which ends up being another turnover but a turnover that does not allow half state to get out easily in transition to get a bucket so right now another blown opportunity to continue to cut into this lead and put pressure on the Mountaineers but right now you would have to say Louisville does have the momentum on their side making the seven point game and they forced a timeout with the full court pressure foreign Music Applause dont forget coming up afterwards on here in Louisville Armando baycott and number one North Carolina they host Gardner Webb at the dean Zone in Chapel Hill its right here on acc Network and the ESPN app this number is one of the top contenders for not only ACC player of the year but National Player of the Year Governor Webb has gotten up attack yeah if GardnerWebb is averaging 85 and a half points per game Caroline with over a hundred their last game this is going to be a shootout I tell you right now North Carolina will not back down from a running shootout with anyone it looks like GardnerWebb is up to the challenge Louisville has trailed throughout in this game trailed by as much as 16 in the first half and have never LED app state has led right from the opening guys in large part because of Tyree Boykin who has only two points in the second half making Four Points hes got 14 for the game and nice play by Boykin there using his body going to the left hand to be able to finish and extract stretching the lead back to nine Applause Music so it looks like they found something here offensively with Miller running the point and Ellis off the ball and Huntley Hatfield has started to assert himself as well some guys besides Ella starting to step up well and they were kind of forced to do that because their second lead he scored Jalen Withers has been on the bench with foul trouble only played nine minutes in this game who comes in averaging 16 points per game but I think this is something that Kenny Payne will use often during the season to put El Ellis in a scenario where he can just go be a score now lets attacks the rim floats in rebounded by Music App State trying to put it back into double figures and this is trouble when youve got the switch and the big having the guard absent right elbow jumper rebounding by Curry cards will push app state is back in transition Applause Music the half court set right now Id love to see Cindy Curry get his hands on the basketball giving him an opportunity only one for two in this game nice feed current couldnt finish and rebounded by absent and got a great look El Ellis did the job dropped it off to the big fella just unable to finish it Louisvilles had a number of those opportunities missed Gregory attacking the ring blocks stays with the mountains Applause a few Subs into Mel Pearson along with CJ Huntley for App State and JJ Trainor whos played sparingly tonight for Louisville Kenny Payne is sticking to the rotation hes getting guys minutes trying to find someone to help someone build confidence for themselves in this game Boykin Miller clears the glass and bushes Miller another three laying off and the rebound loose on the floor hand tied up a jump ball the arrow will favor App State but if youre a cards fan youre happy to see JJ trainer getting on the floor weve seen App State all over the place on the floor scrambling hustling for loose balls we havent seen as much of that from the Cars tonight so great to see trainer getting on the floor and even though he doesnt get the basketball it changes The Possession once this ball is inbound so much talk about final male High School back in 1993 oh nice move taking it to the rim had the pass cut off Carvel t7 instead of three Applause the thirds of the rim offensive foul and if I told you who took that offensive foul I mean thats got to be six charges that young man has taken tonight he needs a nice bet well hes done a great job getting back establishing his garden position that one though I dont know Walgreens State continues to lead Louisville by nine with under eight minutes to go you take a look at the game reset what jumps off that sheet or the statue the paint points thats something you would expect for the more athletic the bigger team the Cardinals to dominate but its been all Mountaineers in this one a 3012 Advantage points in the paint and Coach Kern sold us earlier today this team he doesnt want to be identified as much by the threepointers as his teams have been over the past three seasons and right now they are showing that they can be dominant in the painted area still have the ability to shoot the three but they want to play in attack mode more so getting downhill putting pressure on other teams at The Rim last year they averaged 25 threepoint attempts a game tonight only 17 and they had taken about 70 threes in their first two games so definitely to your point theyve concentrated on attacking the rim and theyve done that with success Applause were passed out of bounds stays with App State 13 on the shot clock Applause agree leads app state with 11 harkham finals is on this and scores and right there just a miscommunication do you switch that or are you asking your Defender to fight through the screen right there LL is didnt even know that he was about to be screened Applause Gregory was 16 I should say Boykin 14 at the other end chance almost the threepoint play as James will go to the line Ellis leads Louisville with 17 Huntley Hatfield the only other double figure score with 12 four fast now on harco the only other double figure score with 12 four fast now on Parker Music Applause yeah very friendly role on the previous out of bounds play UCL Ellis getting screened but James never tells Ellis the screen is coming and then tries to switch at the last minute at that point its too late the offensive player already has the advantage misses the shot but James now out of position to be able to get the defensive rebound and an easy bucket for App State Applause Louisville continues to go between about six and 11 points behind but theyve got to make a push here with seven minutes to go starts at the defensive end it really does theyve got to find a way to get some stops and again this young man put so much pressure on your defense when we talk about Boykin and hes able to distribute huntleys able to knock down the corner three to stretch the lead back to 12 six out of 11 from three this season for Huntley James attacking the basket blocking foul it is Huntley his third Applause Music Applause James attacking the paint lowers the shoulder if that were called offensive foul I dont think they would have been wrong on that one Louisville fortunate to be able to get that one back not a shooting situation both teams with five fouls Ellis turns it over but that play its in between either you drop it off with a bounce pass or you throw it up for the lob and right there L Ellis was in between and so therefore JJ trainers going for the lob the ball sails out of bounds I think percentage is about a 10 difference in favor of App State but because of those turnovers app state has 16 more shot attempts yeah 17 turnovers for Louisville just five for the Mountaineers easy look at The Rim but couldnt finish for Carvels he said theres not a great job sealing all James not allowing him to be a defender on the shot got an easy layup missed Ellis knocks down the three and that turns out to be a fivepoint swing in favor of the cards as Ellis knocks down to three and well see if that can build some momentum for Louisville heading down the stretch under six minutes 20 points now for L Ellis Applause down to nine Applause didnt finish so now Pearson defended well by Louisville Applause wide open down low Huntley Hatfield hesitated Applause Music three from the corner its gone JJ trainers first three points of the game makes it a six point lead and trainer was confident no hesitation on that shot same way he did in practice this morning second threepointer of the season for trainer crowd on its feet Boykin rebounder James foul now Kenny Payne talk to his players earlier today about shooting the basketball quicker you can see JJ Trainor was locked and loaded as soon as the basketball touched his hand he knew it was going up and took advantage of the big opportunity for three in the corner and now Louisville has it to six this is as close as theyve been here in this second half Jayla Withers steps back into the game with his four fouls and right now looking to try to cut into this lead even more how tough is it to come in Off the Bench when youve only played nine minutes right here at crunch time its extremely tough but hes a veteran James stays with the cards now weve watched James turn down wide open threes Im shocked that he took that one but momentum is in their favor maybe hes feeling a little more confident but weve seen him turn down shots that we thought he would have taken earlier fortunate for the cars to get another shot at it Applause Ellis off the screen pops The Big Three knocks out by tamel Pearson and a good look youll take that look App State its just two of its last 10 from the field Louisville is locked down on defense oh fifth foul on Withers and I mean I know its kind of a nickel dimer but what are you doing dont buff them like that but I will say this there has been that much contact on other drives and other possessions throughout this game and again weve got a great officiating crew by Guy Jeffrey Clark of course Keith Kimball Tony shiraza it was a great group of officials but I I think that Im not sure that this is a consistent call from what weve seen at the other end of the floor throughout this game Jalen Withers not his Knight Applause Music did not score came into the game averaging 16 points and six and a half rebounds did not have a point or rebound tonight hes fouled out of the game on the back pure sin travel another opportunity for the cards despite 17 turnovers in this game have a chance to cut this to a four or even threepoint game and right now as youre Kenny Payne you want to start going with whatever your best offensive opportunities are you want to see if you can make that happen here Huntley Hatfield backing in and foul I like it I like the call because it is consistent Jeffrey crock right on top of us consistent as to what was called on the other end of the floor and I can appreciate it thats all you ever want from your officiating group is to be consistent make sure that the calls are the same on both ends of the floor Applause one and one for Huntley Hatfield his career high was 12 points at Tennessee when he played there last season he has 12 here so far he missed of the one and one Pearson the rebound their number of opportunities that Louisvilles unable to win this game they can look back to certain moments and say we had our chances right here and we did not take advantage of them Boykin pops The Big Three air ball long rebounded by Kamari lands app state has stopped scoring they have only 19 points this half Louisville trying to inch closer Ellis zigzagging down the lane off placing in 22 points for L Ellis its a fourpoint game foreign Applause recognizing hes got the bigger Defender picking up the foul but L Elvis trying to get the cars their first win on the season attacking the basket to finish these fans excited that the cards have pulled back to within four as they searched for their first victory of the season and theyre doing it behind the scoring and play making of L Ellis Well Ellis has been aggressive here in this second half getting downhill hes knocked down threes hes doing anything he possibly can to help this team pick up their first win on the year also six or six from the free throw line and you see he stepped up his production here in the second half and been more of a scorer with Percy Miller on the floor to handle the ball handling responsibilities L Ellis has had the freedom to go out and start hunting his up on opportunities Robert Lee and Corey Alexander are entire ACC Network crew with you from Louisville Kentucky the KFC Yum Center where app state has led from the start and Terence harkham the sophomore knocks down the first free throw Music led by as much as 16 the first half Music never trailed half of the Mountaineers Applause ten points for harkham absent in shot blocking presence as Pearson one of the unsung heroes of this game checks out Music offensive foul thats a tough call and Im not saying that its the wrong call its a tough call in that spot Applause coming across at a time where you need a bucket and there was contact there but also I honestly believe I have some trip on that possession Im not sure if it was over his teammate yeah she was backing up he fell over somebodys legs and made it look a lot worse nonetheless App State takes another turnover and will look to convert and extend this sixpoint lead Applause Gregory right Baseline jumper the rebound two possession game trying to pour his guys to play faster Huntley Hatfield L Ellis outside didnt want to shoot the three instead back inside high percentage look blocked out of bounds by half sin thats one of the nations leading shot blockers absent who comes into the game averaging four blocks per game big block on that possession where you thought Hunley Hatfield had a good look absom having no parts of it freshman from Pompano Beach Florida eighth blocks in his first two games Music Applause Music from back at the line Applause point that out because I talked about the consistency on one end of the floor and the call has been consistent down the stretch so let me applaud the officials for doing just that missed another one and one missed opportunity Applause two missed front ends of one and ones for Louisville here late reflected Ellis in the open court Ellis will lay it up and in Applause Brandon only half of a lot of credit for great hands with that possession and coming up with not only the turnover but the bucket blocked away Louisville has it minute 40 to go attack Ellis to the rim hes found Applause Huntley Hatfield makes baby a gamechanging play with the deflection allowing L Ellis to get out in transition for the bucket and Ellis once again in transition gets fouled and now an opportunity to make this a one possession game first of two is up and in Thursday well have the womens basketball game of the night right here on acc Network in the ESPN app Don Staley in number one South Carolina take on Clemson at Little John Coliseum both teams come in undefeated our coverage starts at six Eastern 26 points for El Ellis it is a two point game app stayed five and a half minutes without a field goal five on the shot clock Gregory in short range missed it got numbers push Huntley Hatfield clears the glass Ellis all the way to the rim and he was fouled hell go back to the line with a chance to tie the game and this is why Kenny Payne has been imploring his guys to play faster put pressure on app States defense in transition to try to build a wall and stop L Ellis hes the best athlete on the floor Music and he is starting to show that here over the final minutes Terence harkham fouls out of the game Applause 10 points Carvel T set in to replace him Applause Alice from the line is eight out of nine Music Applause last game Ellis and 29 Points a career high now hes got 27 here tonight 17 in the second half and a onepoint game and right now the cards the defensive energy has picked up and a crucial time here to get a stop game hanging in the balance app state has never trailed looking for their first Power Conference win since 2014 Gregory came up short offensive rebound shot clock did not reset five on the shot clock absent lefthanded Sky hooks up and in thats a big bucket by abson The Freshman coming up with the offensive board and taking his time going to the nice move the lefthand jump hook over the right shoulder Music Gregory unable to finish it but give absent credit the young fellas sticking to it Huntley Hatfield knocks the basketball away allowing Afton to regather his rhythm and the nice jump Hook is to increase the lead to three absent just a freshman couple big plays down the stretch Music lets reset it here both teams in the bonus Louisville in the double bonus theyll shoot two the rest of the way and apps they still will shoot one one and one with the next one the possession arrow favors Louisville app state has one time out left Louisville has two but with 35 and a half seconds remaining you do not have to go for a three on this possession now if you design something and you get a good look at a three then you take it confidently but at the same time theres more than enough time to be able to extend this game if you get it easy two and then foul to try to get out of state to line see if theyre going to make their free throws give yourself an opportunity to extend this game a little longer does it have to go through LLS here absolutely hes the guy right now who will have the basketball on his hand doesnt mean that he will take the shot but he will make the play Louisville comes out with Ellis James Miller trainer and Huntley Hatfield Music five and a half second difference between the shot clock and the game clock Ellis has 27 points can tie it with a three Applause down the lane lace it up and in 29 for L Ellis I like it now youre such a defense Kenny Payne going with the timeout now you come out with some full court pressure see if you can get a trap and a turnover first before you foul and send app state to the freethrow line Ellis rejecting the screen and then spinning using his body getting to the rim the finish and a onepoint game right now we have to remind you Louisville has lost two straight games by one point actually three if you go back to last years loss of the ACC tournament to Virginia so the cards have played tight games close games and now Kenny Payne looking to get his first win as a head coach here late in this Louisville has started Owen two for the first time in 23 years 99 2000 they even started owing three since 8687 and theyre looking to desperately get that first victory of the Kenny Payne era LLS is doing all that he can on the other side App State we mentioned they havent beaten a power five team since they beat Virginia Tech back in 2014 theyre looking for their first 30 start in 25 years for head coach Dustin Kearns what did he drop in the timeout he gets it in for Gregory shot clock is off they look to set up the Trap they get it to Boykin an excellent free throw shooter yeah you gotta foul youve got a foul finally foul with 11 seconds left Applause Boykin has not attempted a free throw tonight he is six out of six this season this will be one and one I think Louisville gave away a number of precious seconds on that one once they didnt get the turn over the backboard they should have fouled and were rolling Tyree Boykin a sixth year grad student Mystic Chancellor Lloyd to vote to win with a score final 10 seconds five seconds left Ellis with one he I dont think he got the shot away but he does score did he get it off in time I dont think he did theyll go to the monitor from the moment its a gamewinning score
