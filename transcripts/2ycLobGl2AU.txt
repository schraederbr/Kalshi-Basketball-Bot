ball at Rhode Island just hasnt played basketball here at pit so going to be a really interesting early season for the Panthers you get a look at two of the guys on the floor of course and that is Carrington and leot and it is Bob Carrington who handles in pit gets the ball first off the tap feder Rico and heres hitson on the drive a little soft stop and a score for Blake Henson gets us going tonight Wes I dont know that Ive ever seen anybody stop like that that wasnt exactly a jump stop but it worked Florida G Coast their best player is on the bench to start tonight thats Isaiah Thompson ramir barno Cyrus lari Chase Johnston Zack Anderson kesan kelman as a Princeton transfer and he gets the ball inside here on the Block this is kelman backing down on federo Long three out front off the mark and the rebound for Zack Austin a transfer from highp point who has joined this program at pit and already had an impact as well heres terrington to the basket and hell draw the foul that is Chase Johnston who stepped in front of him to draw personal number one West Florida GF Coast likes to shoot the three they fire up a lot of them so far this year they havent made a very good percentage Pat Chambers told us today that hed really like if they would score a little bit more from two but when you miss threes that allows a team like pit that wants to get out in transition to really get out and go first points for Bob Carrington as you get a look at Pat Chambers second year in Fort Meyers 208 wins in his career second free throw from Carrington is good the Freshman from Baltimore had the triple double on opening night against North Carolina entt quite a statement to begin your Pittsburgh career for Bob carington Baseline this is Anderson and hell draw fast Zack Anderson is a junior from Apopka Florida who averaged about 31 minutes a year ago and he draws Blake Hensons first and number one tonight on pit Anderson is a big guy Wes hes not a Bruiser goes about 67 205 lbs but hes a pretty good shooter hes a solid rebounder and as he showed you right there he can handle the ball a little bit Hinson is a very valuable player for this pit offense hes got be careful to stay out of early foul TR Anderson had been two of two at the free throw line before to miss there through the first couple of games hit the back end to put the Eagles on the board and both teams have started in manto man Henson long two out front and the rebound pulled away by Anderson three ball a two ball from in front is knocked down and that is largie the Sor from myar and right back the other way the Panthers answered Henson a triple and Henson likes to shoot him and the further away the better and he can really get good looks in transition Florida G Coast has got to get back in traffic Anderson kman tried to keep it alive slapped it away to Austin thats great Hands by Austin caring to wrap around inside feder Rico the catch and score boy what a pass by leged and thats what feder Rico does they dont run plays for him but he does a great job finding open spots particularly after dribble penetration are off the screen and roll early sixpoint lead here for the Panthers inside theres the dunk from kman kesan kelman is a terrific Prospect to had as you see 14 and seven against al Maria Last Friday Night in Fort Meers being the home opener for the Eagles after a road loss at Indiana started their campaign hin in a nice move hes got seven early he can be a very streaky player and you cant just play him to shoot the three he does a nice job handling the ball and scoring off the dribble had 26 against Bingington on Friday night jump hook no good from kelman youre not going to shoot feder Rico yeah and Carrington really drives the ball deep three oh Henson was standing in the script pit when he launched it I dont feel like he has a range limit I dont feel like he feels he has a range limit theres a three out front and the Eagles answer quickly and barno knocked it down yeah that was barno he hadnt been shooting at threes but he is capable and they like to get out and they like to shoot him in transition theres Carrington well not a lot of time to wait around on defense Dan the balls going up here early Baseline Drive thats largie and another one out of the corner barno has delivered back to back threes Dan after he started the season 0 for four hes got eight of the 11 points y zone defense now from the corner Austin the three feder Rico recovers and fouled on stick back and that is kelman drawing his first and the second on the Eagles pit with an early twopoint lead on FGCU and he lost four really key guys and but hes got some key guys Applause remaining Blake Henson is one of those guys who was off to a really good start with seven points here and of course cable now in his sixth year took the Panthers to the tournament last year but I I tell you the thing about it was they you know they got wins they got critical wins during the season and we were talking today with him about just the building process in the last three years let alone the first two which was so rugged to overcome in terms of just you know culture and and the things you have to do heres we are inside Off the Bench now for the Eagles and Andre Weir the 610 junr from Hollywood Florida missed the the shot and then commits a foul as Austin cleared away the rebound well theyve tried to go inside a couple of times now against feder Rico and feder Rico yeah hes a little bit thin and you can muscle him but hes does a good job maintaining his position and then its just really hard to shoot over him third foul on the Eagles in the First on Weir Franco Miller Jr from the Bahamas has come on the floor and right there at the foul line area leot drives down on the back down dribble and scores his first point so the transfer from OD is and ish Leed on the board and the Panthers have pushed it to a fourpoint lead barno Bion Johnson is also checked in transfer from Penn State on the floor for the first time and Austin got a hand on it but it was ultimately deflected away and it looked like Franco Miller was the last guy to touch it there for Pat Chambers team pther really turning up the defensive intensity Here Comes Jorge Diaz Graham into the lineup and Pat Chambers team with an intention to go to the block but so far pit has turned away the Eagles a couple of times we got feder Rico and here is Carrington the rookie ishma left open for three legot cant hit Applause it and the Eagles three out of the corner was an air ball Leed and pit on the run all the way down and knocked away and last Touch by Music FGCU Boy West you really dont have much time to get settled in on defense in a game like this lean pushing the ball very hard and its does a nice job getting by loses it out of bounds though Isaiah Thompson who is a preseason a sun choice is in the ball game and the foul was ticketed to Franco Miller itll be his first fourth on the Eagles and there is guo Diaz Graham the older of the twins from Tenerife and Canary Music Islands and so far the struggle for pit has been at the free throw line Panthers well that one goes down so this is a really big pit line up against a relatively small towarda golf Coastline Baseline layup Music and the Eagles back on the board to cut it to within three Zack Anderson with his first field goal theres Henson fighting through and hell draw another Florida G Coast foul Lee Cassell with Roger SS and Anthony eids tonight on the whistle and we talked about Zach Anderson and his ability to handle the ball and hes created a couple of baskets like that in this ball game here is Henson at the line hes got seven make it AG Dan hes going to be 24 years old on December 26 and for me and it was interesting I thought to listen to Jeff c talk about his leadership today with this team and its a different kind of leadership than what they have with jamarius Burton the last couple of years but is uh and thats because Hinson is a different kind of person you know Burton very very serious Hinson not so much this is weird going to work leftand turn nicely done Andre wes third field goal of the year and his first basket tonight long three from out on the left missed by caring and were going to get a block call as you see dalion Johnson the Junior from Boston and the transfer from Penn State colliding with guo Diaz Graham M Graham is trying to get in position but he never has both feet on the floor facing the dribbler and its the Florida Golf Coast might have a little bit better chance going inside against the he has Graham twins re they list him at 285 and the twins go back 200 and 210 theres Franco Miller run the offense yep heres Weir as Dan called it and hell draw the foul so Pat Chambers heard your strategy boner and he really liked it no I heard Pat Chambers strategy earlier today Wes that time the the previous time they allowed the Panthers allowed Weir to really go to work that time you saw they tried to double team him and he drew the foul a couple of fouls here on Jorge Diaz Graham West this Florida go Coast team is a team that plays really hard and they have hung right in there against the Applause Panthers rear hit the first missed the second now A little Applause pressure its 10sec violation yep 10sec call against Henson and the Panthers as you see Jaylen low on the floor for the first time thats the first time that the Eagles have shown that pressure and the Panthers just a little slow reacting to it C looking on at his team after their first turnover in fact the Eagles of Florida G Coast University have only turned it over once hes at Battle inside we and thats guo Diaz Graham jump shot is short here is Leed in overdrive trying to get to the rim again and knocked out of bounds itll stay with the Panthers and we mentioned Leed is a guy who has great speed he has a very aggressive offensive player low heres hence of a three left of the circle missed everything itll go out of bounds to the Eagles hon can do that Wes hell miss three or four in a row and then hell make five in a row so Blake Henson will come out of the lineup Jeff cable who talked to us earlier today about potentially trying to get to a ninan rotation and hes dipped into the depth here early Austin back on the floor he got guo Diaz Graham theres a three by Johnston thats off the mark and the rebound for will jeffris a red shirt junr from Eerie whos back on the floor this season for the Panthers after missing all of last year low on the dve beads GMO for the dunk Wes they dont really run very many plays for those big guys but all of them the Diaz Graham twins in feder Rico do a great job following the ball were the long three heres Leed open floor Step Back Off the Mark Austin tried to tap it home and I think theyre going to call the foul here on Weir here which will be his second but uh my goodness hit waits for no man low gets it to Diaz Graham for the dunk Panthers ahead they couldnt go big game hunting Dan hes got a tough schedule but they got some history of knocking off power fives well of course theyre famous as the dunk City Bunch from the NCA tournament a few years ago but what the interesting thing about them theyre playing tough opponents but theyre not playing those tough opponents to try to maneuver themselves in position for an at large bid to the NCA tournament because Im not saying its impossible but its highly unlikely that the Aon is going to get an at llarge bid the only four games they have to win are in the conference tournament thats the only way theyre getting an N tournament bit but you play in places like Pittsburgh you play in places like Indiana you set yourself you set yourself team up for tests that allows you to get better johnon kicks it to the corner three by Anderson I think kicked off the side of the glass and heres pit now Carrington back on the floor with low you see Zack Austins out there guo Diaz Graham and will Jeffers who handles in the script for pit low nice pass into the corner Austin too strong with the three Anderson ran it down did he travel with it and Lee Cassell and Roger SS he step out of bounds think he may have somebody stepped out of bounds yep hit the white line right there nice piece of officiating Applause fellas no foul just stepped out of bounds ball stays with the panther Applause low off the screen couldnt knock down the foul line jump shot fivepoint lead for pit seven of 16 from the floor man yeah well Lo has done a lot of things here in the first two games but he hasnt shot the ball Applause well thats barno inside kelman the catch and score second field go for kesan kelman kelmans another big strong guy in on the inside nice execution of the screen and roll there see the details on Pitch shooting here recently and we get a block call underneath thats going to be on barno Seventh now on Applause FGCU Henson returns for the Panther to replace will jeffris here is Zach Austin who is W for his first four at the free throw line quick reminder to you that season 4 of all access the ACC life continues Sunday unprecedented access into the lives of the student athletes coaches staff parents and fans 600 Eastern Sunday on acc Network and always streaming live for you on the ESPN app one of two for Austin kelman scores again inside thats where Florida G Coast would like to go and West the Panthers have not helped themselves from the free throw line here early in the game they were only seven for 12 well theyve had plenty of chance low fre ball got it Jaylen Low Dan thats his first three as a panther this a kid who has reputation he can shoot the three West but still getting adjusted this is only his third college game barno heres a nice match up kelman and feder Rico and kesan kelman is starting find a little bit of room inside hes got eight in the first half to lead everybody now he used his body really really well against feder Rico feder Rico 220 oh my goodness Bob Carrington and theyre going to take it off the board I think theyre going to call the kick out he kicks his leg way out there West youre absolutely right yep basket comes off the board for Carrington hell get ticketed with his first fourth on Pittsburgh and you saw Larie get around there defensively Carrington comes out well there would have been no contact had Carrington not kicked his leg out Les and thats thats the key largie was going by and the lake got it Johnston throws it up and in with the right hand Chase Johnstons first points and the Eagles to within one won has has Florida Golf Coast has been able to score more effectively theyve been able to get back and set their defense terrific drive and score by low and setting your defense only works if you prevent that kind of Drive Johnston the long three bounds away low has really kind of impacted the game here in the last couple minutes Hinson missing on the three and ramir barno the Freshman from Philadelphia is on the floor running the offense for Coach Chambers another three that bounds away that was Selman I think Panthers be okay with that kelman is not a threepoint shooter heres low again hell miss on the three BTO Rico kept it alive one dribble bounces in traffic and ishmail Le it is fouled all the way up thatll get us to a timeout Missouri City Texas freshman hes got to play freshman ramir barno out of Philadelphia Dan qu minutes here because Isaiah Thompson still coming back from a shoulder injury and and barno who came into the game averaging four points and was hitless from behind the threepoint line has answered that call in his third college game tonight and so is keishan kelman the Princeton transfer with a lot more experience under his belt obviously and kelman has done his damage mostly from the inside Florida GF Coast is two for9 from Beyond The Arc but they are 8 for 13 inside the arc and the Panthers still struggling from the free throw line theyre now seven for 13 get a look at Pat chambers of course who is a Philadelphia himself second free throw by lean here a transfer from Rhode Island with four and pressure pressure really bothered Florida Golf Coast in their game at Indiana Oh My Johnston throws up another Runner with the right hand literally literally throws it up S minutes to go in this first half third game of the year for both Applause clubs Baseline Drive Henson and well defended by Anderson there Zack Anderson at 67 well this is johnon he is noted as a threepoint shooter but hes been cold from out there there goes carington all the way to the basket goodness what a drive hes really some kind of player West very impressive looking Bob Carringtons got six to lead back to four for pit kman could not take advantage of feder Rico Anderson on the pass back to kilman swiped out of there Leed on the attack ishmail Le it winds through thats slapped out in a second chance tried to go right back to feder Rico too hot to Music handle dalion Johnson was handling momentarily out front now heres Anderson got a mismatch trying to get Applause close in the lane jump shot good for Zack Anderson had a 6in height advantage against leg it just was very patient PS couldnt get any help the Andersons got five and four and the Panthers have just committed their fourth turnover here of the first half PTO Rico tripped and fell down no fallen down here Carrington with a great job gets his head and shoulders past the defender and then Has the strength to get to the goal and here Anderson just really good patience and a pivot and he gets that shot off before feder Rico can come to help Applause Music out front this is Isaiah Thompson back on the floor for Coach Chambers Chase Johnstons had a couple Runners and one inside and the basket is good and thats Dakota rivers a 68 senior from windir Florida who ties the game with his first field goal Henson a deep three again and touched out by Rivers it will stay with the Panthers but pit is really fighting it behind the line they are now two for 12 behind the line Dan and they are eight of 12 from two in this first half these are both teams noted for their threepoint shooting not so much tonight there is Ismail lean hes got six on his second field goal he really is able to get to the Music basket Johnson thats a three missed badly Carrington ahead for Henson and hell draw the foul on the Block Rivers couldnt get set and I believe he was in the Moon even if he had but a another score the hoop for lean Le we said he likes to attack and Henson likes to attack as well you got to your the defens defender has to be set in rivers never got set at all first of two for Henson and once you get set youre allowed to youre allowed to move youre allowed to move backwards youre allowed to move laterally but he just never got set Deo Diaz Graham reports for feder Ric Blake Henson you see with 10 and stays with 10 only player in the game with double figures here in this first Music half Baseline jumper no good heres low back on the Applause floor into the corner Carrington look at here a three and Diaz Graham was trying to battle for the rebound I think Rivers is going to be called for the checkout here with under four to go thatll bring us to a timeout pit will have the basketball threepoint lead when we continue no it sure hasnt this is a team that set a School record for threepointers made last year Wes I think part of the problem Tonight is their shot selection from Beyond the threepoint Arc theyve theyve hurried the shots sometimes and Blake Hinson in particular he has taken a couple from the parking lot early in the shot clock the Panthers have had such success being able to get the ball inside but theyre not getting inside by throwing it to the post they get it inside by driving going all the way to the basket and drawing the defense and when they dont do that they get a little stagnant on offense going to get free throws as we come back this is G Mo Diaz Graham who had 12 points and a couple of Threes himself in the ball game against Bon and misses for the free throw line for the first time this year makes the yeah the struggle is real here for Music pit and the second one no Applause good theres Isaiah Thompson coming front Court hes with Chase Johnston Zack Anderson dalion Johnson and kesan kelman entry pass for kelman double team Johnson Shoots for the tie and here is Carrington trying to get pit Applause going again this is a half court offense has been where the Panthers have had Applause struggle low on the drive tough shot in the basketball wow yeah fivepoint lead Jaylen Lows got seven here in the first half hes doubled his average almost a travel by Johnson Helman putting it on the floor against guo Diaz gra nice reverse and score for kesan kelman really good Patience by kelman Jeffers was trying to get over there to double team but kelman did a nice job with the spin Dribble To Get Away Le it inside the Diaz Graham who lost it but right the low low a lefty three got it jayen low quickly to double figures two threes and two regular field goals for the rookie hes really had himself a half Wes yeah Pits got a sixpoint lead Thompson hand check and a foul and low will will draw his first and the fifth on the Panthers D showing you some versatility West taking a drive into the basket this is a very tough shot sort of a one on three and this is not a tough shot he just drives his Defender off with the dribble and then pulls up and knocks down the three for a guy who hadnt made any threes coming in he looks pretty smooth Applause yep back on the drive this is Anderson picked up against jeffris kick out and the three ball from Thompson no good and foul going to be called against lari itll be his first its two shots at the other end for pit on the double bonus here with 144 to go west coming in the Panthers are a team that has not shot the ball well from the free throw line and still still early in the season but they were only 61 coming Applause in and ish Leed is now three for five and hes got seven here in the first half seven is as big as its been for the Panthers in this first half and now its largest Advantage eightpoint lead but has really helped the Panthers to this lead West is they have been unbelievably aggressive on the defensive in the last couple times and that has helped him create some opportunities on the other end Thompson has left the floor barno back for the Eagles in the corner Johnston fires rebound for kelman skips it back to the wing johnon they move it to barno gets around low tried to get it to kilman and he couldnt hang on to it I thought it was defended pretty well wasnt it Wes thats a perfect example of what Im talking about the Panthers were scrambling around on defense a guy would get beat somebody rotate and help out and Florida G Coast eventually lost the ball carington fouled on the three and thats uh Cyrus largie this just a great job you see the Panthers rotating around everybodys sprinting after one guy or another and eventually this just wears down Florida G Coast thats a really good defensive effort so Carlton Carrington better known as bub goes to the line first to three thats the second foul on largie this is he little Bub technically he is Little Bub his dad is bub Music Carlton Carlton big Carlton I guess you would say who is a terrific coach both high school and a in the Baltimore area in fact the former Panther Jamal Artis was the beneficiary of fig Carltons coaching and there you see little Bob has worked his way to an 11point first half so you got your two freshman gone both in double figures right yeah well no Im sorry hes got nine I said 11 hes got nine Dan Lows got 10 close enough 11point game under a minute to go and the ball got knocked away itll stay with the Eagles of Pat Chambers Wes if you hadnt said anything nobody would have known I know we just try and be factual Dan if nothing else right informative and try to be as accurate as possible tell me good pressure by the Panthers heres Miller now kicking for Johnston the Deep three theres Chase Johnsons calling card thats his fifth three of the year hes got seven in the first half and about a 5second differential shot clock the game clock as we wind down this half I think that was a big basket for Florida gulf coach theyre back in their Zone leg it foul line area Jeff turn and scor will Jeff with just his fourth field goal of the year and it puts the lead to 10 and a timeout here in the final final 108 this is one of three games involving ACC schools tonight well get you caught up on the scoreboard at halftime the league is off to a terrific start 23 and5 five after yesterdays play in the nonconference calendar couple weeks away before conference play begins and theres a turnover with two seconds left Carrington from half court and the Panthers going to take a 10point lead to the locker room Dan 61 from the line and thats exactly what they were in the first half did a nice job getting to the line you have to convert though Eagles have the ball to start second half barno into the lane jump shot over Carrington and feder Rico clears it for the Panthers at the other end look at Music that 10 now for ishma Ley Wes that whole play started when feder Rico switched out defensively forced barno to stop then got a rebound and what a great pitch ahead by Carrington and we talked about how aggressive leged can be offensively and hes certainly shown that aggressiveness in transition here and the threepoint trip for Leed hes got 11 now five of seven at the free throw line after the conversion there kelman paid for it with his second foul first of the frame on Florida G Coast Anderson answer is for the Eagles Seven now for Zack Anderson on his third field goal pressure offered by coach Chambers team and Bob Carrington heres leg it lobs feder Rico the catch and flush the defense went to leg it because leget has shown the ability to get all the way to the basket and you cant leave feder Rico standing alone under the basket that is a really nice pass largy Baseline Anderson blocked and a foul Music call them really run plays for their big guys but they do look for them off penetration and F Rico just has a knack for being able to find the open spot this is a great Applause delivery fto Rico the foul his second Anderson at the line now two for three with the conversion there Zach Anderson is one of the guys that Pat Chambers talked about prior to the start of the Season he is one of the three guys who can impact our season and get us to where we want to go because of his ability to do so many things hes a 14 and2 point score through two games to lead the Eagles and six rebounds Henson cant answer with a three at the other end 11point lead now for pit and here is Anderson and got it to kelman and I believe it was blocked and then the foul called so two shots coming from kelman when you miss threes it creates some opportunities for guys to drive to the basket in early offense and that time really nice job by Anderson drawing the defense forcing Austin into the foul situation Ean kelman from Allentown Pennsylvania imagine he needed some tickets and he got one of the Applause two 11 for kelman lead is 10 for pit Le it another lob and thats Austin first field goal for Zack Austin the transfer from High Point everything built on the dribble penetration for the Panthers com a little work on fto Rico left short legged Le it all the way down the kick for Austin on the drive and a foul on the Eagles Music its Wes how many times have we seen this tonight leg it being able to do a nice job getting into the lane draws three Defenders and Austin just finds the open spot nice little L the charge was called on Zach Austin well thats his second and three quickly on pit from a team perspective here in the first two and A2 minutes Isaiah Thompson on the floor for the first time second Applause half Anderson Fall Away oh inside rear the stick back Andre Weir had some first half foul trouble with two quick ones but hes got his second field goal big big body West hes just a load for the Panthers to handle in hen Henson cant rattle the three in Now Thompson and the Eagles trying to find something offensively lead for Weir heres feder Rico double team help from Henson Johnstons three rebounded lari right back for John now were the dunk that time that Flo the Golf Coast made hit pay for all their scrambling around on defense they found some open opportunities and eventually got an easy offensive rebound and the lob for feder Rico deflected by Weir but he couldnt pull in the turnover before it goes out of bounds so it will stay with pit and an eightpoint lead for the Music Panthers heres Carrington working against largy long two got it what a nice pull up off the dribble if a guy can do that Wes hes almost impossible to defend yep hes got a smoothness about him too Dan for a young guy doesnt he yeah he does and a confidence as Applause well and the foul called and Music going to be on feder Rico I believe and thatll be the third on feder Rico and it is four now on pit Jeff taes team up 10 here and feder Rico will get a seat Wes theyre up 10 but it doesnt feel like a comfortable 10 if youre a pit fan thats right Deo Diaz Graham you see checks in theres johnon now working against ish Music Leed Baseline and theyre going to call Bass go ending on Deo they are so Johnston gets his fourth field goal hes got nine but is leats provided the power for the dunks feder Rico and Austin both the recipients here in the second half take you to the KFC Yum Center in Louisville Bucknell visits Jeff walls and the Louisville Cardinal All For You on acc Network always available on the ESPN app with Dan Bonner Wester a coverage of pit in Florida G Coast tonight and a three ball out of the timeout for Zack Austin his first triple of the year hes got five to lead pit here in the second half really nice ball movement and Carrington found a wide open Man Austin was able to step into that one lead back to 11 now for the Panthers Johnston whos been a pesy score tonight for the Eagles Anderson on the drive johnon a three good Chase Johnston from the corner Wes that was right at the end of the shot clock and he just let that go so fast he felt he wasnt going to be able to get it off maybe thats the key for him dont think about it Just Let It Go Dio Diaz Graham in the traffic back to Carrington Dio squares three off the back iron rebound for Weir got to be ready to shoot that when youre first catch it West three ball from out on the left and Austin a rebound for pit Carrington nice feet ahead the catch left it on the front rim and then slapped it away from Weir thats going to be pits ball yeah Roger As tapping his head to indicate that Diaz Graham might have slapped it off the head of Andre will youre right Dan shot clock winding down and Chase Johnson buried that one but I mean Wes he just let that go like a second baseman on a double play you know the balls in his hands and its gone yep eightpoint lead Carrington out front strong and Jeffers kept it alive good Hustle by Will Applause Jeffers legged Carrington GMO Diaz Graham and theres the drive and score for ishma Applause lean the Panthers have struggled shoot theyve struggled shooting the three but lean hadnt struggled driving that ball to the goal Tan kelman in the corner this is Isaiah Thompson for the three thp Florida G Coast just keeps hanging around yeah first points of the night for Thompson leg it again fishing around got blocked by kelman off the spin Music Applause skip for Johnston Lefty Runner and pulled away Carrington all it for low on the drive and left it short how about that rebound by Carrington Applause though this is Miller and now Thompson to work C through the double team and low reached in with seven on the shot clock thatll be the second on Jaylen low nice pressure there by Diaz Graham but Carrington Just pulls the rebound down and Wes when you get it out that quickly you can really get going down the court the Panthers didnt convert this but Carrington did a nice job turning the defensive play into offense really quickly and we get a foul called off the ball an offensive foul on kelman I believe there go screen yep third on kesan Applause kelman that ones not hard that one is not hard s of to lean in you have to be station here so wes back on the floor to spell kelman Carrington tried to go right by the big guy but Andre Weir took away the Baseline for it heres hon trying to get back on line and hes going to get fouled on the runner and Blake Hensons going to get a couple of free throws out of Music this this is really a nice Cut and a nice pass one of the few times tonight that the Panthers have tried to spread the court and make a cut to the basket as opposed to trying to attack with dribble penetration Hinson like to have that one back thats one youd like to see your big guy finish and go to the line for an and one couple free throws here for Blake Henson 10 points in the first half scoreless so far here in the second for Jeff Cables Music team and free throws too strong in the wo at the line tonight continue for the Panthers who are now 15 of 25 at the line you see dalion Johnson coming to the lineup and he replaces Franco Miller Music Jr and Henson had that one roll away boy yep nothing you do about that if youre Jeff Cap and taken away by Jeffers did a nice job defending the entry pass heres low stops and starts and scores my goodness how about that yep a dozen for jayen low its his best college game of the first three in his career here for the Panthers Johnson trying to answer air ball the three Carrington Long two did he Bank it I think he did I think he did its a three its a three for Carrington all right and a timeout youth has been served here in Pittsburgh Jaylen low and Bob Carrington two rookies in the lineup tonight for the Panthers and pit has built a 12point lead in the second half for Jeff C team Under 12 to go in this second half and Dan its been fun to watch these two rookies go tonight for the Panthers and Jaylen Lows been really good yeah the zoo may be doing its part but Jaylen low has taken on a big load here look his first two games he said he played very well in areas other than offensively didnt shoot the ball well no problem tonight you can see there 12 points on five of eight shooting of the timeout now in Pat Chambers team with Isaiah Thompson back on the floor I think this is another critical spot for this Florida Golf Coast team kelman was calling for the ball on the Block 10 on the clock Thompson the drive and got the runner tough shot five and Isaiah Thompsons second half now youre in a tight spot you need your best guy to make a play and Thompson just did out front heres low three ball off the screen of Diaz Graham too strong Thompson again now this is guy started his career at Purdue was kind of in the rotation not a main starter for painter boilers but has uh come to Florida G coast and had an impact in Pat Chambers program for sure and a Fall Away by Anderson and a foul on Henson Blake will draw his second and he is six now on Pitch and Blake Henson talking with Lee Cel about things where youre talking about Isaiah Thompson and he didnt score a lot of Purdue but he played in 96 games 10point lead for pit timeout after the hson foul we game 130 for the Senor from zionville Indiana one of the reasons is the unquestioned leader of this team right yeah and one of the reasons they went to play at Indiana was because zville is very close but he was not able to play in that game still recovering from that shoulder injury but Pat Chambers said Thompson went to him and said coach Id like to try were trying to save him for conference Applause play Anderson got one of the two so its a ninepoint game nine games of 20 or more last year for Isaiah Thompson but heres Carrington back for Pinson hell fire and hit bit of a drought from the perimeter for Blake Henson his second three of the night his first basket of the second half good ball movement and player movement and Hinson was able to step into that one back to a 12point lead for the Panthers kelman backing down Diaz Graham will draw the foul on G Mo this is really good ball you see theres nobody in the post West they spread the court and again Blake Hinson can really shoot the three its only his second tonight but again hes very streaky from out there for the foul on guo Diaz Bram gives kesan kelman a trip to the line one for two Applause and hell have a second one coming feder Rico comes back remember gotten some quick two quick fouls here in the early part of the second half so PTO Rico has been over there on the bench and kelman gets the backing kman feder Rico is a guy who can get into foul trouble West because hes so active defensively heres Carrington working against Music largy inside of 10 and now Leed left open long rebound Henson up strong Blake Hensons got pits last five strong is the word for it Wes he just muscled his way to the goal yeah 13 point lead ahead of nine to go here kelman scoop with the right hand missed everything that was interesting jeffris for Carrington now Henson tried to go right at Helman and I think it got picked away a turnover by the panther Anderson trying to get Jeffers to commit turned over and here is Leed open floor tremendous defense by jeffris W he simply would not let Anderson turn into the lane to his right hand and it ended up being a turnover 15point lead largest of the night for the Panthers Thompson back for kelman hell score 14 for kelman on his sixth field Music goal thats where get up over go ahead Dan thats where Florida Golf Coast has had their best success W theres carington back inside nice look for fto Rico feder Rico is going to set that screen and roll to the basket and you need to be conscious of that Thompson waiting for help and feder Rico going to be called for the foul this will be four now on Federico Federico the Junior from Finland and seven on pit Dan and feder Rico is a guy who could be very effective on the inside and what a pass by Carrington the Panthers comfortably ahead the ESPN app four double figure scores tonight Dan including the two freshman Carrington and Jaylen low who have Ive really enjoyed watching these guys for the first time won Im with you 100 they have been very entertaining and pit theyve got 73 points despite the fact that theyve shot the ball poorly from three and poorly from the free throw line Jeff capable has himself a very interesting team I think there is an awful lot of potential here Thompsons got six and the second one good seven for Isaiah Thompson who played for the other night uh for the first time against a Maria the Nia opponent that the the Eagles beat at home in Fort Meers he missed the Indiana game as Dan alluded to early but hes played uh played 24 minutes the other night looks like hes had a full scoop here as Carringtons three pounds away that was an open look and that was not a forced shot the Panthers again just having scored well from three and thats a defensive breakdown you havent seen too many of those tonight yep Weir has nine in the ball game now on his fourth field goal and the Eagles of Florida G Coast trying to change the tempo a little bit with some pressure mod Diaz Graham working down on Weir all the way to the basket couldnt finish couldnt get the rebound and now Isaiah Thompson and the Eagles launching a deep three thats good wow Thompson a long Music triple hes got 10 now and its an eightpoint game under six to go well they needed to respond and Thompson has remember Wes he came in the game when it looked like they really needed a spark and he gave it to him Applause carington Henson tries to answer and Music Applause do 18 for Henson now back to a double figure Advantage for the Panthers Isaiah Thompsons got all 10 in the second halfs to go as the Panthers try to get to 3 and0 before Friday nights game with Jackson Ville and then next week they go off to Brooklyn and barlay center to see Florida in the NIT tipoff Dan and Jeff cable team trying to build a little bit here but Florida G Coast is riding Isaiah Thompson to keep within Arms Reach here with five and a half to play three again from out on the left good another one for Thompson w we just showed you that graphic where he shot 39 from three at Purdue so he can shoot it out there theyre doing a nice job running plays to get him open yep 13 all in the second half and a turnover by the Panthers eightpoint game skip across to the dangerous Chase Johnston against will Jeffers and and Hinson gets the switch on Thompson Anderson against jeffris two to shoot and jeffris took it away two really good defensive plays by jeffris here in half two Diaz Graham straight away Henson tried for the battle inside finally recovered by L three here makes it very interesting West sure does Thompson Johnston for three nope were the rebound and the Music foul Dio Diaz Graham commits the foul Music Applause and we with that 265lb body just outmuscled Diaz Graham on the inside the Panthers did a really good job on the boards in the first half but Florida GF Coast has gotten their share here in the second and we talked about a threepoint basket well heres a chance for the Eagles to get a three the oldfashioned way and they do were now two of three at the line hes got 12 in the game the lead is five with under four to go I dont think this is a situation where the Panthers cant settle for a three they need to get something I think going to the basket Carrington a two and he is fouled on the Applause play and well get a timeout Eagles have drawn to as close a pit as theyve been the whole half Five Point point game when we come back in front but Isaiah Thompsons been a big reason the Florida G Coast has made this run B well hes got 13 all in the second half Wes and in addition to the fact that hes made three threes here hes done a great job moving the ball around hes got a couple of assists hes got a couple of steals he and hes done a nice job defensively he has really stabilized this team at a point where they absolutely needed it so Thompson will come back and he is now right in the neighborhood of the amount of time he played the other night against al Maria you see the Eagle Run 13 to3 in the last three and A2 for p Chambers Team B Carrington at the line after the foul on Johnston and the free throw good thats only the fourth free throw attempt of the second half for the Music Panthers he knocked both pushed it back to seven for Jeff Cel Music team harda G Coast now 51 from the floor theyve gotten good shots they made it lgy into Weir against feder Rico tap rolls in Cyrus Larie Ls one of the most effective rebounders at 6 three hes a very aggressive player good strength on the inside oh my Heavens now Im not sure if Weir commits his third thats the fifth on FGCU Wes he hes was trying to do that thats I mean feder Rico feder Rico not a good free throw shooter and this is a situation where the officials are going to review it to see if that was a flagrant foul because was he making an attempt to play the ball he just went and wrapped him up and so Roger ss Lee Cassell over for a look well West said theyre going to look and again the flagrant foul there was nothing excessive there but it certainly was unnecessary and its excessive and or unnecessary and not a legitimate attempt to play the ball and so those are the two factors theyre going to consider and theyve decided its a flagrant one foul because he did not make a legitimate attempt to play the ball and Andre Weir will will get his third well this is normally something you see at the end of the game but he just went right out there and grabbed him Wes that was a relatively easy call and its not like feder Rico is the worst free throw shooter in the world he shot 65 last year only 33 this year but hes only been to the line a couple of times it was two for eight after two misses in the first half and now two for n its of course with a flagrant one theres two shots by the person whos fouled in this case feder Rico Bank it in there you go and pit gets the Applause ball and Carrington will handle the inbounds here you see the free throw numbers tonight for the Panthers 60 18 of 30 but 23 of those were in the first half those are temps Leed squeezes inside and scores boy he is n and a half for Leed yeah he is oh my goodness I mean he can get to the basket and he doesnt need to get all the way there he does a really nice job with that little turnaround got good size now the switch and Thompson against Henson lost it on the dribble turned it over very well played by Henson moving his feet and feder Rico ahead for the dunp well he can run he can Applause run boy an ishmail Leed you know between we said this at the top between the two freshman low Carrington and then leit theyre just kind of the Sparks to the offensive system that Jeff cable wants and theres a look ahead for feder Rico in the dunk feder Rico he he knows how to run the court and leged sees him theyre looking for the big guy to run and when he does they reward him but legot has I mean legot has passed the ball well Le has driven the ball to the basket hes been pretty solid defensively and its a 10point pit lead with 224 to go Dan a year ago we talked with Jeff cable about it today there was Nelly Cummings there was jamarius Burton there was Nike Sandy it was Greg Elliot there was so many so many variables with this team and it feels like while you dont know the variables by name youre getting a lot of the same type playing personalities out of jayen low is Leed and certainly Bob Carrington and I think I think its a good sign for the Panthers that in the first couple of games they got really good offensive performances uh from the Diaz Graham twins not both in the same game but I think it was Jorge in the first game and guo in the second but now low didnt play well offensively in the first two games and against higher level competition he has performed very well tonight y again theres just lot of potential with this pit team yeah theyre going to see another ason team on Friday night in Jacksonville before Florida who played Virginia tight one the other night with Charlotte next week in Brooklyn here is Thompson eagles need a basket down 10 just ahead of two minutes to go a screen and a three that missed everything and thats Leed recovering the air air ball lob again feder Rico missed the dunk got the rebound couldnt score it kelman the rebound thats tough break for the Panthers I think feder Rico got a finger on that shot then he just sprinted down to the other end Baseline they go and a bump will be called on Carrington it will be his second and that is 10 by my count on the Panthers Music and Cyrus largie the senior from Miramar who started five games a year ago for Chambers in his first year playing in his2 career game tonight for the Eagles at the line for his third point two years ago largie averaged almost 14 points a game in the 2021 campign P I should say three years ago and then had to battle injuries in 2122 ninepoint lead with 90 seconds to go at the Pete tonight in Pittsburgh Carrington Hinson now against Johnston Blake will just turn and found legged cutting through back for Hinson and thats a deep three spins out feder Rico in pit with a fresh shot clock and a foul will be called after Henson got it back quickly to feder Rico and the big man from Finland was fouled some really nice interior passing but I am surprised that Henson didnt shoot that ball but leg it Johnny on the spot once again and look how deep that shot was of course the shot clocks running down but really nice interior pass PTO Rico misses the first P Chambers team this is not the Music last power five team theyre going to see this the second as well Eagles are playing an incredibly competitive nonconference schedule out of the Aon and kman went to the basket and had it deflected now both feder Rico and jeffris were there yep and now Leed going to wind this shot clock down as you see time winding out on the Eagles night here in Pittsburgh Le it to the basket and they go to the deck and Federicos got it and with one on the shot clock it goes down okay my Heavens my Applause Laughter Applause Heavens Carrington look at this oh my Heavens Bob Carrington and thats going to do it for pit Henson going to hold the basketball and the Panthers are going to win 86 74 Dan Florida G Coast gave him quite a test but I would say this this this pitch
