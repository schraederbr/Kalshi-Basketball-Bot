Road at Cal on the other side for Stanford their first home ACC win coming midweek against Virginia Tech they are looking to add to that home whites for the Cardinal Road blues for the whoos and it is Stanford with the first crack at it Virginia basketball is about pressure defense its about good habits with high hands short choppy steps on the close out and a double to the block they immediately throw two guys at raino make them give it up and the three ball is Good from the new starter the debutant Donovan young with his debut in the lineup in just his fourth game of the season and there is also a debutant on the other side for Virginia with isan Sharma also getting his first start the Freshman from Canada Elijah Saunders comes in as their leading scorer they also will start two freshman with Jacob Kofi on the front line to bring a little more size to that Reno matchup and a situation there right away where you see both of these coaching staff still trying to figure out the best lineups day in and day out in a the ACC and there you see young alongside Reno and then Jaylen Blakes may be one of the most improved guys in the conference the transfer from duke certainly one of the more experienced guys playing college basketball as sellers knocks down the backto back triples oah the transfer from Southern Cal enjoying the best season of his career out of Hayward California heres Andrew roie another guy better shooting this year really worked hard on that aspect of his game in the off season Second Chance opportunity there for Kofi cant get it to drop Virginia typically not an offensive rebound team they like to get back and load their defense they dont give up many or get many offensive rebounds because of it yeah in fact they they are the worst offensive rebounding team in the league the held ball here well one of the things you got to watch early Beth is weve seen Stanford knock down a couple of triples the last game that Virginia played in which was on the road at Cal they gave up the most free throw attempts theyve given up and they fouled the most they fouled they had trouble guarding the ball the emphasis for Ron Sanchez is guarding the ball keeping the ball in front keeping Stanford out of the paint yeah they are top 15 in the country in fewest fouls per game and thats rattled in by Saunders hes been on a tear six straight games and double digits and shooting better than 50 over that stretch and on the other side for Stanford you got a make Virginia make plays off the bouns 65 of their baskets are assisted they play off the pass so theyll move it and space it and make you be laate on a close out you got to be there on the catch and you got to make sure that you make them put it on the ground blaks the rear turnover hes fifth best in the ACC is assist to turnover ratio Jaylen Blakes has already been to a final four and an elite eight as a transfer from duke so he has some winning experience Sharma in his first career start bounced that one off a teammates Music knee all five on the perimeter including the big fow the 7 foot one Reno tries the three offensive rebound for agarwall 71 moves like a guard guard likee skills and really tough check hes plan a and plan B on top of the report is dealing with Maxim R now Ryan nice off the drive there hes playing with a lot of confidence now his 10th straight game in the starting lineup for Stanford Virginia has opened up the ball game one for four from the floor Virginias going to hit you with a lot of screens and thats the one guy that you have to have a high hand on on a catch Isaac mcney the best threepoint shooter by percentage in the ACC third makes in the league thats a big start for him he was just one for eight from the floor in the Coss on Wednesday well hes very much a catch and shoot and he sets a flare on the opposite side then he comes off another screen it is constant motion for Isaac mcne hes one of the best in the league without the ball trying to get a paint touch inside for Reno denied right now by Blake Buchanan at 611 off the Virginia bench I mean look at the weak side help Beth okay they got two guys on the weak side with four feet in the paint thats part of the pack line transition three and its knocked in by Sharma had three of them in the cow game midweek scored nine points in 25 minutes so he earns the start today and its a 60 Virginia run on theore tie ball game eight scoring coming from outside for Virginia a couple of triples from Sharma and mcney well mcney does such a good job being ready off the screen with his footwork and then an advanced pass and transition charma The Freshman getting his first start knocking it down from Deep both teams have made a couple of Threes here you see Ron Sanchez a longtime assistant coach for Tony Bennett and when Tony announced his retirement in October Sanchez named the inim so coaching and hoping to possibly extend his stay I know everybody says Tony Bennett has retired from Virginia Im not using the word retired I dont know I just got retired from Virginia perhaps not from basketball Im saying reinstated somewhere reassigned were not sure where Tony Bennett is going to end up yet but I I do believe theres a reassignment coming of his doing yes at the age of 55 may still have a lot of basketball left in them Reno with a nice feed from Blakes theyve become a really good combo the playmaker and the big time scorer at over 20 a night roie trying to back in the defender keeps that dribble alive mcel never stop moving gets his second triple constant motion without the ball for Isaac and hes coming off a game where he had one basket outside the arc he had three points in the last game so hes already topped that here on the road today at Stanford and Virginias hit its last four shots sellers nice drive Scoops it up and in got to have some help from the weak side on that penetration I just had spent some time talking about that weak side with feet in the paint helping out on the weak side in Virginias defense about five straight buckets for Virginia that one from Saunders they had a terrific start against Cal on Wednesday and then tapered off and the Bears came back to win that one so can the waho put together a full 40 minutes here today on the road nice back door cut young and a terrific find from Reno thats one thing you got to appreciate about 71 Ive mentioned his guard likee skills but he sees the floor so well and hes a willing passer and also a disruptive Defender as he bothers Saunders there hes good right here shooting the trail three also he can pick and long roll pick and short roll he can pick and Pop theres nothing that he cannot do r no is that skilled Pro Scouts have taken notice theres a handful of them here in the building today Blakes lost his footing tough shot and here comes Applause mcney oh nobody picked him up hell dish to roie instead found the open look Virginia hot from Deep really unselfish play Stamford doesnt get matched up quick enough Virginia will send Five Guys to the defensive glass and when the guards rebound they dont need an outlet four triples from three different guys meanwhile Stanford effective here early Debbie off the bounce thats Ager wall really nice take backto back buckets at The Rim Virginias got to tighten up that packline defense talk to Kyle Smith pregame he was adamant theyve got to get paint touches whether thats to the big fella or off the bounce Sharma another triple for Virginia five of six to start the day I love offense Im good with this baskets going in like six of eight shots thats incredible seven of eight Music Reno buan and trying to push him out towards that line nice back door nice delivery inside UVA knocking down triples in transition while Stanfords attacking the rim really good hustle right here by Buchanan to keep that ball alive and then Sharma to step into his second triple looking pretty good for getting this first start number nine in blue so theyve hit five of six3 Stanford has hit seven of 10 twos to open up and Buchanan going to be whistled for the foul along that front line they can go 611 610 they can bring another 610 Off the Bench trying to deal with raino its a threepoint Virginia lead Music and we welcome you to the farm here at Stanford the Cardinal and the Virginia Cavaliers ACC matchup Beth Mullen alongside the Nay Smith Hall of Famer Debbie Antonelli we got a threepoint ball game eight minutes in Stanford scoring inside Virginia scoring outside to open things up today Virginia five for six from the threepoint line their threes have come in transition playing Inside Out off offensive rebounds and Stanford has attacked the paint theyve been off the bounce theyve been able to get inside this is Isaac mcney moving without the basketball that is one of his strengths hes got the best percentage in the ACC right now and here he is knocking down his second triple really good ball Movement by the Cavaliers early and good job taking the first available shot in transition in Rhythm Jaylen Blakes at the free throw line able to get a pair Maxim Reno number 42 in white Beth this year right now leads the ACC in scoring and rebound in he is a 71 build with a guard likee skill set coach Kyle Smith can put him anywhere on the floor and he can be productive on both ends of the floor from Paris originally not highly recruited and the development has been spectacular you know theyve been playing basketball in the ACC since uh the 1950s 71 years I believe Debbie only 13 times has a guy led the league in both scoring and rebounding and Reno trying to do that trying to fight off Cooper flag perhaps for that honor the player of the year hes certainly in the conversation right now theres no question about it Stanford by the way has never in their Pack 12 years had a guy lead in both statistical categories hes 71 hes 244 he moves like a guard hes a great communicator yesterday in practice r no had had the loudest voice on the court they all speak about what a great teammate he is and hes got that kind of range as well missed on the first its tack back out to him hes a 37 shooter from downtown heres Benny geler both teams with experience in starting a lot of different guys theyve been searching to find the right lineups r missed a couple of shots on that possession Jacob Kofi the 610 freshman for Virginia did a good job closing the space and Blakes who leads the team at steals comes up with an emotional play right there for maybe this crowd to get him off their seat a little bit fourth in the ACC and Steels took that one away from roie its been a very well played clean basketball game oh almost came up with another steal instead its a reach in foul but heres blak this is what you want out of your point guard Beth on the top of the floor hes fantastic at generating his own offense he leads the team in assist steals hes got the best assist turnover ratio and he is one of the most improved players in the ACC two points last year to 15 this year how about 13o Improvement he had 17 Wednesday against Virginia Tech amongst the power four leagues that is the second best Improvement in the country for Jaylen Blakes the transfer from duke where he spent three years Kofi with a nice drive lays it up and in thats 610 stepping around sers who was setting himself up to draw a charge he started the last five the Washington High School Player of the Year sers Corner three good Josiah sers transfer from USC its been a couple of years there he is a fantastic threepoint shooter hes almost a 5040 80 guy 50 field goal 43 80 free throw Kofi tough shot good defense that time from Talis Tade the 611 freshman Off the Bench I think Stanford has better depth Than People realize Kyle Smith has uh the ability to generate a change in Rhythm of the game when he goes to his bench oara heres a guy he can bring in Off the Bench who also has starting experience and a whistle before the shot AJ Desai Trey San and Jason garrettson are officiating crew today if youre just joining us already two ties and eight lead changes a good back and fourth Affair here at Stanford its always good to see Trey stons its a great reminder of Ry St one of the long time officials in the history of the ACC 17 years in the NCAA tournament more than 20 years working in the league and his dad uh passed in the off season to a heart attack so its always great to see Trey its always a good reminder of how much we loved and missed his dad thats going to stay at this end of the floor Trey would be the uh official inbounding the ball you see that heart on his sleeve carries his dad with him all the time his dad was one of his great influences and Inspirations in his own career and many officials that work in college basketball dealer the inbounder had an open look couldnt knock it down here comes Sharma the other way Music mcney got to stay on him defensively their top threepoint threat heres tane Murray who started the game midweek now coming off the bench today five on the shot clock for Virginia Murray off the bounce and a foul with one second on the shot clock dealer coming over to try and help I mean it is a staple and part of the culture of Virginias offense is That You Dont See panic in a late clock situation its a mature group of guys they drill this way theyre ready to move the ball and attack off the bouns its just a really good job by Taye Murray who started the last couple of games coming off the bench tonight today 65 senior from New Zealand for Virginia trying to make amends for what has been a really rough start on the road this season much better at home also a tough schedule four losses to ranked opponents and its been a a problem at both ends of the floor when theyve been away from home just one and six this year an 0 and three and true Ries Virginia is always to me an acquired taste you got to really understand the game and appreciate the way they play how connected they are and how much toughness in competing matter it certainly matters to Ron Sanchez its what he said more than anything yesterday in practice tworay Baseline got up in the air and batted out of bounds by Anthony Robinson raino will come back on also noteworthy for a 7 foot one in guy he is fifth in the ACC in minutes so his conditioning is there his work in the weight room spe spacular hes must see I mean and hes a computer science with a minor and math major here at Stanford come on hes the whole package Kyle Smith says I dont know if hes going to be the MVP in terms of player but hes our MVP in terms of most valuable person to he called him the most talented person hes been around AAR after the turnover and a foul off the ball drawn by the big guy Anthony Robinson a couple of early fouls onepoint ball game here at Music Stanford ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by McDonalds beautiful day here at Stanford the Cardinal up one on Virginia and our back and forth first half under eight to go and how about the measurables for maxim Debbie this is what a lot of the INB NBA guys look at when you go to the combine so his standing reach is 9 3 in his vertical would be jumping off two feet straight up for a 7 foot one guy 27 in I think is excellent and his approach vertical would be a running start and then the dumbbell press thats two 100 lb dumbbells in each hand different than the bar PR press according to Michael Robinson who is the strength and conditioning coach here for the Stanford mens basketball program Virginias been done a good job of keeping him quiet so far hes just one of five shooting here he is with the tip up and in right on Q offensive rebound and stick back theres that 9 3 in reach with a little bit of a jump not quite 27 in on that one that was that was between two and seven in on the vertical terrific Talent out of Paris who spent his summer practicing against the French Olympic team you know theres a lot of conversation about Cooper flag against the USA team how about you know practicing how about Rayo practice him with a French national team who if you recall Steph Curry had a bunch of shots to help the United States win that go metal moment for the French national team how fantastic is that when you look back on that graphic we showed about his development over the years and you think about his incredible upside its amazing what this young mans going to be able to accomplish in his basketball career made that shot for mcney a little tougher okara Reno got away from the defender for the jam they threw a double at the other guy and Maxim went the other way well Virginias not activated on the weak side and you know theyre going to double the block this is a good timeout by Ron Sanchez no field goals in the last three minutes for Virgin fivepoint Advantage for the Cardinal that last bucket for Reno and the Improvement how about this year in and year out Debbie I mean its amazing when you stay in the gym you work Player Development you stay around a similar system and you make yourself better I mean you cant wish that youre going to become better you got to work at it and he loves the weight room also besides the skill set on the floor averaging 20 points 11 rebounds per game to lead the ACC when you came into the gym for practice at Stanford its his voice you hear more than any other players its the sign of a good leader when your best player is your hardest worker and your loudest voice in the gym off the bounce and the kick out okara hell try the Baseline five on the shot clock agarwall checks it Blakes will have to heave offensive rebound Reno with the right hand so Ron Sanchez calls that timeout to talk defense and they get a stop besides giving up the offensive rebound so for 30 seconds they did a good job but theres Reno thats the difference hes 71 at The Rim they have the worst rebounding margin in the ACC raino taking advantage of it there heres Saunders McNeely will try for three hes already got a couple and knocks down another to end the drought W Reno sees a big fat rim on one end of the floor mcney sees no Rim thats all net six of nine for UVA here in the first half and their defense forces the turnover watch sers right here youve got to stay in front you cant guard that much better you know that McNeely likes to pull up for three so you got to come with that long close out and make him dribble into his shot which sellers did so kyp know your personnel I would say sellers did a pretty good job MCN is just the best threepoint shooter in the leag boy after he really struggled against C is back to form here today well he knows his teammates need him he cant hesitate oh nice ball fake there short and its tipped back out to Virginia theyll get another try I think there was a miscue on the shot clock reset theyre going to go back to 20 maybe take two seconds off they didnt call that a change of possession they did they did call that a change of possession so 27 on the shot CL long time assistant with Tony Bennett now Ron Sanchez taking over as the interim after he replaced Tony in October has had a brief stint as a head coach Kofi and one and a foul on Reno that is a welldesigned play by Ron s Sanchez youve got the ball side flooded with offensive players and you go naked side pick and roll right here you got no help this is oneonone if you pinch off that shooter in the slot hes going to pass it for the three this is very well designed nice clear Applause out trying to get things figured out on the road is Virginia and Ron the head coaching stint for him was at Charlotte before returning to Virginia a couple of years ago as an associate head coach and a run that started back in the late 90s at Sunni Onan in Upstate New York a state school shout out to the Golden Valley Sports Camp up there where many of good hoopsters spent their Summers we knew Syracuse was going to pop in somehow taken away by agarwall Blakes is the one that triggered that now hes calling for it hes got it geler three thats good for Benny r no doesnt Force anything Bethy lets The Game come to him right he hes yet to really assert himself here and his team has a fourpoint lead both teams shooting 50 Debbie in Virginia has assisted on seven of their 10 buckets roie will go it himself Reno help comes finds an open man look at the ball movement all the way back around to agar wall that is beautiful Applause and in practice yesterday Kyle Smith and his staff spent time working on Reno getting doubled on the Block at 7 one its easy to see over the top of that double mcne now has missed a couple in a row from deep under two and a half to go and Stanford looking for a little breathing room to head into the locker room up far Saunders made it tough good defense and now isan Music charma Saunders wide open mcney roie takes it inside the lane it was a tough pass to handle so he was able to make the most of it for you never make a shooter drop their hands you got to pass it in the pocket fortunately Ro mate was able to make a play out of it Reno will head to the free throw line he knows he doesnt get a double in the middle third and its oneonone and watch the ball movement of Stanford out of the double youre late youre late youre really late but it Cardinal in 3530 with the ball movement this is how you play out of the double you want to welcome two to the ball they throw it to Reno knowing he Virginia doubles the post and they bring post to poost help this is excellent coaching preparation spacing and unselfish ball Movement by Stanford its really well done everybody gets a touch Stanford shooting 50 in this first half eight assists theyve only turned it over a couple of times Virginia 6 for 11 from downtown thats one shy of their best threepoint shooting half of the Season that is what has been keeping them in it now you you see Kyle Smith over there with Jim Shaw Jim Shaw is sort of his defensive coordinator we didnt see any Zone in the first half but I guarantee you were going to see it in the second half because Kyle Smith is a master at the 131 back into the 23 matchup and Jim Shaw has brought that defense to Kyle Smiths scouting right his report they call it the shamble after Jim Shaw the shamble brought his whole staff with him from Washington State thats an excellent basketball mind right there Jim Shaw turnover to Stanford Blakes and then Reno sends that one into the front rope back to back turnovers 18 points in the paint for Stanford has been the difference all part of the game plan for Kyle Smith to get touches in the paint if not for Reno then off the dribble and theyve been effective in that category as Kofi finds a shooter outside around and out no Reno good box the rebound really nice job boxing out by Donovan young 10 points five boards for the leading scorer and rebounder in the ACC hes only been out for one minute in this first half McNeely looks like hes going to go the full 20 for Virginia well he plays 34 minutes a game hes capable and built for it final seconds of this first half Roy nice play by Blakes to jump into the passing Lane good if it goes got it off the bank and he celebrates off the floor Hands Held High into the locker room for jayen Lakes officials to the scores table to make sure the floor the call the floor is a good but it looks good from every perspective and its a Music triple he might have been the most surprised guy in the building and that puts Stanford in front by 10 at the half six after riew confir the sh Stanford up in the paint and also off of six turnovers Stanford was able to score 12 points and Reno on Pace for yet another double double his 12 double doubles in 15 games leads the nation and by far the most in the ACC as he continues on a quest for Player of the Year honors and Stanford opens up the second half the way they ended the First with a triple I dont even think Maxine Reno has inserted himself in the game yet I mean think hes just doing what he can to help his team win hes not selfish he has a certain maturity about the way he plays they havent really you know used him uh in their pick and roll game except for On the Block to draw two and then play out of it really well balanced offensively here is the double he immediately spins to fire week side good box out that time for Virginia they were led by Isaac McNeals nine points in the first half three of those triples what makes Reno so challenging is hes getting all those hockey assists right now right hes making the pass that leads to the pass to the open shooter and theres nothing selfish about the way he plays we were talking in the first half about how hes got the loudest voice in practice what a good teammate he is you see him encouraging all the time really fun to watch boy in this possession won by Donovan young for Stanford in his first career start playing in just his fourth game bouncing back from a high school ACL injury he got down on the deck right there to get the ball for the card and here he is number two in white Reno open look for three and thats going to be a foul on the rebound against Virginia out rebounded 17 12 in that first half you know theyre going to call Sharma for the foul and on the last possession he face guarded the rebounder so was giving up himself for his teammates to get the rebound this time he gets called for a foul doing a similar thing and before the shot from Young another foul whistled against Virginia I believe that was Saunders holding up young and that is the third now on Elijah Saunders he moved ahead of mcne as the leading score after the cow game but he really hasnt been able to get going Reno going to work and three quick whistles against one of the teams in the ACC that fouls the fewest this is what got Virginia in trouble in the second half debb midweek at Cal when the Bears went to the free throw line 33 times and May 27 of them Virginia committed 23 fouls in that game both were season highs for Virginias defense and uh R know was going to Euro around to draw that foul it was very nice footwork by 7 one and you know this is a good free throw shooting team in Stanford so getting in the early bonus would be a a way for them to se uh separate from Virginia 69 at the line this year for Maxine and he now has 12 points six rebounds this is the largest lead now at 15 of the day well Virginias got a really dig in right here they run their stuff theres plenty of time thats what MCN needs to do beth when they come with that long close out when he works off that screening angle and he does not have space he has got to put it on the floor and punish that long close out nobody lets Isaac mcney breathe you got to be all up in his shirt mcne keeping the dribble alive and theres two quick fouls drawn by Isaac because he put it on the floor and was aggressive now he started the game being aggressive hunting his shot in the first half hes got to be aggressive right here hes going to go to the free throw line and ironically hes not a great free throw shooter less than 68 its kind of shocking Junior from West Virginia fourth in the league in minutes played weve talked about how terrific he is from outside the threepoint line now trying to dial it in from 15 ft I dont get it how he s it down its kind of odd one for two theyll get another possession and rattle in a three thats a fourpoint play for Virginia thats how you can get some momentum and get back in it its the K State transfer DayDay Ames sophomore out of Chicago he was in the starting lineup earlier this year Reno with one defender on him in the middle of the floor missed it and then two Cavaliers fought for the rebound and knocked it out Maxim now four of 10 from the floor he shoots 51 from the floor on the season thats pretty good for a big here comes the double from Buchanan hes able to see over the top of it at 71 sellers swooping in no an encouraging defensive set there for Virginia Sanchez wants him to push it a little bit and Ames does just that and gets to the Applause rim Virginias not a team that is built to play from behind so this is a really important stretch right here cuz they dont want to have to press too early and open up the floor for Blakes and Reno Rand took that one away from Kofi and sticks it back up and Music in hes got 14 there will be a time to speed up the game but its not yet for Virginia mcney Sellers goes over the top good slip he ghosts that screen right there which means he goes like hes going to set it and then slips past it nice feed good dish inside to BU Canon on the roll now this is the way McNeely started the first half Beth being aggressive assertive hes got two fouls on the defense and he makes a nice play right there hes drawing a lot of attention now hes got to continue to be a Music playmaker Blakes looks for three and he hits it I tell you what this is a well prepared Scout by Kyle Smiths team to be ready for the way Virginias going to play defense great understanding of the double post to post the high hands on a hard hedge on ball screen offense they havent run a lot of ball screen stuff unless its late in the clock so theyve done an excellent job of beating Virginia at its own game if you will being patient and methodical on the offensive end this time now switch on mcney good he gets it back oh they lost him that was the youngster young got caught behind the screen and mcney buries it thats an excellent screen right there good fade behind that flare Reno gets a touch immediately the double comes and the dive to the bucket for Donovan young and a foul Applause the misu at one end amends at the other Maxim Reno looking at the crowd saying lets go through the double the dive the foul and and one when we come back 11point lead by the Cardinals watch right here freeze on this trap right here look at this great Trap by Virginia but what rno does is he stretches the Trap and escapes dribble away from the basket DayDay Ames is supposed to be the low man on the eye to tag the dive instead the lane is wide open Virginia doesnt rotate properly out of the double team and that allows the basket to be open for Donovan who knocks down that free throw Donovan Young making first start today eight points for him in 14 minutes mcney spins away from Benny geler and hits midrange so capable so skilled so compact in his skill set right I mean hes got tight handle hes tight off screens he works really hard on this end of the floor as well does Isaac mcney similar to the way they started the ball game theyve hit five of their first six shots to open up the second half but they need some stops at this end Blakes unattended and they get one there down by as many as 15 early in the half now trying to Chip Away McNeely three raino corals it but theyre going to get the foul on the box Music out thats the third foul on oiah sellers Music and another whistle off the ball lets see who they tag here thats the second on Reno Saunders called for the walk as we uh open up this second half debut were also trying to get eyes on Andrew roie who is a Virginia starter played 17 minutes in the first half uh but he has not yet been on the floor and it and we dont see him on the Virginia bench either well try and see if we can get a little more info there in the meantime they have stayed even with Stanford in this second half until right here Aiden camman the red shirt freshman from Andover Mass will head to the line and a couple of free throws coming up for Aiden a 50 shooter hey heres our next womens college hoop Sunday afternoon double header for you on ESPN DEA powpow number two South Carolina the defending national champs take on Texas and well follow that up with NC State and Stanford Debbie and I get a double dip here on the farm you mean were staying in Palo Alto for another absolutely its pretty sweet swing out here yeah that Texas South Carolina game might a final four preview those two are couple of the top contenders I would tell you right now those are two of my final four teams and they played twice in the so this is the first one for us fans to enjoy I dont know how much fun da Staley and Vic schaer are going to have but thats an interesting matchup between those two foul here on the drive McNeely much more aggressive with his dribble drawing fouls in this second half and we see if this is good news for Virginia Ro is at least back out near the bench and hopefully for the Wahoos hell be able to return shortly Saunders off the Miss fight for the loose ball its a hell ball will stay with the Cavs good Hustle by Kofi but Saunders has got to finish that around the rim he catches the ball with two feet at the rim and you see roie looks like theres something on his left hand good sign to see him back on the bench also getting some fluids and a little something to eat you know theres a lot of talk about the travel for Stanford and Cal heading west but theres also something to be said for these ACC teams that have to come out now to play Stanford and Cal camon terrific feed from Music agarwall and the adjustments that teams have to make right academics practice time did you say did you say academics that matters in college sports sure does okay especially if youre on the farm of the grounds yeah well thats true collision and theyre going to get a blocking foul on Blakes thats his second and it looks like Blakes may have to come out of the game he was calling for the other point guard sellers to come on here limping a little bit as he heads over may just be a charlie horse looks like Andrew R is going to get back in the game so looks like hes refueled and ready to go he has a according to the Virginia bench he has an illness um must have been a halftime issue but he looks like hes going to give it a go its going to be a foul on Geller trying to hold on to McNeely thatll be the third on Benny and so uh after a relatively quiet free throw shooting first half things appear headed in a different direction here in the second Virginia trying to and a 2 and 12 minute drought and mcy hits the front end Isaac now with 15 couple of rebounds couple of assists and he leads all scorers here this afternoon power mcney will check out TJ power the Duke transfer is in yeah I dont think mcne is going to be over there very long just a quick rest a good time to rest him waiting on the next medum a timeout hes been the most uh efficient and hes been their best player here in the second half and I think this is the first break hes taken so far today another nice pick and roll same result with a free throw added Ager wall to Aiden camman ball pressure and communication T Murray is the low man on the eye hes supposed to absorb AB that dive late and a foul this could be 60 points and we still have 12 and 1 12 minutes to go its a good lesson for everyone watching if youre a weak side Defender you need to be ready to make a play there are opportunities on the weak side defensively to make a play if youre engaged and ready Cavaliers who for years under Tony Bennett the calling card was the defense they gave up 75 points Wednesday at Cal and Stanford trying to push that number even higher here today thats the 10th Virginia turnover out of that short Corner along the Baseline and sers whos enjoying a career year hits for two more hes into double digits foul on the drive Saunders free throws coming when we come back Stanford in front quarter but they put him to work today Debbie there is Isaac just a second ago tossing tshirts into the crowd and leading them in their cheers what a moment for a young Stanford fan to remember for a lifetime absolutely amazing all you need to know about Maxim is how about the team how about his interview skills that was that was pretty spe hes got a lot of basketball in front of him before he takes our job yeah yeah hell be playing a while well be retired by then not not Tony Bennett retired totally totally retired reassignment on our own ree assignment on her own speaking of Tony Bennett I want to tell you this story about Tony while my Tony BETs first year at Virginia in 2010 in January they go over to Chapel Hill and they play and he wins he beats North Carolina Im the reporter getting ready to do the postgame interview Im waiting for him as he goes to the handshake line when he comes to me as Virginia changes up their defense here as he comes towards me I say say Tony congrats on the win big win in Chapel Hill over the Tar Heels first thing out of his mouth to me is did our women win today Debbie Ryan had a really big game that day at Virginia the head coach at UVA I said no they actually didnt win he said oh and then he did the interview and I was like thats all you need to know about Tony Bennett what a company guy what a team team first school first I like the switch in defense by UVA one possession although resulted in a three they they match it at the other end with Saunders 15point lead for the Cardinal shot clock winding down geler going to work mishandled initially aara has to Jack and he hits Applause it 28 8 threepoint shooter and Stanford now has hit five shots in a row their biggest lead and an and

spends a lot of time in the gym you can tell power TJ gets it back 16 footer and a foul committed by Blakes on the shot and that will be his third TJ to the line substitutions coming in for Virginia

Monday night no Reno tried to tip weak Music side good job by deer not giving any space to McNeely pass picked off four on two numbers for the card oara the distance for the laye Music hes got five taking that Coast to Coast sellers off the ball with a foul well speaking of Los Angeles and the wild Stanfords ball movement and ability to play and make the defense wrong they have done that all game when they have put Reno on the Block you know Virginia doubles they play out of that when Reno not on the floor they play through the middle third and just slice up the Virginia Defense its a Well executed game plan by head coach Kyle Smith already more paint points than they average per game still got almost eight minutes to go and for Virginia defensively 75 points given up in the cow loss Wednesday Stanford is nearing that number two opponents have already scored 80 or more on them St Johns and Florida well theyve theyve played a tough schedule right me they have played a really challenging nonconference schedule theyve played five teams that theyve lost to theyre in the top team they got a good win against Villanova because Villanova is playing much better big game today in the garden tonight against St Johns 17 for Isaac uh mcne leading the way for the Cavs the three in double digits for Stan Stanford so far led by REO was near a double double sorry Beth uh the balance for Stanford is evident right and Renos unselfishness makes this team really unique and special I mean you got the best scorer and rebounder in the league and hes a willing passer and he doesnt Force anything hes a great floor spacer as well because you got to respect his ability outside the arc and then for Virginia what an opportunity for Isaac mcney to build on what weve seen him do here today hes knocked down threes hes been more assertive right here in the second half hunting his shot which is why he should that thing is beautiful coming off his fingertips five for nine from downtown Isaac with 20 I mean he acceleration off that pin down Rayo with the rare miscue aired that one out watch the acceleration right here and Buchanan is going to get a clip right here of geler whos on his hip this is how quickly mcne can get organized his feet under his shoulders he squares up his hips to the bucket and he lets it Fly its gorgeous that was a nice square up at full speed I thought Day Day Ames played well when he came in in the second half also if you cant has got to score that Kofi back to Buchanan Reno bothered it Kofi with the tip up and in Virginia making a run right here they cut it to 10 can they get three stops in a row that would be called a kill and then can they score good timeout yeah Kyle Smith wants to shut this down right now an 18point lead down to 10 Virginia on a 70 run and the Buckey Debbie used to work at the Ohio State University and yes my my father Lennys been uh praising Notre Dame football his entire 91 years so hes having a heck of a week this week getting ready I hate to go against Lenny but uh oh Ill give you the io on that one Blakes Baseline pullup no Virginia trying to make the comeback here in the last 6 minutes down by as many as 18 theyve hit four their last five shots they got a stop there but not the ball oh good high low call nice call from the bench Kyle Smith set that up their atos have been terrific well they operating in the middle third with Reno has youre not going to double team in the middle third its really hard to do and the the game plan and the pr ation to go against what Virginia does defensively has been on point all night Reno to the line 16 points nine rebounds a couple of assists Im still uh thinking you know hes had a couple of big nights where hes had over 30 r no mhm um the Santa Clara win on the road at Santa Clara I went down there to watch hers index team play out of the West Coast Conference they are excellent thats a good win for Stanford you got to keep stacking them together but I still think R now Im thinking about Cooper Flags 42 today on 14 shots how amazing that is and what Ry no could do if he really wanted to mcne deep three a oneand done agarwall with the rebound and round Rayo every piece has played their role well for Kyle Smith today oh nice pick POI with the takeaway and draws the foul on Blakes and that is his fourth this a really good job in the double team they trapped this ball screen its been a hedge but this right here is a good deflection he gets his hands in draws the foul so the Freshman will tow the stripe better than 80 on the season Kofi is two for two Music today nothing upsets a player more than thinking they didnt commit the foul which gives them four and makes them have to go sit cuz nobody wants to go over there and sit hes their playmaker their primary ball handler hes also an free throw shooter in a late game situation so is sellers got one to two Virginia does have three timeouts remaining Stanford has two deers camon they got Renault One V one Maxine turns count it he yelled something in French I didnt know exactly what it was but it was something competitive hes got a lot of energy at 7 one with his off hand with the half hook this is when you spend countless hours in the gym working around the rim to make your game better well its going to be fascinating as the season plays out depending on how good Stanford is right in the ACC Standing obviously folks on the East Coast love themselves some Cooper flag they have but its a rarity if you lead this league in scoring and rebounding that you are not the player of the year and you know what you dont have to you get to play at North Carolina and at Duke this yes you do day day no agal able to come out there with it for Stanford look at the agility to go get that Reno nobody comes to help out so hell wrap it around 22 points nine rebounds under four to go and Stanford stretches the lead Music again good fade good read and thats going to be a foul going for the loose ball are you rolling the r on this B no look at this move look at the look at the pivot excellent footwork inside 22 points 10 rebounds for maxim Reno gives him his 13th double double which is best in the country and he is the ACC scoring and rebounding leader heading into the weekend and how about this company Debbie The Last Five Guys to lead in both categories of all the G on to win Player of the Year very interesting y including Marvin Bagley most recently he is supremely talented raino and the conversation obviously will go to Cooper flag best team best player and his numbers which were fantastic today 42 points on 14 shots got to go back to Rod Griffin from Wake Forest in 1978 thats the last time a scoring and rebounding leader was not the player of the year it went to some North Carolina point guard in the late 70s pH was pretty good yeah yeah yeah he was pretty good yeah Stanford on a 70 run and really putting the pressure now on Virginia to make things happen Music quickly one and done trip there and Kyle Shaw says lets pump the brakes a little bit or Kyle Smith excuse me Reno spins Baseline no AGA wal he has been terrific as the hustle guy today for Stanford I was just going to say the same thing six board five assists hes got seven points hes active he defends multiple positions thats what I mean about everyone else playing their role around what Rau does Blakes and sellers have really evolved together theyre connected on the top of the floor both good Defenders both can initiate offense this Stanford team they theyve had a some impact trans transfers but also a guy like agar wal a reserve for a couple of Seasons an opportunity to win a spot in the starting lineup making the most of that chance look at the communication and you can hear r no his voice is the loudest even in a loud gym Saunders hits the shot clock I think this road Swing Out West for a lot of ACC teams is going to be tough cuz Cals a good basketball to team also sakovich is a heck of a player former Cardinal now at Cal he scored 23 Wednesday against Virginia I saw him drop 30 on Clemsons defense last week yeah they they so next to come out here Wake Forest or excuse me uh Miami Florida State Syracuse yeah tough road trips though theyve got North Carolina theyve got Duke on the road and then finish at Notre Dame and at Louisville a team right now that has been a huge surprise tied for second place Pat Kelce has been a winner everywhere hes been the head coach at Louisville you see how he dropped his hips not his hands on that low pass thats what Im talking about when you pass it to a shooter you cant make them drop their hips and if the pass is below the pocket you got drop their hands if the pass is below the pocket you got to drop your hips pockets like a strike zone isnt it Debbie youre youre looking shoulder shoulder hip hi watch he drops his hips but he doesnt drop his hands his hands never open up hes just a little bit short but thats because the passer didnt put it where it needed to be boy agal and camon have teamed up at least three or four times for Pick and rolls and back doors 11 unanswered for Stanford as they pull away here late mcney gets that one to drop Isaac now with 22 Stanford a chance to put a season High number of points on the Virginia Defense when we come back they got womens college basketball action for you tomorrow including right back here on the farm NC State taking on Stanford of course the wolf pack at the final four a year ago Stanford under the leadership now of Kate pay after the retirement of Taro vaner and it all starts with Texas and South Carolina a lot of folks think that might be the national championship game double header tomorrow for you Virginia out of the timeout full court pressure here with under two minutes to go and a lot of ground to make up Beth mowen alongside Debbie antelli and you continue to hear Reno barking out instructions and he gets the assist and the back door jam for sellers I love seeing a player celebrate team success not about himself r no is all about the team he plays with great joy Applause and the Roar of the crowd is for the Stanford substitute coming on Cole castner a transfer from Virginia with his degree and a national championship with the lacrosse team and now getting a chance to play against his old school what a great story fre time allamerican in Lacrosse at Virginia as you mention twoway sport twoway athlete I should say well what a nice moment for him 53 seconds he played in their game against Denver quality minute and 15 here for casner and lets see if they go to Applause him Cameron Grant also into the game off that bench so is Anthony Batson and the takeaway for Virginia jayen Thompson also out there for the Cardinal as DayDay Ames with the step back and a rebound for Cole castner hes in the scorebook officially tried to get him in the pick and roll theyll go again geler Thompson off the bounce getting inside and Thompson throws it down and thats the exclamation point Applause 8865 Stanford a winner over Virginia and a big moment Off the Bench for the Cardinal an opportunity for Cameron Grant and he makes the most of it another look and for our entire
