theyre 0 and2 at home in ACC play loss here to Clemson and Cory saw last week against Carolina and away we go from the Pete tonight the Freshman Foster out front with McCain the veteran roach filipowski and Mitchell there for Coach Shys team see early Duke wants to get the basketball inside to see how pitch going to guard Philip palski and a great defensive possession coach on the first one for the Panthers nice double and he makes a bad pass the deflection great start for Pittsburgh you see you see low with Carrington two young guys on the floor playing in this for the first time Carrington can get electric on offense and low in the starting lineup without ish Lega being able to play for the Panthers missed the last game not in the starting lineup for the second straight second straight game for the Panthers heres the Duke lineup of course you got we told you Jeremy roach and then filipowski and Mitchell inside and filipowski Taps back home his own Miss to open The Score they come over to help on the driver hes going to be there all night amazing Duke was the leading rebounding team in the ACC a season ago the Panthers are now the leading rebounding team in the ACC well see that how much this board plays into this game here is low The Freshman from Missouri City Texas all the way to the glass filipowski the rebound McCain attacking on the dribble and he will score early hoop for Jared McCain crafty he normally doesnt the majority of his damage from Beyond the threepoint Arc but of course the Panthers know hes a great threepoint shooter theyre going to try to run him off the line makes a great move inside you know theyve got to get the ball to Hinson I mean he struggled yes but hes the veteran guy on the team hes the guy that was setting the pace early in the year but coach Duke is going to switch everything defensively against the Panthers how do you go about getting Hinson this look heres Diaz Graham and a foul on Mitchell you know hinsons got to get his Loops when he gets the ball he can put it on the floor hes got to let it kind of come to him but at the end of the day when theyre switching everything you got to make a play in those situations youre not getting any advantage and hes getting switched a little guard on him sometimes hes got to be able to take advantage of that get to the basket that was a really good play there and theyve got to finish that play but it get the opportunity to line Theo Diaz Graham 51 on the year pit is 68 by the way on the season but Cory 76 in conference play are the Panthers at the free throw line well they went made their first 19 free throws against Louisville last time out and really was the free throw line that cost him the game against Syracuse on the road earlier which could have been a difference in the trajectory of this team especially starting out ACC play first points for Jeff Cel team on the free throws from guo Diaz gram the older of the Spanish twins T to shoot and heres Foster back for filipowski on the drive in traffic a little shot fake gets him his second field goal he struggled last game around the basket he missed three four of those its a good good thing for Duke for him to get off to that kind of St but its different when you got to go on guard SF footer that can put the ball on the floor get to the midrange and pull up isnt going to get out of control and pick up the charge here is Carrington see they get a mismatch like that they should try to take advantage of it theres a Rising Fire three long rebound collected McCain Duke wants to get in transition here guys thats what Jeff cable does not want to happen is due getting in transition Jeremy Rose gets a walk up three and a lead for Austin to catch and Applause Music score and you see they wait until the first field goal for the confetti to fly in the Applause zoo rebound filipowski of the Miss from Mitchell fresh 20 for the Blue Devils Foster in traffic against low and Diaz Graham runs it down and low steps out of bounds across the way at the scores table and and John shy and Jeff cable both Duke alums both former Mike shashki assistants squaring off here tonight and Sh makes a move to his bench Tyrese Proctor checks in and guo Diaz Graham takes a break as feder Rico feder Rico arrives for pit on the floor but WD did you hear my man moan to the side of me on on the unforced turn over they painted these lines a long time ago they dont change them you know you just cant go outside the line and that is saved out of the corner by Proctor using the hip of Blake Henson to keep it for the Blue Devils in a game like this of course where every game every possession is so valuable as a coach you see Jeff capable and low steps on the sideline right in front of him did you even say anything to your guy at that point thats my one of the its probably the worst thing a player can do in my book step out of bounds Austin with a terrific play on what looked like a catch and shoot from McCain Cory well this is a guy that has has 60 blocks and 63point field goals in consecutive Seasons the only player thats done that in the last 25 years is a goty that won a national play of the year for the Blue Devils by the name of Shane Bader so Zack Austin and some Elite company and right now hes making a difference defensively guarding the best shooter for the Blue Devils in McCain Y and Austins made a play on the layup and now a couple plays at the defensive end for Coach Capen nine to shoot third trial on The Possession here for the Blue Devils this is the kind you got to finish it off youve got the pretty much got the stop you got to finish it you cant let him score here filipowski against feder Rico and turned it over low in the Panthers trying to attack coach this is what youre talking about better Rico has proor on his back Fall Away y they got a guard against Philip hsky and they take the jump shot look at roach in transition knocked down a triple 22nd of the year for Jeremy roaches and this is my first game of the season with the Blue Devils so Ive been waiting to say that Jeremy roach has been the best guard for the Blue Devils this season doing a great job leading this team as a captain as a veteran and really a bounceback year for him yep I would agree with you on that Duke an early fivepoint lead heres Carrington and a hand check Duke in the Blue Devils with an early lead and inbounds for feder Rico feder Rico was stripped and Duke in transition off the turnover here is roach for another three and the rebound cleared Away by Henson with Cory Alexander the Hall of Fame head coach Jim baheim West Durham Carrington to pull up spins out feder Rico resets for pit heres Henson from the logo shot thats the best sign for the Panthers they could have gotten in this game off the offensive rebound to see Henson get a wide open look first shot and he gets it off the offensive rebound thats the best threepoint look youre going to get in basketball offensive rebound should throw everyone out to the threepoint line Ryan young has come in now filipowski works his way back to the scorers table coach Derrick colans on line one no hes saying you dont throw them all out you go score those DC D said he never got the ball unless he rebounded it thats why he was throwing it out never thrown out and most of the time he dumped it anyway there you go proor knocks down the three the sophomore from Australia whos averaged but seven points in his last couple of ball games n and a half points on the regular season Duke back to a fivepoint Advantage Jeff CES got a young flavor to his lineup even with a veteran player like Henson heres Jaylen low in the corner Carrington three feder Rico the rebound from behind young heres Austin in traffic had it wedged from behind on the Block and Duke in transition and McCain launches in hits the Blue Devils have hit three threes in their last three shots from the floor Cory but thats what Jeff Cape was fearful of he talked about transition defense and when youre playing against this team not only Proctor but of course McCain whos their best threepoint shooter Jeremy Roose these guys are all capable of pulling up on the break biggest advantage of the first half of eight now coach and the nothing nothing worse you get a wide open three and miss it and they go down and make a wide open three PTO Rico underneath the basket feeds Austin for the dun Austin finishing that one off with two hands got it blocked on a previous possession recognizing got to go stronger in the paint when youre playing against the Blue Devils Ryan young an undervalued shot blocker heres young backing in on feder Rico and scores say it was one step extra but were not going to get on the pi tonight yet a little early coach are you sure are you sure that were not going to get on the offici tonight not yet oh not yet said yes I I just did but well let it go okay 7 Minutes in Blue Devil lead is to eight again Duke is three of seven from behind the line pit is just three of 10 from the floor and Pat Driscoll will will call the foul and itll be on Jared McCain and we welcome you courts side great to be with Cory Alexander and Coach bayam West Durham all right what do we seen here early Jeff capable had some concerns one of thems already been realized yeah if you get transition Duke gets open threes theyre making theyre making all them but Dukes defense has been good in the half court the switching on every play is really hard because you dont get anything when you get that switch and the guy has to then put it on the floor Diaz Graham has come back in to replace feder Rico heres Henson thats too strong air ball off the Baseline but the right idea coach youre posting Henson but you dont want to post 15 ft away from the basket allow him to walk down get a little closer and then take advantage of his size against Roaches on the Block Philip palski against Diaz Graham thats a tough guard there coach but and thats where the the difference between the two guys with feder Rico feder Rico on the floor Jeff capable wants to play straight up but you see what what filipowski will do with Diaz Graham if you dont bring the double team hes just going to overpower him inside heres what hes going to try to get back on the other end try to make a three but if its not going in that philosophy does not work too well off the Miss of Diaz Graham ishmail Leed by the way defending proor Proctor here he did not play in the Louisville game with some shoulder soreness back on the floor tonight for the first time he had four points against Carolina to go with eight rebounds and theres Proctor a three and were going to get a Blue Devil foul I think Philip palowski tagged on this itll be his first the Blue Devils have made themselves comfortable here in the zoo Jeremy roach knocking down to three then finding Proctor for three more and of course mcain got to get involved the only three pits got as the open look kinson got on a toss out they havent got a good look off their offense the Panthers five of 29 of week ago here on their home floor against North Carolina this a team that averages 96 made threepoint field goal baskets in a game if they cant make shots especially the open looks theyve been able to get they dont have a chance against this D team well they made 12 on Saturday at L what kind of sense does that make again well Duke is playing great defense we got to give them credit too so here are the Panthers with the Freshman Carrington leged for and thats going to be a foul on Jaylen Blakes the Junior from New Jersey the Golden Globes for Sunday night but Henson was nominated oh he tried hey thats a heads up play thats basketball IQ at his finest right there at WD you hear the whistle spoken like a guy who used see if you can get three shots out of it any way possible yep heres Carrington now almost 9 minutes into this first half trying to find some success in traffic nice double team with young eight to shooting Diaz Graham this is Jorge were in 31 by the way Le it from the parking lot bounds away for foster switching defense has giv him a lot of trouble just cant get anything going John sh told us today he can go one through five when feder Rico is not on the floor and in all honesty what that does it takes you out of running your off def you prepare for how youre going to play all week coming into the game and then when you see Duke switching which is what they did primarily last season but this year theyve been more of a drop coverage team John sh switching it up for Pittsburgh because he recognizes that guo Diaz Graham can shoot the three ball so you can switch with him on the floor at all five positions guo and Jorge both on the floor together will jeffris is also checked in for Coach Cs team heres young kicking into the the corner and a three ball there badly missed by Blakes Carrington for jeffris working inside on filipowski great job by flip moving his feet right there but more importantly staying on the ground not jumping for the pump and that got knocked away from and Blakes rubbed the dunk out and Carrington going to be called for a foul here only thing Im thinking coach is to be young all Im thinking is didnt he say he was was going to try to get a dunk well that that was that was actually Jeremy Ro that was going to try to get the dunk but Blakes does a great job getting the steel defensively but the fall the only foul was I think by the rim the rim got him I think the rim got it was all contact by the rim that was it two shots but Blakes has got to get some attention here hes got a cut little blood on his fingers on the inside of the hand so Dukes veteran trainer Jose fona now on his 19th year in Durham will come over and have a look at at jayen Blakes and a quick reminder to you that the ACC play just continues tomorrow night 800 PNC Arena in Raleigh atmosphere might be pretty good for NC State and number seven North Carolina Dave OBrien Jay bis will be Courtside tar Hills have won nine of the last 11 in the series it is going to be rocking in there youre talking about two three and0 teams in ACC play going at it they are going to be Rowdy and PNC tomorrow I I like I like the way Carolinas playing both ends of the Court they picked up their defense their offense have been moving good all year this is a really good test for NC State its a huge game for NC State we got to look 3 and Carolina 3 and0 but watch the fall again this is to be young the foul is there you see Carrington but Blakes does a full split when he comes to the ground that Music is and Jaylen Blakes trying to deal with the bleeding issue on his hand so you send Jeremy Rose to the free throw line you get a better free throw shooter yeah Blake seven of eight roach is 85 eighth best free throw shooter in the ACC thats a thats a good foul for for dke and he did touch him on the hand but it was a really not much and Blakes actually going to theyre going to take Jaylen Blakes behind us here back to the uh Blue Devil locker room so hes got his stitches yeah believe thats a tough break for the young man from New Jersey five for roach as he hits both of the free throws on the carington foul thats why I didnt play all that defense you see that you see what happens when you play defense you get hurt you get injured so therefore stop playing all that defense Drive much you just shot fade aways Jeffers thought about the three pit needs a basket Panthers now trailing 12 low Jorge Diaz Graham great job by the Blue Devils though getting out covering the three on The Possession but been able to come up with the offensive rebound jge to from guo and this Duke run and a foul called and that will be on Caleb Foster its gone almost four minutes without a basket yeah Dukes defense is dominating this game right now just and youre talking about a team that was one of the better defensive teams in the ACC a season ago and John Shire told us you know earlier today he had to switch some things up he started out the year doing things that they had done in the past what they did last year but it wasnt working for this group with this level of this personnel and theyre starting to find their way now they had Philip palsky switched on a guard three or four times and they cant beat them thats where you try to attack and they havent been able to do it Kyle Philip palsky has done a really good job I thought the other thing he talked about today was the mentality he wanted this basketball team to have too coach he wants the especially the sophomores coming back to be more in charge they need to take more charge not just be passive theyre theyre the guys and he also wants them to be cocky on the road which I love to hear him say that because when you think about winning on the road in college basketball you got to have guys that walk in the gym and want to take ownership of that gym you want to quiet the crowd you want to quiet the zoo he said they needed to be cocky they havent been that when theyve gone on the road and of course when youre dke youre going to get everyones best shot its going to be sold out everyone no no empty seats and youve got to have that mentality of were coming in here to take this one and the interesting thing there is Mitchell gets double team he still gets the shut up and he still goes and gets the rebound out of a double team and thats just physically going after the ball hes a pretty talented player John Shire has won 38 of his first 50 games at Duke its the best first 50 in the history of Duke basketball for any coach eclipsing the guy whose names on the court and the guy whose names on the building yeah and and 38 for the Duke fans isnt good enough so you know lets make sure you understand that I sure hope the Duke fans can determine whose voice is whos over here that would be that would be beim you dont think theyd like better 22 to9 its a 13point lead for the visiting Blue Devils number 11 in the country looking for a second straight ACC Road wi nice fallway bucket ishma Leed is the junior transfer from Rhode Island out of Prince Georges County and you talk about two guys that have gone at it for a long time ishma leget Jeremy roach legot from St Johns College in DC of course roach at PBI Paul the six so these guys have had some wcac battles for a long time tend to shoot for Duke Foster trying to get Baseline on low found it through traffic filipowski three nine for flip here in the first half his 14th triple of the year and when hes shooting the basketball from three he is unguardable only 31 simp him on the season thus far but starting to play with more confidence and again this is a guy that missed the entire summer he didnt play basketball all summer with two Hip circles low fed Diaz Graham guo couldnt catch it and flush it so with under eight to play in the first half the Blue Devils on the attack again four threes from four different players and theres roaches driving to the basket and a timeout for Jeff cable here seven for Jeremy Roose coach Cory and the lead is 16 and KY filipowski finding a rhythm here on the road the nice find the kick out and of course you got the big fella wearing his coachs number for three knows all about Jeffs walk with his family and Jason and their family and its Jim you know this too its its an endearing Journey against just a ravenous disease well we have a platform Jeff is using it and thats whats so key use your platform and hes doing it Jeff happy to see Blake Henson knocking down another three especially the execution out of the timeout and now well see some Zone defensively from the Panthers but I can remember when Jeff told me that of course Jeff cable II had ALS it was actually through a text Jeff watched me post a uh a post with a ALS walk and so he reached out to me and asked me what information I knew about and I didnt know much other than the fact that of course Boston college sports information director Dick Kelly pass from ALS and thats what kind of taught me about the disease at first feder Rico feder Rico finishes on the nice catch and score inside Foster answered Hensons three with another one for Duke Blue Devil still attacking from behind the line five of their 11 field goals or triples and you see the Zone defensively for pit so you got to make sure you identify the shooters and its tough when you have Foster roach and McCain on the floor all three of these guys are dangerous tough a match up really is its a good thing you want to try it but its I dont think its going to work against this team no wait a minute were talking about uh Mr zone defense what do you mean its not going to work not going to work low and it bounce out filipowski the rebound but coach when you are playing against a playing a Zone against a team that shoots it this well what are the principles that you have to stay involved with well first of all it doesnt matter they they played man that time but you got to get out on the shooters and hope they dont get too much inside but if youre not playing a lot of Zone its hard to switch to that defense Duke is shooting it like they havent missed in a month Cory well this is a team that you know has the potential to do that and theyre starting to find their identity you looking at a different starting lineup then what you saw earlier Caleb Foster getting involved in the mix now as a St where he was coming off the bench early and its that simple when you shoot it as well as he does he steps right into one is able to knock it down and then you get Jeremy roach and Foster involved in pick and rolls with filipowski he knocks down his second three so when you got guys on the floor that can shoot it at every position its completely difficult to guard McCains come back in the game had it knocked away saved and that was Austin keeping it alive for Henson it is a 20point Duke lead and the Blue Devils are just ringing the bell from behind the line here in the first half Pits got to find a combination of hitting shots and stops here in the final five minutes Henson fall away three got it nine for Blake Henson all triples everyone he gets is hard except for that first one I mean its hard to make those shots Duke is just switching and and really getting up into them making them drivers and theyre having trouble doing that filipowski out of the corner McCain you know and we watched McCain Foster and roaches work out pregame the three of these guys shooting together Proctor also involved in that mix but the ball rarely even hits the rim youve got Elite level Shooters between these guards for the Blue Devils and when theyre shooting like this theyre extremely dangerous theres a foul itll be a Blue Devil personal foul on Caleb Foster itll be his second its the sixth in the first half on Duke Coach we get a look at the numbers right here Duke comes into the game averaging 77 threepoint field goals per game at 37 look at what theyve done already tonight theyre getting good movement they hit the Two Against The Zone and different guys are shooting its not the same guy theyre hard to stop when theyre shooting the ball like this one and one seventh foul on the Blue Devils Caleb Foster is the first Duke player with two you see Jeremy roaches kind of get everybody set as low goes to the line Jaylen low is from Missouri City Texas theres an interesting tie of this game tonight with low his Godfather is John Lucas II okay well Dukes got an assistant coach named Jay Lucas and now heres Jay loo we got a little bit of the family picnic here Cory is what Im telling well let me tell you this Jay Lucas and John Lucas of course the son of my former assistant coach John Lucas the great alltime great at University of Maryland and he likes to remind people number one pick in the draft right the first point guard to be drafted number one overall I coached against him he was pretty good he was pretty good yeah coach did you coach against Will Chamberlain I mean really would played against somebody I was a little little bit behind a little behind couple years couple years you Coast against pretty much everybody couple of free throws for low heres young working on feder Rico back for foster boy Caleb Foster and then turns it over Zack Austins got it in transition crossover gets him to the Lane cant finish against young and Ryan young is going to be the beneficiary of a a foul I believe on Austin so the foul will be actually on Hinson thats his second coach Lukes ball movement is been great obviously youre making shots but to make shots you got to move the ball and thats what theyre doing theyre getting great looks and theyre going to make those Music shots Music Applause Music all right Zubin coach thanks very much more coming up at the half big win tonight by Iowa State against Houston unbeaten and of course Kentucky got Missouri ahead of us tonight yeah and Florida State 3 and one in the league now for that start they had yep pretty pretty good recovery y w far as falls for the first time in ACC play all that and more coming up at the break with those guys all right Duke is on fire CA shooting it here the difference is theyre on fire on the road is not something weve seen from many teams throughout this year we talk about wake Force going in into Tallahassee at 3 and0 they cant beat the seol on the road so thats even more impressive by the blue doues the way theyre shooting here not the whole theyre getting great ball movement getting open shots open shots thats when you can make them Hinson stays on the floor for the final 341 after picking up his second blue double turnover here and ahead for Ley you cant you cant take him out two fouls are not you got to leave him in you got to get him going and were going to get a Duke foul foul and if its on McCain no its Mitchell Mark Mitchell a sophomore from Kansas City thats his second he becomes the second Blue Devil with two joining Caleb Foster now John sh will take Mitchell out as Henson goes to the line here hes got more guys so heres Blake Henson from Deltona Florida and the front end of the one and one no good by the way Mitchell came out filipowski came back yeah thats not thats not a bad tradeoff to say the least for the Blue Devils but coach mentioned youve got more options well when youre as deep as duke you can have a guy Mitchell comes off two career highs and now he hasnt really got anything tonight but that guy is coming off a couple bad games and having a big game hes got 14 in the first half thats his sixth field goal in seven tries Cory I love the way he adjusted to the left hand around the shop Locker in feder Rico making sure he was able to still get a bucket three ball out front Carrington no good scoreless first half so far for the Freshman Carrington for Baltimore Co John Shire talked to us earlier today he said that the guy that they had to stop was Henson that Carrington was going to get his he was going to find his way to score but Carrington was always the leading score in their losses so rolling Henson was going to be more of a thing Hensons actually been able to get going a little bit but theyve kept Carrington under control but hes getting shots you know some of the some cases he didnt havent got good shots but Carrington got some shots Austin long with the three kept alive and heres Tyrese Proctor inside of two to go in this first half Blue Devils are 612 from the floor 57 from behind the line thus a 22point lead and Proctor they scoop it around for McCain his three was too strong terrington tried to get it to feder Rico couldnt handle it heres Proctor with the dke turnover from pit a pull up three and the follow is good thats Jared McCain Jared McCain with his second bucket in the paint we saw him drive it earlier and then coming up with offens rebound but I love that from McCain even though hes a shooter he didnt stand and wait for the basketball in the corner he went and got offensive board both guys stand out in the corner he went right and got it where would Ive been coach in the corner absolutely in the corner you you were nailed there look at this were trying to get a third and one converted at the top of the circle here and a hell ball will ultimately stay with the pit Panthers quick reminder to you big games and events continue to highlight our J January calendar NHL Saturday MAA Rangers in caps at 100 Eastern Spanish super Copa finals comes up Sunday Wild Card Monday night in Tampa with the Eagles and Buccaneers UFC 297 is a week from Saturday jampack January right here on ESPN ABC ESPN Deportes and ESPN plus okay WD so we know John Shire is a bears guy course my guy Jay Lucas is with me in the Cowboys we know youre a Falcons guy coach who is your football team uh was the Patriots but I had to switch to the bills oh you went to the bills it is a little closer you got to go to the winners you by the way coach uh Carrington Just got his first bucket and you you say when youre here that youre for the Steeler thats what you I know I know I cant no you dont coach we dont do that I dont do that Im a Bills fan all right now youre Bills fan apparently yeah yeah got the part of the mafia went of their practices this year you under the filipowski a deep three what a half for filipowski by the way thats 17 now on three first half triples but hes doing it inside and outside this is the reason why Kyle filipowski was the ACC preseason Player of the Year Henson a three at the horn bounds away and Duke is going to take a 25point lead to the locker room here fellas this has been an offensive exhibition for the Blue Devils coach they have done it in every form every fashion every way and their defense has been really solid 60 from the flooor 53 from behind the line well you you got to look at you got to play every play but you got in the 10 minutes you got to get at least 10 points off it and thats going to be hard to do unless they miss some shots Foster misses there and Caleb Foster was two for two from behind the line he had two of the nine threes in this big sparkling first half duat offensively and if youre Jeff capable you want to continue to see if you can keep filipowski from being dominant in the post but you got to make sure that your guys stay closer to the shooters hope they fall in love with some and St missing him Austin knocks down a three his 15th of the Year by the way it is of note Blake Hinson had nine but Buck Carrington only had two for the Panthers in the first half Philip palski 17 LED all scores heres Mitchell who by the way had a tough first half only a free throw to his credit after backtoback games where he set to career highs and you see Diaz Graham reach in and knock it away off filipowski theyre playing off Mitchell theyre just Hons playing back in the lane off him and hes not going to take that shot you see the nice find from Diaz Graham to Zach Austin who knocks down the corner three and maybe thats something that can get the Panthers going being able to get the three to go down in the first offensive possession of the second half yeah theyre taking theyre trying to get the mismatch and then see if they can get the double team and then try to get it and get a good shot and over the top of McCain and Diaz Graham couldnt collect it neither could filipowski but you see McCain never wi in to help on that one he stayed close to Henson so when he caught it on the opposite side of the ball swung around the perimeter he was right there well Pittsburgh you know Duke really adjusted well after the double team they they didnt give him an easy shot roach had seven points but also four first half assist filipowski saw Fall Away 18 19 now on his eighth field goal re his nin coaches we watch him go off the bouns we see him shoot the three we see him post up I believe and more importantly we see him switch on pick and rolls I believe KY f is actually going to be a very good NBA player I think all those attributes allow him to be very good at that level You coached more NBA players than me what do you think I only coach the very best NBA players so Im not a good you know a real good judge of that when you coach the Olympics and you LeBron and theyre not normal NBA players yeah Kyle Kyle can shoot it he moves pretty well and you know hes a tough kid yeah I mean hes got its hard to predict the NBA for big guys the way the game is being played today but he can shoot it as a big guy and thats going to help him Mitchell by the way the Breakaway dunk for his first field goal Dukes got 20 fast break points in this ball game now in addition to the hot threepoint shooting we saw in the first half there been impressive performance by the Blue Devils we talk about the NBA a lot of Scouts in the building so watch this one as you see Jaylen low go high off the glass but he was able to do what weve talked about throughout this game when you get a big man to switch out on to you got to be able to put him in drive and find a way to finish at the rimo find a team a for shot theyre doing a little better job of that in this half theyre getting a little better looks heres roach back for filipowski little help there finally heres Foster soft jumper good boy Caleb Foster came to Duke reputation of a score he was the first of the heralded recruiting class to commit and uh tell you what he has delivered averaging almost six in conference play eight during the regular season hes a young man that can absolutely shoot the basketball but he may not be the best shooter in the class alone because Jared McCain probably has the title for that one but you bring in two guards that can absolutely shoot the cover off the rock roach commits the foul John shy terrific recruiting class this year another one coming next year headlined of course by Cooper flag got a special player coming in next year hes not normal hes hes not normal hes not normal Ive heard a lot of things about Cooper thats the first time I heard that one Co I cant wait to read that one in the D beheim hes not normal he does it all everything and then then something that you dont think he does he can do that too he absolutely does had opportunity to go watch Coop and of course known him since he was in the seventh grade but watched him at the city of Palms a few weeks ago and ran into our guy Dicky V so he made sure to tell me you keep doing your doing your thing on TV he likes your work right now coach hes the best we miss Dicky V I mean nobody has meant more to the game of college basketball than dick byal and to pedi pediatric cancer research no one and you like them or love them whatever it is you think hes been unbelievable for the game of basketball no question and our best to dick and Lorraine theyre the best sure hes keeping an eye on this one here tonight oh hes hes locked in his granddaughter goes to Duke a timeout after a blue double foul itll belong to the Panthers but Kyle filipowski coming in averaging less than 10 in his last two well hes well over that 19 and the Blue Devils with a big lead here early in the second Music Applause Music Music well zuin coach thanks very much interesting night across the country in college basketball this road performance by the Blue Devils has been impressive here tonight at the Peterson Event Center in Pittsburgh and a lot of it having to do with what the Blue Devils have done behind the threepoint line heres Hinson trying to answer for the Panthers and had it spin out coach its hard to survive off of individual plays like that when you have to go and make a tough shot yeah the switching is just taking them out of their def out of their offensive game and theyre just having to go at guys and those are hard shots roach on the scooping score hes got nine JY roach a much better player attacking the basket than he was of course couple seasons ago does a great job of knowing when the time to go to the basket when to shoot to three but again hes the season veteran on this Blue Devil team Austin on the kick out from Leed and here is Proctor into the front court for Duke and taken away and here is guo down the floor and he had it stripped and therell be a whistle and a foul and its going to be on lean most impressive part of that play is the fact that both Proctor nor McCain gave up on that play even though its a turnover they both chase down G mod Diaz yeah and theyve done that taking the ball away way under the basket I him three or four times tonight where its an easy basket hes got to learn to secure that and get it in the basket filipowski squares for another one also got to learn not to hold that hedge too long if hes got to get back to a guy thats four for four from Beyond a threepoint Arc now tough scenario for G Modz Graham to be in Philip palowski now with 22 in the ball game and thats his third fourth three of the night and a turnover by the Panthers and turned over by Duke before they could get the ball to the rim filipowski had 22 against pit last year in the ACC quarterfinals at Greensboro he was eight of 10 from the floor that night and four of six from behind the line Austin trying to answer and were going to get Proctor couldnt contain it on the end line I did that game a year ago WD and it was very similar to this one yeah it was a route by the Blue Devils I believe a 30point win when it was all said and done 9669 y but it wasnt the news of the ACC tournament however though its a guy beside me who that was the news kind of stole the show at AC tournament last year the news that the tournament is sitting to your right Im trying to get it publicity any way I can yeah okay appreciate you yeah yeah yeah that that was the news at the tournament absolutely the news the tour yeah until Saturday night when Duke won the title there was the headliner right there sitting to you doing your right there sir Im impressed with Duke tonight theyve struggled on the road for two years and they are not struggling theyre playing good both ends of the Court when they get their shots theyre knocking them down here is sliding Drive Proctor couldnt finish Young Who spell Philip palski in there a moment ago now heres Mitchell Baseline foul from behind by feder Rico because were watching this team grow though I mean if you go back and you look at the Georgia Tech game December 2nd to now the road games for the Blue Devils and John sh even said the noted aim game it was a they had to grind that one out and so when you look at what youre seeing from them right now they have a different level of confidence when they step on the road and this is going to help them moving forward cuz obviously they got a lot more Road games this kind of a game is obviously going to give you the confidence Pittsburghs pretty good theyre not theyve struggled in the league a little bit but theyre not bad and to come in here and dominate gives your young guys an awful lot of confidence dont forget Saturday basketball triple header over on acc Network number 21 Clemson welcomes Boston College thats presented by Food Lion and then you see Duke and Georgia Tech 500 from Cameron Indoor Stadium and then well close down in blackburg at the castle on Saturday night Jim Lena and Miami visiting Virginia Tech all of that on acc Network and always available for you on on the ESPN WD I would assume that youre going to be on one of those games where will we find you this weekend I will be in blackburg to see Miamis road trip good game yeah Miami you know what happens up there with Virginia Tech at the castle little Charlie hit one from half court one night the loudest building in the ACC I said it yes it is actually louder than Cameron indor however Ive never done a Duke North Carina game so cant judged upon that any other game Ive been in the Cameron IND door hasnt been when you play like this on the road its very quiet thats the best way to quiet the crow you start making shots and its just the way it is you got to and young who had a chance at the threepoint play a moment ago turns it over Pitt and transition Carringtons had a tough night That Got swatted Away by Philip palowski and were going to get a break in the action 6228 here go bub right there not having his best night no hes not happy hes hes a winner he wants to win hes hes not at all happy up there course a Baltimore Elite Fame and was the first coach of as his son lines up another one un able to get that down first coach of Team Melo of course who was established by our guy ba ba ba your guy of course dont dont give anybody else credit Applause B out of bounds itll belong to pit off the Baseline Duke by 31 tonight as you get a look at the fresh who by the way bub Carrington little Bubs second cousin is Rudy Gay Baltimore connection yeah you think about it you talk about the players that have come a lot from Baltimore oh yeah going back to coach I mean hermer hered lets lets start with Tre Michael Brown and Herman hered Herman hered is one of the best High School coaches in the country now has won multiple state championships of course Dante green after that CJ fair and what was that other guys name from Baltimore got same initial as me I called him little CA yeah H thats it yeah my my my assistant Troy Weaver told me were going to win a National Championship with this guy coach I said really he was right he was right he was on point and Coach Im going to say this and not because youre here I say it all the time the best one and done in college basketball history Carmelo Anthony no question about you think about not just the numbers and everything that he did but winning a national championship had pretty good players with them also oh yeah Jer M yeah Jerry mck theres a jump shot and thats Jaylen low no one wins the national championship without a lot of help thats you know its the bottom line its hard to do and you got to have a lot of help here is McCain the collective effort tonight by Duke especially in the first half and here in the early stages first 10 minutes of the second half has been impressive now you start talking about John shy here hes going to start looking at this and he knows what this is which is the ACCC in the net and Cory thats the top 70 pit at 53 Duke at 18 but a roadwi doesnt hurt you in that formula no it only helps and again of course I truly learned a lot about the NCAA tournament in the selection process when I got to the right here coach bam schooled me on a lot of this and one of the first things he told me was the road matters thats the biggest key is WI games on the road I think when youre close we got in a couple years cuz we had a couple good road WIS not just playing on the road but beating somebody on the road and net or no net which Im not a net believer but you have to win games on the road if youre on the jeffris the three his fourth of the Year first points tonight for will jeffris red shirt Jr from Erie who battled injury a year ago and he come back after offseason foot surgery canel out most of his 23 campaign Jeffers is a guy that reclassed up to join Jeff cable here at Pittsburgh for wi his senior season that rims out of the corner from McCain and here is Carrington this is what I love seeing with Jared McCain with the reputation of being a scorer which hes an elite level scorer especially from the shooting standpoint but getting it after it defensively and I think thats been the difference with this Duke team theyre starting to gain their identity on the defensive end of the floor I believe when these guys came in they thought it was all about offense and what they needed to do but John Shire making it very clear they have to be good Defenders to play for them yeah I I think thats a part of it but also their offense theyve got a lot of weapons offensively with Proctor coming back now and roach you know theyve got Shooters and when they have Kyle inside playing the way hes playing Team night theyre a difficult team you double him he pass those Shooters you dont double them he scores theres been discussion though that they dont have that guy at The Rim the Derek Lively presence if you will from a year ago though fellas thats the part that keeps coming back in conversation but when you play like this at both ends and youre as connected as theyve been tonight it doesnt matter Rim protection doesnt matter as much when you play good defense when you get beat a lot then you need a rim protector back there but they dont get beat a lot on the from the perimeter their perimeter defense is pretty good but no I I think theyll be fine theres guo Diaz Graham knocking down a three WD that goes into what John CH talked to us about earlier today pregame where he said we had to change a lot of things from what we did a season ago season ago they had that Rim protection but they dont have it now although Kyle filipowski is averaging two blocks a game coming into this one so hes a guy that is doing a great job at The Rim when hes there but of course when theyre switching defensively often times hes out guarding guys on the perimeter yeah filipowski by the way hes top 10 in the ACC and points and rebounds coming in hes 12th in field goal percentage but hell only go north after tonights effort and Cory you mentioned the blocks hes fourth in the ACC in Block shots he had 27 coming into tonight at the preseason Player of the Year timeout in Pittsburgh going to be ready for the most passionate fan base in the league and how about Florida State a fivepoint win tonight over Wake Forest who was 3 and0 in the league Jim well Florida State couldnt beat anybody and now theyre winning in the league so who knows who knows but that game North Carolina NC State lot a lot there a lot you know youd hate to see that go away someday too thats whats crazy about this whole realignment stuff here is guo Diaz Graham he draws a foul on the way up you saw Notre Dame in Georgia Tech thats over on acc Network in Atlanta final game of a double header tonight over on that channel and here tonight we have watched Duke John sh used the word cocky want to play Cocky he uses it in a positive way not an arrogant way just an attitude to mindset and I like the idea of what he instilled into his team about playing this game tonight cuz he knows the reputation of this pit team from two meetings a year ago Cory not just the one of Cameron but also the one in the tournament in Greensboro but not only that as we got to look at John sire John sire and the two guys to his left understand when you think about Chris Carwell and then will Avery on the bench as well you think about they understand what its like to play for Duke yeah and to go on the road and youre going to have some people cheering for you but youre going to have way more Jing at you and they know understand you have to be cocky to be able to come in and play in that fashion I asked him do you want us to use that word because of course the word cocky has a negative connotation to it people used to call me that all the time and so therefore but as you mentioned he uses it in a positive way yeah I like to say confident but you know you can use that word but theyre playing with confidence but it comes from hitting a couple shots early and Kyle filipowski hit a couple early roach hits one early all of a sudden thats contagious and you know pit couldnt hit anything mainly because of the defense the D play Austin scoring there Zach Austin a transfer from High Point originally from Winston Salem tell you what the star tonight is Kyle filipowski is 11 of 12 from the floor hes already got another double double by the way thats his fifth of the season in the 21st of his Blue Devil career and he tried to pass out of a double team there he and Diaz Graham both hit the deck and heres low going the other way for pit and WD this was a team that at the beginning of the season was not cocky they werent even confident as you see Shawn Stewart Big Time block by Shawn Stewart that was a block Shawn Stewarts another guy that can help this team because he has the rim protection but you look at Duke vers ranked opponents this season they got punched in the mouth by Arizona on their home floor they got the win against Michigan State but the most important game that theyve had this year has been the win over Bor in New York City yeah thats the one that I think allowed this team to start to understand the identity they have to play with the be successful and Blakes got tangled up with Diaz gr and I think Jaylen Blakes is going to pay for it with his Music foul thatll be the fifth on Duke you see that one and two Mark the road win is the victory on Saturday at Notre Dame the losses are Georgia Tech and Arkansas in the ACC SEC challenge theres carington with his second field goal of the ball game that was better hell give hell get over this game hell learn from it thats what freshman do TJ Powers come in for the first time he wears number 12 for the Blue Devils here is Shawn Stewart highrising jump shot Stewart by the way Cory set a Duke basketball record for vertical mhm leading up to the campaign unbelievable athlete gets it all from his mom Nicole is where thats where the athleticism comes from Im giving yogi no credit yeah Michael Stewart of course well terrific player wasnt he yeah he was and an elite shot blocker thats where Sean gets the shot blocking from but Nicole gets all the credit for the athleticon here is Carrington with 15 to shoot one of the interesting pieces about this and theres the runner and the scorer by bub all of his points have come here in the second half and its a 21point Duke lead with four and A2 to go the Panthers are going to have to wait on this they do not play this weekend they have the by weekend if you will in the ACC rotation so they go to Syracuse or Syracuse rathers here next Tuesday night the orange had beaten Panthers 8173 in late December another quick two game Spin in the conference schedule thats a block by Austin who can also get off the deck and Stewart poked that away from low and saved it to Proctor and here is power and back to Foster with under four to go here like what John shs doing right now with Proctor and Foster on the floor together these are the two guys as B was able to step back and knock down a three and we know he can score Elite score but you see Proctor and Foster these are the two guys that John shy made it clear to us we need more from both those guys theyre getting consistent efforts right now from roach and McCain but the four guard lineup five if you include Blakes in that bunch he knows what hes going to get from those guys he needs these two guys to step it up haringtons got 10 all here in the second half three in a row I think hes just couldnt get going early yeah hell learn from this and he got a lot of good looks early coach he did it wasnt that he was taking bad shots he just couldnt make couldnt get in the basket and if some of those go down it really changed the complexion of this game totally Duke now winds the shot clocked inside of 10 back for power out of the corner one more time too strong and it was saved to Austin by Diaz Graham TJ power had an elite summer last summer and went from a little school to come to Duke and its going to take him a little while to get used to playing he put up big numbers in the ebl last summer he was one of the best players in the eyb on in that summer and Carrington threw that pass for jeffris Beyond his reach so we get a stoppage of play 220 to play tonight at pit Duke on the way to their 12th win Music well you went to a you went to a good school its all right I mean you couldnt quite make it a puse but its okay we still we still love you in Syracuse especially my wife J I was getting ready to say lets get down to who the who his favorite bayam is by far but shes her judgment obviously isnt good look at who she married so we got we got to go by that too oh man sea Stewart by the way out of windir Florida sets it down softly with two hands his first points of the night out of the timeout this has been an impressive performance tonight by the blue dos it absolutely has been and again theyve gotten so much production from many different guys the guard shot the basketball extremely well kows played like the ACCC preseason player of the year that we were expecting for him to be but most importantly the defense holding pit to 50 points on their home floor has been impressive here is Stewart again and fouled by guo Diaz Graham so thatll take Stewart to the free throw line yeah the defense really was the key I mean they made shots and there were they would have won the game with just pretty good defense but they played really good defense they didnt let Henson get looks Carrington they kept him off balance and you know they just dominated the game on both ends coach with a weak off and youre Jeff capable you dont play this weekend so your next game is a week from tonight against youre Alma moer yes sir with a week off what is that youre trying to get across to your team throughout this time where youre going to have just a little bit of a break well you played the best team in the league probably and you know we didnt have our stuff and they did so lets just worry about the next game lets work hard this week we played in Syracuse it was a close game the whole way so we got him here lets lets just play our game Jim you cant get lost on the long game you got to stay to the short game right thats the everybody says it but its true the next game you can have a bad night and you can still come back and beat somebody really good the next game or win two or three in a row I mean its the game of basketball heres Blakes ahead for proor meanwhile Duke welcomes George ATT attack on Saturday theyre going to be thinking about that first game down there in Atlanta well and then they get a week we off before guess who comes to Cameron pit how about that its interesting both these schools have just one game before they play each other again Cor in the next 12 days its scheduling its the way it works sometimes not good spot up by Foster no good Duke will get a second chance heres Proctor teeing one up and thatll be pulled away its going to be an interesting rest of this month I think in the ACC weve got weve got some things kind of set out there you saw Carolina last Wednesday night here Tuesday night rather they played well got the win played a very fisical brand of basketball we get an unbelievable performance by filipowski tonight 26 11 of 12 from the floor hit all four of his threes I think KY filipowski is just rounding in form he missed this summer because he had the the issues two Hip issues and so I think when you take off that much time I believe right now hes just starting to get a RI yeah theres no doubt about it you know theres a reason he was preseason Player of the Year and and and youre right right it takes a little time to get yourself back after you have that kind of surgery in your off for so long and you know I mean hes a really good offensive player well they are going to win in a commanding fashion tonight 75 53 is the final and John shy picks up his 12th win of the year hes third in the ACC headed home to meet Georgia attch on Saturday and and dont forget as I what I said early John shrier has done a great job sure has and tonight his team wins by 25 here is Scott Van Pelt in Music DC
