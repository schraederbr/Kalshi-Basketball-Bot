on that coaching staff Joey Rodriguez in his sixth season he was the point guard for that final fouram back in the day with shakka I remember that team very well we played VCU in a tournament uh my junior year and they br so much intensity and no fear coach Chaka smart brings no fear and expect to see that from this FIU basketball team tonight opening tip goes to the Miami Hurricanes tonight theyre 20 FIU 0 and2 Ron Grover Pat Adams Tony Henderson the officials here in Miami this evening opening whistle its going to be a little B check on FIU so an early foul by FIU and that was on Seth Pinkney the center at 7 1 in tall out of Philadelphia Pennsylvania a transfer from quinia expect them to be very aggressive on the ball screws as you can see early on theyre double teaming off the ball screens right away to not get him going and it work for a turnover FIU open up their season with an 8562 loss at UCF an unexpected loss to Carlton State 8265 last week but again theyre forcing a ton of turnovers problem right now you know you got to go back to last season Denver Jones was their standout player in F at FIU well he took the bag he went to Auburn hes the starting point guard at Auburn as FIU and Seth Pinkley will go to the line early theyre looking for somebody to not only take control of this team they also are probably in a position right now Jack they got to believe they can win a game here you know you got to believe you can win cuz a belief is nothing but a thought that youve been thinking for a long period of time and that becomes your Bel system these FIU kids they need to believe they can win this game they need to be confident coming into University Miami basketball program and try to come out with a W so P to the free throw line This is the first again big old Center of of Philadelphia we saw the size in the last match up for Miami against UCL it did present a bit of a problem Miami was able to run away with that game late down the stretch but the size did bother him a little bit as FIU jumps out to a one nothing lead here tonight I like how FIU is putting pressure on Miami early theyre not waiting to be down to put the pressure on theres Matthew Cleveland in transition nor Chad omir thought he was fouled ball is loose on the floor its Miami basketball FIU bench erupts they thought it was off of Miami see the starting five there Cleveland for Miami along with pack Bley Joseph and nor Chad oir and the officials come together they get it right its FIU basketball see the great thing about presenting a press is is that its not all about getting steals its making the opposite team play fast and right there they made the Hurricanes play Fast onto another turnover de to the rack kicks it out three in the corner on the way no good Matthew Cleveland down with the rebound for the Hurricanes they like to run they love to get out and transition Nigel pack with an underhand toss to nor Chad oir off his fingertips another turnover by Miami theyre second fu is set the tone early lets get these guys to play fast and its working in their favor uro Dean with the basketball the point guard he hands it off tra right wing beyond the threepoint Arc by Miami FIU splits it they get out of it Dean kicks it out three on the way that is too strong nor chadow down with a rebound for the hurricanes and now Bensley Josephs turn to bring it up the floor hillfire away and early three and he buries it Bley is picking up where he left off notice he has the long sleeve shirt on today hes going to get hot early well why would you mix it up the way hes been playing huh heres a deep three on the way and that missed badle Off the Mark Jonathan a bar missed badly Matthew clay bang me out Matthew Cleland an incredible slam dun on the fast break right there the Florida state transfer the 67 thirdyear Junior out of of Atlanta gives the Hurricanes a 5 to one advantage great help defense by NORAD another turnover here com another one oh he laid it off the glass early couldnt get his feet right smile his face smile crowd would erupted well theres nobody in this gymnasium tonight that can get up there more so than wga popper another near turnover and a missed layup by jayen lip scum so here comes the canes again in transition Matthew Cleveland stepped on the Baseline heres that Cleveland dunk again that was close he know he had that you can see the length in that finish right there binley Joseph hit that early three for Miami and the threes continue to fall for the Hurricanes they total 10 plus threes for the second straight game in their 8872 victory over UCF three on the way rattles around and out 7 nothing Run for the Hurricanes nor Chad omir spins in the paint Fades away cant connect too Music Applause strong FIU still without a field goal tonight Applause Music Applause boy FIU a lot of dribbling but theyre going nowhere with the basketball now with double team here it comes and a foul on the floor who they going to get as four Panthers get set to check in its going to be on North chadow near another early foul soogo Brewer and Hawkins will all check in now for FIU FIU subbing very very early lets see what what value that these kids coming in the game bring to their team Miami and the traditional home white tops and bottoms tonight ifu decked out in the black road traveling great tops and bottoms as Michael noo will check in for Miami nor Chad Mir with the early foul will take a seat coach El tells him just put your hands up would Applause you heres gens pass Corner three on the way that one looks good that is buried javante Hawkins Fresh Off the Bench the sophomore out of Miami thats what you want to see you get in the game automatically make it play for your basketball team a lot of confidence Matthew Cleveland fouled hell go to the free throw line with 1547 left the play in the opening half here in Miami the Hurricanes out to an early 7even for lead 2022 2023 it culminated in the programs first ever trip to the final four just a couple of years ago coach El took him to their first ever Elite eight in his 13th season as the head coach of the Miami Hurricanes and boy for a long time now Jack mclinton hes had him rolling here in Coral Gables hes had him rolling hes had them believing they think theyre a great team right and what does that turn into their belief system they believe theyre a great team and its amazing because if you go back to like that 2012 season it didnt take long and it was the day before the transfer portal right so guys were sitting out but it didnt take coach out long to assemble a really good team that turned the heads of the Coral Gables and Miami community that who did not you know like and that that to me is whats so impressive is Michael Nook about touch the top of the backboard Bensley Joseph in transition fre on the way second time tonight hes barried a three benley Joseph has really found his rhythm you know coming in as an offg guard when hes used to coming in as the first point go off the bench I think hes starting to understand his role and believing in his jump shot it looks very very pure and smooth expect to see a lot more threes from thisy you know I was going to say that there seems to be a sense of confidence not that he didnt have but in Prior years theres a big three on the way for Javonte Hawkins thats his second but Bley Joseph never had to be the guy before and the expectation he doesnt have to be the guy this year but he is going to have to be a guy he might need to get you 10 15 points a game he doesnt need to be that guy but he can be that guy and thats something that we need I would like to heat check for him on that shot right there well he thought about it right in the face of patar kakap pich behind the back pass noo pulls up he buries the midrange Cho I like the way he caught that ball conf let it go right away no second guessing on the Music shot sky for the offensive rebound Jaden Brew on a put back is good very athletic rebound by Brewer in the Music Applause Music Applause Finish Cleveland lost the basketball popper picks it up kick out for three on the way Bensley Joseph no good Matthew Cleveland skyed over the back of desan gens and gens is going to get called for the foul theres that noo block into that threepointer how about the block look at that thing great timing on that block you know the key to being a shot blocker is to be able to time the shot and that get you transition threes wide open transition three Nigel pack will take a seat kesan George is in now for Miami young promising they believe a stud freshman whos seen some playing time here early he gets the ball C It Off the Bench he pulls up and the shot is too strong I love the confidence that this young kid plays with comes in the game comes up a stagger double screen shoots the ball does it make the shot but I love the confidence to be able to step right in and shoot that ball oh nothing wrong with asserting yourself thats for sure Brewer kicks it out to sonogo and then he hands it off to Dean who works off a screen top of the key picks up his dribble heres Hawkins hes hit a couple of Threes now he tries to get to the rack kicks it out oh thats a beautiful look and then the corner three no good a bit too strong for Applause Brewer well that was a great look though a terrific pass by Javonte Hawkins great triple team down in the paint theres a turnover on the deck is wga popper and a dunk a flush on the other hand for Brewer I want to see Miami get wga going early you know W is a rhythm player we want to see him get going early so he can kind of get into his rhythm make some shots get some stops continue to be that guy that he is its interesting Jack being here Courtside next to the FIU bench a lot of energy from this team you got to had that energy when youre playing a top 10 team top 12 team Cleveland just moved up from 13 to 12 you got to bring the energy Matthew Cleveland buries a jump shot that little stutter that little Euro Step you notice I said top 10 before I believe this University Miami Hurricane basketball team will easily be a top 10 team the next couple weeks great move by Dean great move Stutter Step into the Euro Step in the paint kind of slowed his body down in control and uh tried to kiss it up there and was just a bit too strong so Miami basketball after the foul on sonogo his first FIU with four fouls Miami with two heres Cleveland swings it we get popper hes been burying them since the season started and here we go again right on time got to get your sniper going early he almost just had a takeaway now numbers and now Poler does take it away wow he is so athletic hes got a triple now theyre going to work it down low for NOCO hes going to go to work on the big man sonogo now he just kicks it back out to Joseph 15 on the shot clock here goes popper pulls up in his face he buried it whoa thats what I mean about getting a sniper and a shooter going early when he sees one go in he dont gets into his rhythm trible to another three thats why you want to get your best shooter going early Miami leads by 11 I like the energy though from FIU their bench the head coach Jeremy Balor theyre very engaged in the game Super engaged deep three on the way no good Arturo Dean not in Rhythm fired it off the right side of the rim Here Comes Kean George in transition tries to get his way to the back the the basket and then was blocked by sonogo great defense I love the attack mode by The Freshman got to be on Attack Mode at all times Applause Music Applause Music Applause Hawkins dribbling the basketball out near half court hes got a couple of threes and six early points is he going to shoot another one yeah that ones way off the mark FIU is not scared to shoot the Deep ball theyre two for n in that department early Miami 4 of five from Beyond The Arc heres Cleveland hes going to try to back Hawkins down low picks up his drift now he gets it right back mismatch Miami loves this matchup right here Cleveland Fades away and he bar great shot you notice how Cleveland got to a spot in the elevator over the smaller Garden thats what you want to see from my Dynamic G Matthew cl play per in the post well welcome to the show that they call wga popper around here hes buried a couple of Threes first one a piece of cake and then NOCO found popper and he buried another Music one well back here in Miami tonight and to start the season it has indeed been the W of popular sh hes got a couple of Threes tonight he set new career highs in points in Back toback Games had 21 versus NJIT in the opener and 23 three last Friday against UCF on a night in which they unveiled that final four Banner high in the rafters here with the watsco center Wugga popler is one of the guys thats going to be held responsible for picking up a lot of the scoring in the absence and departure now of Jordan Miller and Isaiah Wong here comes poer he just got fouled who that was dangerous that was dangerous and mis not happy about Music it wow that could have been very very dangerous and I think the officials want to take a look at Applause it yeah I think thats got to be an intentional foul you cant grab him by the hip on his way up you got to make a play on the basketball that should be an intentional foul I mean its easy to see it and say oh it should have been that he was going for the ball you know in live action you dont really know how to react but you know in situations like that sometimes you want to jump off two feet jumping off one foot kind of puts you in a a tough position when it comes to finishing the back basketball and a fast break tight like that so itll start as a common foul on Arturo Dean I would imagine thats probably going to escalate though you cannot just go grab somebody on their way up to flush a ball and grab him right around the hip I also dont think Alro Dean thought he was going to elevate like that so Music quickly after further V review the call CH from FL one all right so its going to be a flagrant one and thats going to be on our tur oine heres another look at it you just you got to kind of let him go when hes up there near the rim unless youre making a play on the ball and youre going to Tred to block it so popler will go to the free throw line for a couple of freebies he hits the first a little fake handshake like somebodys on the line and that goes back to want to say rhythm hes used to make a freee throw D my team up makes a pair now he goes with the real D once again we havent seen many threepoint shots from Nigel early these teams know Nigel on that threepoint line theyre doubling the pick and roll lets look they get him lets look to see if he can get some shots in transition Chad oir back in the game for Miami so popper hit a couple of free throws Nigel pacing pester at top of the key popper in the corner he elevates and he hits it its so smooth its a great elevation guys running at him two Dro pullup straight up and down nothing but the bottom of the net wer works on that every single day so it looks so natural when it comes to him doing in the basketball game Christian Watson checks in for Miami theyre trying to get him to become an Absolute Pest defensively as well hes down low on the big man abar heres a shot no good and FIU is going to come up with a loose ball heres a near side corner three and that is buried by Arturo Dean that was a big three they needed that three to startop the Applause Music Applause momentum Nigel pack has been slow out of the gates to start the season Jack just a handful of points in each game as nor Chad oir traveled thats a turnover what do you see from Nigel early you know the SC in report now is you cannot let this guy breathe you know in previous season could come in get a couple sneaky threes but now theyre all over him so were going to look to see will get different spots to get shots maybe in transition maybe off a screen and rescreen maybe play him off the ball to get it some shots early how much will the success of lets say Bley Joseph and wga popper and guys that can start to fill it up how much will that open up opportun for Nigel pack its going to open up tons of opportunities but as I said when youre a shooter like Nigel pack theyre on you all game missed easy layup for desan gens it was a turnover heres Nigel Pack 4 three once again I just said it 5 seconds ago lets look to get Niger some threepoint shots in transition or the defenses scrambling they dont know where their man is and right there you just saw it Nigel pack with a wide open three and expect him to come down with more confidence shooting his next shot as youre shooting you just want to see the ball go in one time thats all you need oh nice pass down low and Dante Wilcox The Graduate out of West Palm cannot finish and thats going to be another turnover by Miami Kanes leading 316 Miamis made six of their last eight field goals miams turned it over six times theyve only been able to force three turnovers problem for FIU is that theyve only collected three points off of the six turnovers that they forced this second game in a row that Miami has gotten lucky by teams not capitalizing off the turnovers Fs got 10 points off and from their bench tonight six second chance points the Miami none Fu trying to work it down low in North chadow Mir the big boy for Miami takes it away here comes Christian Watson tries to get to the rack and hes cut off on the Baseline by Kaka pitch back with a three over for Bensley Joseph he gets in the lane then hes stopped shot clock at 13 omir now spinning on his Defender and he found AJ Casey but he threw it away Casey was cutting and omir didnt see him once again I want to see NAD step into that shot with confidence hes passing up these open three opportunities for Drive and kicks but the kicks arent ending up how we want them to end up on the offensive end for Miami oh theres an Al you there from AAR to Music Pinkney couple of big boys out there on the floor right now for FIU packed is wide open I wouldnt leave that wide open he couldnt connect nor Chan here with an offensive rebound and he Fades away and he cant connect you want to see him go up stronger there are you okay with the fadea away there Im okay with that fadeaway shot I just want to see him shoot the open threes that he has because once you shoot the open three and make the open three now the defense is running at you hes attacking the defense but the defense isnt running at him Dean pushes off of Joseph and Dean hits boy Dean looking like step back Jack on that one great attack great step back great finish hes got seven hes three of seven from the field he leads all FIU scores heres pack again bombs away on the way and he buries it I cannot believe that fi was even one the best Shooters in the country wide open for an open three like that but once again thats another three in transition n Jo pack with six early Music Applause points Miami leading by 14 FIU slowing things down heres a kick out three on the way no good way too short and its picked up by nor chir in transition position ball was tipped right off the fingertips of petar kaka pitch 544 left the play in the half pretty looking aliu KS up by Music 14 well

good energy on the bench they are engaged theyre kind of deliberate with what theyre doing only turned it over four time theyre missing shots really um but you can kind of see how coach Ballard is going to really try to put this thing together uh in the years to come hes into six season at FIU now these players are ready to play they play for them yeah amazing they play for your coach theyre playing for each other thats what you want to see Nigel pack Baseline Bensley Joseph with a shot fake underneath for Matthew Cleveland he gets blocked I want to see Matthew Cleveland go straight up the last couple games Ive been seeing him double pump his shot and making himself smaller oh that was a wild and crazy shot right there by Jaden Brewer and a shot up no good offensive rebound nor Chad Mir now that ball is tipped Packs going to have to run it down in the back court 10 on the shot clock pack Works left comes back right gets all the way to the hoop and his Runner off the right side is no good great attack mohamd sonogo getting set the check back in for Applause FIU Panthers shooting 32 from the field three of 12 from Beyond the yard uro Dean with a team High by seven points firing away bombs away desan Music Applause G 3423 now back to an 11point game hand off to Cleveland to Watson to Pat to Cleveland they want to see go straight up and dunk the basketball dont worry about the contact coming go up and finish strong great finish by Matthew you want to leave him open oh did he just come out of the floor and just block that I didnt even see him its like he jumped out of the floor clean block to the first row of stands Javon Hawkins is looking around like where the heck did he come Applause from oh hes got to step into that shot to shoot a little bit faster we got a guy like NORAD out there you got let that ball go now Dean working on pat down low near the Block in the paint had it strip shot clock is at four and going up and finishing strong sonogo Off the Bench you notice how norat didnt want to get his second foul yeah great attack by the big fellow expect to see more of that from FIU pack up ahead for Joseph and look at poer just got fou boy they are all over poer tonight its a little dangerous a little very dangerous but its good to see wiga sming another Timeout on the floor 343 left to play Joseph up top oh boy oh boy little dangerous down there underneath the hoop kans leading by Music 11 343 left left to play in Miami the 12th ranked Miami Hurricanes with an 11point lead over their cross town Rivals FIU and the University of Miami separated by uh a whole 10 miles the two gyms are these two tangling here tonight its you know what its a I dont know if you want to call it a rivalry but its nice to see these teams get together Jack I like that you can see that you can call a robberry from Music Florida get together time is two play 2008 great play out of the timeout to get Nigo pack of Music three Applause 3825 the coach is telling his big father to calm down slow down boy no it down slow it down slow it Applause down Applause Music Applause gens has nowhere to go Corner three on the way that thing is buried by George pidget Jr the Junior at a Boston Mass in the transfer from Pok State College hes coming in ready to play Cleveland again in transition had the ball knocked away from him got swatted off the backboard collected his own Miss fired pass that was deflected and now Matthew Cleveland is going to the free throw line for a one andone Music opportunity Jonathan iar is going to check in now for FIU so AAR in Hawkins out Cleveland to the line this might be one of the games where you see the brightest shoes ever at once you got pink green and orange highlighters almost a full spectrum of those highlighters full spum you know you get to pack when youre in elementary school mom get you the highlighter that every color you Music Applause need Ur de thought about a three heres an offensive rebound spinning on omir and omir just picked up his second foul and Mohamed sonogo gets the bucket to fall once again if you notice mirs hands were up they were a little bit slanted over just a little bit yeah he fou them he actually it looks like he almost lost his balance a little bit here kind of fell right into him were going to expect a lot of the teams when theyre watching this film theyre going to try to attack oir early cuz the dynamic of this University Miami team changes when hes out the game you know you look at nor Chad in the game hes getting rebound hes starting to transition thats one element that univ might me lose when hes not in the ball game well hes been in foul trouble Jack to open up the season and Coach mentioned it in his presser that they they theyve uh theyve got to keep him on the floor the best ability as they say is availability and youre not available when youre collecting fouls and when you see a guy like ner Chad you dont never want to tell him you cant play hard because he plays so hard which is why sometimes he puts yourself in bad position to get fouls so you got to meet in the middle heres popper for three yeah that one rattles in and out almost surprise almost a surprise when a shot of popplers touches the rim these days for sure a little St St back three on the way its good Arturo Dean F BYU is within four just like that with 213 left to play in the half look at the difference in energy on these FIU bench is up down loud screaming Miami is a little bit dull over there a 90 Run for the Panthers Miami leading by four Music greatness is got ourselves a game here in the first half Miami just had themselves a real big lead their largest lead at 956 here in the first half they led by 17 that has been cut to four after a 90 run over the course of the last 1 minute for FIU pack nearly just had it taken away oms off the floor he doesnt have a point tonight but hes got a rebounds leading score for Miami is popler here he goes he rises and he misses Im loving the intensity this FIU basketball team is playing with right now you can notice theyre playing with so much confidence really believe in they got a chance to win this game if they try to attack the Freshman noo its down low for sonogo theres a mismatch and soogo puts it up and it falls FIU within two theyve had a lead tonight that was when it was one nothing Miamis LED for 16 minutes and 36 seconds and counting pack thought about a three trying to get himself to the hoop he pulls up and he misses an opportunity right here for FIU to Tire take the lead with just a little over a minute left to play in the half you want to see Miami get back into their offense theyre not really moving the ball that they were doing early on taking quick shots but thats what happens when you get down and team makes a run here is Dean you better be careful hes got a team High 10 is he going to try to pull up is he going to try to give him the lead heres a step back that is no good rebound down to Matthew Cleveland heres a two for one opportunity for Miami if they want it 25 on the shot clock 40 on the game clock benley Joseph and a cter go Bley Joseph shooting the ball with so much confidence thats got to be a great feeling for Nigel pack Miamis lead is five they will get it back so they execute the two for one opportunity potentially perfectly heres PID and he hands it off to Dean then just gets it right back another hand off Zogo handling the rock working on no woko the Freshman that was taken away Bensley Joseph had it then it falls heres a three at the buzzer whoa As Time expired heres a heave from Nigel pack FIU with a last second three time expiring on the shot clock here in the first half Miami is going to carry a 41 he believes lets watch the swag that he plays the rest of this ball game with look look at Dean right now the starting point guard what do you think hes saying man you cant guard me might be telling him look out say you think youre pretty good I think Im pretty good 1992 the only time FIU ever beat the Miami Hurricanes they havent played one another since 2008 an opportunity to start the half for FIU to tie it and lets see if they can do it yes they I CAU it that boy Dean confidence on another level I saw the way he was dancing and swaging out at halftime hes coming in strong one for one to start the second half hes got a team High 12 we are knotted at 41 all is wiga popper gets rejected at The Rim W popper got a shot popped tie ball game blocked by AAR heres a three buries it deep one thing I know about basketballs when you come out with that swag and you ready that can play out of your mind a 0 run for FIU out of the gates here in the second half theyve got their second lead of the night their first since it was one nothing omir still off the stat sheet thats his third foul dadir called for an offensive foul pushed right off with the forearm pushed off and at the same time this Miami team you dont want to get down to a team like FIU it was blatantly obvious position like this very obvious just pushed right off with his left arm there thats three personal fouls on nor Chad omir who plays a minute in the second half and hes back to the bench heres a three in the corner no good another offensive rebound for FIU heres the man of the hour Arturo Dean barking out signals the play caller Dean to the rack gets tied up ball taken away oh look at the strength from the big man Seth Pinkney this senior Out of Philly FIU by five a 70 run to start the Applause half what a run by FIU coming out of the break here goes popler to the rack and that gets SW of the way back comes the Panthers what a start to the second half for FIU Miami is down five the height the size differential has been too much for Miami quickly to the rack up and under a bucket for desan gens a timeout for Jim Lena 2 minutes and 15 seconds into the start of the second half Miami Trails by seven a 90 run for FIU weve got a good one here in Coral Gables tonight what a turn of events here in Coral Gables FIU if you go back to the first half Jack is on a 233 run theyre on a 90 run to start the second half it forced Jim Lena into a timeout Miami all of the sudden the 12th ranked hurricanes are trailing by seven here at home theyve got to get going do you do you sense any difference here in the body language if you look at the FIU team on the court and the team on the bench their body language and their frequency and theyre vibrating at a super high level if you look at Miami its a little lackluster its kind of low the vibration is low and youre saying the energy Shi into fius favor Bensley Joseph with a turnover he stepped out of bounds before the threepoint opportunity so FIU leads 40 8 to Music 41 what a win this would be for the FIU Panthers theres a long way to go in this game but its been a long time since Miami has any type of control on this thing again theyre on a 233 run they look like the better team right now look like the better team theyre playing with more confidence and you can tell theyre playing with nothing to lose its like they out here ping the playground thats the best basketball shot no good another offensive rebound this time its Seth Pinkney FIU by nine and this is where you need North Shadow yep they might have to get him back in the game even with the three fouls Jack not only does he help you with the rebound but he helps you with rebounding position he gets those big men out the paint another turnover by Miami this is incredible they have forgotten how to play basketball its a ninepoint lead for FIU a deep three on the away its short another offensive rebound here comes another three on the way no good swatt it out Deans got it two offensive rebounds another one Applause yes long threes equal long rebounds Miami needs to pick up their energy right now or they may may be going home with a loss if you notice Miami is not even really attacking B they cant get a shot Jack they cant get a shot Cleveland for three and that rattles in thats a huge shot its a huge shot by Matthew Cleveland to kind of put a halt to the momentum that FIU has right now wow North Chanel m is going to have to come back in this game and it might be coming here at the next mediate timeout Miami trailing by nine approaching 15 minutes left of play they need a run of their own to get back into it here at home theres a turnover numbers Joseph all the way and he lays it up in in thats the intention you want to see from a guy like bsy Joseph bizley Joseph finishes that basket talks a little smack to the big FL to try to block a Applause shot quick run for Miami five quick points the lead is seven now you see the crowd getting into it thats what you want to see Miamis got to find a way to rebound the basketball after an FIU Miss FIU has their foot on the floorboard they are sticking it to the canes going back to late in the first half deep three no good offensive rebound shot clock expires FIU saying that the ball hit the rim I think the officials want to take a look at it theyll go to the video monitor while we take a break 1441 left to play in the half in Miami its all 18 Second Chance points Miami does not have a second chance point this evening it goes right back to the energy standing around if you watch this Miami basketball team right now theyre really playing not to lose instead of playing to win the basketball game stunning Miami has two points from their bench tonight and in Second Chance opportunities outscored 18 to nothing Miami is 20 FIU is 0 and2 are we going to witness an upset in Coral Gables here tonight well Miami start attacking offensively Cleveland over Nigel pack three rattles in and out one and done opportunity great P hes ready to shoot expect the next one to go in coach Lena has put AJ Casey in the game and maybe thatll help him in the rebounding Department theres a takeaway Here Comes Miami and Joseph over to Pat and for FIU right now you do not want to turn the ball over and get that momentum switching in University of Miamis favor easy layups easy switch ups for momentum under 14 left to play 5348 FIU

up and he gets it to go shooter touch great great Touch by bsy Joseph and great attack once you get in that paint and you make a play you make it a lot easier for your offense to offensive rebound a little over 3 minutes ago FIU led by 12 its now three FIU with four turnovers in the last three minutes Miami on a nine 0 run to the wre shy no good ball is in the air Here Comes Miami theres a foul Bo whats fyu doing what do they foul in Matthew Cleveland for 80 ft away from the hoop thats going to get Matthew Cleveland going nice little smack to the face that gets you rolling that gets you

AJ Casey with the block Here Comes Miami the other way can they retake the lead Joseph gets fouled he hits the deck hard I really like this lineup for the University of Miami very different Dynamic fast lineup switch one through five everybody can shoot the basketball this is the lineup That kind of got Miami back into this basketball game that was another offensive rebound for FIU too theyre theyre lucky AJ Casey was straight up and down when he left the deck because boy Miami is getting H you know thats been a talking point of contention for years now how do they beat these teams that are bigger well theyve struggled the last couple of games as Joseph makes the first to give Miami a onepoint Advantage I theyve got to figure something out Jack Miami does to find a way to rebound the basketball a little bit better thats not going to fly in conference play its not going to fly in conference play it starts with having your best rebounder keeping him on the floor but it is good for a plan B to be able to play fast and use your speed to outrun basketball team and thats what University of Miami has done to get back into this basketball game right now lets look for FIU to come back

no idea thats thats a tough call right there de makes the first though he makes all three this could be a fivepoint game with 22 seconds left to play and Miamis not in the double bonus FIU doesnt have fouls to give but a couple more fouls is still a one inone opportunity and he rattles in the second Dean with 19 tonight big game for Dean Florida kid as well so its good to see him come back home or
