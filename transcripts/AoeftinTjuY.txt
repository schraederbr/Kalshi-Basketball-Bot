will counter jamarius Burton with Armando bakecock and Pitt really had a problem with baycott in the last game thats going to be a really difficult matchup for the pit inside guys but thats a problem you have to solve if youre going to handle the Tar Heel 7674 was the final on December 30th in Pittsburgh the Panthers have won two straight in the series and four of the last five and theyve won their last two meetings at Smith Center and Jeff Capel IIIs team wins the tap and a team thats won two straight and four of five and hes four and one on the road in the ACC pass the ball first this is Greg Elliott the transfer for Marquette and Blake Henson the star of Saturdays win against Miami misses on a long jump shot Carolinas first chance with RJ Davis healthy and back on the floor after that collision with Judah Mintz a week ago last night at the dome in central New York here is baconic its Federico Federico Armando too strong rebounded inside and a bounce pass from black and then bacon had it stripped nice hands inside by Federico Cummings for Federico sews the Baseline threw it away trying to save it off Baker Davis a pullup too back for him Miss RJ a second try Elliott pulls away the rebound with pit cut right there was a look at the Panthers starters Burton with Henson Federico Elliott and Nelly Cummins who is from Midland Pennsylvania in the Pittsburgh area transferred in from Colgate and heres the matchup leaky black against jamarius Burton and off the Federico screen a kick for a Cummings three caught the rebound Cummings is a high volume but a little bit low percentage threepoint shooter Wes theres a wrap around and a oneonone but Burton looking like he wants to help on pay cut digs down Armando strong and left it short and thats a nice job by Burton to drop down West pick Federico did a really good job just holding his position Applause almost two minutes old and were still scoreless in Chapel Hill theres Cummings with a mismatch against Nance I dont think he wanted to pick up his dribble so quickly now Hensons got love defending him thats the one theyre trying to find heres a spot up on bacon off the window and in for Blake Henson wait thats really good Patience by Pitt I didnt think theyre ever going to get there Wes but Henson did a really nice job getting the position without fouling Vincents had 20 or more in his last two hes had three games against the ACC of 20 or more six this season match for the lead three ball from the left corner for Pete Nance who Dan found a Groove last Tuesday night at Syracuse with 21 points and Pete Nance is a guy who can find a Groove and he doesnt have to be the leading scorer for the Tar Heels but boy when he makes that three their offense suddenly becomes much more effective look at black pounding Burton on The Possession and suddenly 10 to shoot for the Panthers starting to Fall Away Federico tried to keep it alive second chance for Pitt Elliott a three ball with nothing doing from threepoint range for the Panthers early routes yeah both teams are in the mantoman it was nine of 22 last Saturday against Miami black misses the three they caught the rebound and our first foul of the night will be on Greg Elliott credit transfer from Detroit who played at Marquette his first and the First on Jeff capels Panthers you know I think if youre the Panthers West youre okay with leaky black shooting that long three but boy you got to block out and its just really hard because bacon does such a great job getting in position Mike Roberts with the word with baycot and Federico before the ball was put in Play Hes our umpire tonight with Ron Gruber and Pat driskin high level game in the ACC we got a high level whistle Here Is Love on the drop blocked by Federico off the hip of Caleb love itll be awarded to the Panthers and Wes thats an area where North Carolina has been very successful recently love and Davis both have done an outstanding job attacking the basket good defense that time to block the shot but theyll be getting to the freethrow line a lot tonight I suspect yep heres burden to pull up on Black it was short leak he did a good job making it a good shot on the Drive Davis and one Dan Henson trying to make a play in transition against one of the most dangerous guys in the ACC this is what we talked about attacking the basket and boy he really goes and if youre Blake Henson I think you have to try to block that shot or get out of the way you know that rule is you have to have both feet on the floor facing the dribbler thats initial guarding position and you have to have that before your opponent leaves the floor so here is RJ Davis Junior from White Plains New York who had just nine points and what was only his second singlefigure game of the year last Tuesday night at the JMA Wireless Dome hits hit one of his first six and trails Carolina four here Cummings against Daviss mantoman this great defense yep very good hes trying to get to that screen up high but he couldnt get them Lewis Cummings nine to shoot launches the three thats good Nelly Cummings a 31 threepoint shooter 28 in ACC Play heres first basket of the night 28 is not very good in ACC play West but hes gonna have to make a few tonight I think Caleb love a deep three well love is three of five at Syracuse from behind the line and draws one up for his first basket here tonight well Wes overall hes not a great threepoint shooter but we know he can get hot and he can be very streaky and theres carrying the ball double dribble yeah Burton with the turnover Carolina an early four point lead tonight on it uh practiced on Tuesday and that was the full green light for the second year Tar Heels head coach and you see the Davis Improvement Wesson a lot of that has to do with that injured index finger he had on his shooting hand and he didnt get the tape taken off until after that December 13th game Tar Heels last four turned over by Burton as we went to break 15 to shoot in the Carolina possession its capable of switching one to five heres Nance with seven to shoot trying to back down Henson here four on the clock a little running hook sure Dan Larry would have liked that move that was right from his era you want to be careful you dont want to come and double team because Davis is out there he can shoot the three and if you double team then that might leave baycato theres a lob and try to Rico the tap in in West down with some play by Federico I thought that ball was too high yep sophomore from Finland who started at Northern Oklahoma College before coming to Pittsburgh huge upside bangkoks got to handle a little bit more less theres love thats another deep freeze Music we said he can get hot from out there theyve doubled the number on the Panthers thats Carolina here early almost six minutes gone Cummings trying to fight for a spot in the paint scores on a nice spin five for Nelly Cummings on his second field goal nothing wrong with that defense West the perimeter defense by North Carolina has been very solid so far here is love Financial gun for three front run Miss Black tried to tip it out love a heck of a save at the timeline deep three front rim miss that was a heat check from Caleb love well Wes he can recover that ball on the other side of the court because thats a rebound heres Cummings foul line Runner good now Im telling you the pit Panthers are really good in the midrange and with the runners they score 38 percent of their points in conference Play From Beyond The Arc but they are very effective particularly their perimeter guy of perimeter guys in the lane area four in a row has cut it to a threepoint Carolina advantage out here is Lance working against Henson just spots up and the line drive misses Im not sure that early in the shot clock less you get that shot anytime here is Burton Damaris his scores and comes in averaging just under 18 in conference play thats fourth in the ACC there is sabandi hits Federico with a sharp pass and Federico air ballgame Carolina Music West the Panthers are not really a team that throws the ball a lot into the low post so Federico hes had a couple of tough catches in there and now one of the Diaz grams is coming in Guillermo Guillermo wheres number 25 we also see Jalen Washington for the first time tonight and DeMarco done and we were talking about done today his minutes are starting to pick up a little bit his minutes are picking up because his productivity is picking up less he has shown that he is a pretty good offensive player well on the drive scoop and score Caleb loves has got it into gearbox tonight for Carolina at least early well he sure does Wesson because he has hit those first couple of Threes you got to get out there and try to pressure him on the perimeter see they follow up the screen and Santos is trying to get close to him because hes worried about the three and love just goes right by and love we talked about his quickness but hes got that strength West he can get the ball up there and so North Carolina again they can get to the freethrow line and they can score once they get there hes got nine leads all scores the Tar Heel lead is six here is Nate Santos the 21 year old sophomore from Geneva Illinois whos averaging about seven minutes a game in conference play third and left open and the three spins out he can make the three West and he shoots a pretty good percentage but that is not the best part of his game DeMarco Don launches Nance tried to recover sobandi chases it down the Guillermo Diaz screen and until he goes straight a foul called on the illegal screen that will get us to a break eight minutes go Hubert Davis tells us this afternoon what was different from the first meeting tonight were a better defensive team Dan well and they have really been putting the pressure on the perimeter for the Pitt Panthers he said Pitt doesnt really have a low post kind of guy and so you can push out on their perimeter players and thats what weve seen so far early its been really difficult for the Panthers to get easy shots now theyre a team that can make some tough shots but its hard to make a living that way maybe just one or two clean looks so far for Jeff capels team who Trails six as we rejoin the live action here at Smith Center with Dan Bonner West Durham our great crew Welcome to our coverage tonight theres a hand check on DeMarco Dunn thatll be his first that is two now on Carolina the foul going to break by the way was on Caleb love who was trying to fight over the Guillermo Diaz Graham screen done in love and picked up fouls in this half court possession for the Panthers fighting Me Up and Under and done draws a second the Nike sabandi has got enough of a game Dan to make you defend him on the perimeter and also know hes a threat on the drive too yes he has made over 200 threepoint baskets in his career he scored almost 1700 points uh this is a guy who can be an offensive factor for the Pitt Panthers and has been in a couple of games Applause first of the free throws is good whos an 88 percent free throw shooter by the way Nike sebandi went crazy go nuts at Georgia Tech with 22 points he hits six threes that day he looked like he was going to hit 63s in Louisville a few weeks ago tonight Seth Trimble is coming to the Ball Game to replace DeMarco Don as sevantes on the board he hit four threes in the first half at Louisville on five possessions two weeks ago it looked like the world was going to be his state to Jersey City heres love whos on stage tonight that one spins out Caleb hit his first two hes missed his last three and cummings dogged defensively by Davis unless thats just what were talking about its hard to run your offense when youve got pressure on the ball against you theres a kick for Savannah Seth Trimble the freshman and the guard Nike for Bandy who spot up Jeffrey Shore really important to prevent the pit guys from getting pasture now he cant dribble that Applause wow ball went off his own Foot Right wasnt knocked away thats that famous uh Ty Jerome play from the final four called heres Love Now Davis with 10 to shoot hes coming very defensively Lance was six to shoot Jalen Washington hanging out now Nance is in trouble against Diaz Graham Fall Away sure all the traffic you want and Pete Nance has got the answers wow we talk about tough shots thats some tough shot for all those Hubert Davis just folds his arms and goes okay sixpoint lead for the heels Diaz Graham launching and Trimble had a shot at the rebound Santos I think is this going to be on its on battle is on Santos this is just a situation where the shot clocks running down and Nance has to turn around and fire it I mean you cant guard him much better than that without following him Advance will take a break bacon has returned Washington to the bench as well so Carolinas built this lead West and baycott still hasnt scored a basket has only attempted two shots Armando by the way had 22 points 13 rebounds back on the 30th of December hes already got four rebounds Davis a frontring this black recovers second chance for the Tar Heel working against Federico Davis kick for Love on the drive fall away and a foul will be called on Carolina and its on leaky black itll be his first its the fourth on Carolina quick reminder this is game one of two tonight on acc Network were going to push you about 20 minutes over I40 to Raleigh after were done Jay altered Debbie Antonelli standing by Florida State and NC State the Knowles have won five straight in the series against Kevin Keats as wolf pack thats a really big game for North Carolina State here is Elliott a spot up too Greg Elliotts first basket I think the pit Panthers are going to have to make some shots like that North Carolina is dropping off of the screens and so theyre preventing Pitt from driving into the lane so that spot up jumper I think is going to be critical for Pitt tonight Carolina whos shooting 37 percent from the floor three of their seven field goals or threes love spins out beta tried to keep it alive Elliott pulls it away West theres nothing wrong with shooting the three but you got to get the ball to Bangkok Applause now hits a number he picked up the foul early Elliott on the drive blocked by Trimble recovered by breakup Davis in gear flipped it up no hustle from the Baseline official Pat Driscoll Im not sure theres any contact there West he was just off balance Elliott at the other end rings the bell on a three Wesson I think thats something were going to see in this game if you take a bad shot or a tough shot thats going to allow your opponent to get out and get an easy one weve seen it by the Tar Heels and now weve seen Pittman get a shot like that Carolinas going two minutes without a basket Davis cant find it hits in the rebound and a foul will be called on Carolina and itll be on bacon itll be his first its five on the Tar Heels with 805 to go Wes weve had played 12 minutes in this game and Armando baycott has attempted three field goals well you and I talked about pits depth and everybodys talked about the way guys arrived right and a lot of it hes geared to what they are offensively this is a tough rugged defensive these guys will get after you Henson working against Trumbull in the lane Federico Henson and offensive foul is going to be called thatll be number two on Blake Henson 15 foul on Pittsburgh but Greg Elliott knocked down an open three a moment ago cut to Carolina lead to one at Chapel Hill Bernardi pit is down there there among the last four in now if I read it right there he there theyre the first of his last name Virginia Tech and Wake Forest are under consideration both of those teams suffered tough losses last night and to your Point NC State on that line big one at home Florida State because as you say you cant lose those games right and a turnover by Carolina West is what we talk about with the net ranking and your net sometimes isnt nearly as important as your opponents net right and Florida States net is such that if North Carolina state were to lose that game at home to Florida State thats a quad throw loss and you cannot afford this those are 200 today in the net NC State is 40 by the way with a 74 conference mark listen this is a strange game the two guys we talked about before the game Bay caught and Burton havent scored yet oh look at leaky clock on the lockdown of Burton five to shoot and Damaris trying to tee one up here fires over faycott and it spins out and black gets the rebound thats great defense sure is Applause Music four on Carolina but the The only positive for North Carolina right there is Pitt has to take the ball out of bounds they dont get to go down and get an easy shot one point lead for Caroline dont forget tomorrow night double header womens basketball on accn number 16 Duke welcome pit to Cameron then NC State and Georgia Tech from Atlanta 8 oclock womens basketball on acc and always available on the ESPN app and there is jamarius Burtons first Mark of the night 153 of the year for the grad student from Charlotte and pits in front 2119 caught the double team hell call the timeout Armando was trapped with Burton and Federico its a tough pass a very difficult pass he hit when he caught it he was off balance twopoint lead for Pitt when we come back to Chapel Hill jamarius Burke and Hubert Daviss team Daniel well talk about quad their Nets 37 six wins and quad one quad two Tar Heel dossier and bacon misses a layup from Cincinnati now he was contested Spartan at the other end got tumble in the air and cant complete the threepoint play as Trimble draws his first foul and it is six now on Carolina Panthers are doing a really nice job against Armando Bangkok I mean even when he gets the ball inside hes surrounded and Burden Burden thats the kind of play he makes he likes to get in the lane and when he gives you that pump thing youve got to stay down so heres pardon the seventh Fest free throw shooter in the ACC and the free throw is good remember we showed you Carolina had six wins between quad one and quad two band pitch got seven yeah theyve got seven West but that one quad four loss whenever youre a team that the metrics dont believe in and look at that net uh this is a team thats like in the middle pack in the ACC that means that the metrics dont believe in the pit Panthers and if thats the case boy that quad one loss might jump up to bite him a quad four loss excuse me ten nothing run by the Panthers as theyve posted a fourpoint margin I think the Tar Heels have to try to play through bacon Tyler Nichols you know freshman on the floor at 67 for the first time during the dead ball a moment ago now love would tend to shoot squares for three oncoming Applause Music shot and cummings allowed him the room to dribble into that Burton tries to answer can I ball got deflected away Cummings in a new 20 for Pitt Nelly right back on The Mark with a three and he says for Cummings he has something to say second double figure game in the last five for the grad transfer Cummings and its a fourpoint pit lead again here is love Runner with one hand is short and last Touch by Pitt itll stay with Carolina well heres Caleb love from Roy Williams signature well you dont think hes going to pull up from there but he had all day to shoot that one and then Burton to miss but watch Nellie Cummings Square back on the return to just a quick three on the board for Coach Catos club and its very important to pick that they have gotten that that lift from coming black collected short and safe to dance boy what a great play by leaky black and Ron Gruber here this is a stop because the shot clock Music and Ron Gruber is going to do a quick piece of game management here Music were going to have a look at this well it appeared to us to be an air ball West right but what a job by black whether it was an air ball or not he went right after it and he I thought that ball was for sure out of bounds Music oh yeah that hit the rim on the left side you see the ball change Direction so Dan two parts this if they determine the ball did hit the rim right thats part one Music second part is now they got to go back to look at the clock and how much expires right but black everybodys watching the ball and leak nobody blocks out leaky black and he just hes all the way at the free throw line almost and somehow he makes it to the Baseline and saves the ball so right West theyve now ruled that it hit the ramp right so the clocks got to reset so theyre going to reset it to 17 that I mean Wes that is a tremendous job by Ron Brewer to recognize that that ball may have hit the rim well and heres the other piece too were were way deep in the technology on a lot of sports Dan and sometimes the technology helps you and in that case technology and now heres another piece of the officiating the ball was saved out into the midcourt area weve got stopped so now theyre going to put the ball in play from the midcourt area well at the 28 foot line right calling so because thats where the plane was stopped it was out there and the players stopped Music so they got the game square with the house absolutely its worth about four nickels Music but Carolina ran something to get the ball to the big fella but just a simple screen and roll West and baycott set the screen and rolled to the basket Pitt tries to get two guys there but they cant you know both of both Federico Federico left to try to go with the dribbler and Guillermo Diaz Graham didnt get down in time excuse me theres no excuse for saying you cant tell what part because theyre wearing different numbers so theyre looking a lot alike to me though well theyre identical thanks Applause his first point with 505 to play in the game Music good match up there isnt it and heres one that is a showcase black and Burton Federico with a nice hard screen to get hurt in an hour now Diaz gray on the five gonna do something what stick got into traffic and traveled fourth turnover on the Panthers Wes I dont think you can make a living trying to make plays in the last two seconds of the shot clock sleeky black if Carolina can put them in that situation the Panthers have problems heres Caleb love hes got 12 in the ball again hes been Dynamite from behind the line hell attack on the dribble fall away two short got it put it back up and hes going to draw Pittsburgh foul and it is going to be on Burton and thats going to be his first but thats seven on pit West the Panthers actually did a really nice job attacking love off that screen Federico Federico went they basically had him double teamed but then theres nobody to block they cut out first of two for Armando for his second points of the night dont forget after a busy dying to womens basketball nothing but net takes over following our double header Kelsey Riggs host with Buffett McGraw Lexi Brown and Kelly Graham will look at the night in womens basketball look ahead to the best games on the weekend analysis and more 10 oclock on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app Music Applause unblocked it out of bounds now Wes what part of the problem for both of the Diaz Grand Brothers is theyre a little on the thin side and so you know they need to bulk up a little bit Nance just overpowered them forehead rebound Jorges 190 pounds Guillermo 205 Jorge was the uh guy who was uh ranked in the top 100 out of ing Academy Guillermo was the much more accomplished amateur player in Spain hes on there under 20 Nationals score Music and if they called that on Burton thats two but Federico Federico yep his first bets eight on Pitt cotts now got four in the game and a chance for five well this is just a great job by Davis baycott throws the ball back out but gets closer to the basket and then Davis gets a passing Lane and gets it inside to him and thats some kind of strength in there baycots get going to get the ball that close hes going to be impossible to stop the free throw on the front rim slapped out RJ Davis will let it get in the back court before he collects reset of the shot clock and since he recovered it in the backboard it resets to 30 here is Armando inside of four to play Tyler Nichol on the drive back for Davis with tend to shoot Cummings defense Nance of three Federico against bacon commits his second right on Pitch 3 43 is four and a chance to complete a threepoint play and missed on that now hes got a one and one after a foul a moment ago on Federico Federico got us to the break Carolinas got 12 offensive rebound stand but four Second Chance points I wish you can see Carolina four of their last 20 field goals so 12 offensive rebounds is nice but if you have that many offensive rebounds that means youve missed a lot of shots and a couple of those offensive rebounds lists have been off missed free throw North Carolina doing a really good job rebounding off the freethrow line Carolinas last six the Tar Heels had the lead 2826 North Carolina with some pressure and a pass from Savannah got flown by its intended receiver and that was uh Guillermo Diaz Graham Applause hes willed Jorge during the timeout fifth turnover on pit coming on here late for Coach Davis who can open the floor up with his shooting your pay cop perhaps a little more room here is nickel catch and shoot three too strong off the back iron and now sabandi off to the races in transitions wow and that was a break for the Panthers because bacock got his hand on that ball and sabandi was able to get to it first so thats almost like a long Outlet pass under three to play really working hard for position inside heres Davis spot up that is a two and some Bandy the backside rebound question it looks like Bangkok was wide open inside yeah so Cummings working off a Diaz Graham screen and the traffic around Baytown but six feet tall theres very little Commons hes going to be able to do in there tend to shoot over bacon what a shot down while he Comics wow a dozen for Cummings he leads Pitt whos got a twopoint advantage Applause Music Diaz Graham really going at it on the inside now Wes two minutes to play first half heres Nance attacking on the dribble jumps out for Pete Nance hes got nine thats his fourth field goal when he has really had a good half West I mean backed it up he had 21 at Syracuse eight days ago and strong opening 20 but its a 3030 game here with 97 seconds to go Diaz Graham trying to drive it off got it rejected eight to shoot for Pitt and Caleb loves going to come back in for Carolina to spell Tyler Nichol Im not sure this is its best play here DS Graham trying to drive it to the best whos in great position moved his feet very well Music we talked about the lack of strength and thats what that is seven rebounds for fake cop Here Is Love on the drive and a foul on Santos and suddenly West North Carolina theyre attacking the basket the fouls are starting to pile up for the Panthers that is three on Nate Santos and thats 10 on pit that is trouble well Wes it is trouble you know those offensive rebounds were talking about the fact that they hadnt converted very many of them but he has given them nine more possessions Music well Carolina how about this a higher freethrow rate than three points this is part of their core now I mean we dont get this long into the season because love is two or three at the line and not this now be a trait of what this basketball team is well Wes bangkoks going to go to the line a lot because he handles the ball out hes going to get fouled but their backcourt guys are really good free throw shooters when you have really good food places you got to figure out a way to get them to the line foul going to be on black leaky black itll be his second Hubert Davis with a visit with Mike Roberts about it well Wes and again its a situation where yeah its much easier to say than do but you got to stay on your feet when Burton gives you that pump fake black was in great position he just got faked off his feet a couple of free throws down for jamarius Burton 19 points 10 rebounds against Miami on Saturday see black is in great position and he jumps up in the air and theres not a lot of contact there West but the rule is basically is by contact you gain an advantage thats a foul Burton says four games with 20 or more against the ACC he had 31 against Carolina back on the 30th of December Applause has both free throws there and seven first half points Quest and he does again most of his work in the lane and in the midrange thank you so they went to draw a charge and they left nickel all alone seventh lead change of this first half Applause a couple of possessions left in the opening frame Cummings out of a offensive lock with fake hot and Davis and then Burton lost it on the drive over the inline out of bounds and Pat Driscoll originally said Carolina Ron Gruber upon some litigation for Burton and now Mike Roberts is awarding Pitta timeout Hubert Davis wants to know how it stayed with Pitt but we will find out in just a moment 33 seconds you see the shot clock game clock differentials we wind down this first half it was a bit of a bang bang play as we went to the break here on the drive by Burt of course who is it who touches the ball last its Bert it looks that way yeah crowd heres because Pat Driscoll originally awarded Carolina Ron Gruber said no belongs to Pitt Panthers have the ball and tend to shoot with Burton on the inbounds against Caleb love squares for the three and so handy to tap follow what a play and he beat Nance to that ball Wes one point lead for Pitt 15 seconds shot clocks off for the last possession Music he got knocked away it will stay with Carolina with four seconds left now if youre youre playing defense here on this underneath out of bounds play kind of watch for the lob North Carolina Caleb love too dont you yeah but they really like to throw the lob in this situation lets see if anybody was going to borrow a timeout nope Davis to put it in heres Nance two one threw it up nickel the followup blocked by Diaz Graham and Pitts gonna take a onepoint lead to the locker room pretty interesting 20 in Chapel Hill off to the ACC Network Studios Jordan Cornett Dallin cup Music it really needed because Pitts defense has been pretty good but they havent been able to convert very many of them Carolina three and three on the year when they Trail at the half we told you pitch 102 with the lead Tar Heels trailed are led by six at halftime of the first meeting and lost by two as we start half number two here in Chapel Hill and theres Caleb love with a three and that goes bounding away and there is Cummins Malone has now attempted 11 shots in the game West and bacon has attempted five I dont know that that can be a formula for Success long term for the targets here is Greg Elliott who had a threepointer in the regular field goal Burke nice pump fake again but fake hot grabs the rebound Armandos got eight all of them scored in like uh hes all his points hes got six rest yeah and all of them scored within a twominute span advancing traffic rattled out for him hit the rebound a lot like the way the first half started the second half with a couple of exchanges that either win now Elliott Music and theres Burton inside scoring for the Panthers nine for jamarius Burton on his second field goal Wes you do not often see someone take a rebound away from Armando Baker but not only did Elliot do that but somehow he stayed in bounds hit by three love for Nance Music fake Cod against Federico blocked and recovered by the sophomore and a pay cut foul ensuing behind it itll be his second in the first of the half on the Tar Heel well we talked about North Carolinas offensive rebounding but Elliott just does a great job to take that ball away from Bangkok and how does Burton maintain his pivot put in there I mean that those are two really good but really tough plays by the Panthers and down here Wes you dont often see somebody blocked Armando baycott shot with the ease of Federico Federico just did yep Applause back to Federico who got the rose second field goal for the sophomore born in Egypt raised in Finland Federico Federico makes it a fivepoint pit lead largest of the night for the Panthers heres bacon out of a double team and blocked I believe out of bounds by Henson Pitt has done a really nice job Dan seemingly being able to connect the double team on Armando baycon and they have and bakatis got to recognize one thats coming and find an open teammate scoring Music and drawing the foul Wesley we talked about our Stars before the game and you saw there that very little production or not nearly as much production from those two guys but look where Bangkok catches this ball Wes hes right on top of the basket and its almost impossible to stop him once he gets it in there eight points for Armando baycott hell go to the line where he is four of six in the first half foreign Music Applause Music Applause and that really was a push what happens second on our second on Carolina third on Armando Baker Wes that was great ball moving by North Carolina but you really dont want to end up with leaky black taking that long three black just a 33 field goal shooter and the last six games but in conference play West he is six for 28 coming into the game now what now you got the Davis and cummings and weve got a technical five I think weve got a technical foul on both of them and Elliott came running down the floor and Blake Hensons trying to get his teammates Burton also helping out west we talked earlier about what was going on with Cummins and the North Carolina guards Applause so you see Cummings and Davis is trying to get positioned to defend the inbounds and double Temple technical spin called on Davis and Cummings personally second theres a lot of lobbying going on here jamaris Burton is having a long conversation with Pat Drisco okay so Davis gets his first third on Carolina Cummings his first second on Fifth lets try and keep our paperwork straight here Music this is hes saying hes innocent as we all do yes right Camden Midfield heres Burton Carolina putting up a little back for pressure Diaz Graham remember Henson has those two personal fouls and hes only got one basket coming up yeah hes been the shooting star quite frankly for Pittsburgh here as of late theres Cummings on the Drive Davis before the foul by Mike Roberts I mean thats quite a battle Wes Jeff Capel pounds the scores table he thought Ron Gruber was getting ready to call the foul on Davis and Roberts called the travel I think he was getting ready to call a foul on Davis he had three officials out here so they can see whats going on seven turnovers on pit heres love Guillermos first and three on Pittsburgh well Diaz Graham went to help on the screen Wes and then its a scramble trying to get back to baycott and bacon does a great job in those situations get in great position Davis Music tears down the rebound and last Touch by pit I mean Wes theres four pit guys there and baycat is the one who comes down with the ball the Panthers fortunate to knock it away Music Applause heres the inbounds for bacon youve got to be smart if youre a player now because the officials are looking for trouble thats a three caught the tap tried to get his own rebound finally got it now black somehow with his first basket once and again I think its the lack of strength by Diaz Grant he had the ball he just couldnt hold it and Carolina trying to turn up the volume in the building and on the floor picked by a basket and a point Burton against Nance heres Henson and a foul called on a hand check I believe against leaky black itll be his third and the fourth on Carolina in the second half now a little note about Pittsburgh you dont want to just go Pell Mel to the Panthers at the freethrow line theres six of six tonight and Dan theyre number two in ACC play at almost 80 percent as a team Music and that is four on black and again West this is what I was just talking about the officials are going to call a little tighter because everybody was getting chippy yep so thats four on black and here comes DeMarco done Off the Bench of second year head coach Hoover Davis and leaky black to the bench with 1605 to play as Henson misses the three RJ Davis the oneman fast break I think theyre called a foul as well Cummings will be ticketed with his second four on pit Carolina back in front thanks to the oneman break Applause Music Applause thats the time of the year again yes it is Applause your old friend Tim bro Brando used to say the battle of the Blues RJ Davis at the line to try and cap a threepoint trip here got five in the ball game and the accs best freethrow shooter just missed for the 12th time this year stays a onepoint Carolina game Wes Henson has made 13 threepoint baskets in his last two games coming into this one he hadnt made one tonight there is Burton working on Dunn this is a hard assignment to come Burtons into the traffic and well draw the foul from DeMarco down remember blacks on the bench with four that is six on Carolina now the fans are upset here because after the foul was called undone Burton pushes off a little bit the file was already called Music shot clock to 20 and Savannah off the reset Music and Pinson was coming off the screen and Guillermo guermo was throwing him the ball when youre coming off the screen you got to expect that the ball is coming to you turn over hit in the ball game for the Panthers unless weve had 24 fouls in this game yep here is Love on the drive strong take Caleb 15 and that is fifth field goal thats really a nice job by Caleb love struggling from the perimeter on the Tar Heels take the ball to the basket threepoint lead down for Carolina five minutes into the second half back to the curtain done matchup and jamarius Burton now with 11 on his third field goal four in the half for the grad student from Charlotte and a pit timeout Music Carolina lead cut to one we step aside in Chapel Hill Music I hit a pit wow Wes he really did a nice job he started out scoring from three he made three threepoint baskets in the first half but he has been driving the ball here recently and I think thats a very effective strategy for North Carolina Pitts got a couple of guys in foul trouble there you get a look at his numbers get those three threepoint field goals have been a big help love had only seven points the first time around in late December against Pitt shot with Henson defending and Panthers have gone with a smaller lineup Vance and Tim size to play top double team quickly love fires past Elliott on the drive and scores and again he had the opportunity to West to shoot a three but he saw that the Panthers were scrambling around on defense he had a lane to the basket and he took it 17 now for love Carolina lead is three foreign Applause Music does a good job grabbing the rebound with one hand trying to reset on Babcock and Armando Falls and Barton travels but West he was tied up with Bangkok down on the inside now if hes got him outside its probably Advantage Burton and so when Burton got the offensive rebound he went right back down inside and he was presented with the same baycot problem that he couldnt solve Weve Ended up in a lot of oneonone situations gives you a lot of oneonone situations Davis cant hit the three take off the recovery draws the foul that is the eighth time tonight that they got has been fouled bless and we said the Panthers went with a little bit smaller lineup and they were having a hard time blocking out bacon with their bigger lineup in there Armando will go to the freethrow line hes four for eight tonight hes got eight points nine rebounds of course hes Carolinas career leader in not only rebounds but also double doubles did that 10 days ago in a win against NC State in this building two dont forget our new addition of all access the ACC life its terrific now premieres Monday night youll get an emotional Journey with ACC student athletes and administrators from all 15 institutions who went from Montgomery to Selma Alabama to experience and learn more about the Civil Rights Movement highlighted by march across the Edmond Pettis Bridge Dallin cup was on the journey with him youll see it Monday night seven oclock on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app the rest I think this is a danger zone for the pit Panthers theyre struggling offensively theyre playing the smaller lineup I think they really need a goal so Bandy heres Elliott over the top of Nance air ball to three caleblove step away three missed everything Applause Nelly Cummins rest hes got 12 points but he hasnt scored since late in the first half yep heres Cummings over Paycom Applause and now weve got another Whistle Post foul here well we got all kinds of things going on Wes Henson was Tangled Up on the inside with Davis RJ Davis just picked up his second its the seventh on Carolina with 13 minutes to play and Ron Gruber and Mike Roberts and Pat Driscoll are huddling both teams and this may have had to do with Henson and RJ Davis below the basket huh thats exactly what it had to do so here is Blake Henson the six seven 235 pound Junior from Deltona Florida 11 and missed it and Ron Gruber has theres a wet spot a wet spot over in front of the pit bench and Elliot will come out of the ball game well Wes again I think this is a danger zone for the pit Panthers they their offense has totally stalled here and again they put Federico back in the game so theyre playing with their bigger lineup heres Craig Cox is about to get away from Pitt with 12 40 to go 132 Tarheel run Cummings for three thats the deficit in half we just talked about the fact that he hadnt scored in a wild west that was a huge basket he got himself a lot of room and hes been very effective for not beyond the auction 15 for Nellie Cummings Applause heres love bacon with Federico defending double team there trying to get around Savannah and love got into trouble and a hustle and a foul will be called Applause and it is on Cummings thatll be his third sixth now on the Panthers I think weve got now five players in this game West three for Pitt and two for North Carolina with three personal fouls and leaky black has four personal fouls Music yes we have Nance on a wrap around for Baytown Advanced left alone get off the front of the rim with eight minutes gone second half Pittsburgh who got a big Cummings basket now Shoots for the tie and Nelly Cummings ties the game hes got 18 now and six in a row by the panther guard thats exactly what they needed taking some trouble and Cummins bailed him out Applause nice quick bounce pass against Federico run down hits in the rebound Federico continues to do a really good job just getting in the way six in a row his Cummings getting nine he is nine in a row for Nelly Cummings thats his fifth three of the night and Pittsburgh has rolled to a threepoint lead five threes and five attempts well as he had missed from out there and all of a sudden Carolinas got to be back on the attack baycott skips for Dunn thats a two and its good for DeMarco Don and the Tar Heels keep Davidson down in the backcourt here Pittsburgh has beaten Carolina the last two times in this building theyve won four of the last five in the series and are trying to snap the Tar Heel 12game home win streak at Smith Center where Carolinas last loss was last February to pitch heres Federico on the dock up a nice bounce pass hes got six and the lead is three you know the Panthers thats something they werent doing earlier in the Year Wes theyre really trying to throw the ball to Federico on that screen and roll theres a love of three balls and a rebound scrambled Davis with it and the step back rolls off 10 minutes to go heres Burton for the ball fake on bacon and jamarius Burton now hes got 13 Dan and Caples Panthers playing with a ton of confidence now with 948 to go and a timeout 132 run by pit and Nelly Cummings at the wheel my goodness fivepoint lead for Pitt Nelly Cummins helped spark them to a 132 run of their own Wes I missed somehow as the bench reacts I didnt remember Cummings missing a three because it seems hes made everything but obviously he did hes five for six with 21 points and hes I mean hes made some big pass and maybe more importantly Carolinas not been able to make a three here in the second half in eight tries well theyre over eight and Wes its very interesting that most of this pit run came with leaky black on the bench yeah with four personal fouls and so I think thats and hes back in the game now and I think thats an indication to you of how valuable black is on defense see during the timeout Dan mentioned RJ Davis and the index finger will veteran Carolina trainer Doug Halverson reapplying some of the tape for RJ Davis and that injury hes had throughout the year Don Davis Love no pay cut on the floor here black of three left it on the front of the rim again this is a guy whos 28 percent in ACC play from three points hes old for three tonight fivepoint lead for Jeff capels team inside nine and a half to go in Chapel Hill heres Henson a quiet night from the scoring perspective for Blake Henson Music working on Don soft jumper good Burton and thats then you know burden thats a matchup that he has really taken advantage of that 158 in the second half jamarius Burton is a for sure First Team all ACC Canada and hes showing live tonight really at both ends of the floor running onehanded by Davis is good thats a big basket and a tough basket RJ Davis now with seven just four in the second half its a fivepoint pit lead and youve got to be careful Ryan leaky duck leaky black garden Burton the blacks got four personal fouls Burton against Nance twopointer away backside rebound Davis trying to find a scene heres clock in the corner I think wisely passed it up that time Caleb loves the guy who said what the hottest hand from the perimeter tonight yes Davis three ball away and Savannah had a shot at the rebound Davis raked it out of there last Touch by the Tar Heels so Pitt will have it Don dress styles checking in for Carolina the sophomore at 66 from Kinston who did not play against either Syracuse or Boston College got three minutes in the NC State victory Music 10 days ago theyre looking for somebody to guard Burton black will stay on the floor baycott stays on the bench there too with better than eight to play for Coach Davis now youre getting big cotton ready for the stretch run and black is matched up against Henson Styles will take his turn against jamars Burt good luck well Switched Off to Nance on the drive right hand score is good boy Burton is so good at that when he gets matched up against the bigger guy he uses that body to create space at the basket 17 for jamarius Burton thank you the pit lead is seven with seven and a half to go to travel a travel called on Carolina so a turnover on the Tar Heels thatll be their sixth of the night pit trying to get their fifth ACC roadway shot the lights out in the first half led by 17 at the break they ended up with five double figure scores 10 of 17 from three by the way throw one in at the horn and the Panthers won 7667 now what happened after that would it change Carolina season altogether they went 112 got to the finals in New Orleans against Kansas it did not win again was eliminating the ACC tournaments first round Dan doesnt feel like that kind of Panther team does not feel anywhere absolutely West yeah they got a seven point lead and Burton trying to make it nine and bake out back in the lineup after the timeout pulls the rebound away 10 now for Armando baycott with nine points are a little bit harder to shoot it over top of Bangkok and I think Burke felt Black coming behind theres Nance trying to get Pace lines shall pass for Pulaski Carolina has missed all 10 of their threes in the second half Mance a little soft turn around Music 13 for Pete Nance well West when youre over 10 for three the strategy simple get closer and thats what Nance did I court pressure Alfred black will stay with Burton remember leaky black plays with four here backing down love squeezes up and in for the basket the pit back court not only burped but sabandi Elliott and even Cummins at six feet tall they can run their way inside This is Love thought about the three Runner is good team for Caleb love on his seventh field goal fivepoint game under six to go well earlier in the second half of the ACC campaign game but this has got a big town feel to it it really does for it against black between PayPal deflected heres leaky black for love attack speeds fake hot and the foul might not have been the cleanest transition chance but Carolinas going to get free throws out of it and we told you this is big Dan pits eight and three a full game behind Virginia remember they lost to Clemson in their only meeting with the Tigers of the regular season Carolina lost a pit lost to Virginia and has Clemson a week from Saturday here in Chapel Hill Applause seventh foul by the way on Pittsburgh with 5 29 to go with one more to try and cut it to a threepoint Panther lead electric short barely got there to say all that to say theyre playing 20 ACC games but sweep of Carolina for Pitt would be like two and a half it feels like Cummings and Davis and a foul will be called on Davis Applause thats been a thing all night its hard on Davis in the eighth on the target it has been a thing all night so thats our sixth guy now with three fouls in this game Davis has him by the its interesting in there if thats an inside play that might actually be a hook and hold because Davis got his left arm underneath Cummins and pulled off yeah one and one from Nelly Cummings and a rare Miss hes 94 at the freethrow line he missed the front end of the one and one Cummings has got 21 tonight thats a big Miss on the front end though and this is kind of a game Nance spinning through traffic trying to get a cafe got deflected away now theyre going to go to the deck he tried to keep it some bandys out of there with it hit looking for a transition chance and Savannah scores wow I thought that was a force a little bit by sabandi but he was not to be denied and leaky black had to be very careful didnt want to pick up the fifth foul Nikes got 10 hits lead is back to six with four and a half to go Federico running fake hot and Bluff cant get in the ball tend to shoot heres Davis feeds Baytown and one Federico draws his fourth on Pitt West this is just a great job you force Federico away from baycott to try to stop the dribbler and that allows baycot to get the ball and go to the basket thats a great drive and a great pass got his 62nd career double double thats a big play and now the Run by the home teams brought the partisans back into play Dan Pinson a three off Mark Davis cleans it up plus he hadnt been close tonight nope Nance under four we go they caught skip for black heres love with some Bandy defending Shakedown in three balls tied at 61 the guy from The Louvre can flat stroke it he will shoot you in and hes doing it tonight Music it was a twopoint game in late December at the Pete in front of the Oakland Zoo and Dan looks like were going to the wire tonight at Smith Center well it sure does Wesson the interesting thing about this game is how each of these teams has responded to adversity they both found themselves in trouble and every time they have theyve been able to respond so now North Carolina who looked it looked like they were pulling away but now North Carolina has tied the game Caleb love with the Tar Heels first three of the second half Henson Federico and cummings has been the star tonight bounce pass nice play Federico hes got eight on his fourth field goal and pit back in front with 322 to play thats a heck of a thing that coming out of that timeout throwing the ball to Federico shows you the kind of confidence the Panthers had in here love boom dangerous Mount Davis against Cummings step back three RJ Davis front rim missing sabandi the rebound foreign defensive rebounds in this game well hes played great too theres Cummings a little soft Runner parsley Brock Davis so Bambi recovered and a foul called Ron Gruber off the Baseline on Caleb love itll be his second nine on Carolina were just talking about sabandis rebounding yep and the one and one for Nike Savannah and West in conference play hes 18 for 19 from the free throw 88 on the years two for two tonight two front ends have been missed here comes at 94 now sabandi at 88 those are two guys you would want them on the line every time if you could get him there they caught off the bounce double team coming heres love out of the corner nope missed everything that ball got knocked away Burton scoops and Pitt looking for an alley and there goes tomorrow is one of the foul didnt get it heres love trying to get to the other end and he lost it over the inline out of bounds and turned right back over to the Panthers Applause Burton drives the ball into traffic West and thats just a really tough play he had open guys around him but he was taking it to the goal himself and you really cant question Barton when he does that two minutes to go twopoint lead for Pitt trying to win their fifth ACC Road game of the year Cummins oh thats an offensive fine to Davis and gets ticketed for an offensive foul driving to the basket just steps right into him all four of Nelly Cummings fouls in the second half that one with 158 to place the ninth on pit so the next Panther foul is two shots on common so now Cummings a very valuable player with four fouls just like leaky black theres Davis tried to get it into traffic and if thats coming thats five it is Music Nelly Cummings in 21 points is going to foul out itll be the first time hes fouled out in ACC play and be the second time this season West there was a lot of traffic there hes the guy who shot Pitt back into this game when they really needed a boost they were down six three threes and he knocked down those three threes big part of a 132 run Applause so free throws for Carolina and RJ Davis to the line Applause remember hes one of two at the stripe tonight were talking about the number one shooter in the accent Applause Cummins has his hand on Davis and pushes him from behind you know theyre going to call that one thats right in front of the referee you can see that one easily so heres Davis now and knocks down the back end two for four as RJ Davis he only has eight points tonight 98 seconds to go Burton and black squaring off now touch with 13 to shoot Burton in traffic tried to go back door got deflected heres some banding with fouled to shoot hell take it on the drive collected short love the rebound thats great defense by North Carolina Nance thought about the three Davis will launch and they caught the rebound right back and a whistle before the shot well put Carolina on the line theres a balloon Henson draws his fourth Applause Music Armando Bay Cuts just always there West you know you say big caught on the Reaper say that a lot Two Shots coming for baycod hes got 11 rebounds tonight he is seven of 13 at the line though its a 69 free throw shooter at ACC point and the first of the two is good seventh time of the night Wes I think its important in this situation that burden didnt try to do too much himself hes got perimeter help with sabandi and Henson here is Henson on the drive missed the shot rebounded by low one point lead and a timeout will be asked for by Hubert Davis Carolina will make it a full Applause with 446 left to go west two key defensive stops for North Carolina Applause well and Hubert Daviss team has won four straight six of seven and headed to Durham on Saturday but this is a premium type event right here with a onepoint lead Carolina will have the ball but Dan youve talked about defense tonight really at both ends for both schools Tar Heels have had the last stand here in the last two possessions well this is a situation where Burton gets himself trapped inside and sabandis got the ball this wasnt the last play this was the one before and thats just tremendous defense burden sometimes holds the ball a long time so when he cant make a play the shot clock is running down and again thats not a criticism of Burton hes the guy who makes plays for the Panthers but that last play I thought was a little bit of a force by Hinson Hinson has really had a tough offensive game hes only scored two points and missed all his threes and I just got the impression he was trying to make the play there and just forced it you briefly saw the reset it would have possession of the ball if it comes to a hell ball Nelly Cummings is fouled out with 21 love and Nance just under 50 percent combined for 35 points another DoubleDouble for bacon Carolina who is lighting it up behind the line in the first half hes just one of 14 in the second half and well theyve done a great job driving the ball in the second half West for the game they have a total of 19 offensive rebounds so the Panthers really have created a lot of extra opportunities or excuse me the Tar Heels have created a lot of extra opportunities they have attempted 66 shots and Pitt has only attempted 55 Carolina on a 92 run Pitt had a six point lead with 4 47 to play and heres RJ Davis Applause now love dance right back for Baytown double team coming armandi was shot away but he traveled yep moved the pivot foot and were 277 left now Jeff capels team this this double team is really a good one to bake out his right foot there is his pivot foot and he just moves it and theres the timeout asked for by Jeff Capel so for the third straight time Pitts gonna have a chance to win the ball game in Chapel Hill Federico again does a really good job and Henson comes down with the double team Bangkok remember that right foot is the pivot foot and he steps with it you cant do that right Music well remember now Henson was the winner he provided the game winner on Saturday against Miami but the core of the Panthers Pride would tell you that Burtons got to be the guy here right well Burtons got to be the guy to help create things Wes I dont know that he has to be the guy to actually make the play but keep this in mind the pit Panthers are trailing by a point so I guess if youre you know you want to take the risk and youre on the road and you want to try to get the last shot but thats not the normal strategy the normal strategy is to get the first good shot you can get so if you miss it you have time to file and extend the game but I would expect that Burton is going to be in the center of this no matter whos the one who takes the shot Carolinas got the only timeout remaining in the game if youre waiting on NC State Florida State stand by Debbie Antonelli Jay alter just down the road a piece at PNC Arena waiting on the wolf pack in Seminoles and theyll join you as soon as we wrap it here Henson is one of seven from the board tonight Burton is six of 18 youve got Elliott in the game whos an excellent threepoint shooter although he hasnt played very much and youve got Nike sabandi who is a guy who can score and weve also seen the screen and roll for Federico tonight wow element of surprise I think that would be a risky play theres the inbound for Burke black plays with four hell guard jamarius Burke oh they may be trying to take it down West they are theyre going through the last shots there are Elliott with the screen heres Burton working against Davis into traffic foul with 34 foul is on RJ Davis his fourth 10 on Carolina with 34 left and so its Burton they clear out for him they drop everybody down below the freethrow line down along the Baseline and they create a wide open space for him in the middle and Wes we said the normal strategy is to take the first good shot so in case youre mid but Jeff Capel said aha were going for the whole thing here and here theyve got burden for two jamaris Burton has started his career Texas Tech on Wichita State from Charlotte is 91 in conference play he is four for four tonight first one is good game tied Burton with 11 in the half and now 18 in the ball game Carolina does have a timeout left free throw good pit in front with 34 to go Accord to Davis two one RJ calls a timeout with points six left to go they broke the timeline called the timeout and Pat Driscoll to double check the time here yeah theyre going to look at the clock West but in that situation Music okay on the top left is your clock and RJ Davis calls the timeout well Wes it doesnt matter when he calls the timeout what matters is when the timeout was granted theres Patrick Driscoll pointed maybe a tenth who knows thats hard to say they could put as much as one up there but Music so Pat Driscoll and everybody they seem comfortable with the Euro 06 both zero six is where it stays okay theyve had a look youre Hubert Davis what do you got time for here well you dont have a lot of time once you have time now remember if 04 is the thing where that gives you a chance to catch the ball so you have very little time to do anything except catch the ball and shoot it so you want to get it as close as you can to like if Bangkok catches it hes got barely time to turn around and shoot it I think youre looking for lover Davis headed toward the basket though on a catching shoot love will put it in play theyre going to throw those Caleb law from black its a Bandy and Pittsburgh has beaten Carolina 6564 the Panthers win for a third straight time at the Smith Center Music and thats all you have time to do Wes and Nike sabandi does a great job getting pressure yep
