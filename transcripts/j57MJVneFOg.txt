diir Davis easy big fella easy as Syracuse now has possession coming out in those iconic all orange uni Syracuse arrives feeling the toall of blown double digit leads of backtoback games LED Virginia Tech by 13 before losing in overtime on Saturday in blackburg heres Davis the drive on back crosss kick out wide open for Lucas Taylor right on Q Taylor rips it just under 37 from outside for SMU the starters number three Chuck Harris is the second leading score all five starters average at least 10 points a game and thats big time for SMU that was that is what makes them great they have a lot of guys you dont know each night can give you something special and theyre looking for that on this senior night for as some you m things Syracuse number two JJ Sterling is a high volume scorer at 18 a game and number four 44 Eddie lamin leading rebounder in ACC play thats going to be a battle against 72 yigu and theres lamin inside getting it done SM someu very good defending the pains and thats a big time matchup coming into the game tonight the lampin being a vet and then you got eatu a young Rook hes coming in here hes going to learn a lot tonight but Im sure big fella is prepared and ready to go poopy put it on the money for yiku but the Freshman from Turkey cannot convert and for a team like Syracuse you got to understand you want to build momentum going into the tournament also after seeing what NC State did last year in the H tournament they believe they can do the same thing it was great spirits in shoot around before the game as thats the leading score JJ Sterling nearly knocked it down oh go boopy quick the other way off balance and gets it to go welcome back poopy Miller and thats what SMU was missing in their Cali trip they needed a catalyst I mean I last five games actually they needed their Catal to push the pace and give two feet into the paint and make plays inside lamin that is batted Away by yatu and as SMU going the other way Matt cross cleaning it up and the senior gets SMU on the board and Matt cross doing what he does better does best and thats rebound the ball and just get Buckets senior night here inside Moody Coliseum cross just under 12 points per game there is Miller nearly took that away from jquan Carlos Taylor turning the corner long two its good thats the start that Lucas Taylor was looking for a quick five and L Taylor look like he very comfortable early here in Dallas hoopy Miller returned to practice yesterday for SMU did not make that West Coast Swing to California as he is knocked away and its going to stay with SMU and this right here is what SMU is missing having a guy like booby back in the lineup gets downhill sees a gap and just gets to the pain then makes a nice little floater here so is a bruis left foot how are you going to know the old that boy Miller is okay I mean I think that just shows right there that quick little burst getting to that Gap attacking the 45 is just going to show that he still has that burst that you need him to have for this team to be successful but Ive had foot injuries before and Lord knows I know what they are like but just seeing that its a good sign for them and cross is Bump there by Jer Davis number one on the senior out of Delaware and this is my third time doing the SMU game and I just like how they try to get everyone involved they want to get everybody touches to try to get them a rhythm and uh bopy Miller is a good Catal is a great Catalyst for that just getting everybody a touch and everybody look to get a accl into the game oh hes got a lot of weapons is this is Harris beautiful touch for Chuck Harris averaging 13 shots per game in the last five without boy for sure and his role goes back to being doing what he does best and thats score the ball with booby being back in the lineup Chuck can just go back to going to get Buckets not worrying about getting everybody involved lampin lost it into the hands of SMU boy Miller swing pass to BJ Edwards heres the big fella inside lamin on Yu The Bigs banging and its going to be a foul on lamin got to keep him out of foul trouble thats one of the best post players in the ACC five double doubles in the last six games and for lin you got to understand like just make him score over top of you he hasnt scored over top of you yet let him work the game and see if he can score on you first before you start reaching and digging in there Miller B two cross nearly had it here comes Starling Full headest Steam and that is JJ Starling 18 points a game and he he hes really the key for Syracuse when JJ Starling plays well he scores about 20 points and he scores 20 points Syracuse typically win shock Harris another bucket we got a track lead early on I love it I love it both guards on bigs guards everybody trying to get a bucket and I love this energy right now this pace favor either team this pace right now favors uh SMU SMU is a little bit deeper but Syracuse they got a bunch of dogs over there like I said theyre playing good basketball as you can see JJ staling right there feeling it feeling it right now so these guys they theyre ready to play and like I said they feel they have a chance to make a run in a tournament and you never know just like that in State team last year you didnt you didnt think that was going to happen and it did cross too long from the U and a tough rebound there by BJ Edwards fou on the floor H JJ Sterling hot star for both team team Syracuse five of six from the field JJ Starling getting that corner three SMU great for them to get boy Miller back he had the first du and its a fourpoint q Music lead opportunities are is tough and most of those are coming from inac play so you want to give your T give your team a chance and thats great hands Jer Davis there hands but like I said you want to give your te your team as many chances as you can to get these quad one wins because those things matter as you can see in the SEC theyre talking about South Carolina being a uh in the tournament and they lost every game in the SEC and so you have teams with jool lardys bubble watch and Texas and OU ahead of SMU and the projections Texas has four quad one wins U has five and and that that comes to the strength of schedule I mean it helps them with SEC being so strong this year but you got to you got to pack your team pack your schedule in a little bit and try to dig out these quad one wins as much as you can second chance for the Bruiser lamin Nimble on the feet KS it out to Carlos Carlos had the bomb three late in regulation to force overtime against Virginia Tech and they call it on the floor do not count the bucket for Eddie lamin Adrian ay second season as Syracuse head coach went from 20 wins in year one to 12 and this season number two told us and shoot around today we fight until the end this is a team thats still locked in and engaged 100 like I said before they have a chance to make a run in the ACC tournament and you want to be playing your best basketball right now and this is the time to do Music it five and seven start from the field for the orange David on Cross backs him down and tried to muscle in for two thats a Applause foul what if they going to let him play Let him play I like it all eight now 10 points for SMU in the paint attacking the hoop early and thats a big time drive by Matt cross known as a shooter known as a guy that can stretch the floor but got to the paint on that drive right there thats just only going to open up the shot Applause Music Syracuse at 73 points per game this is a different team though thats coming out with this start Lucas Taylor hitting from Deep yeah Lucas Taylor like Klay Thompson right now he might coming to Dallas my goodness just locked in I guess the MERS can using right now huh they can use everybody heres Carlos in transition Taylor why not Syracuse refuses to miss it has not been the season the ore wanteded but you would not tell it by the way they start of this game and and the number one thing right now is Lucas Taylor he made the shot but Carlos big time pass Lucas Taylor is in his badge shooting the ball at a high high level as you can see jquan Carlos here finding a shooter finding a hot hand and knocking it down got a little Klay Thompson feel going to him right now I mean he is feeling it Lucas Taylor may have just made the greatest turnaround in ACC history from fouling out in 12 total minutes at Virginia Tech to 11 points in the very early going and this must win for SMU he had to get them shots up early cuz he knew he might foul out really quick urgency always helps does it not for sure heres the big fella freshman from Turkey wrestling inside and what the call and its going to be a jump ball moments ago we saw yatu on the bench ER getting ice that has been something that SMU has done with him since the North Carolina State game they to share the Freshman from Turkey stays healthy and whats interesting right now you would think Syracuse is on the bubble the way theyre playing the intensity Syracuse has right now and the attention the detail and the fight theyre theyre taking to SMU is really impressive and I Im interested to see if SMU matches their intensity heres Harris from the ACC logo that missed everything got a shot clock violation so a Syracuse team that has struggled defensively coming up with the first shot clock violation of the night and Syracuse is just taking a fight to SMU right now SMU turning into a 221 press just changing up the look for him and try to get a get a spark somewhere Taylor has 11 Starling has five SMU just has to take a something away from from Syracuse right now right now Syracuse is very comfortable with Lucas Taylor getting to the basket there but end up missing and getting the loose all on the floor but the shot clock will expire it shouldnt cuz that hit the rim and so they are talking about that and theyre saying no it is a shot clock Music violation I thought they hit the rim on the drive apparently Lucas Taylor did not what a start for Syracuse and 181 Lead the lead has not been the issue for the orange holding on to it thats been problematic for sure and that just comes from maturity and just understand the time and score and I think these guys are learning that but hopefully they can come out and and go from what they did not do in the last game heres the only Mustang on the floor currently with points hes got four that was nearly thrown away Starling took a shot and so did Chuck Harris and now we have a whistle Starling flew in to try to take that basketball away now coach atrey is checking him out both players shaking up yes Starling jumping the Gap and oh man yeah direct contact like he might got him in the temple that was head to head no doubt Music oh yeah yeah Chuck might have caught the worst of that though so JJ Starling Chuck Harris Collide check on their condition Syracuse leads 1810 here in Dallas Music Music sh Music Music orling heard it the beginning of the Season he got back Donnie Freeman gets hurt hes now out for the rest of the season and Starling was looking good early yeah and that just hurts because you you you built the Rhythm you built the type of confidence amongst the team and when a guy goes out like Starling its going to be its going to be tough and with with those guys going at the game its its going to be a tough thing for Syracuse but this is another way to show who else can step up who else can come in and provide a spark for the Syracuse team whos gotten off to a really good Music start so still taking time to get everything cleaned up losing JJ Starling thats an 18 point per game producer the leading score for Syracuse what kind of impact is that going to make for this team I mean its going to make a Big Time impact because like like I said he hes the head Catalyst of the snake he he gets things done for this team and you those thats a guide to end in the game that youre counting on so you want to have a guy like JJ staring in the game but like I said next man up mentality you want to have these guys come in and see who can step up and make plays at the end of the game and this just gives another opportunity for guys like Chris Bell and Lucas Taylor to step up and take more of a range of scoring Music low SMU will inbound kry o Oquendo who in the words of Andy Enfield was the most impressive in boofy Millers absence is in Edwards with two on the shot clock front rim Second Chance Miller hesitates and weve got a travel on boy Miller has to be turnover and thats the reason right there you want to see boy get back in the game right now and not wait till the ACC tournament because you need to get a little bit of that rust out hes been out five games you want him to work these Kinks out right now especially at home and against a a good team of uh the Syracuse Orange the orange with five on the court and have yet to score in this matchup that changes right there with Jake Juan Carlos what do you like about the senior from Brooklyns game J car Carlos is really dictating the pace of this game right now hes been a better point guard so far and hes just controlling the pace getting his guys good looks and get to the pain and scoring also oh quendo the long three yes for SMU and thats a big time shot it just settles SMU down a little bit they were on the scoring slide a little bit and now they can get back into this game and see if they can get a little more spark but a quindo like you said he he was a guy while bopy Miller was out that played very well and hopefully he can continue to do that Music Applause Music now heres cuff Off the Bench and draws the foul so around the SMU theyll tell you youre going to know what you get from a quino pretty quick you can usually tell in the first shot for sure and hes a guy that can just fill it up in bunches you know you kind of know what youre going to get from him every single night and he steps up to the occasion majority of the time its and as you can see right there knocked down his first shot and theyre looking for him to do a little bit more of that heres Kyle cop at the line just under 80 for the charity strike second on the team coming off a 13point performance in blackburg is second most this season out of 14point game against wake and the orange with the 2113 lead and youre surprised by this start for SMU for sure I mean you would think they would come out a little bit more desperation and a little bit more fight than they are right now and maybe they they just have to settle into the game but like I said its tournament time for them right now they dont have time to be settling to any game its its either a die for those guys right now that was Keon Ambrose Hilton looking for only his fifth three of the Season CU quickly takes it the other way and makes SMU back yeah like I said SMU looks like theyre just sleepwalking right now Syracuse is just taking the fight right to him and I dont see anybody from SMU with right here ready to respond thats a response that is Ambrose Hilton maybe it was a senior night festivities for a guy like Ambrose Hilton for sure guys like a quindo hambros Hilton those guys they know this is their last game at home and Im sure they dont want to lose that I lost my last game off a buzzer beater from half court so I I it wasnt a good feeling for me so I I I would think these guys feel the same way do you feel the ceremony before the start of the game can be a distraction 100 I can definitely say that you can get a little bit caught up in the emotions of this being your last game and not just you got to find a way to just lose yourself in the game as coach used to say that was ined out by Carlos this skip wide open for a quendo yes theres two for Carri and like you said thats senior to senior these guys understand the magnitude of the game they understand whats on the line and they just making play Chris Bell Dead Eye from three in conference play 44 great pass and it keeps moving cof got it blocked what an effort by o quindo to reject that out of nowhere and hes been a great Spar for this right now hes just coming here making plays on the offens and and defense defensive end as you can see that one was nearly jumped by Movic and a tough take and Ambrose Hilton draws the Music whistle and thats just big time from Ambrose Hilton and a quendo get him out here a quendo contesting a shot not fouling at the same time thats just a big time defensive play and then coming here with ose Hilton making a skip pass to his senior buddy running mate and knock it down to three from uh look at that up qu Ambrose Hilton knocks down number one super Tuesday presented by Progressive continues tonight on ESPN at 11 Eastern Caleb love in 24th ranked Arizona hosting rival Arizona state wild cats projected 4C Joe lardy and Bracketology lot on the line in this game Theo this is one that SMU cannot afford to lose lenardi has them among the next four out meaning theyre on the wrong side of the bubble 100 I think this game is Monumental for these guys and they understand that they just have to bring this fight to Syracuse ultimately if they lose this game they got to damn near win the whole ACC tournament and I think they want to do that anyway but it it just makes it a lot harder for them speaking of fight Harris back on the bench looking like he just took on Mayweather Lan was trying to go inside to Davis SMU the other way Miller nearly pulled the trigger heres cross o quindo thats his spot case of points three for three for Cario o quendo from outside and thats just big time basketball there from the SCU Mustang everyone and everyone on the floor touched the ball and and quo got rewarded being the senior leader set up Bop back cross going driving the 45 kicking it to his senior mate in the corner knock down to quo Big T Shai SMU T Music game three St from outside hes found his spot and hes comfortable there yeah I mean hes shooting the ball at high level I think they just need to go get him the ball right now JJ Starling returns this is great news for Syracuse after he was involved in that collision with Chuck Harris he did not look good sitting on the bench being checked out yeah for sure he did look like he was a little woozy but he came back in the game and look like hes ready to fight with his teammates Chuck Harris is back on the sine now so cuff wants it all great start for him five points and you dont pay attention to the little things with JJ going out cuff minutes got pushed up a little bit more so he he got a little bit more comfortable in the establish into the game but you cant leave him maybe a heat check there for quendo cross the offensive rebound shoot it again stay hot right hey he listen Theo I might be to to be a coach or something sign Theo Pinon up come on man no quos just being very aggressive and understands whats going on and hes hes carrying the SMU Mustangs right now Chris Bell for shot of quindo fantastic defense hes doing it on both ends of the floor thats going Music up SMU is doing a good job getting everybody involved and just everyones getting rewarded toat gonor and one thats how you clean up your own mess get out the broom and the vacuum go to work and thats just a big time staying active on the boards not F not understanding that you might miss it following a shot and then getting back and finishing the play another senior Corners first year at SMU he was an 11 Point per game score last season at San Jose State hes had to adjust to a new role its a guy thats now averaging under two points per game in his final year and Im sure thats not what he came here and wanted to do but hes coming into the game on his senior night and being productive and thats all you can do right now just be where you are be present and do what you need to do when he come to a bigger program I imagine to have that chance of the ACC playing the NCAA tournament and it would be shocking if the four seed and the ACC tournament which SMU is in play for if they were to miss the NCAA tournament and Im Im going to be completely honest SMU is a tournament team they have the talent to go into the tournament and make some noise they just have not had enough quad one opportun unities or quad one wins to get themselves implemented into the NCA tournament so Lankin goes to the line jell Colbert with the foul so in the case of SMU is the film better than the metrics 100 they they they have everything you need to be a quality NCAA tournament team and Ive seen it before this is my third game doing them and I every time I come here they have impressed me and like I said even right now they kept started off sluggish and they got a twopoint lead in Syracuse you would say you would think they have been playing better than SM Eddie lampin to the line and a lot of times I tell you when you go through the mock selection process that when it comes down to Bubble teams you see them here in the ACC you ask yourself who do I not want to face if Im a coach who do I not want to see in the tournament and the answer to that is the team that should probably be in Hey listen Im not advising anybody to lose but I would do what I can to not see Duke in the first round in the second round so for these guys you you at the end of the day you want to get in give Your Best Shot you want to be playing the great basketball right now and I think thats why I said they are in the tournament mode right now because you want to play your best basketball going into the ACC tournament a quendo looking for his four threepointer Off the Mark great to see Chuck Harris back in the game playing with that bandage over his right eye yeah a quindo deserved that shot he earned that spoken like a true shooter great beautiful feet inside Starling to Pete my storic freshman from Serbia its good to see JJ and Chuck back into the game having those two guys in the game is going to make this a whole lot better for us and everybody else watching we have a tightly contested one here inside Moody Coliseum Cross what a move righty off the glass just a great great shot great patience just getting to his spot and then going up and ring and knocking it down top 10 in the ACC an effective fi goal percentage meaning he hits from inside and out after thinking about it Starling is wide left tied up at 29 Eric hard to the hoop and hes fouled Lankin was there along with Lucas Taylor and Harris hes just throwing the body around and then I know tuck is like my goodness can yall just stop hitting me but great dve out here with Matt getting to his spot taking his time getting to where he wants to get to and using the glass heres that set up by Starling and Starling with the nice footwork SE not being disciplined on the backside and then finding his teammate for the easy layup so when we talk about SMU in their resume the biggest thing thats lacking is a quad one win they are 0 for five in those matchups and get blown out scoring deficit is more than 10 points per game no team has ever made the NCAA tournament since we started doing the tear with a quad one 2 three and four without having a quad one win they have to hope that its going to come in the ACC tournament thats their only shot because this against Syracuse next game against Florida State those are not quad one opportunities not going to do it and these guys understand everythings in front of you I mean you have every opportunity to do what you want to do and thats get into the ECA daa tournament its your first year in the H You Want To Make Your Mark going to the H tournament playing your best basketball and then play against the best in the ACC and see what you can do I think you cant ask for nothing better you want to match up with him and go to work Asing you collapsing on the paint theres BJ Edwards Harris one foot in the U and Grazy is the front of the rim what do you think about that shot selection I dont mind it I mean getting back into the game Trail shot no ones contesting at you hand down man down if they aint going to guard you you got to shoot it Andy infield has himself an the elite offensive team top 25 nationally and offensive efficiency great on the offensive class they shoot 177 from three heres the response Chris Bell cool and collected 44 from outside in ACC play and Chris Bell is shooting the cover off the ball right now 44 is an elite shooting percentage he started the year off very slow but came back in ACC continued to work and now hes shoot shooting the ball at a high high level doing it Off the Bench two of the biggest players in the respective program history going at it thats yatu of 72 and the McLoud at 74 that was a travel I dont know how did I did not call that one he the big guys get different rules right he went from left block to the right block I know he tall but he aint that tall and Starling has that mismatch but well kick it out got to go back to him you want to see him Blow by The Freshman little teardrop beautiful touch but if you dont want to give him the ball keep igu outside of the paint and get into the paint as Carlos did there and got it got in there had a nice little touch for a floer hea double team comes looking for that and one but draws the foul on nem McLoud free throws coming up from s Yu here in Dallas Music Music so bright come on now its so bright thats better than my Swatch watch Ill tell you that much that was my retirement GI to myself youu thises the first free throw attempt now North Carolina factors into SMU in their situation theyre also on the bubble theyre also in contention for the number four seed in the ACC tournament coming up next week in Charlotte for to get in with that double bu over North Carolina SMU us to win out this game of Florida State and they need Duke to beat North Carolina if those two things happen then it is SMU as the four seed in that last double bu and what you need to do in a situation like this is just control what you can control and you have to control these games right here so they have to focus on Syracuse tonight and then switch their focus to Florida State on Saturday and they thats all they can do and move on from there and then just hope Carolina loses to Duke and I hope they dont oh theres the cloud with the foul and Adrian Audrey doesnt like that he is hot on the Music sideline that is number two on the 74 Center Out of Philly Audry great player for Syracuse long time assistant under Jim Bayon and I kind of feel coach Atri there I dont I really dont think that was a foul great Savvy from boy and Bai the baiting the ref but I guess what they always say as my guy from UNC rashed Wallace says the ball dont lie that was the front end of the one and one Zess Uss in the modus poy Miller misses good to see hit back on the court after missing five stra SMU two and three in those games coming back from a Bruce left foot two points one to two from the Music field Starling for three and lamin fighting for the offensive rebound he is an absolute Beast the leading rebounder in ACC play and theres some barking going along with yigu thats a lot of size in the post yeah thats a big dude thats a big dude I mean he hes played college basketball for a very long time but hes back hes back in Texas Im sure he want to put on the show being back at home hes got about 40 friends and family here grew up in Houston started his career at TCU down the road in Fort Worth thrown away BJ Edwards who always finds a way to come up with those throws it up contested cannot convert Edwards 68 Steals on the year in the conversation the SMU single season record of 79 and BJ he is a big time Defender and he he he gets a lot of deflection and thats what SMU needs for him to get implemented into this game under two minutes perfect timing for Chris Bell to keep adding on hes two or two from outside its to the point right now every time Chris Bell just throws it at The Rim you think is going Music in and this is a big time response from Syracuse SMU came out and took the lead and applied a little pressure and now they come out and theyre just playing with a lot of juice as you can see the bench involved the Syracuse fans that who have traveled very well doing and doing their thing great pass by Carlos whos controlling this game at a high high level with Chris bell with a bucket and we just had a whistle over on the sideline not sure if it was a technical foul or if they decided to go to the Monitor and review part of this but there was a reaction from the Syracuse Music bench sort this Music out previous players under review for a possible flagrant foul I think it was igu and big fella so going to the monitor now see if there was a flagrant in play Music yeah it is been a physical match up with c yigu and Eddie lamin its really been almost an introduction to Big Boy basketball by lanin I mean Target 611 265 and a guy that can throw around and is willing to throw around that way I think my man got grills in so he he just test he just T testing his gangster a little bit he tried to see what he want to do oh and L just sold it oh my goodness what you say hes hes what he is 611 265 and the and my freshman yiga tou pushed him all the way across the ACC come on gave him some of that Turkish Thunder but you cant say it thats great Savvy thats great Savvy he baited him right into it ni in yigs head and you can tell its its affecting him U is not nearly as effective as he usually is lamin is being physical and making him play on both ends to the floor and thats getting to his head a little bit but thats something the freshmans going to adapt to as he gets older thats just the wild thing about college basketball now that were going to see more and more of these matchups where its a fifth year player against a first year player thats a lot of Veteran Savvy as lamin right now living rent free in Yus head rent free Yus head is just going right through it you can tell those wheels are turning uh is there anything there that scream dreams flagrant no I I mean I guess he open hand pushed him but like I Im a tough Id be a tough ref Im like I might give a tech to lampin for flopping you know what tech on lampin for tricking us like that the officials arms on the shoulders confirming before they make the announcement of what the call is and this is a good moment for uh yigu to settle down loopy to get his team together and just make a run this last minute and 30 30 seconds to go in the halftime feeling good and understanding what after review the call on the floor is going to stand we have a dead ball contact technical fou on 24 white for pushing the Syracuse opponent were going to shoot two and put the ball in on the in line with 30 seconds on the shot clock okay so a t on C yigu not upgraded to a flagrant foul Im going to be honest with you the the the reason I dont agree with that is because if you walk up to me and youre in my personal space I should be allowed to get you away from me so giving me a tech because someones walking up to me and talking I should be you dont got to hit him but if you push him away I dont feel like thats an issue and you should be able to do that Chris think coach is talking about that right now 76 from the line hes got two of them and makes some both both lets take one more glance at the contact right side of the screen yeah thats thats not a tech Im with you thats not a tech he he walking up to me he talking barking in my ear yo get out my face theres nothing wrong with that whatsoever so put it this way I know lanins a big dude but if yigu wanted to move him around yeah he could have moved him around a little bit it aint like he slapped them in the back of the head also at the same time time though with the physical nature of the start between those two maybe this is a way to just nip everything in the butt yep yep sevenpoint lead for Syracuse theyre in the ACC tournament its really nothing to gain but confidence for them SMU only has their entire tournament hopes to lose in this Music matchup Starling great feed the lamp can throw it down big fella welcome back to to the Metroplex and Syracuse just playing with a lot of juice a lot of confidence and like I said you would think oh he look at L and these guys you would think they Syracuse is on the bubble theyre playing with a high high intensity and just taking the fight right to SMU Carlos called for the foul but how about this one and this is just a great pass by JJ Sterling you got Lin getting on that RAM and Duncan and just letting everybody in the SMU crowd know about it hes got the dog he definitely got the dog poopy Miller to the line 0 for one miss the front end of a one and one short while ago connects on that this game is so important for SMU not just competing with their own resume and a vacuum but you got to consider what North Carolina Ina is doing as well will it come down to picking one of those ACC schools to be the fourth from that conference to get in on selection Sunday yeah its a lot of pressure on both both schools and like I said you got to take advantage of whats in front of you and North Carolina did that earlier against Virginia Tech and right nowu is trying to do the same thing with Syracuse and thats going to be SMU Basketball you spotlighted it but SMU is get some production of guys off the bench like derell Colbert little things that make the difference and thats and thats what it comes down to I mean every single night your starters and your guys aren going to always have it so who can come in and make a provide a spark for your team and right now the guys off the bench have provided that spark and understand that they didnt need to make a run to get back to game huge possession here foru trying to cut down that deficit head to the break and a great move by SMU and a great move by Syra changing up their defense a little bit but SMU with a great counter having five guards out there that can shoot the ball to spread him out and just get great shot what a move past lamin poopy Miller with the Finish hes got Music six little confusion about SMU because they dont have a big in there except for Matt cross he forgot he was the big orange can take the final shot triggering early but lamin got to get it off Carlos Bank is open and thats how its going for Syracuse right now got word from Syracuse hes dealing with the going coin strength decided to give it a go here to open up the second half a big Collision there with cross Lucas Taylor great battle inside and thats the Freshman from Turkey C yigu and I want everybody to understand that is El leite grow from yigu in just one in just in this game he didnt he didnt wait he just went quick and got a bucket decided to come to SMU sight unseen because of the job that Andy Enfield did with his bigs at USC too strong there from Lucas Taylor thats thrown away but well stay withu and this is just big time play from yigu coming down Court understanding where his guard is that hes stuck getting the inside position and making a quick move not waiting and get hes understanding youre seven foot just go up and finish over top and that questionable technical foul cuz the shove against lampin and theres a whistle inside they want to feed the big fella for sure I mean hes 7ot so you got to feed somebody whos 7 foot underneath the basket and has great footwork and can score at any time and like I said I can tell by SMU right now theyre coming out here with Pace a lot of more energy cuz they understand whats ex stat thats something that Andy infield pointed out with Yola just the growth with his touch around the basket and the footwork leaks and Bounds its arriving from Turkey DJ Edwards sweeping with the left and draws the foul Edwards still looking to get on the board well have a chance at the free throw line and thats a big time drive by BJ just get to the pain and understanding thats how you get back into game putting pressure on the rim get to the rim and draw Fouts just getting to the line and getting it easy two game like this situ ation that were seeing for SMU how do you balance the urgency without freaking out in the moment for sure I mean you played a bunch of these games before youre dealing with a whole lot of anxiety youre dealing with a whole lot of pressure right now its senior night youre on the bubble you know you have to win these games youre trying not to pay attention to what Carolinas doing youre trying not to pay attention to what other teams are doing and you just got to go out there and take care of what control what you control and thats Syracuse right now its really tough to see a path for to the NCAA tournament if they lose this game it would almost have to be as an AQ by winning the ACC a loss here would make it even more difficult was likely K that four seed and double bu goodby for sure and like I said they want to make it as easy as they can on themselves and what they need to do is just take care of what they need to take care of as you can see 48 of getting into the tournament right now and they need to win to make that go up higher and at the end of the day you dont want to lose because that just makes it a lot more harder on yourself and they done enough work in the year just not with the quad one wins but they want to put themselves in the best position to get into the tournament joardy has SMU among the next four out oh yeah on skates Luke is Taylor looking like the guy we saw at the beginning of the game yeah I mean he coming in just putting that cross on Jason get to his spot and knocking it in season high four Music threepointer Miller nearly lost Music it bigs want to bang let him heu pumping with that left shoulder lampin saying hold on now but its called for the foul and thats just big time growth from yatu just going into the paint and not settling and just getting to where he wants to get to and get to that right hand hook it kind of like me see imagine lampin being Marcus pagee and Yu being me just going right over the bait thats for you Marcus shots fired I got no problem with it try to get that friendly roll yiku cannot just under 60 from the charity strip the season as part of the turkey National development Squad overseas before driving here in Dallas missed them both sevenpoint lead for Syracuse a blown double digit leads in their two previous games had a 10point lead in the first half here its a great double by PJ just showing a different look and understanding that it aint going to be a great the feed keep feeding your friends the hockey assist ends up with Jer d two but that just all comes down to jquan Carlos just making a play making that 45 cut as the paint as L gets the ball in the paint just making a dump off too poopy for three too strong yeah if you just lose the record oh what a feed a little street ball loving it from JJ Starling Syracuse just playing with Pace theyre playing with pace and taking the fight right to SMU again theyre not coming in here playing scared and these two guards jquan Carlos I mean hes just getting to the paint controlling the whole thing and JJ Sterling come to the party great dump off to Davis and thats just a great big time pass and then you got JJ staring coming down the paint feeding the big fella and rewarding him big time pass Syracuse Music up you can tell theyre coming out with a type of fight and a type of want to to just win this game for him hes back in his home state and you can tell they coming out here with a lot of energy and a lot of juice because they want him to go out here in Texas with a dub eight points five rebounds closing in on another double double hes got five in the last six games heres cross having an excellent allaround game thats now eight points and six rebounds and thats just a big time play for SE right there Syracuse the coach arrey coming out with a two3 Zone to try to mess up their manto man play that they probably Drew up uh in the timeout was double are coming lanin seeing it he wants it back good battle with Ambrose Hilton and a foul thats going to be against St brose Sil and thats just a vet just understanding he doesnt have it early understand they dont theyre sing a double team getting it out reposting and making a quick move to the basket where they dont have a chance to double him what does it say about a guy to be that locked in when your last year isnt going the way you want it to go I mean just understanding the moment I mean with a guy that a guy like lamp can understanding like this is my last ride Im going to do everything I can to do to just have a chance to win and hes doing everything for his team and just making him believe that they still have a chance great play there by cross Endo takes you other away the vision and Rose hilted off the feed from Chuck Harris right now if Im asking you Im just keeping these seniors in the game theyre bringing a whole lot of juice and they understand that they want to win their last home game here in Dallas Applause Starling looking for some daylight not going to find it quick he Lin Gobles it up great pass Starling open in and out quindo with the rebound thats great work on the boards from Lan but still coming down getting a good shot for JJ hand off to Harris playing with that BandAid over his eye cuz the collision with the man guarding him JJ Starling got his own Miss cannot clean up lanin with another rebound thats a great drive from Chuck hes get into the pain of trying to force the issue a little bit but just trying to touch the paint and just change it up for SMU a little Music bit thats where I had the ball in hands right there thats a guy to get it to its still cannot connect and there is a foul on the floor and thats just big time just great play and Syracuse just playing very hard and like I said here Music up North Carolina a chance to beat the tar Hills that would be a quad one win but SMU has to make sure they do not leave the ACC tournament until they have a quad one Victory or its tough to see them getting in and as you can see on the screen they might have to play Syracuse again and Syracuse will give them the fight for nothings going to be easy in the HC tournament Syracuse has their spot confirmed locked up in Charlotte coming out with great effort and intensity Eddie lanin big reason why heres Taylor playing so hard now starting to go Cole outside shot wasnt falling missed on the drive sevenpoint lead cross on Davis a lot of contact no whistle cross over comes it fivepoint game and its been a real physical game down there theyre letting those guys play and thats great patience from Matt cross we got a bet right there on this senior night making a big time bucket for the Mustang H trying to set the stren dier Davis playing with the strain groin and the rebound by PJ Edwards Here Comes o quendo no the follow and a whistle a quo look like a running back running through there and this is just great patience from Cross understanding that is a real physical game and just getting to a spot knowing where he is and just explode in the up and getting him bucket football contact there as well Hey listen theyre battling down there well Jak Juan Carlos just picked up foul number two its going to send PJ Edwards to the Line crossing poopy over for a conversation with Coach Enfield Edwards misses Saturday in Las Vegas UFC 313 PR liims begin at 800 pm Eastern on ESPN news and ESPN plus the main card which includes the light heavyweight title bout starts at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific on payperview to buy the main card go to ESPN pluscom ppv Lindo here with the pins and Edwards missed both two crucial misses for the Mustangs trying to hold on the tournament hopes got to have a win here against Syracuse this would be the biggest blemish on their resume with the loss yeah this is not the time to do it Davis drawn contact McLoud and one and thats just big time Big Time from McLoud coming into the game picking up with Lan left off getting the offensive rebound and finishing as you can see here hes getting inside position as the ball goes up using his s foot frame and going back up strong and finishing and how many times have we seen bigs from both sides saying wheres the call wheres the contact and Ambrose Hilton picks up foul number two yeah and thats big time I think one of the things that everyone needs to pay attention to Syracuse has 15 assist SMU has eight and thats just not like SMU at all for these guys from Syracuse to come in here move the ball everyones getting good shots and being involved in the game you can tell they have a different type of Pep different type of rhythm going into this game right now Syracuse top 50 an assist per game only had seven in the loss at Stamford and the cloud converts a threepoint play how much is that just get booby Miller back in Rhythm and I was just about to say that thats and one the Rhythm Is there Im sorry Theo there it is no but that that thats thats a great point that you made there having a guy out five games and a great drive by here boy just attacking the Gap and getting into the paint and making the all one but implementing boy back into the game its a little bit of adjustment hes been out five games you kind of got used to with how to play with him being out the game but now hes back hes the head honcho hes the point guard hes the guy thats going to have the ball in his hands a lot so everyone trying to get acclimated to that again but they got to make free throw and thats been problematic as boy is now two of four from the free throw line sixpoint lead for Syracuse this has been a fantastic match up the perimeter point guards Carlos and Miller going head tohead and back the other way almost in n one just moments ago we had Carlos picking up foul number three now booby Miller picks up the foul number one and the savy by Carlos this point guard match has been very intriguing Carlos has played a phenomenal game I mean hes very hes been very impressive of me and been El leite for Syracuse tonight and hes controlled this whole game as I said before but he hes just doing at a high high level Syracuse shooting 51 from the field and this follows performance from Stanford when they shot just under 55 against SMU on Saturday 7368 loss for the Mustangs SMU right now needs to build a little they need to get three stops in a row get a buy here great pass by Boy Turkish Thunder but they have to build on this they got to get three stops in a row to build on this uh momentum that they have right Music now five points for samat gatu Tan Carlos alob to the wrong team thats in the midst of a quindo quick the other way the touch is Good carry o quindo with 13 points like I said thats a good start you got to you got to you got to bucket then you go get a stop then you get another bucket you got to do the same thing but great timeout for Co timeout Syracuse Moody Coliseum coming to Music light and this is just great Savvy by boy getting you get totally into the game and thats what you need from him coming back and finding your big fella making it easy for him and then you got a quind do coming down the lane like a a freight train and get in the Buckle SMU fight back Music Music SMU feeling that sense of urgency they know whats on the line This is as close to a mustwin as it gets this time of year fans inside Moody Coliseum they get it as well standings in the ACC its also a big factor here as Andy Enfield and SMU need a win to stay live for fourth place in the ACC standings which would be the last double Buy in the ACC Applause Championship fell the pull up to Pure hes just playing in a great great Pace right now the game is really slowing down from him thats just a great ripping go get to two dribble pull up Miller was a good late contest by Carlos and fou against SMU thats going to be against hola I mean these two been going at it all night long and Im its been very intriguing SMU coming out with a 221 press right now to try to change up the look on Syracuse a little bit C handles Music it 17 losses Syracuse third most in program history you would not know it by the way that Charles Bell and Company Chris Bell checked that a ring of the Bell here in Dallas and thats just a big time shot by Chris Bell but once again thats Carlos being the connector making that extra pass and finding the the best shooter in the ACC right now what it looks like my goodness oh got him offensive foul against cross and he got into it with jquan Carlos how about another Bell three and thats just big time chot for Bell I mean hes shooting the lights out of the ball right now you got a great Swing Swing Carlos being the connector and once you let it go everyone in the building knew it was good here up Music Music Music we ch Music for here we Music go e Music welcome back to Moody Coliseum officiating crew reviewing the foul that we just saw from Matt cross it was high contact that was made on jquan Carlos checking out to see if this is upgrade and its just to stay with a common foul so they will not upgrade this to a flagrant but that has really been the story of the night with the physicality in this game Music saw two players leave the game in the first half JJ Starling and Chuck Harris after a hard Collision both returned to the game its a Syracuse ninepoint lead Syracuse is doing what you need to do on the road you got to make Johns great play SMU Music Basketball big time stop coming out of the timeout for SM Music Applause its a great play for oh did it go off might have hit that foot last a quindo thats been his spot the other side of court that was a grown man rebound by Davis five rebounds per game third leader in that category for the orange 12 and S on the season 6 and 12 in ACC play but they have locked up 13th spot the ACC Championship next week in Charlotte heres C Baseline Drive thats going to be won by Yu and shot CLK violation so ASU solid defensive team turning the screw there on the CES Music senior coming in for senior Ambrose Hilton will set up the offense with poopy Miller given name Kevin no one calls him Kevin its poopy its poopy its Chuck Carris thats going to be a foul on Kyle C thats a tough call its been a physical game you call that Music one but Syracuse man you got to give these guys credit coming in Dallas right now just giving these guys a fight and not letting them letting it be easy making SMU earn everything Miller hesitation the kick that will stay with SMU scoreless in the last 224 had a long drive out about a field goal near the end of the first half as well Syracuse does not have an issue typically scoring points its preventing points that has been problematic for the orange this season and finishing game so this is another test for them to see if they learned from what they have went through early in ACC play my goodness flying around for rebounds no concern for your wellbeing and and thats just the type of fight theyve had all night long and SMU they just they just havent matched it to the same type of inen that Syracuse has had first ever match up not just in the ACC but all time between these two teams cop hits it from the corner had a careerhigh three from outside and the loss at Virginia Tech and quickly the other way the Finish By Ambrose Hilton and now thats 18 assists for Syracuse and 9 thre and thats what you have to do on the road when youre coming on the road in AC SE play any any League Play you have to hit threes to be in these type of games because you know the home team can make a run at any point how about another one for Bell no fighting for the rebound is lanin some Jersey pulling going on its going to be Mustangs basketball nine of 19 outside for Syracuse and thats just big time that that keeps you in the game and these guys are making it and guys like Carlos and JJ Sterling whos not even in the game right now and resting thats that just helps Syracuse and makes those guys understand they can play with committee they have a lot of guys that are capable of keeping them in the game and playing well once again a 10point lead backto Back Games glowing double digit leads for the Music orange o quendo bounce pass inside Yu the Finish against lampin what a night for the Freshman hes got seven points and lamin has to do a little bit better understanding that eatu wants to get to that left shoulder and get to that right hook if he could just shade him a little bit more and make him use that left hand might help him out a little Music bit good hands spu Syracuse basketball six on the shot clock and now you got to come up with a quick play understanding that you want to get the ball into a playmakers hand to make a play in this last 6 seconds in the shot clock on the shot Music clock got him theres cough lamin beautiful feed but its blocked rejected by BJ Edwards SMU Basketball Great Rally there Theo no thats just big time play and extra effort play you got BJ BJ coming across weak side not letting it be easy and then continue to fight for the ball and with a shot clock violation but thats what they need they need to build stocks and go down here and get a bucket on the other end SMU seems very patient and in control despite trolling in a mustwin game the smuk cars need to come off these ball screens looking to score a little bit more theyre coming theyre coming off these screens looking to pass and not being aggressive but hes aggressive and W give it to him quendo has been flexing and showing off all night and this is just a strong drive with cuffing the ball like a running back and getting to the paint and finishing strong a quindo carrying the load right now for the guys and just playing Big Time basketball on this senior night how about confidence for him knowing that he got that one five straight games as a starter with no booby Miller and hes carrying through 15 points but the coaches have raved about him hes been in this role pretty much all year being a starter not being a starter but just being a pro being these kids are actually pros at this point being pro about it and just being him they talking about reviewing this is college kid this aint its not the pro hey this has to get better if SMU drops this theyre going to look at the problems from the free throw line now seven missed free throws in a row yeah that that that cant happen and thats not a recipe to win game usually a solid team at 73 from the free throw line Looks like Syracuse is settling in to a nice Rhythm not rushing patient okay going deeper into the shot clock as lamin draws the he just trying to go right through his chest so we got a quo going through the paint with a right hand cuffing it get to the bucket with the n one SMU still Music fighting the clutch three Adrian arrey head coach for Syracuse says we fight until the end the message all season long to his team has been handling adversity what are you going to do as a parent when one of your kid runs into an issue and youve got to handle that are you going to fight for him or you going to quit quittings easy and atres words we want to develop Warriors and continue to fight this C team is Lankin at the line clutch free throw there nine points with Mom Vanessa on hand 40 close friends and family members out here inside Moody Coliseum to watch a Music homecoming htown native gets a split at the line and theres no more victories I know Syracuse wants to come out here to win but coach arre has to be proud of these guys coming out here and just fighting and giving everything they got to come out with a d haris Corner three Here Comes SMU fourpoint game and thats a big time shot right now SMU with 7 minutes and 30 seconds left is playing for the NC NCAA tournament live so they have to bring everything they got right here here at home on senior Applause night Sterling weavy SS on the clock gets it back a glance great defense by Harris one short Starling gets his own Miss and he is pushed out of bounds by Harris and thats just effort thats just big time effort and those are possessions you just have to finish if youre SMU you play 30 Seconds of great defense you force the tough shot and then you give up a offensive rebound to Syracuse and now theyre at the free throw line thats just a tough tough blow when youre trying to play for your NCAA tournament live Syracuse in the bonus JJ Starling leading score 25 Point performances in six games this year third most in the ACC been a rough night for him two of 13 from the field but hits his first free throw attempt of the night he had that vicious collision with Chuck Harris in the first half but battling and what C is doing right now thats different from SMU theyre making free throws theyre going to the fre thr line and and cashing in what they what theyre trying to do houst 12 from the free throw line SMU 8 of 18 Starling hits him Music both this is where Syracuse has to learn how to win these games up six points with six minutes 6 minutes and 50 seconds to go what are you going to do understand time and score and make a smart and easy playsolo hands off to Harris on lanin back to the turkus sensation Flex big fell Flex thats just a big time drive you got Chuck Harris driving the Baseline being patient understanding big fella rolling to the rim and lampin trying to back into him trying to disrupt the shot a little bit and big fella understanding hey thats a big time bucket for it now lets go get a stop lets see if he can make a free throw though lets see if we can do that seven straight misses okay so theyre sending a guy thats not the best from here at 59 point 6 I believe in him he going to make this one call it okay eight straight Lord how Mery one to five from the line tough I mean you you you hope they for SMU fans and Fu guys on the team you hope they come out and win this game but if they lose this game thats going to be one thing theyre going to look at and beat we left a lot of points at the line tonight thats contact not called by Harris but Starling gets it to go if he starts heating up look out as he can do in a hurry and thats just big time patience thats big time Savvy understanding you dont have to rush you have to just get to your spot and Elevate seu gets within six they get within four and then something like this happens it cannot cross that threshold offensive foul yeah and Syracuse is just and thats just a big time play from Carlos on the defense and then you have stot coming off this down Scream by lampin with lampin with the nice roll otello stuck in between two and then and JJ just get to a nice little floting what makes Starling so effective offensively I mean hes just at his own pace the game is slowed down for you thats the biggest thing with guards in college basketball and in the NBA when the game slows down for you everything looks easy and then you just make it like Carlos right here thats just great Pace thats smooth thats in control thats jquan Carlos delivering 11 points for the point guard hes in no rush and no hurry to get anywhere he is he he is under control Harris canot get that roll but well go to the line for two I dont know if thats a good thing at this point yeah I mean well see I mean this is what you want to do to get back in the game when youre down like SMU is by eight points you need to get to the line to keep this clock from continue to run and you just have to capitalize at the free throw line but they got to do something on this defensive end more than anything get some stops and get down here and score the back you got a bold prediction here for this free throw ah Chuck hes going to make this one hes going to make this Harris wishes you didnt say that oh got it if yall didnt know Im over here clapping NBA Wednesday presented by State Farm on ESPN 7 Eastern its Miami at Cleveland 930 Oklahoma City at Memphis coverage tips with NBA Countdown at 630 Eastern to see Evan Moy Cavs played for Andy infield at USC Enfield did a fantastic job with the Trojans producing winners going to the NCAA tournament and NBA draft picks yeah he knows what it takes and thats why they brought him here and hes trying to get this SMU team into the tournament also in his first year they made two free throws in a row they did CU i like to say hang the banner hang the Music banner SMU worked on this in that shoo around today they knew I guess ke anfield knew he would have to use it at some point so well see how they doing it hey but Starling left wide open last guy he want to do that went Davis follows up with two and he is a Workhorse I mean he is a physical physical player and hes just doing what he needs to be done to doing the dirty work for the Syracuse Music arms how long can Syracuse keep this Music up poopy Miller welcome back for him hes now got 10 points solid KN in his return after missing five straight Bruce left foot a run OHSU went two and three put themselves on the wrong side of the tournament bubble jardy has the Mustangs and the next four out long possessions for Syracuse land kick laid in the shot clock the hook no and cross slaps it takes the Mustangs the other way and thats a big time stop from right there this next four minutes is huge for them tournament L and poy Miller before get the shot off fouled by JJ Starling thats number three and both teams are in the bonus so thats a big time drive from bopy understanding that theyre in the bonus just get to the paint and try to draw a foul but the problem is will they make the free throws you were spot on last time it was eight straight and and SMU hit two in a row heres boy Miller guy that you want at the line 83 thats why you want him there so it seems like both teams are playing with a lot of control right now you wonder though with this pace is it still enough for SMU is it too controlled I I would just say Im not as confident as I would be because Syracuse just played at a great pace and with a point guard like Carlos has even it doesnt look like hes going to get sped up at any point and if he continues to control this game Syracuse is very very good stake andu showing a lot of poise in the face of adversity right now this is a must win game Starling turning the corner got caught up against yatu and we got a whistle thats going to be against Syracuse SMU Basketball when we turn clinging to hope that they can make the NCAA tournament got a win inside Moody here Music tonight four seed in the ACC tournament and that last double buy of the attorney starting next week in Charlotte 7267 lead for Syracuse what do the Mustangs need to do in the final 34 four they got to get stopped they got to make free throws and continue get a stop theyre getting to the line and they doing a great job doing that but they need to keep imposing their will inside get get great shots the assist count is 19 to 14 so theyve done a better job creating good shots for their teammates and they continue to do that theyll be in good shape physical match up especially inside with these two Yu over Lin touches every part of the rim and gets it to go hes in double digits with 11 now the crow getting into Applause it Davis in space in and Applause out closest its been in the second half Miller heres a quendo nearly lost it got it back Falls awkwardly and is fouled by Chris Bell three for him and like I said just putting pressure on the rim understanding youre in the bonus and not settling for a tough three getting to the paint taking advantage of his big frame and just getting to the bat and being a physical force and Chris Taylors like what do you want me to Chris Bells Asing like what do you want me to do and quendo now has 16 the ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins Wednesday afternoon in green B ACC network will have all the first and second round games as well as two of the quarterfinal matchups NC State for the one seed there split for a quendo who has been a factor twopoint lead for Applause Syracuse under 10 and it will stay with Syracuse attend on the shot clock they know whats on the line here inside mudy Coliseum and the best offense for Syracuse right now is getting the
