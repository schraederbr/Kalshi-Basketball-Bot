one thing one of the things buddys doing better its not just stroking that three hes putting it on the floor getting it into that paint and hes really good at shooting over the top hes got six games of 20 or more this year including monday night four have come against the conference and the junior from jamesville new york gets it to khadari richmond who spells gerard at the first media timeout out front brasswell drills the three robert braswell who only played five minutes the other night against carolina knocks down his 10th three of the year they tell us how good a shooter he is in practice he has not been a good shooter in games what a bonus that is to hit one early here from braswell 10 to 41 from the floor now behind the line and clemson lost it in the corner hemingway and sims down there scrambling with dolajay among others first turnover on brad brownells team he won career grand number 200 with the tigers hes already clemsons longest tenured and winningest coach in season 11 in the upstate heres richmond now griffin to buddy working on trap tend to shoot and griffin and a catch and shoot three chris tigers get the rebound and again trap helps off i know thats what the normal convention of your defense is you cannot react to penetration you have got to stay home on buddy beijing trap misses badly on a three and brasswell the rebound chris they say styles make fights were getting a look at the differential here early clemson in a drought as griffin knocks down the three its 92 in favor of the orange boy do they need to see that he has been feaster famine of late 26 against georgia tech an outstanding first half he goes one for 10 the other night against north carolina he was hitless in all five threes too good start for the orange especially from behind the line trapped for sims reroutes and scores with a right hand amir sims the third best field goal shooter in the acc gives clemson their first points in the last five and a half minutes richmond a hangar spins out knocked out of bounds brasswell that will belong to the tigers Applause dont forget more basketball to come presented by food line nc state notre dame is next from south bend with jay alter and malcolm huckabee and then mike monaco and dan bonner open bcs florida swing chris in tallahassee against number 11 florida state scott spinelli got the win against notre dame in his first game as their interim head coach last saturday they get a foul on the orange as clemson was attacking and jim behind looking on dont forget those games available also on the espn app as well as live here on the acc network Music john newman has come on the floor for the tigers alomir dawes out there as well and hemingway deep off the back iron for griffin here is richmond changes the game for him chris in some ways theyre better when kadari richmond is on the floor richmond spinning and well draw the foul i think dawes got him no there are things that he can do just instinctively athletically that joe gerard cant and tell me that the difference between the two well joe gerard can knock down a shot well that hasnt been a difference maker this year because joe gerard has not hit shots consistently they are better syracuse with this guy on the floor now you know a lot of syracuse nation is hot and bothered over lineups and this and that right and the question i would ask you wes youve known jim bayhem a long time hes been doing this for almost 50 years and hes the foremost supporter of the status quo he doesnt change lineups to begin with right so why is he going to do it now 25 games into the season and potentially by the way lose joe gerard mentally calm down all right he plays a lot hes in the game early like you got to calm down here i i think youre right i think richmond has accepted that hey im a freshman gerards a sophomore a deep three out front dawes not answered and newman had the rebound i think thatll get us to a time out but i think you bring up a really good point about richmond and gerard and behinds working knowledge of his basketball team hey guys in the hall of fame for a reason his teams up early the official grocer of the atlantic coast conference senior day afternoon if you will on a wednesday here in central new york for rama sadibe marek dolajay chris lavalle and nick giancola honored as seniors on the roster for jim beijing before the game khadari richman whos playing through a little knee soreness stays on the floor with griffin and john newman in the ball game early for brad brownell misses the jumper off the baseline out of bounds tigers are fighting it early just two for 14 from the floor chris nine of syracuses ten shots have been threes early thats why i say that this clemson defense you have to youre gonna have to hit some shots youre gonna have to beat it over the top at times theres a knock away by dawes recovered and back to alamere for the layup Applause hes right owns patolas q tiger defense Applause Music Applause and jeffrey clark says he stepped on the end line Applause back to the tigers it goes with about nine minutes gone here we go chase hunters coming the ball game for the tigers wearing number three so is uh jonathan bear a big seven footer right around the foul line area heres newman left open knocks down the three big bucket off the tiger bench huh yeah that corners open you attack that acc logo that middle that skip to the corner is open tigers to within two griffin bayham saved it out near the timeline heres richmond with five to shoot step back griffin the rebound and then boy nice play by hunter halfway home in the first half in a twopoint game Applause theres hunter at three is clemson settling a little bit here chris good times offensively you know zone will will make you do that wes and you know i always goes like that first or second time out where a coach has to say look its okay to drive his own its okay to throw that ball to the middle to penetrate with either the pass or the dribble those shots are going to be there and i think sometimes guys come in off the bench in particular wes and their eyes light up because theyre open a lot of times against this syracuse zone youre open for a reason theres jesse edwards who played very well the other night hes averaged about 24 minutes in the last two ball games and pj hall has also checked in 24 for clemson in our shot there pj halls not played in the last two ball games after seeing six minutes of action in atlanta against georgia tech gary yay on a nice pass off the baseline scores easily for the orange on a team that doesnt have a lot of muscle quincy garrier is the muscle for syracuse standing three from the perimeter Applause knocked out dawes back for hall and hes fouled Applause good recognition by alamere dawes off his missed shot thats where that retrieves the foul yeah thats where the penetration can really you know you force help particularly from that back line to to react to your your drive and like you said alimir dawes you know if he doesnt play well against miami they dont win that game the guy who was starting for brad brownell earlier in the year was uh taken out of the lineup i think brownell likes the combo of trap and nick honor but alimir dawe is only a sophomore really talented good athlete and learning how to play that point guard position pj hall misses just his third free throw of the year freshman from spartanburg south carolina gets his first points threepoint game tigers are using the bench here too chris they realize the advantage can it be productive though is probably the question weve got to answer before were done here today Music gerard playing with richmond in the lineup heres brasswell who had a three early cant add a two garrier the rebound back up strong and hall held his ground and gets the rebound heres hall again over the top left its short sims tried to scrape away the rebound we get a whistle and a foul sims hes open and i think hall saw him but she cant hesitate Music great entry pass there and sims was open because roswell was late on his rotation down and thats got to be immediate baseline inbounds for the tigers who trailed three trying to find the crease here theres sims trying to get into traffic had it scraped away and a whistle and a foul jeff anderson i think has ticketed braswell with his second but thats the jesse edwards effect if thats i in the middle there i think sims goes right into his chest but because he saw the length of jesse edwards there at the rim it was a deterrent and brasswell will check out with the second foul at the 806 mark buddy peytons come back on the floor Music nick honor quiet early foul and jumper short hall couldnt collect it and it rolled to the far side to go out of bounds wow under eight joe linardi brings us up to speed on where the orange fits in his bracket when we continue good ball game a threepoint decide lead on clemson the under eight media timeout okay chris we said at the top joe linardi says theres value in everything syracuse is going to do so he was good enough to get us an update lets do the bracket math for the orange they keep their season alive at least from an atlarge perspective by beating north carolina and must repeat that tonight against clemson to keep the momentum going realistically i think they need two more wins after that which would be a four game winning streak to stay on the bubble and in the meaningful conversation for an atlarge bid a tall task to be sure but after tonight they might be halfway there all right thanks joe off the dead ball tigers missed the shot orange with the rebound and the threepoint advantage chris you agree well first of all was joe linardi doing that pro bono because if he wasnt why the extreme closeup i mean hes pulling into big bucks can we pop for the fullsize camera why do we need to get that close to joes face first of all Applause appreciate joe doing that though chris nonetheless heres edwards shot clock going off and its a violation on the yard back to the matter at hand however do you agree with the fourgame streak you win monday you win today then throw two more on the fire in greensboro i do and heres the unfortunate thing about games that have been canceled for syracuse west theyve lost out on two games with louisville which would have been without malik williams in those games and they lost the game against florida state at home now would they have won all three of those probably not but they certainly could have went two of three so thats where yeah i agree with joe and its in part a byproduct a of how syracuse is played but b a product of the way this season has gone in terms of games postponed or canceled by the way jesse edwards just picked up his second chris at the 656 mark and pj hall back to the line where his only point has been scored here in this first half and that one rattles around and bounces out for pj as here comes mark dolagh back remember we told you hes playing with a banged up finger on his left hand but a senior from bratislava in slovakia giving it a go paul got the back in Applause if i ever would have said it but two fouls on jesse edwards is a big loss yeah i mean hes been he was huge in that carolina win i thought he changed the game hes got 16 rebounds in their last two games they are better with him on the floor hes playing premium minutes too i mean hes averaging almost 25 minutes the last couple ball games that shows hes hes earned the confidence of his coach in some respect gary would tend to shoot twopoint game and last touched by the orange Applause you mentioned the confidence of his coach i was reading stuff after the game the other night and coach behind still saying that jesse edwards is not ready and look im not no coach is going to intentionally leave a guy off the floor or on the bench if he doesnt believe he can help his team i think theres a difference between developing and not ready okay jesse edwards is developing but hes certainly ready i think to at least help this team you know look if hes not ready then you look around the room and nobodys walking through that door well then hey the guy whos the closest to being ready and helping us in that particular spot hes going to have the remainder of this year to get ready if hes not already right and the ball last touched by hemingway in a corner with gerard defending young man from amsterdam has played very well six and a half points eight rebounds hit half his shots in the last two ball games of course had the big ball game monday night against carolina twopoint lead for the orange under six minutes chris we kind of thought it might be low scoring not this low scoring but low scoring nonetheless and a block by sims of a dollar drive saved by to griffin and he missed the three Applause and honor our trap rather will be whistled for the charge Applause first on trap four on clemson block here by amir sims had something to say about it too after he was done you know we showed the turnover numbers from that last game clemson 20 turnovers to syracuses eight of course clemson still won the game early i think the pressure rests from clemson particularly on the ball has bothered syracuse and hits its a twopointer for joe girard pushes the lead to four syracuse four of 12 now from three five of 18 overall from the floor hemingway this badly bare the rebound Applause Music gerard leads the transition chance and will back it out to set look at the field goal percentages gerard and the rebound for trap Applause and fouled by dolozza in the middle of the floor five on the orange Applause first you know thats kind of a euro foul to stop the fast break but the wreck does fowls are at a premium to me thats not a good foul Music especially with edwards and braswell already having two chris absolutely hemingway connects 20th three of the year for alex hemingway came into the ball game six of his last eight from behind the line hes gotten clemson to within one bayheim to answer and does cant go over the top of screens youve got to stay locked to him really good screen and a nice flare off of it to create the space Applause heres honor thats deep and short and hemingway tried to make the save did to simms and it got knocked away by the orange it will stay with the tigers low scoring game four point lead for the orange seems as good a time as any to remind you about the acc three point challenge app presented by new york life thatll help benefit the local boys and girls club score points for your school and after the tournament the local boys and girls clubs will receive a donation from new york life based on their affiliated acc teams final ranking not that any records are going to be set so far chris but threes of plenty here in the first half for both schools but the 1814 score in the shooting percentages what do they say to you wes not good not good so far and its defensive driven hows that the shot clock going off the bank three almost landed off the hannah trap heres bayheim baseline sims challenged him so did hunter tyson in a foul call mark dolagh is a really good passer five assists in the game the other night against north carolina and a really good back cut there you know clearly in the timeout brad brownell talking about denying over playing buddy behind good back cut and a nice fine by dolga fifth foul on clemson first on the senior amir simms knocks them both down eight for buddy behind Applause tigers havent turned it over much chris thats their fourth here in the first half well the longer you make a team play offense the more likely they are to make a mistake and thats what the zone does it forces ball reversal forces you to make decisions you dont normally make there arent a lot of teams that play exclusively zone so the longer you stay in it greater chance youre going to air theres a foul off the ball on quincy gary sixth on syracuse coming up at the break the state farm halftime report apparently mark packard now makes some sort of appearance chris to discuss acc player of the year and well have highlights and stats for you as well surprise surprise i never see you guys on this network ever thank you bless your heart for your patronage uh here is gerard rebounded by tyson its more packer than me youve noticed that right catch and shoot three hemingway you can always score early though a transition three or any transition bucket you dont have to play against that zone threepoint game clemson 17 points equals their lowest scoring half of the year by the way just ahead of two to go miss jumper from bahan slapped out in the second chance griffin has no problem neither does gerards three Applause another chance baeheim left open oh and a front rim miss a fourth try gerard finally converts it brad and brad brownell is going crazy at the bench wow coach of the tigers not happy hey chris syracuse has six offensive rebounds in the first half three came in their last possession and brad brownell had to have a timeout for his own wellbeing if not his teams and i dont blame him for being upset i will offer this threes long shots are typically long rebounds and theyre the most unpredictable caroms to judge its not a defensiveness guys but its a little bit of an explanation i dont think it would hold up well in the meeting room by the way heres yeah john newman got to the iron it goes out of bounds in the corner and will belong to the orange with 91 seconds to go all of our rhetoric not going to sit well with the native of evansville indiana who by the way has done a heck of a job at clemson chris oh yes he sure has especially this season Applause and the long rebound again collected by the orange and now were going to get a foul on griffin crashing the party at the glass Applause syracuse one more offensive rebound for the orange might have been it for clemson on the floor huh Applause so free throws coming up for the tigers and heres hemingway 15 of 17 at the line this year he leads the tigers with seven in the first half chris Applause brasswells returned and Applause amir sims wanted to call on the deck i dont think hes going to be that fortunate and theres no need for this theres just no need thats not a guy braswells not a guy you have to fly out man thats knowing your personnel braswell 22 from the year on three he wants to drive that thing you can close out short keep him in front instead you give him you give him free throws and he gets three here chris and by the way hes now 12 of 13 at the line this year is that on me i said he was 12 or 13 he missed is that on me nope must not got the back end has five in the first half sixpoint game Applause oh threepoint lead for the orange 10second differentials we wind down this first half brasswell again and you can hear the official saying that hemingway was holding him on the blockout but i mean you know look you get the benefit of the doubt to the guy boxing out there particularly if dolezais trying to come over the top dolagh missed the front end Applause tigers can take the last shot Applause heres dawes in seven seconds hunter feeds sims missed it from in front loose ball amir tried to collect and syracuse will take the lead to the break not very pretty mr patola in the first half was it no it was not not pretty on either side stay tuned this halftime reports presented by state farm when you want the real deal like a good neighbor youre carly jones guy huh im a car leak jones guy well you know interesting conversation we may get into bringing the second half of the second meeting of the year with the orange and the tigers syracuse a threepoint lead cold shooting really both ways in the opening 20 minutes long three beehives short sims the rebound and amir headed the other way quickly honor was scoreless in the first half Applause tyson step in too and the cold shooting for clemson continues well its a lot of perimeter jays you know there were there were shots to be had on the interior if youre clemson theyve got to be more diligent about hitting the middle with the pass or with the dribble over half of their shots threes in that first half and i thought a lot of them were settled clemson starters chris were four of 22 in the first half and trap call for the foul second on trap first on the tigers in the half joe gerard Applause brings it front court against nick honor trap probably a little frustrated he had a huge ball game the first time they played this year three ball from griffin opens the orange scoring in half too yep he could hit some shots man ill tell you what he can get it going theres tyson a hard dribble in traffic hemingway graze the iron and griffin the rebound another catch and shoot here we go again one of ten he was a noshow against north carolina the game before that he had 26 this is kind of the way things have gone with alan griffin Applause largest lead of the ball game now for the tigers honor left it on the front rim id find zero here chris gerard all the way to the rack and thatll give brad brown out a bunch of timeouts seven for gerard syracuse has opened the scoring on an 80 run to start the half dont forget the 2021 acc womens tournament underway in greensboro today boston college beat pitt the only ball game on the schedule well have the semifinals for you right here on the acc network and espn app on saturday at high noon and its 2 30 beth mohans debbie antonelli will be there and theyll also have the championship game on espn2 sunday so the womens underway to coliseum in greensboro more to come there tomorrow and the men are headed next tuesday to the coliseum complex hot start for the orange a lot of damage behind the threepoint line from alan griffin now a hell ball that will belong to the tigers i remember wes talking to brad varnell about a month or so ago about his team and he said you know weve generally been able to guard teams like were a pretty good defensive team we play hard the question is can we generate enough points to win right heres sims and he cant buy one amir sims has been a solitary field goal today griffin another one and that was pretty well defended chris theres no doubt he hits those shots now the problem is when hes still taking those and hes missing heres tyson at the foul line second field goal for the junior hunter tyson cuts it to a 12 point deficit Applause griffins got nine in the half Music Applause and bayons teams making it look easy right now Applause trout tried to shove it inside to tyson behind for griffin Music Applause clemsons execution against the zone has not been good Applause theres no penetrating of the zone to the middle youre not going to be able to push it by wenbank member on dick well 16 point lead for the orange they have uh broken it open here at the start of the second half on a 152 run chris and it brings us to our food lion food for thought not real hard to figure this one out is it it is not you know sometimes alan griffin can shoot you out of a game but boy there are sometimes he can shoot you into a game and he has created quite the differential to start this second half for syracuse offense hard to come by in that first half hes made it look easy so far in this second half wes yep three threes account for nine points the orange have added six more as the squad and clemson is on the ropes here at the dome hemingway trying to revive him and does knocks down a three to give him life over on the tiger bench hes got double figures chris when youre built defensively like clemson is and youre down 13 its got to be a twoway game here right you got to get stops but you also got to hit shots now thats thats the obvious no i mean thats the breakdown you know now theyre driving you you know the tempo is what youre talking about the tempo that clemson creates with his offense and it forces you to to take with your offense because of their defense but theres only so many possessions in the game and thats why a lead like this particularly with how clemsons executing against his own it seems almost insurmountable right knocks down another one hey we havent seen khadari richmond only played seven minutes in that first half he was on the bike a little bit i guess trying to work that knee we have not seen him since he went out griffin lost the handle on it and then the foul on tyson diving in for the steal second and theres braswell the bench Applause for the orange and there is remember dolages playing with a banged up finger gary as been less than 100 with a knee richmond also some soreness in his knee Music Applause Music Applause and thats where the elevation in buddys game is starting to come hes worked so hard at being able to put it on the floor and he liked that matchup and hes gotten so good at getting to his spot and then using his length but hes hes longer than you think you know a good 66 a nice touch there off the glass and when he gets to that second third level to his game offensively man hes gonna be a really good player third foul on the tigers in the half i love his shot chris and its easy to say you like it when it goes in i just think its a hes got a great looking stroke you can tell hes blown all the way with that oh yeah theres a three ball out on the perimeter chase hunter his fifth three of the year clemsons hit three of their last three from behind the line six minutes gone but its a 12 point lead for the orange and bayhem another driving score 15 now for buddy behind tigers trying to find a crease again dawes tyson a tough catch got it blocked by dolage i believe griffin launching and hitting theres just not a sense of urgency on clemsons defense particularly for guys that you i mean alan griffin has had a heck of a start to this first half theres got to be an awareness where is alan griffin Applause on both ends heres the blocked shot on one end nice job by dolghai coming over making a play and you know look thats a tough shot its contested but sims is late and griffins able to catch because you couldnt get over that screen it was no talk you wonder if his lack of offense starting to affect his defense this has not been the amir sims that weve seen over the last few games by the first on the way in the second half theres sims going to work for just his second field goal 97th career start today for amir but sims going to need a lot more where that came from gary trying to get in on the fun and chase hunter runs it down hell feed sims who will duck it down four in a row for sims Applause Music gary sims is playing off of gary a because gary gary is a nonshooter the problem is if you lose sight of him hes going to sneak in behind you like he just did there and he syracuses leading rebounder Applause tyson with six four in the half chris i was thinking about our visit with brad brownell today where he said you know that first half we played against syracuse might have been one of our best halves of the entire year well you could argue that todays first half might be one of their worst halves of the year right now theyre trying to see if they can flip the script here but a lot of ticks have already gone off this second half clock dawes rings the bell again Applause four threes in the second half which equals their first half total Applause and a bump and a foul on sims Applause tigers going to need stops to go along with the pickup in the offense chris really has been the spark to create this separation uh a sparse offensive first half for both teams alan griffin got it going here in this second half and the uh food for thought brought to you by food lion how about that a little synergy so well done on your part i mean really some of your best work khadari richmond you see is back on the floor first time weve seen the freshman in the second half for coach peyton ten point game and both teams starting to ramp it up here a little bit orange has been ramped up since the half started clemsons joined the fray cut it to 10 and lean in by richmond and a foul now is there going to be a look here chris did the ball get released before the shot claw yeah thats certainly what theyre looking at i dont know if thats a foul either i mean i think the official anticipated that there was going to be more contact was a good shot fake and obviously he got he got hunter tyson in the air lets say you council i say that uh id rather shoot with a hand in my face than eat when im hungry wes is it out of his hand oh boy yeah thats tough thats microseconds there it is yep so there you go foul call on tyson and that will be the third and tyson fifth of the half on the tigers syracuse only with one team foul khadari richmond who played at brewster academy has had three double figure games against the acc this year knocks down the free throw Applause well get excited about what his future is going to be like here huh wow 65 already 180 pounds playing out front long see right there at the top of the zone 11 point lead for the arms Applause shot clock violation on the tigers chris what happened with clemson there because the last what three four possessions theyve been really good for coach brownell against that zone and getting clean looks yeah theres times west where theres a lot of eastwest you know theyre content to just kind of move the ball around perimeter and thats fine let the ball you know see both sides but at some point theres got to be a penetrating pass or a penetrating dribble there goes gary Applause Music says jeffrey clarke Applause a little more evidence on that heres newman missing from the corner and richmond in transition ahead and lay up for griffin pretty pass khidari richmond thats the other thing too wes syracuse has gotten out and theyve run both teams pretty good at getting back limiting transition in the first half outside of alan griffin and what hes done syracuse getting some stuff in the open floor oh pj hall underneath got knocked down Music orange collapsing around the big freshman and richmond trying to give you the bottom half of the menu as he got in the lane there just thinks he does you cant teach i mean when youre doing this in traffic when you have the gall to say im going to put it in my legs go a little hesi tween in traffic in that paint thats next level stuff right there and again its its stuff you cant teach athletically physically that this young man has that really nobody else on this team has foul was on hunter his second jim behind said chris back in the fall hes much more advanced he can help right now and im basing that earlier what we were talking about with jesse edwards and what the coach said kadari richmond is he showed up ready to go here right i mean its its impressive what hes done as a freshman in a supporting role principally for the orange and i think it goes back to the question of you know youre a better team but there is a line of pedigree so to speak when the head guys been here 45 years and knows what he wants with a particular team be it this one the year before the one coming up next year in relationship to gerard starting in richmond playing valuable minutes and what happened ive never met a coach who has intentionally left the guy who can help him on the bench but you know look this is coach baeheim i mean dion waiters didnt start a game all season he was the fourth pick in the draft good play right there that backflow getting back on defense to make a play to contest a shot nice job there by alan griffin dawes to put it in play tigers deficit is 15 now with about eight to go tigers skipping it around and a strong take by trap whos still scoreless tonight after having a heck of an effort a month ago in the first meeting and that was a great challenge by dolozzo out front my trap had 11 assists the first time they played only scored two points but he had eight rebounds he was sensational poor clemson nice pass jonathan bear out front that got poked away from behind and richmond will be ticketed with his first second foul on the orange who lead by 15 or of copperfit acc network basketball presented by food lion the official grocer of the acc second half at the carrier dome and the orange lead the tigers 5742 dont forget that the womens championship already underway everything you need to know about the acc tournaments including exclusive chalk talks highlights games and prizes its accessible from the acc mobile app or logging on to acchamphubcom and alan griffin has been the star of stars here in the second half for the home team chris he has and this syracuse defense has really stepped up thats a a rare point in the paint tonight for clemson you know syracuse gave up 92 points in their last two games in the paint up until that bucket they had only given up 10 now 12 points in the paint so been really solid keeping clemson on that perimeter Applause gary working on bear heres richmond playing with dola jai griffin and buddy behind the back in traffic and finally collected by the tigers and the lead pass got deflected but run down clemson training 13 Applause a win tonight joe linardi said would keep syracuse in that conversation of next four out in terms of the bracket but orange fans will be living that bubble dream again chris here we go again right the syracuse in march regular season comes to an end theyll be involved in action more than likely on wednesday at the acc tournament gonna be looking for a couple more wins according to joe linardi earlier in our show and seemingly theyre here just about every time march rolls around at least recently fouled on the bang by sims 4 on amir sims seven now on clemson you have to be patient against this clemson defense and syracuse has been patient all day long this is a really good pass such a fundamental play there by dola jai i mean the bounce pass obviously the right play to make there its not an easy pass especially with how close they were well timed and then gary so good along that baseline such a strong player you know i said in the first half a team that doesnt have a whole lot of muscle quincy gary is the muscle for this syracuse team hes got eight the lead 15 i think dolagis really underrated chris when it comes to what you talked about earlier the pass the distribution understanding where the ball needs to go dawg tried to find an alley fair skips for hunter shot fake and now the three and pair left the follow Applause the shorts hill right Applause hey im intend to shoot here chris now its griffin if that had gone down youd have known for sure took a 30foot shot for alan griffin to miss his first of the second half but taking it at the end of the shot clock doesnt hurt you with time and score what it is right now chase hunter spots up for his second figure Applause still a 13point game with four and a half to go counter to the syracuse play of the day here for clemson now with pittsburgh coming to littlejohn on saturday for a noon start theres a turnover by the orange chris whats brad brownell got to be thinking about and his team came in here winning five straight six of seven one of the better runs in power five basketball well i think their opponent is looking at this saying maybe we should play more zone in that game you know its and its crazy because clemson was so good in terms of executing against his own in the first matchup its a 10point game with 350 to go remember the orange game pretty sizable lead late the other night against carolina i know jim behind doesnt want to do that here today from the start and that dropped in how about that shot what a game for griffin Applause acc basketball is presented by food lion the official grocer of the atlantic coast conference new mass same attitude chris thats the way im looking at the hall of famer today huh what a change it looks like a wardrobe change these days and if youre changing a mask youre changing your entire profile do you know why he went to the change of mask i dont know that but i i feel confident that uh perhaps mike waters nico tamarion one of the central new york media personalities stephen fonte will be asking brett axe theyll probably ask the hall of fame coach in season 45 what happened to the clear mass that we were going with there coach pair out of the corner youngster at 6 10 transfer from unc asheville misses there three minutes to go in a 13point syracuse lead will the league be giving out an award for best mask this year most valuable m mvm this year in the league i mean coach behind would have been there obviously josh pastners in the running shot josh pastners not eligible thats not a mask thats correct its not a mask its a shield it says so at the top face shield he is very different technicality its a very discerning committee it is its like getting in the tournament got to have the right makeup right just dont let anybody in its got to be a mask pastners wearing a shield bayham has a mask do you think pastner will be on my case about that of course you have you heard his argument about the number of teams that deserve to be in the tournament i can only imagine
