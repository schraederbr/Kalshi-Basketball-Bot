four meetings at PNC Arena Trace dimes Jeffrey Anderson Jeb harness on the whistle tonight and the deakes get the tap and away we go with the 255th meeting all time between State and wake and heres Jaden Taylor matched up against Miller and heres horn defending Carr and he poked it away from behind Taylor with the early Deacon turnover Lake Forest turned it over 20 times against Florida state 17 times against Virginia they cant do that tonight hor misses the jumper had a big night at Louisville on Saturday second shot no good Burns couldnt control it DJ horn had 27 points heres a look at Steve forbess lineup tonight for Wake Forest the Gonzaga transfer Salis on the board first and those three guards Miller and Salis and hildr are a load for anybody and Salis is a guy when he drives hes not off looking to go all the way to the basket that pullup jumper is a really big part of his repertoire so heres Burns and Reed squaring off car trying to help on the double deflected the pass that was I think intended for Parker eight to shoot heres Morel against Miller fway rims away and the rebound for Fon Reed that could be a pretty good matchup if that continues for North Carolina State because Morel has a size Advantage can get in there and shoot that turnaround jump Applause heres Parker defending car into the lane the turn and bucket for the Delaware transfer the senior Westchester PA Andrew Carr and a look at the Wolfpack starters for Kevin Keats tonight horn Taylor Parker morcel of course and burns here is Taylor on the drive the contact and the n one for Jaden Taylor Jen Taylor and a first foul on Eon Reed for forest and thats a big foul because its early and Reed is a guy who tends to have foul problems from time to time and thats a situation West where he didnt jump straight up he jumped in to Taylor on the drive NC State 828 at the line in conference play thats third best and the free throw and the threepoint trip for Indianapolis Junior Jaden Taylor and making that free throw scoring allows NC State to set its pressure Miller a lead for Carr caught it and score oh what a look ahead byy Miller that was millimeters that went over the fingertips of Parker what a great manto man for both teams heres Burns and Reed again DJ a shot fake now going to back down Reed Fall Away got wow sixth best field goal shooter in the ACC is Dwight Lamar Burns Jr and a Wake Forest turnover Miller took his eye off of it and itll belong to NC State trailing one Kevin Keats tonight in Raleigh hes been under the weather for about 5 days hes got the mask on tonight because as he told us today I dont want to get my players sick hes been F fighting a little bit of a bug and heres Burns a three out front DJ Burns now 0 for four this Year from behind the threepoint line well I I think West that uh rake Forest would like him to shoot that no sure Im not sure his coach wants him to shoot I can guarantee it his coach does not Baseline heres hild squeezes it into Solace at the left corner who knocks down a three and then turns and has a word for the Wolfpack bench on his 36 threepointer of the year its a nice job again if you get inside that defense wait for course does a nice job passing it out for jump shot theres the double team on burns inside Morel to catch and score Burns is a just a marvelous passer West and one of the reasons is hes so patient the double team comes and he doesnt panic at all he surveys the court and finds the open man twopoint lead for the deacons Salas headed Stripped Away that was horn this is Morel hes got to beat Carr and hildr and Carr recovered to block it off the BL W thats really a good play by Carr but its a tough job by morcel he went one on Two And theres another turn Jeffrey Anderson the fourth turnover on W forest and Steve Forbes whos got 62 wins in his fourth season in Winston Salem 358 in his nine years is fired up already at the Deacon unforced erors really really frustrate the Wake Forest head coach won heres an interesting substitution for Wake Forest Marsh is in the game yeah first time in seven games and theres the state turnover and heres Solace and he tried to finish and Horns going to get ticketed with the reach by Jeb Hartness each each of these teams Wes would like to get out and run theyre not like racehorse teams but each team plays better in transition and they like to get out and go and you you have to protect the ball you cannot not take bad shots you cannot turn the ball over so heres Solace at the line first of two free throws is good he is an 80 free throw shooter Hunter Salis 65 185lb Jr Omaha Nebraska start is collegiate career Applause Gonzaga made history in his home state man he was the first ever FiveStar Basketball Recruiting state of Nebraska hes pretty good player oh he he he is a heck of a player hes got seven of the 11 way farest points here early horn Fall Away over Salis bounces around and falls in off the front IR D perfect basket for DJ horn and hes more than just a threepoint shooter he can get in the lane hes got really good lift on that jump Music Applause shot center of the floor this is Miller working on Applause horn Mars tried to help with the screen and boy middle Brooks read it well wake lost it but Sal Saves The Possession the car with five to shoot heres a hand off from Miller against morcel on the drive and with the clock winding down the jumper rattled out and then three Wolfpack players were there and the ball went out of bounds offy State Wake will have it in the twopoint lead when we continue from Raleigh every

Music well here in Raleigh Wake Forest with a twopoint lead at 11 to9 great to have you for game one of our double header Clemson Georgia Tech to follow tonight Dan it feels like this is Ws offensive prowess against NC States defensive sturdiness well certainly thats the storyline Wes because wake is one of the best offenses in the ACC right at the moment its NC States defense thats keeping them in check by forcing turnovers yeah I mean wake for us is just made four of their first five shots here you get a look at their numbers in ACC play theres a lot of ones over there on the right side yeah all of them are ones including the 963 they had 10 and their win against Virginia on Saturday theyve made nine or more in each of their last four 10 or more in three of their last four so its coming comp conference competition which kind of Pops off the page when you think of the power they have especially on the hildr working on diara fallway is good first points for the young man from England Cameron hildr who averages 172 against the lead well hild he likes to get inside and play with his back to the basket at 64 but normally hes not doing that against the 610 guy like the oconnell fou line jumper good for Michael oconnell had 11 points in Louisville the other the day including three threes his last four games heve had 25 assists in just four turns turnovers hes been doing a lot of work in terms of ball distribution but if his shooting stroke is starting to catch up thats good news for Kevin ke he really has been effective for it three of those four turnovers came in one game the Louisville game here is Carr on the Drive Middle Brooks challenges and draws the foul first on Ben Middlebrooks the transfer from Clemson itll be number two on the wolf pack everybody talks about the big three for Wake Forest and justifiably so but Carr is is the fourth guy on that team that averages in double figures youre talking about Miller hildr and uh Reed sal sal the three guards yeah now Carr is under double figures hes eight points a game in ACC play but I mean this is a thousand Point career score hes a guy who can make a three at 6 11 hes a very good rebounder he did some offseason work in the weight room Steve Forbes wanted him to get stronger and we had to see him early last year he was not nearly as put together from a physical standpoint I think its help him well I think it has too and hes a guy he doesnt Force anything hes had three 20point games this year and had double figures on Saturday on the run against virin Wake Forest lead is three o Connell hesitates out front Taylor packed head and hit a three yet Taylor will offer the of the rebound thats what he does best to the Missouri transfer gives NC State a his shot clock youre going to get those long rebounds if theres going to be those long rebounds you have to get him Taylor hes a guy whos willing to attack as well Wes hild with the foul his first second on Wake Forest and Jaden Taylor who Kevin Keats regards as their best defender will go to the free throw line where he is 77 on the year I told you NC States almost 83 of the team Taylor misses dont forget weve got a big basketball double header for you on Saturday get you started in Tallahassee at 400 Mike Monaco and Randolph CH will be there for Clemson and Florida State and Jay Al Malcolm hu be have Virginia Georgia Tech and Atlanta coach boner and I will be in Cameron for the second meeting in 12 days between pit and Duke Blue Devils had the week off after the win last Saturday well the Blue Devils a little bit B up they need to weak off Mitchell and roach and Duke is a funny team Wes theyve had some injury issues you know nothing serious this year accept you know Proctor his four or five games and so theyre still putting things together Taylor hit the back end of the free of the free throws a moment ago missed by the de horn at the other end and Reed two hand swats that toward the students in the end zone and thats one of the things that Reed gives W for for that they dont have without him he just follows the basketball you know that looks impressive swwa it out of bounds but if he can get it with both hands maybe he just should have grabbed it last time anybody in these parts ever blocked one out of bounds like us when David Thompson got boner back in the day now that wasnt a that wasnt a hard thing to do theres a there is a foul on the drive by horn and thats Salis okay his first well and see thats the other thing with NC State they like to drive the basketball and force wake to get into their depth the deak basically plays seven guys Baseline and it drops in Horn DJ horn my goodness Im telling you Wes that little turnaround jump shot that he has hes rattled around a couple of times now NC States playing with horn woods and okell diara and middle Brooks and here is Salas out in the midcourt area by passes the Fon Reed screen and then po di Mo diara on the drive took the contact and draws the foul did they get Salis again did he commit that foul I think it is the third on or the second on Hunter Salis boy and thats thats a big foul right there sure is fourth on Wake Forest the second on the Gonzaga transfer comes with 1236 to play in this first half and a couple of free throws for a guy who I thinks game is kind of a gap filler for all the things NC State needs that they dont get from other guys Mohamad diara the rebounding figures alone for diara hes averaging eight rebounds in ACC play he had 18 in the overtime win at Boston College that started their conference play last two ball games hes averaged seven points and 6 and 1 12 rebounds hes a really valuable guy off the bench West and you just saw one of the reasons why hes really fast he went down there thats the second time weve seen NC State attack in a oneon creu situation they with the wol p have forgotten to shoot free throws they are two of their first five they 83 in conference play coming in car a three over di Andrew Carr has eight now in this first half thats his 15th three of the year but if youre in North Carolina State you cant overh help and thats what happened that time di got into the Lane trying to help out and the the defense actually out on the perimeter was pretty good just cant get that far away from C threepoint game o conell on the drive tried to feed middle Brooks taken away by Reed here are the deak in transition Miller trying to feed oconnell to the Baseline into traffic and a foul will be called and that is on Michael OK conell transfer from Stanford itll be his first its the third on the wolf pack breaking the action in Raleigh wait foris leading by three on acc Music Network every year thousands of athletes disappear in clutch moments due to

the cheesiest I will come feeling the cheesiest coach Che it official sponsor of the college football Music Music playoff well Kevin Keats whos fighting a little bit of a uh a bug and why hes got the mask on tonight trying to to keep his team healthy and Steve Forbes they knew this would kind of get gritty grimy tonight field goal percentage is kind of reflect some of that Kevin Keats has got 13 attempts only six makes fores his team six of eight Dan theyve gotten good shots and Wake Forest when they get good shots they can theyre very good offensive players I think the key for North Carolina State West theyve got those five extra shots because they forced five turnovers they have three offensive rebounds the problem with the turnovers is they have yet to convert any goes into points yeah Miller hildr Carr Reed and we get our first look tonight at Parker Fredrickson 63 freshman from Bixby Oklahoma where is number 20 and we got a foul as the ball was put in play and its against cam Woods trying to keep the ball out of the hands of Miller thats a pretty good idea four on NC State and there is Carr on a clean catch and score boy Andrew Carr is off to a terrific start hes first player in double figures now with 10 well again we talked about him hes the Forgotten guy on that four double figure Music scores you cant leave him close to the basket hes 611 after all yep heres Burns and Reed going back to their twoman game at the Block Carr coming to help Burns got a pass deflected now heres Miller with another NC State turnover three on the wol pack thats a great double team by Carr hands up the whole time right and remember we keep saying it hes 611 there goes Frederickson kick out for Reed standing three is good epon Reed the third his third three of the Year pushes weights lead to its largest here this first half and eight hes an 18 threepoint shooter thats a bonus for the deakes off the burn screen Woods into traffic pushed it up and in cam Woods who did not play in games against Virginia and North Carolina played 10 minutes scoreless the other day at Louisville is on the board back to a six point w Lee look at Miller now fall away right there in front of woods is good boy Kevin Miller boopy to everybody has got his first points well he is really good at getting into the lane with that little turnaround hes fast enough you want to prevent him from getting all the way to the basket but he really nullifies that strategy with his ability to shoot that pull up heres wood won the drive yep traveled with it Jeffrey Anderson called it so an eightpoint lead on another NC State Tournament over dont forget Sunday is ladies day here on acc Network we got a women metal header starts in Raleigh at noon Pam Stephanie wider on hand for number four NC State and Duke and then number 13 Lille number 23 North Carolina and Carmichael Arena be there for that contest presented for you by food line all on acc Network and also available on the Applause ESPN here is Frederickson who played 12 12 minutes on Saturday in the win against Virginia comes in averaging almost seven against the conference pretty nice for young freshman and a backup roll for Steve for Carr out of the corner tend to shoot for Hil and thats a long three that misses B and heres horn trying to create the breakes all the way down scooped it with the left hand di got the rebound fell down thats a travel now Dan the crowds going to boo here thats a good call by Jeb harness on the Baseline the only call he can make thats the rule if you catch the ball with it and then fall down thats a travel and this is I mean he thinks hes going to beat Frederickson but Carr is right there and does a wonderful job going straight up in the air diara possesses the ball comes to the ground and then falls down by rule thats a traveling violation now five turnovers for North Carolina State eightpoint lead for Wake Forest deacons nine of 12 from the floor that is a strong cup of coffee here early for forbes team Eon Reed left hand theres the Miss nice job by Burns forcing him to just shoot over laob at the post heres Burns resp spends on Reed forced it up it bounds away Hil got the rebound its amazing how he can get that shot off yep he read the screen of the double team from Carr perfectly and went back toward the Baseline just couldnt finish the jump shot now if youre Miller you got to come and get the ball like you just did you cant stand there and wait for it hild the squares too strong W now hes got to adjust to the left a little bit that back up well because hes missed both of the shots in the same place I think he hit the same part of the backboard twice in a row meanwhile NC States had three turnovers in consecutive possessions they end well you know we talked about the fact that NC State forces turnovers well their offense you know really sputters as everybodys offense does if you turn it over right so Frederick going to stay on the floor with Miller Salis has returned playing with the two fouls by the way car and Reed are out there for Coach Forbes horn is there with Taylor Morel Parker and Middlebrooks to get DJ Burns to spot new so what weve had the last couple possessions is turnovers and shots off the back F theres a block by Taylor recovered though by Miller and then the Miss there recovered by Salis heres Miller a three in the corner and it spins out Parker the rebound and remember Salis in the game has two personal FS heres middle Brooks back for horn off the middle BR screen Reed to beat hell bounce it to Middle Brooks Big B inside scoping score and Reed has to be careful because hes got an early foul you dont want to pick up the second one but thats a really nice job by middle Brook midle Brooks has averaged Five Points in his last four Off the Bench under eight to go sixpoint game Frederickson La for Reed back door Carr to catch and flush that is a great cut by Carr Reed had a shot but it was going to be a tough one and Carr bailed him out by just cutting down the lane and Carrs matched up against Parker hes got a 5 in height advantage on him theres horn off the screen hanging too good and more horn third field goal for horn I think the foul is going to be on Salis Sal number and it is the third on Hunter Salis itll be the fifth on Wake Forest itll get us to a timeout a moment ago heres Carr finishing off a nice pass from Reed and then as we go to break maybe a turning point in the game horn knocks the jumper down Salis picks up his third we take a timeout r Auto Owners insures your car because sometimes something from out of left field can literally come from out left field thats simple human sense ask your independent agent if Auto Owners Mak sense for Music you Music make every

without going broke get the brands you want the prices you want whenever you want TJ Maxx where you can always afford to be you to the max Im here Courtside watch this you have got to watch this replay folks watch Music Applause this watch me watch me watch me 2620 we far 7 12 to go here in this first half and Dan a big development as we went to break third foul on Hunter Salis of w forest and Salis you know you got to understand how important you are to your team just let this one go I mean he doesnt even get close to blocking that shot but he puts his arm on Horns back and the official basically has to call that he I he had seven points as we just showed you but he also has four rebounds hes been a key to the de success so far and were not going to see him for the rest of the half maybe not even to start the second half NC State two of five at the line make it three of six seven in the first half now for DJ horn so its a fivepoint game was 7 and 1 half to go Miller hildr Frederickson Carr and Reed and a takeway this is Parker to the basket and foul by hildr second on cam hildr Dan and suddenly the fouls are starting to pile up and thats one with hris hes very aggressive but again maybe you just let that one go the odds that youre going to block that shot are very small Steve forb shaking his head he goes into exactly the wrong place you cant stop there that is cough and Corner one the wol pack who been pretty good at the free throw line including 15 of 17 in Saturdays win at Louisville all of a sudden hit hard times at the free throw line and theyve left some points there certainly Wes and missed another one well Parkers only 59 but the pack is three of their first eight at the free throw line that combined with the turnovers and maybe fortunate to only have it be five Dan I would think so a Wake Forest has those three fouls on Salis theyve turned it over a bunch themselves theres a foul on Parker trying to fight through a ball screen for Reed and Dennis Parker Jr freshman from Richmond Charles his first and the fifth on the wolf pack it has been a bit of an uneven game Wes you know a lot of turnovers wake only one theres another foul and thats on Taylor for a hold on boy Miller and I think what youre seeing here West is the officials are trying to get this game under control Kevin Keats wants a little bit of a explanation from Jeb hardness before Cameron hildr puts a ball in play yeah but hes being nice about it hes keeping that mask on yeah oh I see the over the top yeah hes hes hanging on to him so heres Carr now finally Miller actually the wolf pack have done a great job containing Miller so far weits only hit one of their last seven Frederickson kind of a bulky hand off from Reed hell take it all the way to the basket and score marker fredericksons first points and thats unusual cuz his mostly hes shooting threes Y and I think thats what you expect from him so he did a nice job taking advantage of the fact that they werent playing him for the drop I think in conference play that might be his second or third twopoint goal Dan is that right second second say to say he shoots twos is DJ horn might be overstating it nine for horn on the runner there so its still a fivepoint game we come up on six to play midc area for Reed interested to watch right they theyre kind of methodical with their press offense here arent they dont well theyre trying to be they dont want to turn the ball over so just trying to be careful middle Brooks double team with cell that ball got knocked away nice play by Parker heres Taylor ahead of the pack hell take it down and its blocked off the window itll count second field goal for Jaden Taylor who nows got a half dozen in the first half NC States is very connected on defense Dan well they sure are and that was just a situation where the cut was very if youre going to cut through the lane against NC State youve got to be very aggressive about it and Wake Forest just wasnt and Parker was able to step G steal the ball seven turnovers for the deacons now in this first half that was Steve forbess number one concern today can we do this without offering it up hildr weaving through pushed up with the right hand Reed a slap out field around for Carr and another three its good Andrew Carr having a half hes now got 15 plus hes made all his shots sure has 3125 W Forest pushes it back to six which is Big because neither Miller nor hild have played particularly well offensively here in the first half Carr is six for six and two of two behind the line another Runner by horn have at it DJ Horns got Applause 11 he Carm might want just square off here 3127 back to a fourpoint lead and thats the fourth basket by warn of exactly that style Taylor defending Miller or parker defending Miller and thats a foul on Reed and thats his second so Eon Reed commits his second and its the seventh on Wake Forest with 455 to play eighth turnover on the deacons West End remember Wake Forest basically plays seven guys and one of the things that Kevin Keats talked out today was trying to attract them attack them to get them in foul trouble and you see Burns is back on the floor because Zack Keller now has come on to replace Fon Reed Keller is 610 sophomore from Highlands Ranch Colorado who only plays about 14 minutes a game in conference here goes burns up off the glass and in Z Kellers got to be ready cuz three and the Whites going to touch it that it doesnt matter how ready Keller is if they clear the side for him like that then Burns is going to score every time twopoint game four and a half to go in Raleigh in this opening half leaner by Miller foul on horn State bench not happy DJ horn becomes the first NC State player with two seven on state with 419 to go and he moves Underneath Him Wes I mean that is a very quick shot by I think hes surprised T him with how quickly he got up so he moved underneath him with the body and you see Jeff Anderson tell him he hit him on the arm and he did 10th best free throw shooter in the ACC Chicagos bopy Miller knocks down the free throw hes got but three here in the first half he and Judah MZ of Syracuse the only two players in the ACC that are top 10 in scoring and assist coming into action tonight just a terrific terrific addition for Kevin or for Steve forbes team second one good and Steve Forbes has shown himself pretty Adept at getting terrific additions year in and year out I mean laravia Alis Williams Tyrie apple right now boopy Miller Fon Reed Hunter Salas that old boy from Lone Tree ISS in sales is what he is he is in sails States in its last six fourpoint game after the free throws from Miller and here is Burns now against Marsh here goes DJ Burns left hand Scot hook short and he hit the inline theyll belong the away for w you mentioned this is the first time Marsh has played in Eight Games and the reason is because of that guy right there they need to find a bigger body to match up against him Frederickson lead boun pass car has been he wakes up hes not going to believe what hes done in this first half under four to go Miller all the way to the hole in score and thats where hes most dangerous how quick was that six for booy Miller lead is six for Wake Forest Parker slashing through all the way against Mar no foul call Kevin Keat is out on the floor he is so fired up he care Le he doesnt want to get a second he just got a second oh my oh wow Kevin Applause Keats so a timeout two technical fouls called on Kevin Keats in a row with 332 to go in this first Applause half Now Kevin Keats has been thrown out so we will take a time out Kevin Keats is with his team after receiving two technical fouls 3529 Wake Forest when we come back to

3529 Wake Forest in front 332 to play and heres the sequence well watch Marsh go straight up in the air and all the contact is originally initiated by Parker now I think at the end its possible that Marsh gets him on the wrist but thats offensive initiated contact Kevin Keats gets called for a technical foul and he he just refuses to leave and the referee hits him with another one right I mean these guys West theyll give you one and then theyll let you walk away but he just Kevin Keats just didnt Applause so Kareem Richardson is sitting at the front of the bench with Levi Watkins Joel Justice Steve Snell meanwhile boy Miller is shooting four free throws here right each of the technical fouls is two free throws so theres Kei on the court thats the first technical foul right there and the referee you see the referee holds out his hand and says get back and Kevin KS doesnt so he hits him with another one now west this is you getes two free throws for each foul right and then the play picks up where its stopped so that means wake for has the ball at half court so the decks theyre going to get four shots and the ball and theres the fourth of the free throw so Miller is six of six at the line hes now got 10 the game is 10 and now wake has its largest lead and the basketball with hildr and Miller on the floor with Mars Carr and Frederickson W you can certainly understand Kevin KS being upset but you know you tell your players all the time that they have to control themselves and he just lost control Carr in the corner and a foul will be called on oconnell and for Michael oconnell itll be his second and its the eighth against NC State so thatll put car at the line where hes having an unbelievable first half and Andrew Carr has got 15 points he is one of two at the line thats the only place hes missed anything in this first half dont forget weve got more gymnastics for you at ACC Network in the ESPN app on Sunday Pittsburgh and number 19 Clemson is at Little John Coliseum coverage begins at 400 Eastern on acc Network car hits both breeders won how many guys do you see jump at the free throw line cise hes got a little bit jump at the end of his free throw 10 nothing run is put it to a 12point Advantage heres burs going to work on Marsh left hand score balance and everything for his third field goal well I dont know that hes ever off balance but thats where the wolf pack has to go they have to tighten it up on the defensive end but on the offensive end theyve got to put the ball in the hands of DJ burs here is Carr with Frederickson and were inside of three minutes to play Miller trying to find his way and he traveled with it for the travel on boy Miller will send it to the wack diara is on the floor now with Burns its the ninth weight Forest turnover and Miller that time made a mistake Frederickson was all alone in the corner he drew the defense and then tried to force the ball through all those arms Morel step back two at the right bounds away from Marsh Dan NC States gone this entire half with out a threepoint goal heres H Carr in traffic diara there Carr we routes and scores Andrew Carr has now got 19 in this first half couple of Threes to his credit 4331 back to 12 Taylor trying to get through lost the handle on it over the in line out of bounds it will belong to the defense that was a pretty good play by Marsh you dont associate Marsh with moving his feet real quick laterally but he did that time seven turnovers for NC State Wake Forest has nine in this first Music half Miller left corner Carr first Miss of the night from the floor I might have gotten a little piece of that Taylor here goes oconnell back out front for Jaden Taylor Burns going to help with a screen Taylor got Mars in the A and draws the foul thatll be the first on cornwalls Matthew March thats not Cornwall like North Carolina Cornwall Virginia thats Cornwall in Southwest England Matthew March 21 years of age this Englishman second year in

his uncle and his grandfather he was he was lamenting the fact that they fallen on hard time as he was longing for the Lampard days like most Chelsea supporters are theres a foul on the wolf pack thatll put bopy Miller on the line and that is going to be on Ben Middlebrooks his second he is the third NC State player with two joining oconnell and Middlebrooks or and Horn rather I should say well Miller has really you know scoring those four free throws has really helped him Millers got double figures with six free throws and theyll make it seven you know what he started his career Dan at Central Michigan he played just four games last years preseason all MidAmerican Conference last year but he was hurt after four games two years ago he averaged 13 points 4 and a half assists for Central Michigan and it just goes to show you that sometimes this portal is an interesting thing from that light right that are hard to miss a year you dont know much about them Alis Williams another Deacon who was terrific a guy who was what a role player at Oklahoma right theres a foul called and thats going to be on uh or a kick ball on Wake Forest rather the difference is Wes that alandis Williams was a transfer from Oklahoma a high major School sure and bopy Williams comes from Central Michigan which is you know a mid major and so you just dont know particularly after he hadnt played for a year how hes going to react he started a little bit slowly but boy has he come on Taylor got caught in the air kicks it for diara inside a minute to go heres Mo diara hard off the glass and got the bounce first field goal for diara 10point game with 42 seconds left so maybe a possession each way here left where Miller can really drive you off with that dribble out front here is Marsh stripped on the drive Miller recovers shot fake kicks into the corner Frederickson you know there were guys there but I thought Miller had a chance to shoot that ball right on top of the basket Richard yeah Karim Richardson who is now the coach for the pack after Kevin keatss ejection a couple minutes ago well huddle up here for one possession we have breaking news right now so we wait to see how this plays out in all my years I never watched anything like this you have got to watch this replay folks Ms catch hey you got to watch this Im watching oh oh Im watching you might be watch me watch me now on Sports Center another wild night watch me watch me well its a 10point game and if youre just dialing our way as they say Kevin Keats a double technical foul with 331 to play in this first half Kareem Richardson who is one of its a second year assistant coach did spend some time in Clemson with Brad Brownell the former head coach at Missouri Kansas City the kangaroos by the way Dan okay thank you from 2013 to 2019 and also spent time at Louisville too is on Rick patino staff thats where the ties with ke are here is Taylor and were going to get a foul and that is zanka who commits the foul 66 Junior transfer from UCLA by way of Italy and Wes thats a pretty good substitution zanka doesnt really play very many minutes but hes very athletic hes a good Defender so you put him in doesnt really matter if he fouls and he puts Taylor who as you mentioned before is not a good free throw shooter at the line for a one and one bro does not have any points on the year he has played tonight in his 10th game and the front the one1 Miss just a really rugged night so far at the line for NC State here is Miller trying to get it to the corner Frederickson at the horn and it will bound away but W Forest is going to to take a 10point lead to the locker room at 4535 well the news will be the ejection to reduce that tonight they got to get more from Burns too though yeah DJ Burns and Fon Reed go to work on the first possession that theong to the Wolfpack theres the double team quick half Parker the layup first field goal for Dennis Parker first points of the night for Parker and the wolf pack with Kareem Richardson now kind of the head of Staff over there across the play hildr just did a very poor job getting down to help out heres hildr on the offensive end had it P from behind that was horn heres Morel back for DJ horn and that is the second time horn has done that to H tonight remember Salis has those three personal fouls heres horns slicing the lane Runner right hand how many times have we seen that tonight well hes got six field goals Im going to say all six all six there you go good start here for the wolf 13 for horn to within six blocked away from behind by Taylor on the Miller Drive now Taylor does a nice job staying behind Wes and making sure he doesnt make contact he kept some distance between himself and Miller hes got a height advantage and he used it inbounds Carr the catch back for Solace they got a miss match inside Alis working at the foul line fallway over the top of Parker Grays the front IR that was a tough shot they had horn matched up inside against car they missed it horn another floater that one offline he wasnt as on balance as he has been in the wow got all the way to the IR on the bouns just four points for cam H Dan thats the other thing about cars performance you can accept for uctions from hildr and Salis and maybe even Fon Reed to a degree whos only got a threepointer to his credit in this first half obviously that was a big Applause Music factor Burns working against Reed spin in traffic scooped it up wouldnt go got it back put it up boun it in one Applause wow he took that shot against the double team Burns is going to spin inside and here theres 6 11 and 7 ft and he gets the ball and despite the fact that he gets hit on the forehead hes still able to push it in the basket DJ Burns who went crazy go nuts against Wake Forest last year had games of 31 and 23 missed the free throw Reed ends up over the table on the floor off the Baseline wake at the other end and we get a hand check foul on Parker oh now were going to oh and Im not sure what happened with Miller and burns off the ball well Miller ran into the arm of DJ Burns and I dont know whether Burns stuck his arm out there or whether thats just the size that Miller is this is now two times in a row that Miller has had a shot block and again a really nice job maintaining the distance so Salis will put it in play foul was on Parker first on the wolock in the second half and there goes Reed for his second basket five for Fon Reed the third and theyre not going to help burns out in there and so Reed needs to keep the ball off the floor and get it up over Burns but its hard to shoot over Burns heres horn foul line good 15 now for DJ horn on his seven field goal and hes been able to turn the Corner weson get into the lane to make that shot seven times sixpoint lead for Wake Forest Reed and Salis trying to find something there offensively heres Carr on the drive and blocked and fouled by Burns now the Wolfpack crowd is going to get after Jeffrey Anderson from every whistle here on because Anderson was the one that didnt call them Parker the foul on Parker when he challenged Marsh in the first half it resulted in the double technicals and those proceedings similar play similar spot on the floor at the basket and the whist is blown and you can imagine the reaction foul gets car of the line hes now got his fourth 20point game of the Applause year and another one coming for Westchester PAs Andrew Carr first 20point game against the ACC this year and he missed the second di of the rebound so Burns diara horn Morel and Parker on the floor for PC stator Taylor rather one not 11 and heres hild off the NC State turnover trying to get all the way down hes got stripped of it last Touch by the wol thats a really good defensive play by Taylor hes just going through everybody here yep and coming from the right hand side of your screen thats a really good play by Taylor to reach in lots of times that gets called a foul but he got away with it Miller clutch briefly on a three skips for Salas three out of the right corner and Mars tried to keep it alive wack ends up with it Taylor was toing the in line says Trey Stein it will belong to the deacons now Marsh was trying to keep it alive West and he kept it alive well enough that North Carol United State couldnt control it and here comes Middlebrooks into the lineup to replace Burns and thats Kareem Richardson the uh assistant coach whos now in charge of the team with the dismissal of Kevin Keats and in the lane and one for booy Miller foul will be on Taylor his second itll be the third on NC State as Miller Works some magic in traffic here Dan Miller Works some magic in traffic and maybe Taylor wasnt out of bounds according to that replay the fans in here certainly didnt think he was so here is Miller you see with the 14 trying to make it 15 at the line and doeses W he doesnt even hit the rim on his free KCK 15 now for Miller the lead is 10 again heres morcel step back over Salas good casing morcel hes got his second pass morcel has been quiet offensively and the wol pack really needs an offensive contribution from him eightpoint game almost four minutes gone Music Applause Music here Marsh trying to help Hilder for screen now middle and he lost it Dr recovers save to Middle Brooks heres a lead for Taylor three ball on Carr rattled out NC State still does not have a three tonight skip for Salis hell launch a three spins out on him and each team is comfortable with those frees in transition West Taylor fouled I think he was trying to bounce it toward diara however wol pack will have the ball they Trail eight four minutes and change gone in half two in Raleigh Music Applause Music Applause Music tonight the

horn out of the right corner bounds away from three its been a cold night so so far behind the line for six now in the second half Wake Forest has not made a three theyre only shooting 28 less after over 50 in the first half yeah both teams were over 50 tayor got a hand on that pass from Miller that was headed for Hil well Miller that time probably passed that ball a little too early he was able I think he was past OK Connell and it was DJ Burns waiting for him at the basket that might have been worth a try to go all the way y Applause Miller out front for Reed back to bopy Miller on the drive now for Salis five to shoot now heres Carr clock winding down fires it up there its another shot clock violation they play on Taylor ahead for horn right back for Jaden Taylor on the drive and

basket at The Rim so it was not out of bounds and its basically turned over 11th turnover tonight by the Wolfpack I think he would completed that pass had it not hit the rim but the Rims out there it doesnt move Salas Baseline hes got five in a row now for Way Forest and thats why hes so important W not only can he make the three but he can make that tough contested midrange jumper up 12 points for Salas the lead is 11 now n and a half to go Morel cun on the dump down here for burns take Mar and right off the glass DJ Burns 10 for burns the lead nine now Burns really keeps the pressure on a defense do you double team or dont you and if you dont they clear the side for them how do you stop them heres Applause hildr working against OK conell into the lane block Burns HRI got it back Salis from Miller hell Square for a three long rebound Miller in the corner saved it though to Burns who will Loop it ahead heres Taylor three on two Taylor a little Euro got to the basket and draws the car foul first on car itll be six on W Forest W you never throw the ball in underneath your own basket unless you know where youre throwing it what that was was basically by buy Miller he got it to DJ Burns so thats an outlet pass and you think about an outlet pass Burns what a great pass down the court to keep the pressure on Taylor at the line is four for six NC State is 5 for 12 at the free throw line Applause tonight nine points for indianapoliss Jaden Taylor you see Burns come out middle Brooks back W pack shot 50 in their loss to St Louis earlier this season I should say the win

sevenpoint game yep and cam Woods is checked in to the lineup playing for the first time in the second half number two in white for the wolf pack Woods wanted to foul so do the partisans here at PNC

summary of a fivepoint game with 745 to go but letting you know as well that weight shot 54 in the first half NC State shot 56 in the first half the second half been an entirely different document Andrew Carr only has one point in the second half Lake Forest has only made one of their threepoint field goals in the second half The deak Shot 14 free throws in the first half only three here in the second half here is Miller with hildr trying to beat Woods on the drive runs into traffic with middle Brooks missed the shot got it back and won hes just Relentless yeah plays a lot bigger than 64 does Cam hild Wes this is a force he forces this ball in and it comes right back to him middle books trying to get out of the way and that allows hildr the position for the rebound and I mean with midd Brooks out of the play theres nobody who can guard him in there so H ready to try and push it to eight and free throw no good it was knocked away Carr going to run it down right in front of Forbes in the corner thats a nice job by Mars just to tip it out here he goes again all the way down Middlebrooks bothered it and collects the the rebound again I think that was a bit of a force there by hildr nice job by Miller BR to defend without fou Morel going to draw the marsh foul seven now on Wake Forest second on Marsh with 718 to play won while were talking about Marsh for Wake Forest that reminds us the bench for Wake Forest is not really very deep NC States bench has 14 points and 15 rebounds tonight the wake bench two points and two rebounds morcel the first of two fouled on the drive and the free throw good dont forget Saturday another triple header comes your way here on acc Network 400 start P Tucker center Clemson in Florida State always good fun likewise Virginia and Georgia Tech at 600 from Atlanta and then the night cap at 800 Duke and pit Saturday on acc network streaming live on the ESPN Wes and that Virginia team they have had no success on the road and Georgia Tech is a team that plays pretty well at home so back to seven at 62 or back to five rather at 6257 oh connells getting a lot of minutes tonight heres Miller on travel call got caught in the air he got he got caught in the air because diara did a great job sliding over at the last minute Miller was going to take it all the way to the basket and so I and then he was going to take the short jump shot but diar was there with a blocked it ok Connell runs the offense horns return to join morcel diara and Middlebrooks heres horn now double team coming out of his hands to Casey diara looking for help and tend to shoot and heres oconnell Frederickson defends him now middle Brooks to Horn three to shoot back to Middlebrooks strong to the basket and score eight from Middlebrooks my goodness yes he has played a lot of minutes and they have been productive minutes Ben Middlebrooks has got state to within three its a onep possession game for the first time in a long time power stuck on the dribble picks up eight to shoot now from Miller trying to get Baseline horn and diar and the double team wraps it to Carr hes going to be called for the foul middle Brooks on the shot and Kareem Richardson trying to keep the wolf pack bench from busting at the thread this is great defensive pressure by North Carolina State on that last possession but the last offensive possession Ben Middlebrook just goes right to the basket and thats heavy pressure from Andrew cross and Miller is trapped and middle Brooks just gets Carr right across the arm that was great defense though so here is Carr at the line to shoot two first and no good and if you needed to know the wolf pack people here at PNC are ready to go they have not LED all night second one also out of there wow a three will tie they havent had one of those tonight either the lead or Applause three oconnell all the way down little twopointer bounds away diar the rebound thats blocked and its a basket awarded to Mohamad diara stay to within one on diars third third field goal thats his fourth offensive rebound and 10th rebound off the Applause bench Carr got a hand on it was the ball on the way down I think it was that would have been the only reason right yes it didnt it didnt get to the back for now that may be one they go and look at w theyre allowed to review it at the next 2v timeout Applause so Solace against DJ horn here a onepoint lead for rake for rake for just cant get anything going on the offensive end because they cant get in the lane Miller going to be fouled on the drive and if thats o Connell it is its his fourth he is the first NC State player to four 524 to play and Wake Forest the best shooting free throw team in the ACC in conference play Dan and 80 on the year which also leads the league well go to the line here for the one and one with Miller who is N9 for nine Millers N9 for n and these are important free throws the deakes have really not shot very well from the free throw line here in the second half L is two for six two for six heres Miller on a one and one and he made it 10 in a row at the line for booy Miller who now has 16 in the ball game and DJ Burns replaces Ben Middlebrooks well the Middlebrooks Burns combination has been very good tonight on the year in ACC play they average about 17 points and eight rebounds a game theyre doing that tonight Miller made them both 5 and the2 17 now for Kevin Applause Miller horn waiting on burns heres the screen heres horn hell set up for two and hit no Challenge from Marsh 17 now for horn six in the second half and a timeout with 508 to play onepoint game again NC state has never LED tonight wakes got the ball when we come back to PNC Arena in Music Raleigh Music Applause well 6463 Dan 508 to play you see the particulars wake has the possession arrow both teams are in the bonus now with the opponents getting seven fouls and it feels like if momentum counts here it feels like that NC States got a good bit of it DJ Burns by the way has come out of the game here as W farest takes over at the defensive end of the floor and I think thats what it is its a defensive substitution Fon Reed has come back in the game and he has four personal fouls the North Carolina State defensive pressure not necessarily of the full court pressure but their half court defensive pressure has really taken Wake Forest out of anything they want to do here in the second half middle Brooks plays with four as well heres Huff middle Brooks trying to help now Carr thought about watching tend to shoot Miller with Taylor defending again were leading the shot clock three to shoot Carr in trouble hes just going to fire and hit wow Andrew Carr his first field goal the second half now has 23 in the ball game and again that was pretty good defense they made him run the shot clock all the way Music Applause down diara trying to take Carr Baseline in traffic backing all the way down diara up strong hes fouled by Reed I believe if thats Fon Reed thats five its not his car its his second 18 fouls on Wake Forest mohamd diara is 0 for two tonight 71 on the year diara just I mean he was backing in and he was very close to the basket if youre going to double team him youve got to double team him while hes dribbling in the Music Applause Music ball first one good and the wolf pack after struggling from the free throw line in the first half had been much much better here in the Applause Music second second one good how about that eight for diara six in the second half its back to a onepoint game ahead of 4 minutes won I think its worth mentioning that Wake Forest comes in here as the top offensive team in the ACC averaging better than any points a game in conference play theyre not going to get there today heres Reed back to Miller with 10 to shoot Taylors there here goes Miller kick out now in the corner Carr for three Andrew Carr a big bucket five in a row for Carr at the Wake end of the Applause floor thats as good an offensive possession as wake has had in the last three or four minutes diara a three Off the Mark wol pack still hitless from behind the line thatll be a foul middle Brooks are youing what do we have here Trey Stein and Jeff might be it might be a traveling violation be on middle Applause Brooks that is four on middle Brooks its eight on the wolp Andrew

with Middlebrooks Burns is at the end of the wolf pack bench heres middle Brooks strong to the basket hes going to draw the foul from Reed and thats his fifth Applause byon that as a seven foot guy thats really hard to let that one go but Reed has to let it go and thats his fifth foul Wes and again remember he committed two fouls on illegal screens right Captain Reed hes going to foul out for the second time in conference play and DJ Burns taken ill a moment ago at the NC State bench and you see hes headed to the locker room I think they took him out of view and they had a trash can was

figures tonight ref after shooting 5 for 11 from the line in the first half Hy state is now eight for nine in the second Applause half well pack to within two par working against diara and middle

diara heres Salis against horn into traffic with a right hand rattled out di another rebound 13 rebounds for Mohamad diar tied with 228 to go in Applause righ Morel fights in traffic scoop and foul by hildr itll be the third on hild and the 10th on the deacons with 217 to play won that is a big storyline against Florida State Wake Forest as down the stretch committed a lot of fouls Florida State kept going to the free throw line and thats thats what were seeing here so heres Morel and at 10 hes got of course it was a shooting foul but all all their shots are all their free throws are going to be two shot attempts now free throw for more cell and the Wolf Pack leads for the first time tonight with 217 to go in the ball Applause game Casey morel the grad student from Fort Washington Maryland knocks them both down now hild able to get the ball in bounds a little easier he didnt have to use the trick play like he did before the last possession 7169 the wolf pack in front Taylor knocks it away from Miller tried to get a timeout called rolling timeout awarded to Jaden Taylor MC States going to take the time out and I think theyre going to take the floater its a 30se second timeout taken by Taylor look at this Dan well how many times have we seen boy Miller fumble the ball on the dribble and now you got a credit that to Taylor Miller excuse me Miller now has six turnovers in the game so it was a 32 timeout awarded to NC State some of you may be joining us looking for Georgia teken Clemson that ball game is starting on the ESPN app coming up here ear in about a minute or so with Jay alter and Debbie antelli at Little John Coliseum tonight I tell you what if Jay and Debbie sign up for all the fun Dan and Ive had here tonight theyre in for a real night this has been some kind of second half and its been we dont say this very much this has been full contact hand toand basketball tonight no kidding Morel with horn you got Taylor on the floor with diara and middle Brooks and diara and Middlebrooks have both had fantastic games tonight for North Carolina state two minutes to go wol pack in front for the first time tonight after the moreel free throws and the conferences leading offensive team needs a stop and they dont get it they havent stopped that play one time tonight eight nothing run by the pack has pushed the lead to four Salis against horn middle Brooks plays with four fouls he tried to help on the double team Carr tend to shoot for hildr against Casey morcel back from Miller against Applause Taylor in traffic scooped it up well Carr the rebound and one on the foul against diara Andrew Carr continues to add to his career night that gives him 27 mohamd diara commits his first its the ninth on NC State thats really a force by Miller on the inside of course the clock was running down there wasnt much else he could do but that is a huge rebound by Carr Miller Drew all the attention and Carr was open for the offensive rebound Carr to try and draw the deakes to within a Applause point and the free throw bounces in and now again Wake Forest looking for a stop and they just have not been able to stop that penetration into the lane by DJ horn for the jump shot o one minute to go in Raleigh its a onepoint Applause lead had it poked away keeps it from Middlebrooks six to shoot Ben on the drive got all the way to the basket and one oh my goodness oh I dont know now we got a double technical and one of the technicals is on middle Brooks and now theres another technical on Dr up diarhea so what I saw was two technical on North Carolina State one on Wake four so midd Brooks went to the basket scored and draws the foul boy that was some sequence right there so Middlebrooks if a double technicals been called on Salis and Middlebrooks Salis will have his fourth Middlebrooks will have his fifth then there may have been another one administrated to diara I thought they called a technical on diar in a threepoint game here with 48 seconds left were going to have a bunch of free throws W so Middlebrooks takes in Carr loses his balance now commits the foul and Middlebrooks is not trying to run into Solace but he does solace says something to him they go jaw to jaw theres a double technical called and then diara goes after Salis as well well now Jeffrey Anderson across the way here is talking to the SC book official at the table and then Trey Stein and Jeb Hartness are at the monitor here well the in the situation like this there was all kinds of people out on the court did anybody from the bench come out on the court if players from any of the benches came out on the court then they by rule theyve got to leave the game theyre ejected from the game the other thing here so one more look again at the sequence you see broks the basket he bumps into Solace then they get nose to nose and Jeffrey Anderson quickly calls double technical fouls on Solace and Middlebrooks and then diara and Salis Salis rather end up in the front row of the seats down to our right here but thats a great job what you saw the North Carolina coaching staff kept all their players on the bench yeah Kareem Richardson remember now hes kind of running the show at the bench now with Kevin Keats being ejected late in the first half well heres the other thing Wes after you sort through all these technicals play picks up where it left off and where it left off is Middlebrook shooting a free throw but he cant shoot a free throw because hes out of the game right but we got lot of sort out over there yeah and were going to see what Jeffrey Anderson and Jeb Hartness Come Away with on the video review in addition if you have the technical Salis the technical on Middlebrooks and then another one I think was issued to diara if so that puts free throws in play and then The Possession belongs to NC State whos shooting a free throw on the middle Brooks basket yes now that foul was called on Carr which is his fourth so Carr now has four fouls all in the second half and at some point we will get an interpretation on the proceedings here and well see where we stand here we got a threepoint game after the May Basket by middle Brooks and were going to see what happens with uh were going to see what happens with the number of free throws could determine where the margin is there when we play again and what what we have explained Wes what you did a great job explaining was technical foul in Middle Brooks technical foul on Salis double technical and then another technical on V but we have not had that confirmed yeah Music Applause Music Applause Music right okay all right Wes now what weve just what weve just been told is there are two double technical fight fouls Middlebrooks and Salis got called for a double technical foul diara got called for a technical foul but we understand now that Salis was also called for a technical foul so that means that not only is Middlebrooks out of the game but Salis now with two technical fouls in that sequence is also out of the game so since there were two technical fouls on each side there will be no free throws the free throws cancel out so now it basically resolves itself back to NC State going to the free throw line right somebody will shoot for Middle Brooks one foul one shot foul and it cant be Middlebrook right so now they got to get the bookkeeping squared away across and Salis by the way would have two technical fouls and be ejected those two fouls by the way those two technicals happen to be five fouls on Hunter Salis as well diara will be tagged with a second foul so he has two remaining Middlebrooks has fouled out of the game by the way with a season high and careerhigh 14 points with 486 left West during this latest stretch by North Carolina State middle Brooks was front and center yep I think he and diara regardless of how this comes out at the end and NC States got to like it up five up three now with 486 left I would say this Ben Middlebrooks and mohamd diara have kind of put themselves in a position now Dan where I think NC State can look to them confidently really at both ends of the floor well I would agree with that and the other thing West as you think about Wake Forest trying to Rally from the deficit whether it be three or four points Salis is their best threepoint shooter youre talking about middle Brooks and Dr they have combined West today for 22 points and 21 rebounds Music right just terrible so were waiting on Jeffrey Anderson Trey Steins and Jeb hard is to finish and were going to have Trey Stein come tell us I think what has been determined here and Ill let Dan handle the dissertation with try Im really interested in what he has to say all right so Trey Stein will tell Dan what has transpired here and we will get some resolve as to where the game is going to go with 486 left dont forget George and Clemson still to come tonight on acc Network J alter de antelli that has started over on the ESPN app and we will send you to Clemson as soon as we are done here in Raleigh and Jeffrey Anderson talking to Steve Forbes along with Jeb harness there so Trey Stein has finished giving Dan a fairly lengthy update well isnt that interesting okay what do we have here well what do we have is that it is as we thought middle Brooks and Salis got double got a double technical foul then diara and Salis headbutted one another okay so they got dead ball technical fouls and they both have been ejected from the game okay so diara is out diara is out but hes standing on the floor yeah but I I just was told hes out theara is out middle Brooks is out Salis is out and so what has to happen now is North Carolina state has to put somebody in from middle Brooks to to shoot the free throw heres uh Jeb hardness to clarify a little more so theara will head to the tunnel terrible youre terrible so Kim Richardson not letting any grass go under his feet he puts in oconnell y who is a 90 free throw shooter to shoot the shot for Middlebrooks correct he hadnt a free throw today so heres oconnell to try and make it a fourpoint game with 486 left and does all right well now you got to score really quickly Frederickson Miller hriff Marsh and Carr on the floor for Wake Falls Dennis Parker Juniors out there now with Taylor morcel oconnell and Horn and a three ball is no good and the rebound handled by Taylor hes got a foul now and theres a back cour foul on hildr his fourth Taylor will go to the line foul in the back court on hildr so two shots here for Jaden Taylor and in conference play Taylors above 90 from The Line fourpoint Game and our big bow moment brought to you by B Jangles it is Jaden Taylor and pure 100 hustle Dan its a timeout called and what happens after the timeout DJ horn goes to work and it just bought NC State more momentum than Wake Forest could handle it looks like the key to this second half has been with intensity on the defensive end by North Carolina State Miller foul from behind by Taylor Runner he held up in the air third on Taylor 10 on NC State so Millers going to shoot two free throws now on the 10th Wolfpack foul with 235 left he certainly didnt want to commit a foul in that situation so Miller at the line this has been some turnaround in the second half yep been a terrific gut check by Kevin keatss team question Miller free throw good and Wes keep this in mind too North Carolina state has not made a threepoint Basket in this game yep they have not dj horn has been fabulous offensively but its all been in the lane basically second one good by Miller and substitution Here Comes zanka for Wake Forest it has been since December 30th of 2014 against Cincinnati that the wol pack has not made to three and theres a quick foul by Brooky Miller its his third that will put oconnell back on the line Steve Forbes has now going to try and extend the game as much as he can with 229 left it is already two possessions at four the question is can oconnell force Inc state to make wake shoot threes and thats what the free throws come to here well the interesting thing is theres good free throw shooters out on the court for North Carolina State Parkers the worst one and they kept him very far away from the basket and if youre North Carolina State you know that at this point in the game all you have to do is defend the three if white for gets down and gets a two its not really that big a deal so heres Miller hes going to scoop it up Taylors already met him in the back cour wles try for three here and theyre going to get Parker leaning in stopping the clock with 185 left and thats going to put Miller back to the line where ropy Miller is spotless Dan 13 of 13 tonight and now Jeffrey Anderson is back to the monitor here I think hes looking to see if Millers really the guy whos supposed to go to the free throw line okay but that that was used to play Parker just got to get out of the way so Miller is at the line Im Lake Forest Im and Im Miller Im going to the line so it is Miller at the stripe for two yep couple of free throws Applause here and hes got his 20th point I mean not many times do you see a guard go for 20 and only have three field goals just saying 8075 second one good and you get a foul right away heres oconnell and Frederickson will commit the personal NC State West after being 5 for 11 from the line in the first half yes sir is 17 for 18 in the second half and back to a fourpoint Applause game 255th time these two have squared off they first played in what is believed to be from the record book January of 2011 NC State won 19 to8 the second meeting after wake won the first meeting 336 191 19 January 1911 what is recorded to be January 1911 hild a long Miss on the three and wake is not going to foul and NC State down now they do foul and Andrew Carr commits the foul thatll be his Fifth and this Wolfpack crowd at PNC Arena wasnt so sure at halftime they were going to get this outcome but theyre glad they did W their defensive pressure in the second half was a big key their ability to get to the free throw line and convert was a big key Wake Forest just wasnt able to get in any sort of an offensive rhythm in the second half horns free throw and DJ horn a terrific effort that is now nine in the second half and 20 in the ball game for horn fifth Game of the Year second in a row with 20 or more is third in the ACC how about that and that is it what a win for NC State five and one for the first time since Fire and Ice and Jimmy B
