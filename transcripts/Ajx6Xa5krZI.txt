great thing about this time of year that youve had a chance to clean some things up coaches reevaluate their system players get a chance to get some individual attention you got to no class work for the last three weeks a month you got a chance to really focus in and clean some things up and expect a lot of teams to take a steps o is Hy Jr you saw him on your scream a moment ago George on the catch right corner guarded by Briant just four on the shot clock got to get something up Mo stop with one fires away top of the key thats off to the left rebound cleared by the Bulldogs good defensive

they like the pieces they have as they move into swag they do they they feel comfortable with everything they have and by dongle with another unforced turnover there but they like the pieces they feel like they theyre ready to get into conference play theyre still making some adjustments with their reads did you see coach there talking to Bryant telling him like one of the reads to make and their ball screens action they run heavy he wants his guys to read and react hes not he doesnt like to run a ton of plac heres McGriff hails from Los Angeles off in the attack flips it in coach raved about him and what he meant to this team I mean Quincy McGriff is jco transfer in a 66 point guard gives him a lot of roster finish flexibility didnt play basketball one year ago after committing to Cal State northri started his career at Duane hes played in junior college as well another turnover here for Alabama AM two to two in the early going be a lot of ball screens actions if you dont get back in front of the basketball which is really challenging with a 66 point guard with the size of McGriff he turns the corner and no one stops him he ball you basket and he lays it in 133 points in his debut against Samford Just A Week Ago noted a two early going that was Powell on the touch now George Matumbo couldnt handle it the Bulldogs want to run into the Open Court layup R around is in Sal thats the key there for the Bulldogs if they want to pull off an upsets they want to force turnovers to speed you up Junior from Zak Center mustaf talented freshman Bang from about 8 ft out great job about yellow jackets there you break the Press you want to punish it break the Press you dont always want to set up offense if you got numbers take advantage of it and score need to take advantage of many opportunities as you Music can ball lost out of bounds and itll be a turnover Dam St a great conversation with him at shoot around this morning as he tries to just continue to try and put his NBA touch and his experiences on this basketball team and trying to figure out ways to have game plans for each of the players within the game plan well youre waiting and and When Youre Expecting your sophomores to take a step and theyre adjusting now to these guys were on a team a year ago and they were a surprise now theyre not sneaking up on anybody and theyre being schemed and they have to adjust to what the opponents are doing to him and theyre really inconsistent in making that adjustment right now bottoms top of the key thats Lance Terry the transfer from Gardner web the leading scorer for the jackets I dont know where the yellow jackets would be without him hes been the probably best twoway player there a Bryant comes back and knocks down that left hes jumping 7 to six a some Zone with some blitzing going on for the Bulldogs trying to cause some chaos for Georgia attack whos turned the ball over a handful of times early going theres another one AC of hands thats how they want to play theyre going to run and jump press and trap fifth turnover for Georgia Tech and Im looking for the lead and theyve got it three ball corner of pocket London riy so important for Yellow Jack to take care of the basketball and control the tempo of this game AM wants to junk it up theyre going to press Run and Jump want to force turnovers speed you up and theyre going to play multiple bodies lumbo lays it up and in hes played the last three games after missing the first nine to start the year great job B tumble there but you got to catch you keep it high dont want to bring it down you had to turnover you got stripped the last possession bringing it low just keep it high and finish Shing off there staying with it all blue the layup Chad Moody preseason First Team all swag Al down the throw down Lance Terry of a feed from Nathan George turning defense into the offense is what you want to do when youre a struggling ball Club created the turnover got out of the break Terry showing you how athletic he Music is Boy The Rim Ripper early here at mamish Tex hit their last four shots they lead by two blocked by Powell itll stay with the Bulldogs ooh fastpac game early on here in Atlanta Tech leading by two when youre struggling with offense nothing gets youre going with a Up Up Up and Away oop by the L Terry got a close one here in Music Midtown a lot and sometimes it becomes overwhelming but theyre fighting through that they got a consistent enough Talent now to to withstand this and now weather that storm with the practice time they really feel like theyre in a good place in a better place as good as theyve been three shot quickly taken by Riley missed everything jackets want to run on the drive counted thats Lance Terry a good start for him great job again attacking pressure dont let him get a free press or free trap break it no ones better at finding you than Nate George 60 run for T leading by 413 and9 on the drive shot blocked I think George got a hand on it jackets again into the Open Court Powell nice feed attacks hes foul will go to the line for a pair Duncan Powell the Redford junr from Dallas Texass third Music stop great job coming over by Pow with the block without drawing a foul and then rebounds and it runs to cour get rewarded for it able to complete the and one but love to see when your big guys rotate over and block the shot and get rewarded on the other end B at 13 points against the Blue Devils last weekend a lot of that coming in the first half consistency is what Damon Sodom is looking for from him he gives you a spark right off the bench oh that time though missed the whole Rim uh just a little short draft in here didnt notice its humid it is warm both of us oh hit a little air pocket there trying to figure it out here suits and ties on how hard has it been with all those injuries for the jackets to figure out rotations and rolls I I think its hard because now you think about the starting lineup Ryan mutambo started and he hadnt played a minute prior to that but now the last couple of games hes been starting and thats just shows you they theyre missing their backup their backups are injured and now theyre into their third string guys so to speak and thats always challenging this early in the year and its great for those guys because if they can get everyone back and healthy and draw pun this ex screen and in ACC thats wide open right now outside of Duke there theres a yellow jacket a lot to be excited about in their future they continue to try and figure things out jav and mccullin to the match he cant convert on the other end Aaron Smith 55 local product from Kell High School 64 sophomore cant connect and you see Georgia Tech defense starting to cause some issues for the Bulldogs whove missed their last six shots from the floor M jacket have room protection by daong goes on the floor and fou showing you his ability to rebound be a position body Defender even though hes not a shot blocker another turnover for George to attack a ton between these two teams bit a sloppy start continue you see that b go the other way Terry quick trigger not going to go rebounds by Smith Bulldogs want a run three ball in the air thats pure the L of dur Raman 21 points 10 assists against Samford came out of complete nowhere for his head coach thats a big start for him it is ran is really quick not known for his threepoint Music shooting knockdown is fourth on the year but they play in this style of tempo they want to junk the game up press and everyone is free to take those shots when theyre open foul there the shot will not roll in and going to the line for a bear will be by zong Yellow Jack has got to be cogent of how when the push P when a settle down rushing they run it up you know they theyre they do a great job of attacking the pressure and Scorn but theyre getting into this fastpaced game I think that favors Alabama and him just because of their depth and their style of play they mean they want to press Run and Jump and do all those different things doubt Otis hulie wants to play with Bas Dongo misses the first free throw she get set to ring in the New Year well have a mens basketball double header right here on acc Network that starts at 230 Eastern as Notre Dame takes on Georgia Tech then Cooper flag and number four Duke host Virginia attack at Cameron indor we wish everyone a Happy New Year you all had a good holidays as well with your families at home Rand hope it was good for you it was great had all my children and family home its sing it was good to the childrens family got to love that 15 12 Tech here on its home court kick to the corner three ball launch thats off to the right crashing the glass for the rebound that ball ripped away that was a gon boy Helter Skelter both teams just trying to find their footing Terry attacks no hell go to the Line Tech leading by three under 12 media timeout Music with so many of the young talented players coming over to attend college and thats kind of gone back and forth where they did it years ago then theyve kind of went the professional route and now it seems like that pendulum is swung back to attending college here in the US and the development is shown obviously not just in the NBA but shown their adjustment to college basketball as well something both of you were passionate about and he said he sees overseas is teaching kids how to play without the ball yes its an underrated aspect of the game you spent so much time working out with the basketball offensive F you know will you continue that development you need to learn how to play without the basketball you know you dont have it in your hands enough when you play with better players theyre going to get the ball you how what else do you do when you do not have the basketball in your hand its its one of those things from defense to to screening to passing to doing some of the little things to help your team win when you dont have the basketball in your hand its just underrated underappreciated aspect of the game we talked about Steph Curry and how everybody falls in love right with that three ball oh speaking of Curry that was from Curry range by Riley logo three as its just a onepoint game now but its everything else Steph Curry does off the ball well people dont understand that its just movement and everything else ball handling decision making McCullum step back triple count it oh that was pure from the top of the key Jam McCullum is the one guy on the Yellow Jacket roster that when everything else breaks down dami stard Mar doesnt have to run a play for him just give him the ball give him space go get him a bucketed Hes Surely been missed here early in the year hes trying to figure things out as he come back from injury good sign here with him knocking down that a step back the transfer from Oklahoma block there from pal Tech wants to run theyve got numbers advantage on the attack off the glass no off the side of the rim rather and the Bulldogs clear Damon has spoke so much about Jade mustaf and he thinks the officials struggle to officiate him and thats one of those things where hes so big and hes so physical he drives it a lot of contact but hes one of those young players he initiates so much contact that I think he doesnt get them whistled at times because of that Rand Damon St talked about trying to get him a little nastier yeah and said he plays hard but dont get me wrong I want him to have a little more Edge to him as he continues to learn the college game he you know coaches want that you cant have everything at one time hes this young mans coming here ands giving this yellow jacket team with so many negative things with injuries have been a part of the program early hes been a bright spot it be fun to see his continued growth of development who sto double figures in Techs last seven games in the attack throw out theres The Talented freshman oh you he knew what he was talking about thats when television is at its best this is the end of the floor where you want him to set the tone his his size and physicality talking about Jade mustaf is his versatility allows them to he can guard one through four I think thats his next step development for him top of the key three not there Roff continues to learn on the fly here in his freshman here Al you oh baby high above the Atlanta sky and it was Ibrahim Applause Suarez jackets blood in the water oh was going for backto back alop Jo Techs doing a really good job of getting stops getting in transition that time unable to finish the LOB but that was not the case here Jade mustaf comes down ibraim Suare on the other end of that one great catch and great finish used all 68 of his length to go up and grab that one you like to see the unselfish play thats going on with Jord te you dont mind it you want that to be able to finish that lob there talk about the unselfishness round off seven assists on nine made baskets yeah I mean thats thats a great sign it was the basketball moving no ones forcing a great defensive possession Jord teeker stepped up the defensive end forcing turnovers shot clock violation here excuse me saying Ive seen enough let me calm my troops down coach Julie want to wants to have a chat Georgia attack team back here in Atlanta Tech by eight Rand off what have you liked so far early on from Damon Styers jackets theyre starting to pick it up on the defensive end and even though theyve been in transition early theyre not turning the basketball over as much theyre starting to be unselfish the basketball is moving it but theyre turning defense any the offense and when youre struggling when you drop four out of five thats what you want to hang your hat on you want to put it on the defensive end of the floor and some of this theyre being forced into it because Alabama AM is playing this game at the style of Pace that they want to play but the yellow jacket have done a great job of breaking this press forcing turnovers on the defensive end and making it easy baskets on the other end a Georgia teag team that was picked 12 in the preseason ACC as George dials up a triple off to the right long rebound there for the Bulldogs they felt optimistic though they could pass those projections and in this ACC landscape feels like theres a lot of real estate to be had had by other teams in the league as McCullum floats it gravity oh not kind the rim didnt pull it through its a great move there its just what Jamie Im Callum bring to his team thats just the offense you dont have to script theres no play just put it in his hands simple ball screen he gets in unable to get the floer to go down but you want to see more of that you need aggression from him he needs to put his stamp on this team Music eight media timeout is upon us Georgia Tech 23 Alabama AM Music 15 play that Tech has to do a better job of taking care of turnovers but theyre doing a really good job themselves of getting stops and turning those turnovers in only offensive end layups like right there yeah another turnover the 11th for Alabama ANF Tech is feasted early on George on the catch F Damon St talked about ball rotation ball movement were a better basketball team he said when we move the ball under 10 on the clock McCullum with five hes the guy they go to late in the clock shot blocked go the other way Bryant crosscourt pass pass McGriff interior feed spin move shot up off the glass off the rim not loose ball picked up AM shot blocked oh Applause baby ibraim Suare getting active inside say you one him Suare on the other led to a good look for mullum high effort there for Suare leads to a second chance McCullum lines up another hes not missing two in a row great confidence there and this is what dam stard talked about for Jon McCullum aggression aggression he missed one three no hesitation with the second one he brings that Dimension to this team late shot clock at previous possession he didnt get the shot but thats what you want to see no hesitation step right into it laces it great sign for the yellow jackets if he can just begin to get aggressive and assertive they round up and get ready for ACC play they fall back now into their 131 Zone cullums got six best shooter so far this season on this jackets team over 40 10 run for Georgia Tech has him up 11 defense has been the key theyve ramped it up the last couple of minutes block shot there George now mullum transfer from Oklahoma George right wing mullum again 10 from three back iron rebound caral by Applause McGriff McGriff attacks shot put back foul attack in the glass was Moody hell go to the line Moody we spoke about is raining swag freshman of the year and really good offensive rebounder when if guards penetrate down here was a big weak side you want to come clean it up you want to SC and get involved in the game thats how you do it your Defender goes over and help you follow him chase him try to clean it up great job by Chad Moody there Moody cant connect on the free throw theres London Riley back in the game boy started the year seven of his first eight games in double figures and a double double in four blocks in the first game of the year for these Bulldogs theyve got some nice pieces as they move into swack play right youve got a couple preseason All Conference performance and Quincy McGriff could end up being the x factor in that League he could I mean hes a guy whose Talent says I belong at a higher level and when you get a player like that at any League that just shows you hey my talent dictates that Im the best player potentially in this league it just elevates the team and swacks are a very good League but his talent alone theres not many six6 point guards at any level in college basketball let alone a skilled one rambling State picked to win the league again wrap on laying not there on the attack that was Dongo yeah hes right in front of us he landed on his teammate let hope hes all right not a sight right this Georgia attch team who has been battling so many injuries wants to see from its star player you can see he rolls that left ankle stepping on Lance Terrys foot here right there hope hes all right get that taped up get back out here its never a good sign when you see ankle bin like that but thats the advant of being young like you I assure you he bounces back a lot quicker than I do I promise yeah well they take me right swells immediately were going to the hospital they just put a cast on me right there just roll me out I might be okay and Im asking for an ambulance just in case tacked in his Zone and they last time they ran his Zone he switched the manto man once he got inside McGriff no Bryant yes hardest thing to do when his zone is rebound out of it and you spread out got a crash thats one of the guards to come in and those loose balls and rebounding against his own those were the first points for the Bulldogs in almost 6 minutes good ball rotation leads to an open three George cant connect got a great look offensive rebound Second Chance what a feed hand a layup from mullum okay matuma yeah so impressive to see what Ryan mumbos doing youre talking about a guy that hasnt played all year long and through Players being unavailable hes in the stting lineup and hes done nothing but make plays hes drawn on his experience hes big Force inside hes altering shots crashing the offensive glass and showing you he can also pass the basketball mullum through contact throws it up no hell go to the line he was fouled hacked in the act starting to see the yellow jackets control the paint on both ends of the floor theyre altering shots theyre blocking shots on the defensive end starting to see them pound the paint tack the rim doing a really good job of controlling the P right now foul given to Moody number 23 thats his second colum knocked down the free throw starting this week well have four consecutive Sunday with womens basketball quadruple headers right here on acc Network our first lineup as Hannah Hidalgo in third ranked Notre Dame hosting UVA then its Louisville BC followed by 17th ranked UNC in Miami in the day capped off by 22nd ranked NC State hosting Clemson Randolph Hannah hadalo Olivia miles thats a heck of a backcourt for NE Ivy I watch him every time I get a chance when theyre on they are so fun to watch another great guard play in a great tradition guard play and that no trame point uh point guard the ACC not struggling on the women side in basketball its a loaded lead no not at all oh how about the three ball there McGriff not struggling from downtown he add that into the mix of what he brings to the Bulldogs Music team theyve gotten the shots that they wanted they just been sloppy and turn it over to basketball themselves mccullums had the hand in the first half it continues McCullum his third triple here the half great shot there by McCullum but also a great find there by Nate George hes getting in the paint off the dribble and finding Applause teammates a George has four assists here in the first half McCullum bleeding the way with 13 points for Georgia back this one of many assist body guard Nate George just getting in the paint finding McCullum hes knocking down his third Music three be harder to not to keep him in the lineup one because we talked about it hes just a guy that when things break down and were struggling in the offensive end I can put the ball in his hands I dont need to run a play for him like thats the difference when you can put the ball in a guys hands and you dont need to run a play for him and he can execute and get you a bucket create a shot for himself or for a teammate you know Dame star has the luxury of having a guy like that and of all the injuries hes had none were bigger than having J on mut him out of the lineup over a th points now in his career we talk about the injuries but Randolph how hard is it in this new era of college basketball when you got to put rosters together much like the NBA Callum I mean he continues to ball here in this first half as he tries to find his Groove with a new team oh we talked about that again if you saw him he waved off the screen its like get out of the way hey clear out wave out waved off the screen and just drove took his man took the contact kissing it off the glass for a chance at an n one and this is what he brings its its we dont need to run offense I dont need a screen just get out of the way let me ISO and hes looking to put this game away here early in the first half and thats what what he brings and you just I cant stress how vital it is to have a guy like that because not a lot of teams do immediate impact bucket getter as that foul was on waren back in is musaf Georgia attex open things up here in the latter stages the first half they lead by 18 theyve been tough on the interior 21 holding Alabama AM twopoint field goal percentage its really solid forcing tough shots like that one offensive rebound and a foul lets see if they can continue to rebound though with this lineup in theyre theyre small now Georgia Tech they have four guards on the floor with pow at 68 so now its its can you rebound with your smaller lineup on the floor one thing though Alabama AM has done well this season they crash the glass and they forc turno those are the two areas that I think theyre going to have to rely on as they get into swack play get into confidence yeah and you play against this type of back court guard play when you get in the conference players men I mean theres some Elite guard play out here for the yellow jackets but theyre pace and their style they want to junk the game Up drag you out in the deep end and force you just to play basketball youre not going to theyre not going to allow you to run your Music sets the length and the rim protection and the ability to control the paint is just been a difficult challenge for them so far against the Yellow Jacket Terry dials up a triple and he knocks it down from downtop hes sus spended God sent for Dam stard Mar just as a twoway player just gives them what they need an athletic guard knocks down threes hes been their best player this season and they can just get healthy as healthy as possible in time for conference play and look out you can expect the yellow jackers to take a Music step M Griff hit a three earlier not that time hes got seven in this contest Georgia Tech looking to pull away mullum feeling good that one not there offensive rebound Second Chance coming Terry that three pure got to find Terry L Terry is as good a catch and shoot guard as there is in the ACC and the ball is just moving J Tech right now theyre defending right now theyre sharing the basketball having these three guards on the floor with Lance and Lance Terry and McCullum and Nate George is creating Havoc right now for Alabama ANM another turnover for us nice feed and the jam that was mustaf on the rim Ripper 4622 Georgia Tech leading Music big mustaf on the attack mustu on the Finish jackets rolling at home right before we turn to 2025 Music Music en Music Music Music whoof got six points Lance Terry though has got 14 of him he was another immediate impact transfer right from Garder web you get some older guys into your back court hopefully they gel as you get into ACC play yeah Lance Terry was here a year ago when he red shirted his ability to stick around and just been amazing for Dam St Mars group as he rebounds this and pushes it out to another transfer thats having himself a heck of a game in jvon McCullum McCullum is going to the line him and Terry have combined for 30 points here in this first half Georgia attacks 46 total now with Nate George on the floor his it gives him two wings that he could just Outlet the basketball to and just say hey go get yours those guys know what coming theyre going to get their touches coach Hobbs there oh Hobs veteran assistant coach whos actually recruited me at one point in time in high school you believe that so Im not as old as you think I am dont you say anything about that you just go on to the next I will yes sir he calls me sir huh you like what I did there thats called clever theres coach first person David star called when he took the job Ro Hops and had a chance to talk to him before the game and so much knowledge been around this game for a long time I enjoy going to every building especially today come in here Randolph children the celebrity stopped it thats a foul from Beyond The Ark three free throws coming you got people opening doors for you Damon Sodom comes over big hug you and him go back we do we do were in a class of 95 were same draft and we were actually as we were playing in college it wasnt the way it is now and know I would have to stay up to watch his games and he would watch mine before we became friends we would all we were competing against each other in college its two of the better guards him and Sean rord at Michigan State we were all competing as as we felt as though were the best guards in college basketball Applause second free throw good as well this era of basketball right Rand off its changed so much and its almost like the NBA you got so many free agents who come in every single year that youre trying to gel and mesh together and find that camaraderie as you get into a tough league in the ACC and trying to find ways to win games get in this new normal landscape its it is normal and its you can complain about it all you want its a necessity to adjust to so you can either make the adjustment and like everyone else is doing and you got to figure it out its just part of the job now its its different than what it was and you see some were losing a lot of Veteran coaches who who no longer want to they dont want to adjust to what this is but if you want to have staying power and you want to have success youre going to have to figure out a way to implement young talent and a new talent to your Applause roster attack towards the end of the buzzer and Powell flushes at home as the clock will hit Triple Zer really great half of basketball second half from mamish 50 to 25 Georgia attack Terry on the attack flips it up no the flush the put back Jam is there I think the ankles okay he looked fine but he didnt land on the right ankle he want to put a ton of pressure so seems to be bother him a little bit but hes toughening it out playing so thats a sign that hes going to be okay definitely still looks a little shaken up favoring the other ankle 5225 foul called on the drive Baseline its going to go against Dongo what did I do thats exactly what hes asking what did I do great job there again as a big your Defender Ro rotate over to block a shot its easy at two points as you fine you just follow him foul there and the Bulldogs will go to the line itll be Bryant you know one of the things that Damon STM said made by Dongo by Dongo last season was exactly that put back dunk right the hustle plays following up for his teammates finding different ways to be active without the ball this team needs him to do that because whats happened is when you play against this team youre scheming him hes the guy thats on The Scouting Report that youre designing your defense to kind of stop we got to keep this guy in control he needs to do those other little things because his teammates needs him to do those things so they can score what makes the game easier for him and then now he gets to pick and choose his moments when he wants to attack hes coming out here as this game continues to escalate here with Jord Tech being doubling up bulldogs and you kind of monitor here at some point in time you would like to for them to keep this lead so he can just go right to the ice tub start getting better for 2025 in conference play free throw short here from Brian he splits him the Bulldogs have a chance to come back its got to be they got to junk this game back up what they did earlier kept themselves in the game early before Jord Tech took control that three rattles home from MO showing you the different levels of his game thats not a strength or his but hes capable of knocking down shots if he takes threes like that the open ones just enough to make you have to guard him outside the threepoint line hes a bulldog in attacking the rim and drawing fouls thats a big part of his game but thats all you need him to do step in knock down threes like that continue his development and growth and its going to be exciting to watch his play over the next couple of months as we finish getting the ACC play moving scen called on the Bulldogs goes against s thats what happens when you play against a team thats more physical is where the tech is theyre trying to try to answer back and sometimes you set no screens they never feel good you use your hip say e stuck his hit B on that screen and they George shoulder its in a little pain because of it sophomore shakes It Off jackets comfortably ahead dur in this second half George on the CCH now mullum into the interior looking for the wraparound bounce pass not handled there turnover its an area Georgia Tech cleaned up that last 10 minutes of the first half yeah I think its maybe Im good good idea execution wasnt great so was probably looking for the ball to be up top hes looking for a l not looking for bounce pass at his feet oh McCullum shaking up grabbing his left ankle a lot of pain the last thing damid star wants to see is like here we go again one of his star players grabbing his ankle here say hes saying to his team stepped on my foot Applause FKS there see he steps on his foot falls to the ground hes walking straight to the locker not even going to the bench if anything sums up Georgia Tech season so far thats it right there 18 points and this one from the just as he was starting to figure things out and get implemented get back in basketball shape lets hope he can recover quickly say interior feed catch he F SF footer from darar Sagle you can see hes a handful to cover in this game imagine what he can do in the swag really unselfish well does a great job of trying to seal defended in front of me he likes to wedge you up the lane and create a pass over the top not afraid to throw his body around now on Powell is second Bulldogs team that has a lot of length and Music Applause athleticism stays on this side of the Court O Julie very passionate about skill development saying if you come to Alabama AM youre going to learn how to play the game of basketball in its purest form well hes hes not going to run a ton of plays he wants to teach his guys how to play what do you do when a person drives what do you do when the ball is search position the shot selection is something that you got to work on youre implementing so many players nice feed there and Suare rips it downare there more block shot now on the other end about the burst of energy here from Suare The Freshman thats what he does when he gets into the game he knows hes a Runner he runs the floor here and a rim protector as he blocks the shot on the other end here great job running and finishing the numers called This is how you answer it you dont need the four shots on the offensive end you block shots and rebound and you run the Music floor stardoms got to love to see that heres George on the attack oh turns it over not a great possession there by a lot of dribbling by me to move the basketball much 7 foot or tries the three oh he didnt even catch the Applause rim bulldo are making BS worse now theyre trying to get a theres no 30point shot in basketball you got to chip away one basket at a time dont get outside yourselves H talking to se about that like thats not the shot we want right now Applause both teams 12 games into the season good effort there from the Bulldogs and Bryant really this is your last chance right to kind of figure things out rotations how guys factor in roles obviously injuries playing a part for Georgia Tech but once we turn the page into 2025 its conference play each and every game yeah no one cares after that its youre in conference play and you just got to figure it out youre cheering for your your conference mates when youre in nonconference play but once the season starts everybodys man for himself pow pure from that right wing done a great job of shooting that wing and Baseline Music threes forek has shot the ball well today from Beyond The Arc 8 of 15 53 sent and Alabama AM back to the line but what theyve done the best job I think is they just been active on the defensive and the floor just there do a great job in front weak sides there figh for the basketball you dont mind fouls like that fight for loose balls freshman on the ground draws the foul youre okay with that Thursday at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header than nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for the

also the length of Jord te for out there with his L by dongle with his length its kind it bothers you youre not accustomed to playing against the bigs with their physical strength and throw in with Tomo as is welding his Leng back to back fouls now here on the Bulldogs sh we continues instruct his guys down big always coaching mustaf going to have to help here P inside if he tries to back him Applause down ter step back no offensive rebound put back through some contact play on Terry falls out of bounds T got to remember as well you can call timeout there before you fall out of bounds thats the rule adjustment change that they made falling out you can call time out and get it guess he didnt want to waste it being up Music big go to Tex Center Zone here and back in there two3 theyre really packing it in with and them struggling from behind the threepoint line and tried to shoot over that zone and go the other way Tech having no issues with Alabama AM First Media timeout of the second half is upon us hope Jon mccullums injury isnt bad see him there hes iced up so hes definitely done probably for the game and just want to get through this one but man we talked about injuries its been such a big part of their story talk about wanting to get healthy that Music happens what a move a finish not there there was some contacts that was der on Sutton three ball launched off to the right rebound there I love the activity of a Suare who gets popped in the face he you can see his motor impacting this game active going after every rebound both ends of the floor challenging shots at The Rim thats the way you get on the floor here great move by Sutton here hes got to learn you avoid the contact there youre not going to get the fou need to make a jump stop to create an angle help yourself theyre not going to call that here Suare with another rebound and drawing a foul R was shaking up a common theme these 40 minutes of basketball for both of these sides coach Julie doesnt want to lose him no not period in swack play next up for both teams as they get into conference play we talked about him in the open he needs to be healthy and ready Bulldogs have Arkansas B Blu Mississippi Valley stay in alorn Music state Griff rotates it left wing top of the kick now ran into the teeth of that Georgia Tech defense cant finish through contact the B and crashed the glass well but even the Second Chance not there Ed L is just bothering inside theyre getting to the rim theyre getting offensive rebounds but theyre just unable to finish so much Rim protection and length at The Rim is just making it difficult Music Bulldog Allan and Y they call him a Music say Georgia Tech reach deep into the bench but not much of a bench left here for the jacket they they have theyre playing everyone you look at just this game in a microcosm of whats going on Sutton has didnt play Early Ryan mutambo didnt play early and now W Tomo started and Sutton is averag in almost double digit minutes the last few games and you see the talent but again its just awesome Georgia Tech to have to make adjustments its literally theyre doing it game the game right now with the way the injuries are piled up against but whats been impressive no matter whos been in the lineup this afternoon theyve been defended and defending well Griff prayer not answered go out of bounds last Touch by the jackets Dongo back in there its a good sign its a great sign but more importantly you see that defensive possession switches on to guard guards the basketball keeps it in front forces a difficult shot unable to secure the rebound and finish the possession nonetheless we see him moving in the perimeter which is a good sign because we saw him roll his ankle early in the game politicism of a Dongo one of the best rebounders in the league his game continues to evolve thats a good three ball Rileys got another one yeah Rileys knocked down one in the first half he knocks down another p he had had many teammates knock down threes to help him Music out Riley also hails out of the Atlanta area George from Beyond The Arc no rebound Bulldogs Bryant three ball thats P back to back from Beyond The Arc its going to make the Bulldogs feel good about this stretch well their style of play if they can score baskets and Implement their full CT pressure thats what they want to play Run and Jump do those type of things trying to junk this game up lets see if they can make a run and get back in it there six of 20 from Beyond The Arc hit 13 threes against Sam for their last match up Tech second chance I just dont think the Bulldogs can sitting them manto man they got to do something different to get back in this game nice feed there and the Finish Suare flips it ins another pain basket by the yellow Jacks where theyve dominated all after not there for Bryant what would you change for the Bulldogs oh I just think they need to run and jump mix in some change when he get the half court the one thing about the yellow Jacks weve seen the domination from JB McCullum before he went out and now by dong goes into the game but we saw Lance ter as well they dont have any Rim protection to stop guys get the balls going to get to the paint whenever it Music Applause wants nice move from Dongo couldnt finish a foul staying on this side the cour I believe it is nope itll be on back there great job pushing it Bryant steps into that sweet left Jay there back to back threes here for the Bulldogs theyre down 30 but theyre trying to fight and scrap get back in the game and the last thing you want to do is J Tech give up points without time running off the clock Wyant came into the game shooting almost 50 from three thats free throw there from Ag and Coach Julie doesnt want to shut down he want he doesnt want to shorten his bench he wants to lengthen his bench hes got guys he just wants to play and they just didnt score enough baskets to be able to set their defense and press and Run and Jump struggle from the field and theyve spent so much time on the heels hes still coaching his group but a lot of that just is affected by Jordan Music Tech heres the pressure we talked about this is what they usually want to do after a made free throw after a ma basket sometimes theyll get into their man pressure that time in a 221 and just walked it back down George now foul Tech gets into a set foul called tongo Low Down Low to deal with yeah you cant there a guard I dont want to get switched on it by Dongo there difficult challenge for me or any guard inside how did you play guy bigger than you in z i did you were a shooter like that yeah yeah yeah help thats what you do I just ront it and yield help another three ball for the jackets Georgia attack has shot it really well from Beyond The Ark Terry cuts inside backs it out to George Dongo wants it hes got it oh what a feed unselfish and George lays it in they call go end officially but that was going in no matter what George attack on top in cruise control here in Music Atlanta these are all critical players that are double digit injuries early on is also added to the narrative or the reality of where the ACC was and nonconference play as well Im not saying they would have totally fixed the narrative but they definitely are players that impacted their team and when they come back and healthy theyre going to theyre going to impact their teams in a major way lets see if those teams cant dig you know if they didnt dig themselves in a big hole early they can just hold on to those guys come back and get some continuity and figure out things and makeing make a run in E to play Carolina Clemson pit what do you make of those three teams and the early going feels like Dukes getting all the headlines yeah they seem to be the next through next group I mean Clemsons been really solid been really consistent know they had a couple of overtime losses at home uh they beat Kentucky they did they did which was a great win which a great win pit has been really good je cable has done a heck of a job with that group they seem to be right there Carolina is with that brutal schedule theyre I think the fourth or fifth most challenging schedule in the country and coming off a big win and signature win that they needed against UCLA and I think everyone else after that were just trying to wait and see want to figure it out I think Health becomes a big part of whos the next group that steps up behind those three teams turnover Ali EP saves three ball Corner Pocket yes nothing but nylon that was jayen coling from nearby award you know of guys hitting a portal and you know if winning doesnt do it if a final four run can and some nil money would make you want to come back then I dont know what I can do and obviously its been a tough year a tough start to the season for for the hurricanes and but hes a great coach Hall of Fame coach and weve lost two Hall of Fame coaches in this league this year and uh lets hope we can figure out some Comon ground that keeps keep some guys around this game Ill leave it to the people smarter than me to figure out how to fix it I like what I do I get to hang out with Randolph Childress Im good dont mind me no I think we all do and its just its just this game everything about it is evolving so fast its not easy for anyone know where it was needed to change and you dont like the way it is definitely not going back to the way it was and how do we how do we find Common Ground just vision and everything is happening so so fast no doubt the landscape continues to evolve and change year to year 68 38 George attack has battled injuries this season and in this game as George the three not there only four points for George 0 of four now from Beyond The Arc Bulldog triple not there off to the left one thing in getting Jon McCullen back would allow to be what he wants to do like this he wants to be a pass first a guy and and not having Jon McCullum in it was forcing him to be a score and and thats what Lance Terry does is he knocks down another three with the assist from Nate George thats his fifth here of the afternoon his 10th career 20point game as well theyre going to rely on him in ACC play you hope mccullums healthy George continues to evolve here in his second year Dongo establishing the interior as Georgia Tech team does have the pieces yes to be able to turn into something pretty hard to prepare for as we get into conference play as they get into conference play just one thing is they got to get healthy you got to get some consistency in being healthy G is trying some fancy stuff yeah you get you get you get up big like this try to do a little I do think he needs to balance being a score in the pass first guy is his role changes depending on these injuries with the players that hes playing with and he has to stay down in and stay aggressive in his decision making the shot making just telling the guys its not a timeout its not an in timeout theyre going to keep keep playing looking on Coen shoulder now Bryant to the corner three ball not there offensive rebounds stick back nope heres Terry into the Open Court they left him oh he missed the Laughter jam L teres its like what did I just do my bad thats all you can say to the guys is my bad its better than I would have done cuz I would have got hung he at least hit the back of rim wont get an easier one than that no one stops the basketball and he actually jumped so high he has to duck his head and thats why he misses the shot I didnt have those problems I just would have laid it off the glass last time I tried to dunk on a break like that I got hung Music three not there cleaned up foul on the drive one of our car leagues team made him out last time that Music happened 71 38 George attack continues to roll here in the a Music taking care of business in New Orleans in the Sugar Bowl against not today I do Carson backs out Gunner Stockton in Bulldogs Bulldogs Kirby Smart finds a way I just think they find away how Texas does huh against Arizona State kind of came out of nowhere in the Big 12 hook horns with Quinn ERS at quarterback yeah like I said I just would sign up for a good game we had first week we didnt have the best games I think Texas and Georgia part three would be great I signed up for it when it started and been okay with it I think a lot of tech fans watch it justoo think just cringed they dont want to see that well theres a lot of dogs in the Atlanta area a lot of ug fans in the Atlanta Music area 73 to 38 theyre everywhere they are everywhere rightfully so its good as that program has been last few years Premier programing college football right now no doubt about that 73 38 George step back Nope off to the left Bryant Lefty stroke smooth top of the Music key Bryants knocked down a three showing you why hes shooting over 40 from behind Arc and you saw that Brack bracket there two for five behind threepoint line and you got to build habits now you know in a game like this you look at the score you throw the score out you got to play you got to build the conference play and head coach hulie still barking out instructions getting his guys to kind of adjust to things the way he want them to play nice feed Terry continues his hot night thats one of those with by Dongo I think he he puts you in is hip a lot and allows him to pass I think when he wants to attack he needs to turn his face hes skilled more than he is physical hes not going to win the battle with backing guys down particularly bigger Applause Guys numbers if they want it down the court oh they were mean intentions theyre at the rim for mustaf yeah the rim blocked that hes laughing because he sat on the ground see thats one of those ones I would have pretended to be hurt see this is my kind of dunk this is a Randolph childrens dunk right here ah except I would have failed three rows in true story the last time I did that Cory Alexander carag V was a high school teammate of mine I go down I go to dunk it I get hung I wipe out the next three rows the game is continued to go and hes standing over talking me laughing during our high school game have you got him back for it you dont even want to know what I things I have to do deal with him we dont we dont have enough time to talk about that but no Jade mustaf is going to hear that from his friends and family he got a piece of it and he tried to dunk it and the rim blocked it lucky for him he drew the foul and got two free throws out of Music it whoof with 13 quietly also six rebounds and four assists played really well since hes been inserted in the lineup even before he got in the lineup hes been averaging 12 points a game over the last seven games his confidence is continuing to grow nice feed and a throw down that was Dongo on the hammer another assist by the yellow jackets look got 22 assists was 28 made buckets everybody getting into the ACT Bulldogs relentless on the o glass its clance Crosby what do you know another assist by Nate George by Dongo with the cut and finish great to see him back after rolling his ankle early didnt need a dominant performance out of him today I think the biggest thing youll take out of yellow jacket man just glad hes back didnt play a lot of minutes thats why hes still in the game right now rode his ankle and missed some time in the first half seems to be doing much better here in the second Music Music Tech putting on the finishing touches here of a dominant effort under five to play Dongo a too much to handle hell go to the line the bonus is Georgia Tech this is the way theyre going to play when you switch you sets that ball screen you switch and get a guard on him and he can kind of catch it you just decide if he wants to back you down or turn his face I think he needs to do more of that turn Face to L use his athleticism and his length he can overpower guards but sometimes even though guards are shorter they get leverage against you and takes a ton of time for you to kind of wedge those guards down hes turns and faces and waiting on the double team to pass it to a teammate want to remind you that ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tabom is weekdays at four Eastern right here on acc Network in the ESPN app those two been busy huh two ACC teams make the college football playoff basketball season volleyball couple ACC teams make deep runs Louisville almost had it League of Champions baby definitely impressive actually when you look at Olympic sports they dominate baseball all those teams get to Omaha from the ACC Softball continues to improve Florida State Clemson Virginia TCH softball world thats coming up here in the spring foret about my deeps in the Baseball World now hey coach Walter Im telling you those guys can play yeah and the investment the investment put into that program has been unbelievable yes it has hes hes the best he really is someone from my coaching days I look forward to talking to a lot attack and the Finish game opening up fast break everywhere thats what Jord Tech did a great job of early and the pressure started bothering him theyve never stopped attacking the pressure getting easy baskets and I think thats one of the reasons and I think it changed the game because the Bulldog stopped pressing they stopped extending their press because J Tech punished them going Coast to Coast finishing and he just got out of the press and once that happened defensive end of the floor Jord Tech just controlled the pain on both ends game game just got away from Alabama Dongo muscles his way in too easy there he gets it that low forget about it Dongo now in a double figures with 10 a foul final immediate timeout coming up tack its cruising another assist and another dunk by the jello Jack is running away here up 40 against the Bulldogs and the opening schedule for the ACC there are some really good games to start the year off it starts on New Years Eve it is so were not quite done with 2024 n and then it rolls into 2025 but were back the breaks over we saw conference play and a lot of big games there for thir ATT Tech and a big game against Notre Dame and again we talked about Marcus Britton is one of those guys that have been injured and hes still out both teams are trying to get healthy and play

Hughes hosting awake for us coming up there on New Years Eve its a big game for both of those teams the conference play now no matter what you started out 0 and two two and0 it it gets real now shot

trying to get them to adjust and make the adjustments necessary he didnt care about the score he knows how important it is I want to get my guys playing well this conference plate open up and try to keep them healthy continue to take a step free throw Applause good Techs gotten there now 20 times this will be attempt number 21 of the afternoon s knocks them both down coach Julie the Bulldogs this is how theyll start swag play rambling state was picked was the preseason favorite the Texas Southerns looked pretty good Southerns looked solid pathon cook look tough theyve been picked ninth in the league but if if they can just score enough field goals and baskets will figure out a way to continue to be more aggressive on the defensive end thr pressure Jord DET Tech just punish their pressure which everyone will try to do they force some turnovers early just weren able to capitalize Applause them how about Nicholls brings the fans to their feet teammates love it hes in the scoring Applause column the best parts of the game something that we dont get anymore with the analytics becoming such a big factor this getting guys off the walk on coming in and being able to score they work so hard they such a big part of College athletics they always will be and its great when they get a moment to have some type of stat in the game oh Nicholls stays with it give it back to him let him shoot it
