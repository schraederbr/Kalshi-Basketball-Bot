look at a couple of new faces for radford as well mike jones in his 10th season as the head coach of radford they get a brand new starting five after winning the regular season last year in the big south not a couple new faces eight new faces hes got a whole new team but mike young is an experienced coach coming off backtoback regular season titles in the big south he knows how to get this done bailey oh kev a aluma in the middle with the tip and we are underway in the 2020 2021 basketball season and will wabissa bidi running the floor now for virginia tech Applause aluma the transfer from wofford comes up a bit short and it stays with virginia tech ted valentine with the officials joined by bill covington and tim comer aluma a guy that followed mike young here to blacksburg mac yeah four returning starters but keve aluma is a big newcomer sat out last year really improved this is a guy that can play bigger than his than his stats mentioned yeah seven points per game seven rebounds per game speaking of stats tyrese radford leading the hokies as a returning starter returning score with the most points last year averaging double figures not to mention the leading rebounder two at about six three generously 63 little aluma off the mark and it goes to radford looking at this lineup for radford i already see a freshman in the lineup and familiar ali taking the ball up for the highlanders now wilmington delaware and mike young first time hes getting to see this bunch out there together not in practice both of these coaches will learn a lot about their teams today that they havent been able to so far bailey well louis jonkers going to go right to the line one of the few returners that mike jones actually has for radford the transfer from vcu yeah and watch out for tonka hes a good player you mentioned transfer from vcu out of springfield virginia hes got a chance to be really good well both teams yet to score so far 45 seconds in coming out of springfield virginia watch out for that match up down low with him and aluma although it looks like aluma has been setting up on the outside in the opening possession Applause chunkum takes the lead for radford you can see a lot different virginia tech offense they can do a lot more things with this bunch and youll see the other newcomers off the bench but theyll have some inside presence where last year if you ran virginia tech off the arc virginia tech had very little chance to win the basketball game theyve got more ways to score than they did a year ago and its going to be interesting to see if the hokies are going to have that guy to take it inside to the paint this year after really setting up for perimeter shot for most of the year heres hunter couture a good play by ali as he goes to the floor and its stolen away by jeffers here comes manga making his radford debut going reverse layup to make it three nothing yeah transfer from charlotte hes out of roxbury north carolina a guy that radford recruited hard out of high school got in the second time around now the highlanders pretty hyped up right now hokies without a basket thats what he had over five assists per game last year cant hit the bunny peteys a really good leader he was a big key to last years team over achieving by his leadership skills and how just tough he is bailey and its going to be interesting to see what he can do offensively because at times last year well be sabidi did struggle offensively but was like we said branded as a facilitator for the hokies and almost stole that one away match up against the freshman hes harassing him pretty well walker pulls up hes got it yeah kyrie walker he was the one guy that mike jones mentioned he was really excited about another transfer out of the university of delaware as is justin mutts for the hokies yeah were going to see justin mutts coming up soon as tyrese radford we didnt see him shoot a lot of threes last year but mike young had said that youre going to expect to see tyrese radford to shoot a lot more than he did last year oh for radford a hot start so far drayvon mangum here no reverse on aluma it looked tough so far mac very athletic play a little inside out action from walker knocks down the 15footer bradford will run a lot of set plays mike young has always done a great job with this half court offense taking advantage of matchups creating a lot of big on little screens and three taken by mangum cant hit it okie still looking for their first basket Applause kick it out to aluma and get his first points as a hokey just yet Applause ramfords always good defensively mike young an outstanding i mean mike tones mike young mike jones both with radford connections but mike jones has done a great job at radford in his decade there ali driving baseline hands it off you cant hit the layup even after a great job of driving down the baseline see if the hokies can score in transition swing it out radford hes got it nothing but net for tyrese radford he knocked the lid off that basket well see if that gets a hoax hes going radford has really worked hard on his shooting and the year that he sat out the year before mike young arrived he was in that gym every single day because he was home a lot didnt travel with the team as he redshirted i think hes got a chance to be a a multilevel player oh speaking of multilevel players theres kedealuma first basket as a hokie and its a dunk to tie the game Applause alum is strong enough to battle down on the block but agile enough to get out and run in transition as you just saw jeffers almost lost the ball crowded in front of couture Applause the logo five and the shot clock just a bit too short rebound and the stick back cant fall comes ali almost happy in one well we got a close one so far here in blacksburg the season has tipped off and its tied at castle coliseum hokies and highlanders battling in game one so with att you can pick the perfect plan for each family member with the features they want like hbo max what was that happens every time i say hbo max cool hbo max Music it can read its not complicated now you can save more with att wireless plans and get things your way with features like hbo max included did you know duracell optimum can make devices work even better than coppertop this toothbrush brushes quicker this

medical explanation or that the smallest changes could make the biggest impact you did and so did we thats why hills always starts with a pets biology to anticipate their ever changing nutritional first couple of games that the hokies had they got off to a hot start going into hawaii and beating a ranked michigan state team this kind of dropped off at the end with the league play and the acc tournament the hokies were walloped in the final game of the season by north carolina not a pretty tough one so far taking a little while to heat up offensively the first shot off the mark for familiar ali making his college debut today bailey normally by now the teams have scrimmaged theyve maybe played an exhibition game and this is literally the first outside competition and both teams are showing a little bit of nerves but radfords certainly not intimidated coming in here to castle and like you mentioned the last time they were in here mike jones team won right well its been a few years since radford was able to do that but he knows that it is a possibility that radford was actually able to beat virginia tech i dont believe it was exactly the last time but it was early on in the buzz williams administration where the highlanders actually did get the win theres carvier jotta leading the way for virginia tech to transfer from kansas state and another steal mugged inside of the paint 10th meeting last time bradford was here cookies were able to beat them but the time before that radford was able to steal a win away from virginia tech giada with his first basket as a hokey yeah and right there you see something different virginia tech didnt have many transition opportunities last year john is capable of creating those on his own here comes a kick out to lipscomb another freshman from washington dc for mike joness team trying to scoop it out of bounds or scoop it over to walker and it goes out of bounds oh cartier john is going to add a lot of speed to virginia tech this year mac yeah its fast hes quick he can really push it and find people in transition or take it all the way the rim this is a guy who who averaged almost 14 points a game and four rebounds at kansas state its going to mean a lot to a mike young team to already have that veteran presence another graduate transfer in the lineup for virginia tech coming off of the bench and also another transfer we see out there right now justin mutt says jonah make that backtoback possessions with the layup from the kansas state Applause transfer youre seeing the different dimensions of virginia tech offense that werent available to mike young and his staff a year ago deshawn porter freshman another one on the floor for radford and a good shot nailed by the guard there josiah jeffers he really looks good a junior out of burlington north carolina hes playing with a lot of confidence already showing that good quickness elevation on the jump shot theres the creativity by jada again well missed three more virginia attack from david and goose on Applause the drive and the paint and foul Applause cassano another new face just a freshman Music penetration nice job attacking the rim by redford weve seen mangum drive in a few times already radford hasnt played scared in these first seven minutes matt no not at all they they are plenty confident of course mike young hes had a lot of big wins we mentioned beating virginia tech here but theyve had big wins all over the country and this program is really proud of being a giant killer that made the ncaa tournament a few years ago lost to number one seed villanova actually in the same building as virginia tech and neither team was able to advance and uh foul called on radford so the hokies get the ball back theres joe bamaseal the freshman Applause Music freshman guard from chesterfield virginia and jonatha running the point again off the screen pulls up it sinks the long two Applause you see hes another lefty just like aline and radford the whole court is tilted over to the left side Applause oakys taking the lead for the first time Applause jeffers pulling up gets the lead right back nice job by jeffers had the mismatch he backed the sawn off with a little bit just created a little space and knocked it down really nice play by jeffers Applause jotta running the point for virginia tech has taken shots when he has ran the ball up the floor out to mutts off the mark in his first shot attempt the delaware transfer thats a really good driver really good rebounder but has worked really hard on his shot too they think he can knock that down consistently its a bit rare for virginia tech to see mutts shoot the three he was two of 18 his last year playing is now the foul jeffers hitting the floor again ramford theyve made a couple perimeter shots now youve got to close out hard and they can shot fake and drive and either get to the rim or get to the free throw line well the hokies have already tallied up four fouls radford with one Music young man out of north carolina southwest edgecombe high school good bounce in to walker and an offensive foul so mutts draws the charge and thatll bring us to a break radfords player western kentucky went to fork union like our guy david jackson on the virginia tech staff and donnie lynn who came from vcu with mike jones an outstanding group look at that last season for radford theyre the perennial top team in the big south last year went 22 and 11 won the big south regular season lost in the big south tournament with the ncaa tournament as we know didnt happen anyway ice cold from beyond the arc yeah both teams two for 12 now combined for both teams to start this game its kind of disrupted the rhythm of the star and this is this looks like almost like a first game of the year right its almost like they havent scrimmaged anybody interestingly enough though one three hit by virginia tech that was by tyreese radford he hit one all of last season he was one of 12 from threepoint land and hes already got one in the first 10 minutes of the first game yeah i dont i dont think its gonna be a reach to say that hell make a whole lot more than one this year hes really worked hard and you know you you got to play him as a driver because hes so dangerous at getting to the rim but that means hes got a little space to jump up and shoot the ball if he can do that like i mentioned hes got a chance to be a three level scorer which is a really dangerous weapon for mike young im going to call mike young and mike jones the different names all day just so just just bear with me battle of the mics today heres jonker Applause shot clock running down to five lipscomb up to alis gotta shoot it and theres a shot clock violation so good defensive stand by the hokies but youre absolutely right mac and i think thats going to be the theme of the first couple of basketball games of this season these teams havent played legit live action against anybody else so this is the first time theyre seeing a team that is not a virginia tech uniform thats not in the radford uniform and theyre trying to work out the kinks and youre seeing it happen right here well not only that you have a lot of new players playing in new roles and everybody is getting used to what the chemistry will look like who can do what in live action radford a bit short followed his own shot though a fresh shot clock for will be sabiti had 63 evidence over six rebounds a game in the acc bd misses from 17 feet comes lipscomb freshman that mike jones was pretty excited to talk about he doesnt look like a freshman does he big strong young man with beady in his face and a great job by wabi sabidi to poke that ball loose official says it was off of the massachusetts native for virginia tech and jeffers is ready to come back in for radford beattys been around so long hes on a first name basis with all these officials he was pleading his case to no avail graduate student from north andover massachusetts recruited by buzz williams one of the holdovers from the last coaching staff now obviously at texas a m and an offensive foul on radford a little illegal screen right there joncom didnt quite get set thats a point of emphasis has been for a couple years now teddy valentine explaining what happened Applause youll see it right here youll see him moving and then youll see him extend to try to get a piece of the defender see him reach out there and shove just a little bit officials did not hesitate on that one so the hokies have it back Applause nahima lean on the floor havent gotten to talk much about a lead another returner for virginia tech watch out for him in the wing and pencil on the floor now the transfer from iowa for the first time as a virginia tech hokey pencil does a lot of things great screener really understands offense petey has to shoot it the hokies cannot hit a shot right now starting out five of 17 from the floor Applause both these coaches are both these guys are kind of old school in the fact that they really spend a lot of time on fundamentals oh using up most of the shot clock both virginia tech and radford see if that stays true here with radford on a slight drive and he kicks it back out a lean down the baseline missed to tie the game nice job by lean to drive it and create a little space couldnt finish it though another area where virginia tech ought to be better with length and more depth some size they ought to be able to do a little better on the offensive glass that was kind of nonexistent a year ago it will be interesting to see what pencil can add as far as the boards as well as justin mutts off the mark again once again both teams are very patient getting these shots up and not all of them are high percentage shots this one might be though if bradford steps inside and drains it thats the three levels the three the mid range like he can do right there and obviously youve seen if youre a virginia tech fan youve seen him get to the rim a lot five points already for tyrese radford mutts is so athletic he can switch off on guards bouncing inside and and one louis juncker the vcu transfer trying his luck in the paint we talked about him early on six nine 245 sets the screen and rolls to the rim pencil got a little flat on the defense and joncom had the angle on him well joncom like we said one of the few returners opened up the broadcast saying radford has a lot of new faces this isnt one of them but he only averaged around three points per game last year yeah thats how good that team was a guy as good as joncom wasnt really able to crack the lineup on a regular basis and joncom finishes off the oldfashioned threepoint play Applause so radford still leads in the season opener highlanders up 16 to 13 yeah the the transfer portal giveth and the transfer portal taketh away and unfortunately carly jones great score has taken his skills to louisville kentucky also worth noting for radford they are missing travis fields who graduated last year was another first team all big south selection so theres two big names in the highlanders lineup that they do not have moving into the 2020 2021 season and were were getting the first look at who might take those places well for cartier giada coming off the bench now right back on Music aluma finds radford shot clock running down again hokies have been patient on offense elaine at the buzzer tipped in the air and a foul booked on you jonker that thats one thing again i i will be surprised if virginia tech isnt much better on the offensive glass than a year ago you see the three and you see iluma go to the rim a lot of times last year all five players were getting back because defensive transition was so important and they had very little chance to get an offensive rebound anyway to be honest heres a luma from downtown theres his first three as a virginia tech hokie hes gonna be a big addition he really understands the mike jones offense that was a set play on the baseline out of bounds and we saw all last year bailey how good virginia tech can be in special situations now trying to move in transition back heres couture and a sophomore misses hokies able to keep it though after radford wasnt able to corral it watch this baseline out of bounds nice design where luma screens and then pops out his man had to help on the screen left him wide open for the tray luma following mike young from wofford had to sit out last year due to ncaa transfer rules now back with his head coach he took advantage of that time to really work on his body and his skills he was a big he was a big part of that team last year even though he wasnt playing because they had to play against him in practice every single day i remember the last time he was playing basketball actually got to go to the ncaa tournament with wofford final season there before mike young took the job here in blacksburg the southwest virginia native Applause Music heres a lee and a jump stop trying to feed it inside and the basket somehow falls bradford six for seven for 17 the hokies are seven for 22 from the field so far just 31 shaq jules theres a d2 transfer for radford john with an underhand and aluma with a tomahawk jam shot is so good you know he can make a play even though you dont run a play well jada a guy that had 13 points per game last year for kansas state four dimes a game already facilitating here for virginia tech with a rebound lying down the court tyrese radford Applause gotta throws it back in but its intercepted they won mangum back into the game for radford and running the floor jonathan not a big guy but averaged four rebounds a game at kansas state got the defensive rebound and a hand on the offensive rebound as you see a great baseline drive right there nifty layup for mangum to give radford the lead back hes had a couple reverse layups like no one was there really nice play for the long athletic sophomore playing in his first game after transferring from charlotte shot a steps inside of luma oh hes not afraid to take the three 2120 illuma starting to heat up for virginia tech Applause Music Applause interestingly enough about him mike jones had never even seen him in person and just saw him on film and then because of coven 19 he transferred to radford without ever getting to practice in front of mike jones and now today hes got two baskets sight unseen theres a sight to behold there jotta with a great job on that layup and a timeout called by mike young so now the hokies lead by one going to break here up against a new river foe 20 figures yeah youre seeing him on the defensive end battle down low youre seeing him start out down low on offense there you see a little screen and roll going to the basket got some athleticism and he can step out and shoot the three two for four already and hes just a really cerebral undersized post the six nine red shirt junior following mike young from wofford and leading the hokies in scoring right now leading everyone in scoring only player on the floor in double figures radford though has kept this game pretty tight they have not shot the ball lights out either i mean just nine of 20 hokies are 10 of 26 also radford whos gotten to the line for five free throws hokies have yet to take a trip to the charity strike Applause theres jeffers on a lean bounce inside and a steal from jotta wide open bama seal themselves come in with a lot of confidence very mature freshman wasnt bashful either was he no not at all i mean nobody really has looked scared to shoot at all no ones been reluctant they just havent fallen that one that did though mango hes had a couple athletic looking layups and now he steps out and shoots the three Applause effort bench wanted to walk there steps inside Applause swinging out mangum little heat little heat check right there and the freshman able to pick away the defensive board vanissio what a great rebound by illuma but couldnt keep it alive bradford with the numbers see if they take advantage of it after jeffers wide open swirls out oakys provided a little better communication than that in transition got away with one with jeffers missing the wide open tray man what a step athletic play made by the freshman count it with a foul bailey you love that play hes missed a couple jump shots realize that shot fake drive it and plays through the contact all the way the rim i talked about how strong he is and how mature he is for just a freshman thats outstanding that averaged 28 points per game at monica high school in chesterfield virginia not too far outside of richmond virginia first team allstate selection in the vhsl Music big recruit for mike young in the commonwealth of virginia and the and one completed by vanishing to give the hokies a lead theres couture theres another name to watch out for this year the sophomore from orlando florida right at the end of the year we saw hunter couture heat up and become a player that a lot of virginia tech fans that are very excited about it was averaging nearly double figures down the stretch out of orlando florida bishop moore high school and outstanding basketball school Applause for couture had 14 points in the final game of the season as justin mutts packed that shot but theres a foul anyway mutts can really get up got beat here off the dribble by guard but recovered in time to block the shot got a little body the officials are in early season for him too Laughter they got a little bit of body but after that was chucked up he got all ball oh see a trip to the line from ali mutz is going to contribute on the offensive glass hes going to contribute scoring to basketball he can really drive it worked on his perimeter shooting quite a bit hes going to make hes been a little dinged up a little hamstring here and hadnt been at full strength in practice Applause and talk about a journey for a college player with justin mutts this is now his third college hes played at started out at high point then went to delaware where he averaged 12 points per game and 84 rebounds per game now its inside to mutts theres some points for the new pokey beautiful high low duck in on the back side you saw him get it to aluma early and he didnt finish it but that time mutts did finish it through a little contact on the block virginia tech in transition radford with a bit of contact there and no foul call it itll stay with the hokies anyway that was one of the things radford did really well a year ago get to the rim through the contact and got to the freethrow line a lot we see him attack the rim right there good defense by mango magnum is really playing well on both ends of the floor mangum starting out three of six imagine its got to be tough for some of these transfers who had to sit out a year and then they werent able to scrimmage anybody either that looked easy for nahima lean though finally gets one to go through the hoop for him had some big offensive games last year really nice stroke for the left hander out of georgia Applause keyshawn porter Applause ali tries outside and jeffers fumbles the pass does a good job by couture staying home usually you help on that baseline drive and they kick it to the other corner couture stayed at home and forced the turnover obesity back into the game as the point guard for the hokies Applause aline pulls up switch how about that how about that as a call play from the sideline but mike young aleene made one lets go back to him on the dribble handoff really good execution welling was trying in the 15footers earlier in the game now going back from downtown able to hit his first three of the year ali stepping out back in lost the ball great defense by the hokies Applause here comes a lead starting to heat up and hes fouled and hell go to the lot good job a little shot fake youve made two in a row now theyve got to close out on you and he was able to go by walker couldnt quite get there in a legal guarding position in time just south of double figures in his first year at virginia tech eight points eight points per game nearly 40 percent from three about eighty percent from the freethrow line really has a nice stroke would it i think mike young in an ideal situation would have loved to have redshirted him but elene just played so well and they were a little shorthanded and he ended up having an outstanding freshman year and a lead hits both at the freethrow line largest lead of the game now for virginia tech Applause you get eight points after struggling with radford early on important couple possessions coming up here in these last in this last minute for radford and see what mangum can do hes been a hot hand for the highlanders so far hes got a lean hes got an undersized defender on him a foul hooked on jono and thats the seventh foul his second so its gonna be a one in one Applause Music so lee goes back to the line so far today three of four and hits the front end of a oneandone in our zoom call the other day uh coach jones was talking about how much he liked ali and thought he could play right away and clearly he had that information ahead of time timeout virginia tech to figure themselves out as a team as well as radford yeah both these coaches are learning more today than theyve learned the entire fall i assure you Applause bradford having trouble getting the ball in bounds and its stolen away bradford a little press after the timeout they tend to do that theyve done it a couple times after free throws not a lot just to see if youll mess up and virginia tech accommodated them right there good job by radford on the defensive end shot clocks still on about a seven second differential jules inside cant hit the shot aluma had good position and now a foul he called on kyrie walker it should be the bonus and it will be so aluma goes to the line for a oneandone reference had an advantage getting into the freethrow line nine times so far to virginia texas five three i believe Applause luma at the line has been the face of the standout so far here in the first half for virginia tech Applause Music yeah he and john a couple newcomers have really been the the impetus for this virginia tech uh late first half surge if you will and i think that if you just kept up with virginia tech basketball news throughout the off season you just knew that that was going to immediately happen where theyre going to be thrown into the lineup and theyre going to be kind of trusted to make some big decisions on the floor and aluma has done that both free throws go for the transfer heres another transfer and pencil Applause so aluma likely to finish the first half with 12 points and the shot clock off now and gets fouled with one second left here in the first half hang of its been really impressive hes done the acrobatic layups he shot the three that time they reversed the ball into a oneonone situation where he shot faked and drove a really good defender in radford got all the way to the rim and drew the foul really nice play by the redshirt sophomore out of roxboro Applause just across the state line in north carolina this has got to be a cradle for basketball talent Applause pretty big deal basketball down in that state you dont say ive heard mangum able to hit both makes it a sixpoint game and thats where we will end things here in the first half both teams trying to figure out where they are and who they are here in game one 3731 pokies up top by six mangum has two playing up against radford for the first time in his career heres a guy thats from southwest virginia from radford and has never actually played or coached against radford university thats pretty unusual he hadnt stumbled into him at some point in time almost underway trayvon mangum mangum really we talked about him during the half liter looked impressive josiah jeffers really looked impressive ali the freshman point guard looked impressive now what are the highlanders going to need to do to make this game closer even pull it off in the end well theyve got to continue to execute in the in the half court and and mike jones is very good they run a little motion offense a lot of ball screens but theyve just got to finish plays virginia tech very active defensively a small team radfords got to continue to get to the freethrow line too theyve taken some long possessions jeffers with a step back thats a tough shot in a rebound crowd by aluma really good defensive possession that time by virginia tech on the defensive end Music hes playing inside of castle coliseum with just 250 people allowed in heres a lean got the roll scored on that play in the first half hit the elbow and instead of ducking in a little dribble handoff with the screen and a lean wide open and knocked it down with the friendly roll yeah very friendly indeed soon to be on the iron for about five minutes great job by ali he made a tough shot had a little bit a little bit to say about that shot afterwards hes playing in his first ever college game getting a little bit of confidence here i think hes got plenty of confidence good player Applause thats a radford tyrese radford thats a long two counts for the hokies thats something he didnt do a year ago though bailey thats an improvement thats that allseason work that you put in as a player and as a coaching staff theres a guy that excited a lot of people in blacksburg because of his athleticism radford particularly on one great play against wake forest last year on a reverse dunk you know he was a good player a year ago theres no question he rebounded the basketball he drove it he had some big shots and big moments but the biggest thing that impressed me about tyrese raptor is he is such a competitor when the game is on the line he wants to be involved whether its defensively or rebounding the ball or scoring the ball at the rim he is a great competitor a game on the line against north carolina hit a buzzer beating north carolina manga missed the three and the rebound for aluma theres beady from the freethrow line Applause and when he shoots the ball kind of in rhythm like that it seems his percentage is much higher when he kind of hesitates it doesnt seem like the ball goes in as often for wabisabidi itll be interesting to see the progression for obesity this year yeah he wanted that ball felt like he had a good match up right there and the hokies are very small out there other than aluma nobodys bigger than 63 on the floor and i think thats something if youve watched virginia tech basketball for the past few years youve noted that the hokies never have someone thats humongous down low Applause i think theyll be able to play you know a couple big guys together months and a loom and of course ogiaco is uh you know not available right now but uh theyve got theyve got some size you know youll see youll see pencil in there and youll see the sun in there hard for those guys to get a lot of time today against a small radford team thats very athletic elaine lost the ball picked it back up and possession arrow keeps the ball with virginia tech only 11 on the shot clock mike younger shot up draw something up here or call something up here both teams have been very patient i think thats another takeaway we had from the first half where a good majority of these offensive possessions have been drained down within 10 seconds of the shot clock part of thats been good defense too comes a lead drives through heres an athletic dribble now he goes to the line for a couple thats the play they scored on earlier this time they got a lean coming off the screen the last time they took the screener aluma and popped him out and got that three same play they scored on in the first half see the curl cut right there and going to the hole the rest of that play could have been illuma popping back out for the three Applause cookies looking for their ninth win all time against radford Music oh their largest lead of the game first time its turned into a doubledigit deficit Applause couture goes to the bench bama seal in yeah there havent been any real spurts in the game its just been kind of grinding it out a couple at a time absolutely especially early in that first half where it seemed like radford was playing so well defensively beanie playing well defensively got the steal good hustle right there on both ends on both sides of the ball flips going never gave up on the play didnt let beedy get the ball up on the glass but virginia techs got the ball now under their basket Applause amir ali back into the game mike jones putting a lot of trust in his freshman guard theres a crow cutting the screen down good job by radford really good job nahim a lean but for the offensive foul sends the ball right back to radford we talked about mangum on the offense being watch this he chases off the screen gets there in time to contest the shot then moves his feet and draws the charge on a lean outstanding play by magnum only seen with the virginia attack offense the target for most of these shots in the first three and a half minutes have been nahima lean i think trying to get him going of course he finished strong at the end of the first half too lucille poked the ball loose and was off of the freshman from chesterfield coming in and drawing a tough assignment right away with mangum about four or five differences inches difference in height right there Applause theres a leak Applause Applause someone has to shoot ali gets it off and tickles the twine outstanding look of focus on the face of a lead hes got 10 he was totally calm as that shot clock was running down panacea lost the ball stripped loose it comes jeffers its swatted out of bounds Applause aluma got all ball on that one but its an eight point game familiar ali hitting a threepointer at the bus cc hokies finished to pick 11th in the acc match the usual suspects at the top virginia gets the nod based really on sam hauser the transfer from marquette being on this roster yeah do you think those teams in the top four you know you look at duke carolina virginia you think they ever get tired of being good oh yeah you got the louisville in that group those right those those are blue bloods in college basketball yeah carly jones the transfer from radford big south player of the year now playing for louisville mangum missed the lamp vanishing ranging the floor after that rebound nice rebound right there in a crowd giadas wide open Applause vermeer ali lost the ball out of the timeout lots of fumbling around here that thats not gonna be on any highlights right there the the down backing down right there you could erase that part of the tape yeah quick quick play of the benny hill soundtrack benny hill music the effort was good execution not so much oh mangum i actually had to sanitize the ball Applause as it was touched by someone out of play ted valentine theres a thing were going to have to be aware of this year as crazy as that ball was bouncing around maybe an exorcism would have been better kyrie walker backing up about a tumble down the stairs here in a second like the guy at the end of that movie heres walker five of the shot clock ali hit back cant go for juncam Applause yet again radford will get a fresh chance at this with 20 seconds on the shot clock a lot of competition a lot of competition right there see if everybody puts a body on somebody Applause continue chasing it a lot of battling you really have to be impressed with ali and how well he has played in his first game as a collegiate player hasnt played against anyone else other than radford in practice on the toughest position on the floor Applause manga trying to back in on famous seal louis joncom once again blocked by aluma thats a good battle down down low with two big bodies down there here they are luma luma cuts him off and then still gets a piece of the ball really good defensive play thats what hes talking about he can guard another center but on the offense he can really step out and do some different things meanwhile bini comes back in bounce in walker missed the layup another offensive rebound theres a foul mutts and aluma in there together this will be a different look for virginia tech on both ends of the floor much was jumping and trying to contest shots all over bradford stayed after good job by walker kyrie walker at an upper ball borough of maryland kyrie walker and this entire radford team this has been such a long possession for the highlanders im fighting on the offensive glass thats been a characteristic of virginia attack in the past couple of years trying to win the rebound game and unfortunately for the hokies its been rare that theyve been able to do that this will be a little bit different team obviously theyre still searching for the right lineup but theyll be small again a lot of the time but i think theyll be able to match and uh a little first little defensive change a little zone show a little one one three itll rotate into a 23 zone why are they doing that mac just to change things up a little bit keep virginia tech from getting comfortable well elaine looked pretty comfortable on that jump stop pop porter misses the shot from long range tipped out of bounds well see another baseline out of bounds play for radford margin seems like the entire game 23 to 18 right now still lead by eight led by as much as 11 Applause shot clock running down ali bounce inside mangum gets the bucket to go with the shot clock running down he posted bama still up for like 15 seconds and buried him under the basket it was an unbelievable postup and mike jones the head coach for radford was throwing around fist pumps everywhere after that illuma able to duck inside and get the basket to fall you get the ball of the high post against his own its usually good news for the offense good high low right there for virginia tech attacking radfords 23 zone Applause ali scoops and misses that is speed for the hokies now maam a seal lost the ball picked it back up Applause well it goes out about staying with the hokies oh radford using all of the shot clock using the glass look at mangum posting up hes posted his man all the way off the floor maintained that position with great footwork and they finally found him that was about 10 seconds into the postup where we finally saw it happen on the field Applause great play mangum by the way with 11 points now aluma swirls at home 17 points in his debut in a maroon in orange uniform last trip down a duck in and a layup this time down the three thats that diversity of offense that we were talking about virginia tech has this year that they didnt have a year ago rebound vandaseal is showing some spring in there hes been battling on the backboard that freshman thats getting a lot of time Music therefore got out of that zone didnt have a lot of success in it mutts trying to call for the ball down low jotto tried to force it ally coming up and that went in he missed the dump and the ball popped through the net anyway for the freshman they tried to telegraph that and i guess it counts the same man aluma skies to the rim and a charge Applause bradford down by nine but still a good amount of energy for the highlanders aluma with 17 points hokies keyshot these look pretty solid for mikey on squad yeah loom of the redshirt junior transfer from wofford out of berlin maryland we talked to you about how just a cerebral player he is on both ends of the floor but hes got that big body put on you on offense and defense and hes got the skill to step out and hes really a good defender you havent seen it today but he can guard almost anybody on the floor a couple of blocks for aluma pretty convincing ones as well Applause 30 of 53 points scored in this game are played by players making their debut so mostly thats illumi you also have jada mutts is on the floor as well utah couture has yet to score in this game Applause radford it was wide open but shrugged that three off yeah they played off of him and played him by scouting report and he didnt take it picked away xavier lipscombe lets get another goodlooking freshman out of dc Applause freshmen dont look like freshman anymore bailey they come in physically and mentally mature ready to go a little bit different from when you were here as a ga oh my god Music weight room was just a rumor back in the day and knowing about nutrition was too to be honest heres lipscomb branford hanging in there down by nine make it six xavier lipscomb not a good job on the ball screen that time mutts didnt help and they got a wide open look for the freshman that we just mentioned out of washington dc saint stephens saint agnes another good basketball school a lean from the top Applause clapton rebound by jules good execution that time couldnt knock it down radford making this a two possession game after that three lead went away in a hurry bailey and the lead wasnt even that big to begin with i mean just 11 points to tyrese radford track meet down the floor and finishes no counting actually its a goaltend with the foul actually making no foul just a goaltend so the bucket counts for tyrese radford wally the freshman makes the turnover on the other end and ramford does what he normally does attacks the rim goaltend basket hockey a little bit of contact there radford makes the basket go anyway youre not questioning the officials im not saying anything im up here for a reason theyre down there Music Applause a lead snag by mutts line up the floor jadas wide open thats a good look wide open and great job in transition by the hokies xavier lipscomb heating up for the highlanders really impressed by this whole freshman class of mike jones and we talked about his outstanding staff theyve been doing their work couture getting work done in the far corner speaking of work hunter couture he probably takes about as many shots as anybody he and cone both and it shows thats his first bucket of his sophomore season last year shot around 40 percent from beyond the arc for virginia tech good switch on the ball screen that time see how they handle this one radford fought over a really good job shot clock running down switched that ball screen could tour with the mismatch down low elia oh good defense about beady thats a great job all around defensively by virginia tech lipscomb hes trying to sell the fact that he poked that ball out of bounds off of a virginia tech player and it will got another timeout on the floor 58 49 hokies in a tight one angle Music look at some games around the conference north carolina ready to take on college of charleston basketball season underway well we didnt know what it was going to look like but we could assume at least for the first game that there was going to be some rust and virginia tech has had a little bit of it today with the highlanders keeping this within double digits 23 zone out of the timeout mixing things up mike jones against mike young see if i say him both you dont know whether i messed it up or not shot clock at the buzzer couture pro length triple for the sophomore from florida a not so good uh possession bailed out by a great shot hokies needed that bucket to go the hokies are now nine for 12 in the second half bayley ander fowle keyshawn porter so porter with the and one makes it a 10point game we got another break but hunter couture mac what a three a little deep no problem two out of three today okay tour in those first 23 games took them a while to kind of settle in to college basketball and then those last eight games started to turn a lot of heads he had signed with wofford was headed there with coach young and when coach young got the virginia tech job he called him up and said what do you think about blacksburg and uh hokie fans are glad that hunter couture made that decision i imagine its pretty enticing to get the call to move up to the acc hokies now 912 going to play against the zone 9 for 12 in the second half bayley they have radford has missed more shot than virginia tech has taken hunter couture still on fire third three of the second half make that three shots in a row drained by the sophomore nice to come off the feature and have the guy make the shot great job in the truck Applause got away with that one had a wide open look at it Applause speedy off the screen step back sinks 11 out of 14 in the second half for virginia tech they are on fire still making the choices to take some of those long shots including long twos will be sabiti now with four points largest lead of the game for tekken 14 inside the junk good defense by virginia tech shot clock running down again lipscomb lost the ball and that hokeys defense has been pretty tight in the second half two physical guys going at it right there bd on defense weve seen that for several years in a hokey uniform lipscomb the freshman its a good battle bd came out on top that time ramford goes back to the zone or changes it up and goes man to man this time well see looks like theyre staying in the 23 zone they show it as a 113 to try to get you to run a different offense then they switch and now theyve changed it all together and theyve gone mantoman as mike young raises the fist to signal lets go fiveonfive now in mantoman radford theyre meeting with a 23 back in the mantoman to testimobile Applause the ball out couture four in a row for hunter couture it didnt take justin butts long it didnt take him long to learn to find the tour if hes hot right theres another crisp shot on the outside for miles mike jones son miles jones sophomore from you guessed it radford Applause and a whistle that gives the ball back to radford oh hunter couture we talked about it scoreless in the first half wide open here able to drain it home in rhythm and then the coachs son you gotta think that coachs sons got the green light right came into the game able to get the three ball hes staying in right now Applause ali theyve been going at it all day raptor fans can be pretty excited about the league theres the charge right outside of the circle justin mutts baiting jules there to get the ball back for virginia tech and mutts is a good defender weve got good link can block his shot and you see hes willing to give his body up right here gets good position outside the lane even took it dead to chest if you get hit in the sternum its going to be a charge every time itll be interesting to see what we can get out of what we can see out of justin mutts this year two points in this game heres couture oh just a bit of a heat check there rattled in and out the bench was ready to erupt over there at the spread out bench but everybody was up on their feet anyway Music jules takes a tough shot he stays with it Applause speedy cant get the long two to fall in the rebound snatched by porter right back to virginia tech another one of those freshmen weve been talking about that time a little bit out of control lost the ball the hokies a bit of a larger lead now at 14 points but if youre virginia tech you have some bright spots so far in this game obviously couture heating up from beyond the arc youve also seen some athleticism out of cartier jada but for radford you got to be kind of proud with how much youve been able to hang in this game and with 440 lots of things can happen for this talented team that nobody really knew much about aluma though thats his third top of the game no we talked about you know how mike young didnt know a lot about the pieces missing but he knew a lot about the pieces that mike jones on the other hand these were all new people in new roles and uh like i said hes learned a lot about what kind of basketball team hes gonna have and i think mostly hes learned positive things so far today this is a radford program that like we said earlier on sits at the top of the big salary made the tournament in 2018 and just not knowing what theyre bringing to this game today i mean they have to be a little impressive how well theyve performed but you know you put a little bit of a trust in your talented coach and mike jones said this team can be back at the top in the big south right now picked to finish sixth in the conference this year yeah and we talked about that you know given all they lost that seemed high looking at him that might be low especially if mangum can be a talented player this year for the highlanders he has 12 hes a really good player kind of a stretch forward but can play some three also very athletic long a rebound for jacob Applause jeffers Applause we saw him a lot early and now here he is back late junior out of burlington okies need a few more buckets to put this one on ice goose on beady trying from downtown well the yes have shot so much better in the second half over a 50 percent clip from the field and nearing that from threepoint land 12 out of 15 Applause four of those shots made by hunter couture theres beaty with a steal Music switching hands on the triple mutts is wide open doosan with a hard foot offensive rebound Applause beady skies to the hoop and gets the bucket to fall Music look hes starting to pull away in the final moments of the second half Applause hes getting a little look at some of the newcomers butts and gassan and uh but hes got veterans out there with him that thatll help the learning process for mike youngs bunch definitely a lot to learn for virginia tech kevin aluma learning today mack hes been tough yeah defensive mistake right there and he makes them pay with arena thats just beautiful and then a couple home games wrapped around a trip down to my neck of the woods at east carolina university well for radford not traveling that much at all and lancaster bible coming to the new river valley mike jones and his team going to be tested in the first couple of games now for the hokies and the mohegan sun tournament coming up against temple and usf gonna be back here on december third against the key dance and penn state in the big ten acc challenge or acc big ten challenge i guess is how wed refer to it and open against clemson you remember that was a big win for mike young in his acc debut last year and that was a game where the hokies leading score from last season landers nollie went off against clemson and now playing for memphis one of the couple of transfers that are not in the lineup obviously today for virginia tech mike young trying to reload this team with outlanders nollie without pj horn and without isaiah wilkins who transferred to wake forest Applause Applause louis jonker misses both from the strike Applause these are valuable minutes playing against a someone other than yourself game is just about out of reach but these are key minutes for these coaches to find out even more about their basketball team Applause kusan misses this guys got good skills really guard kind of skills put the ball on the floor can pass it shoot to basketball meanwhile for justin mutts he has four fouls in his opening game at virginia tech trying to draw another charge there and gotten to the wrong place at the wrong time seemingly he would like to to discuss that with ted valentine but if hes watched any college basketball he knows that wont work out so well mr valentine will win that argument no its not necessarily an open forum darius maddox the freshman from bowie maryland into the game also went to oak hill academy another really good talented freshman mike young has overhauled this roster in a big way in a short period of time thats something you can kind of expect i mean this is a second year head coach not a lot of holdovers from buzz williams obisobiti being the most notable and for that matter tyrese radford third try make it the fourth try cant get it thatll kill your shooting percentage over four on a trip but it was pretty darn athletic to be able to get the ball back every time right right what is up on the baseline jumper and a few new players checking in for radford a timeout called by mike jones and so virginia tech pulling away here at the end against radford mack what did you really see out of virginia tech in those opening couple of minutes well kevin aluma was you know short of the story of the game and of course last year you knew what nahim aline was capable of but i think mike young and hokie fans got glimpses of a lot of different weapons for virginia tech nothing really consistent but their defense improved as the game went on and their execution offensively you saw them be spectacular again from a shooting percentagewise in the second half 15 out of 21 at this point almost 60 percent yeah it took the hokies a while to heat up there and then in the second half now hunter couture hitting four threes in a row but youre seeing some new athletes as well joe bamacille being one of them and just went over four on one possession but youre absolutely right when he did miss i mean it did take a lot of athleticism to create those shots and get those rebounds hes very comfortable out there she plays with a lot of confidence and has made some good plays in this game and you have to expect that its going to take a while before everyone gets completely comfortable not only with themselves as college basketball players but with each other saw a glimpse of what jada is capable of and hes going to play a bigger and bigger role for this team as everybody gets used to playing with each other Applause and a foul pencil trying to get his first points as a virginia tech hokie Applause mike young when he asked about pencil a few days ago he noted that pencil is a very smart great passer that adds a few aspects of this virginia tech roster yeah and you know hes played at the the very highest level playing in the big ten for iowa Applause playing for coach mccaffrey and uh really understands the game and a big body guy who can give you some quality minutes down low but but have some skill to him also got that one to fall the last time he played here in a game that counted was with the iowa hawkeyes and that was maybe his best game in an iowa uniform had 14 points for the hawkeyes or excuse me 14 rebounds and six points one minute to play hes hoping to duplicate that a few times this year Applause ali misses and the whistle keeps the play under the basket not sure who found who but it was a lot of collision right well somebody hit the floor bodies went flying get a great look at it here good job of contesting this shot then on the back side its a little i guess they just got a little tangled up so now for jules shooting two mac its the first time weve really called a game together and theres not a lot of people in the building whatd you think you know i once the game gets started im so focused on the game that i that i dont notice that im sure the the atmosphere and crowd as you know it can be great in castle uh but uh you know once the game started you know i didnt really feel that it was a lot different right and im sure for the players i probably noticed that theres not a student section either supporting them or trying to get them to miss a free throw but just playing basketball and you got to imagine that a lot of these players matter of fact most of them most of the basketball they have ever played hasnt been played in front of a gigantic crowd yeah thats a good point Applause easier to communicate with each other easier to communicate with the coaches but im sure the emotion is not quite the same as when the band is playing and the cheerleaders are cheering and the crowd is on their feet now right now just 250 people allowed in the building seen some fans scattered throughout obviously mess on as part of a requirement as the cases continue to ramp up in our country Applause its going to be a challenge going forward lets hope we can get this season in safely and then we see a lot of good basketball Applause heres porter Applause backs up gets a shot off at the buzzer and virginia tech takes the first game of the year and wins it in front of 250 fans 77 to 62 it was slow going in the beginning mac and radford hung around the hokies with some great shooting in the second half they were able to pull away yeah early it looked like both teams were uh playing their first outside competition which they were and they settled down the effort was really good defense was outstanding at times and virginia tech finally got a a little bit of a rhythm in the second half led by luma and couture oh keve aluma with a great start to his virginia tech career mike young and mike jones talking for the first time them ever interacting in a basketball game
