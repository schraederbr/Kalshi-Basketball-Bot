that year five is the best so far for am Bon and so he will jump Center against the aforementioned Malik Brown the sophomore from C pepper Virginia and its the Tarheels with a basketball first and their freshman point guard Elliot cadu here is RJ Davis ninth in the country at over 21 points per game inside they go trying to establish Bott over the left shoulder no Ingrams been fantastic on the glass of especially an ACC play got a piece of that and Carolina will keep it heres the problem for Syracuse in this game they got beat 533 on the boards in the first matchup theyve got to hold their own when the balls on the glass at both ends and at this end of the floor con Syracuse defend North Carolina three of Syracuses last four opponents have shot 60 or better from the floor and a great start cormack Ryan has the first three against Su yeah Ryan makes him pay for going two three out of bounds under corack Ryan if he gets a 34 35 threepoint shooter in March this is a final 14 well that shot puts him just over 30 on the year best shooter for Syracuse Chris Bell has his first three Chris Bell a 40 threepoint shooter told me before the game he doesnt look at a specific spot hes not a front rim back rim guy just Rises and sees really good Fielder as a jump shooter and theres the problem for Syracuse this big dude on the inside a oneman crew getting his own miss the 23yearold grad student from Richmond looking to get his 80th career double double here tonight he gives Carolina a 53 lead think North Carolina has really grown since I saw him in Atlanta its on the defensive end of the floor they got some chops about him and Hubert Davis challenged him two or three games ago to keep that chops up just the fifth made three of the season for Malik Brown and the orange Take the Lead Kau left his feet its a Syracuse steel this is something coach Davis said Carolinas got to stay away from against Syracuse specifically J to Min and theres Brown to clean it up 85 fuse well Syracuse is the best in the ACC at getting Steels and cron turnovers North Carolinas got to be tight with that ball and just sloppy careless haveit passes so far by North Carolina a couple of possessions and Judah men can go get one off anytime he wants and the effort the energy of Syracuse jumping off the quarterly heres RJ Davis and hes off to the offensive foul caused by Judah mins defense its not easy to stay in front of RJ Davis he is a legit driver hes got the step back move but a good job by men who when hes dialed in talking about three in white one of the better defenders in this league mince uses the screen by Brown his pass deflects off the head of RJ Davidson out of bound you dont see that every day you do not does he get a deflection for that most likely on film yes well keep your head in between the the ball and your guy right and thats what RJ Davis does try to reverse that ball right off the backside of four in Carolina blue Justin Taylor along to JJ Starling the sore from nearby Baldwinsville New York uses the screen works his way into the lane dumps it off Brown kicks to the left side shot clock down to three Starling puts it up theres that Carolina defense we expect to see a lot of tonight Jimmy good job by Starling though to get behind the ball and run into that jump shot the kid averaging about 19 points a game over the last eight Harrison Ingram going to work into the lane draws the crowd back out front for M Ryan terrific job knifing to the bucket and drawing the foul on Bell I love the overall game of corm Ryan and hes way more than just a jump shooter he is physical hes tough he drives it he fights his guts out on the defensive end get in there and scrap for three or four rebounds a game and he is a real key of North Carolina is going to make a legit run of that final four big time stroke from the perimeter has to find his group now cormack Ryan is one of three native New Yorkers in the starting lineup for Carolina he grew up in SoHo and attended the Collegiate School on Manhattans Upper East Side family moved to Chestnut Hill Mass Cormac played his last three years of VAR City ball in Massachusetts at Milton Academy but he has been a huge addition now 25 years old playing his final season we think of college basketball you know the the top 20 transfers in college ball this year are averaging about 15 points a game overall the top 20 freshman in college ball are only averaging eight thats the value of older guys transfer in could handle the pass it goes out of bounds they say Ingram was the last to touch so Syracuse will keep it underneath with 11 to shoot Bell off the bounce usually see him spotting up around the threepoint line yeah no doubt has r good job of chasing him off that threepoint line but man when youre 67 you can rise up and make guarded twos really well done by B Bon defended well brings it back out to cadell the Freshman puts it up off the glass no Bon ticks to himself but it comes to Applause mince Brown again and why not huh hes got a couple tonight yeah not a threepoint volume shooter but Malik Brown seen a really good Rim Early just 25 in conference play coming in sticks a trail three but that is part of his progression one of this huge sophomore class for Syracuse Ryan going to work on Bell Good Help by Taylor Ryan just forcing his way into the lane missed the shot keeps Carolina just one shot attempt I like the fight that Ive seen out of Syracuse early in this game Taylors fouled and well head to the free throw line when we come back Syracuse showing some fight against the number leas on the ball is much better than what a 25 shooter you would think has if theres this Trail three I said in the open if you got punked by 36 points a month ago you come out tonight if youre Syracuse and you fight with everything you have and I think one in white probably sets the tone as well as anybody that Adrien ay has and as you mentioned Carolina in that game a month ago down in Chapel Hill outrebounded Syracuse 5330 so far early its even 33 in this game tonight thats a big part of it its got to be gang rebounding by Syracuse the entire night they are a small Club all five guys got to be involved on that GL at the line is Justin Taylor the sophomore from Charlottesville Virginia averaging 5 points4 rebounds a game now only 10 of 15 on the season from the free throw line gets the second Syracuse 14 Carolina 7 as we mentioned off the top going on the road anywhere in this country at any level there are no guarantees no theres not and AD not goes to his two3 Zone after timeout and probably take away the scoring play that Hubert Davis possibly anticipated against man Syracuse only 133 of the time this year dug in that two3 zone its gone up a little bit the last couple of weeks Brown goes back toward to Bell who Music gathers good defense by Ryan the shot off the side of the backboard Tracked Down of course by BAC Seth Trimble back in the Carolina lineup after missing a couple of games RJ Davis still looking for his first points of the night Ingram missfires from three bell with a rebound a good job though by five Jersey in that paint when the balls on the Music glass mince running count the basket and one Doug you got to square him up you have got to square this kid up hes good with his ride hes very good with his left and he kind of Ls you to sleep with that lazy dribble up top and hes so good at shooting shots off the wrong foot sometimes the wrong hand it leads the ACC at eight free throw attempts per game dont foul his tough looks Chris Bell takes a seat adri and ay talking to him not sure if theres a reason why Chris came out they had multiple conversations during a long practice yesterday that both of us were at Jimmy what do you make of Chris Bell he can go for 31 game he can score 25 to Rally against Colgate for a win but then there are stretches where he just disappeared yeah when you say long you mean three hours cuz it it went all of three if not more this is entire sophomore team Syracuse no points on the year from their freshman class or seniors a young team in a rugged ACC this year offensive foul on quader Copeland and there is Bell the sophomore from Concord California his head coach Adrian ay and thats an amazing stat right there that the sophomore Clash just a heavy load and Adrian to me is desperate to find a fiveman a legit fiveman next year to blend in with these guys itll be Juniors a year from now got a high school AllAmerican coming in its all about bringing in dudes at this level the starting center to begin the year for Syracuse nahem McLoud was your classic rim protector but he is out with a season ending injury so theyre without the 74 surfaces of McLoud Benny Williams was dismissed he had size and athletic ability at 69 carry is out with the concussion protocol so there is another big not available for Syracuse Starling comfortable in the midrange heres the problem for North Carolina Syracuse has two guys that can go get their own Starling and MIT are both tall physical guard 63 64 just bouncing North Carolina Defenders out of the way ear and again with the roster issues Syracuse has you like Jimmy this zone defense I I I do and I think Adrian is going to start playing more and more this season aggresses a manto man defense has just not had that sustained fight that you have to have Bader Copeland tough shot able to make it go a circus shot and the oranges made five of their last six from the floor but another offensive possession by Syracuse playing through the contact yards after contact in football and yards after contact in basketball very important well Copeland is the most creative with the ball on this team Ryan misses from the Applause corner and Syracuse continues Jimmy to hold on in the rebounds 7 to four orange over the tar that is a monster monster number in this Music game Brown after making a couple of Threes puts it on the deck setting up men who Miss fires Ryans pass deflected goes into Bott he just turns and scores well Armando Bott if he catches it that deep hes going to get 30 in this game youve got to fight him in that meet and greet as hes running down the floor if your first contact with Bott is at the restricted Arc hes going to score coming off coming off m go Starling attacks over Davis for two more just sizing him up a little bit of a Reload dribble by Starling and gets downhill he continues to be more aggressive as his first season in Orange moves on Jaylen Withers the Louisville Transfer brings it back out to RJ Davis who is still scoreless for Carolina bacock again inside and hes fouled on the shot Doug has been a guard oriented attack for Syracuse in this game I know that our guy Brown made a couple early but the physical guard play of Syracuse two in white Starling takes the bump and rises in fire copel comes right back right through his smaller Defender really good start for the ore game where Syracuse just was noncompetitive on the road this is the first year for Adrien ay after taking over for Jim beheim and I got the sense out of that that hes finding his voice abs absolutely I mean this is a guy coaching out is Alma Mater and he you know he won a big East title when he was here at Syracuse took him to three straight NCAA tournaments theres extra pressure but theres also extra Pride when youre coaching at your alma mater and this guy knows the expectations and the standard that Syracuse is trying to get back to its not just Syracuse in the ACC but you look at those teams right now Doug Syracuse Louisville Notre Dame I throw NC State Georgia techken there theyve got to rise back up and get the ACC back to being one of the top conf confer in college ball theyve dropped off a little bit and Syracuse and Adrien atrey keep an eye on them because he knows exactly what this program supposed to be well Syracuse right now 15 n overall 6 and seven in League Play and again he replaced Jim beahan beheim who retired after 47 years as head coach at his Alma moer and ay continues to rebuild the roster in the program in His image in his last game as a player at Syracuse sweet 16 loss to missou he scored 31 points in the second half after going scoreless in the first half what an amazing one half performance in that NCAA tournament and thats a guy who is fifth all time in Syracuse history in career ass six able to put 30 plus up in a Applause half cormack Ryan wide open able to hit the three its 2318 orang if Syracuse is going to try to trap the ball into the timeline youve got to make them pay like Ryan did he runs to that deep Corner keeping on the number of times Carolina scores in the first six 7 Seconds of the shot clock Brown brings it back outside Starling from the foul line round and out pull down by Bott and I can hear botts voice though hes forcing weak weak weak youre by yourself what a great vocal leader the backline of that defense TI out by Green Malik Brown has the stickiest hands on the Syracuse defense able to force another turnover as number two in the ACCC and Steals and you got to defend Bott early with a crowd and brown does a good job of just winning that top shoulder plays low where the ball was delivered I didnt know how hard Syracuse would fight in this game but theyve answered it so far in the first 10 minutes they need some help to get it in rebounds have evened out now seven at piece Carolina has grab the last three cier Copeland with the basketball Bell back in the game watched by cormack Ryan Bell puts it up and in that is his spot I know he can shoot from both corners but the left corner is his sweet spot kidos pass deflected by Brown out of bounds Carolina will have it Applause underneath Chris Bell with eight points to lead Syracuse when he scores the orange have been far more successful this Music season M guards are pretty tight up top discouraging that nail that nail pass off the Lian miss here is Mintz hes got two points so far has the fourth leading score in the conference and working on wiers gets him in the air lays it off the glass for two once again those guards for Syracuse are just back dribbling and reloading the attack and going right at North Carolina Ryan anwers going right at use at the other end thats thats the fear against North Carolina they rip that thing out of the net and rush it up the floor very disciplined where they run and how fast they Music run turns down the shot and draws the foul on Withers I talked about Chris Bell from that left corner as a righthanded shooter you can get really deep and still have vision of that rim and typically youll see righthanded Shooters favor that left side because they can get as deep in that corner as they want and not get buried behind the backboard with that right release this kid shoots it as well as anyone Ive seen in college ball this year 40 right on the year coming in and Conference play very smooth silk release yeah six nights ago in this building he put 30 on Louisville went eight of 10 and to top it off he had the game securing chase down block late in regulation Ryan lost the dribble dangerous pass mince gets it heres Bell gives it up Starling he drives goes to the other side and puts it in they are just Bulldogs to the rim right now these seuse guards oh we set off the top top 10 teams are losing on the road to unranked opponents at a record rate Carolina back within eight but what looked like could have been a Runway from the start has been anything but Jimmy and 0 not after you Doug doing a really good job of letting his team run when its available and slowing them down when its Music not Music mince back out to Starling tend to shoot Starling drives as it poked Away by Davis the officials look at each other and itll go the other way when we come back I talked about these Syracuse guards being Bulldogs right now theyre just a Blow by a bad close out physical at The Rim winning their collisions the orange hanging in this thing and Beyond with the lead this uh game update here what are you seeing from number four Marquette on the road theyre playing downhill attacking the basket and the last time these two teams played a butler win they were five for 31 from the three today theyre attacking a paint meanwhile number 21 Virginia playing their best ball going for their ninth straight win yeah re been hard to keep out of Lane starts on the defensive end and the tempo for Virginia slowly but surely the B con strictor sucks the air out of you hit up by five highlights coming your way at the break Doug and Jimmy Jimmy Kevin thank you so much and as weve been talking a theme throughout the season Jimmy dyes AP top 10 teams after Kansas went and got thumped last night in Leck now are sporting a losing record when playing unranked opponents really hard to imagine yeah I mean itd be the worst record in the AP poll era and uh you got the another one in the makings right now and the reason is Syracuse even on the boards and the paint points are 12 to2 the C goes manto man now out of this atto just changing it up a little bit trying to keep Carolina out of a rhythm Kido Ryan Ingram Washington and Davis to five on the floor foul against quader Copeland coming up next at 9 Eastern will take it a rough arena for Antonio Reeds and number 22 Kentucky hosting ol Miss Carl rabit Jay billis Marty Smith on the call what do you make of the wild cats at this point well kuy lost three games in a row in R for the first time in the history of that building and if they lose another one tonight the sky going to fall Old Miss Doug a very good team right now theyre one of the last four in one of the nine teams being projected out of the SEC thats a big time opportunity for Chris beard tonight on the road been rough Carolina Jaylen Washington was left wide open he is now six of 12 on threepointers this season M gets into the lane and shoots over kdo for two more just a lot of individual win year battle right now offense by Syracuse and that they are Washington now inside kicks it out kadoo tough shot foul called against Syracuse dont foul his tough shots kadoo takes a ton of tough shots I love his game but you cant bail him out on those tough twos man just completely uncovered got lost on Baseline out of bounds under defense and Judah just hes so crafty hes all of 64 but hes Shifty plays low to high high to low right to left oneonone matchups so far have been won by the team in white Elliot Kau turned 19 in September one of the few freshman starting for a top 10 team in the country how has he been able to immerse himself with guys who are 21 22 23 even 25 years old no doubt first of all hes extremely talented he sees the game one pass ahead at an extraordinary level hes not a shooter yet hes doing a couple on Saturday against Miami from the threepoint line but he is a down he old driving dude thats easy yeah thats thats way Easy Money Man for this kid youre going to play a Zone man whatever youve got to know where four in in Carolina blue is he is money first three point point of the night for the senior from downstate White Plains New York comes in averaging an ACC best 21 and a half points per game top 10 nationally tough shot by Copeland Ingram dribbles up for Carolina he has had a quiet first half of the Tar Heels but how versatile a weapon is he missing on the turnaround I like Syracuse defensively getting their defense set very few first six seven second opportunities for North Carolina so far illegal screen against Brown and that is his second thats another one of the story lines for Syracuse cant afford to have him get into foul trouble no and Adrien oper is going to go to munir hea who doesnt have a lot of experience that moving screen he tried to roll a guy up right in front of the officials iss going to get called and now this kid 55 in white has a ton on his plate very few minutes in ACC play but because of his size hes going to have to bang now for the next 5 minutes and 25 seconds of this first half if Im Carolina I go right to Armando bacock on this possession well he backed up Jesse Edwards last year in 27 games but this year Mana has not played much at all in Carolina does just that to my point hes just not hes just not ready hes said hes got a good body but his feel for the game and defensively just not a guy right now that I think is built for this level of play and North Carolina sees the same thing that I just said the Bott seal has gotten so much better this year he will walk you up but his ability to seal you off and hold you and Carolina now on a 60 Music run Doug Sherman back inside the JMA D in Syracuse where Carolina has scored six in a row and how have they been making their buckets now five of their last six Jimmy well the the the ball movement for North Carolina is good and Bott is such an anchor man he is a pressure release on that offensive end when things arent going well you just trust this guy to seal and play low and get himself in position to score around the rim one of my favorite guys to visit with in the Bahamas this year and actually had aond Burger in Chapel Hill I was there for the SEC ACC challenge phenomenal phenomenal nice well every time Armando Bott takes the floor history is made I mean his name is all over the Carolina record books no basket they say the foul came before the shot by Judah minz and that the personal goes against bacon is that not awfully close to being in the shot the shot motion by Mintz where where does a contact occur as hes starting up uh that like maybe that second as he put the right foot down is probably why they called it off but boy so close 16 foul on Carolina so non shooting Syracuse keeps with under 5 minutes to go in the half what was once a 10point game is back down to oneis so RJ Davis picks up his second foul and thats the seven that will send mince to the line which he does an awful lot of nobody in the ACC gets to the line or makes more free throws than number three in white eight free throw attempts a game five assists a game and hes offensively hes very difficult to stay in front of not a trustworthy threepoint shooter hes got a lot of twist in his upper body even on his free throws right here Doug watch how much his left shoulder rotates back and I just most consistent Shooters stay a little more squared up than Judah minz does making 75 come the line this year gets a pair the orange lead is back to three hes going to stay in that two3 zone which helps stay in front of Kau and RJ Davis good ball movement to find Ingram for the three a phenomenal job of Hubert Davis to put his point guard inside that zone at the nail first time hes ran a guy in there and he puts his point guard in there Kad who again he sees the play one pass ahead of everybody else in the building Ingram a 42 shooter on the year Bell unable to answer at the other end pulled down by Ingram Carolina with a chance to take the lead Ingram for three tar Hills in front he is a blue blazer very versatile can do a little bit of everything for you and good quick ball reversal in the conversion offense by the heels and Jimmy he is now 10 away from 1000 career points couple of years at Stanford before transferring to Carolina this year turnaround bucket by Taylor his first shot made tonight steal by mince again Adrian arre slowing his guys down he does not want to be in a horse race for 40 minutes against North Carolina Taylor hands it off to Starling with Davis stepping out to defend hea sets the screen Taylor penetrates little step back but called for traveling no basket now Harrison Ingram does a little bit of everything hes averaging 11 and 11 in conference play this guys a walking double double theres what Im talking about you put your point guard inside that zone and Ingam just sitting there look for that backside bomb the very next possession reverse it Swing Swing 55 rise release rotation result it doesnt matter the size of the guy you put inside that zone you find a way to get your best passer on the interior of her and kadoo is that as Hubert Davis can coach with any of them out there you know I look at this ACC right now four teams in Wake Forest I believe is one of the first four out but North Carolina theyre fighting for a one seed right now in that NCAA tournament Purdue and Yukon theyre not going to move off that one line but Arizona Houston North Carolina Tennessee I think those four teams Doug are fighting for the final two spots as a one seed in that NCAA tournament to your Point North Carolina cant lose this game tonight theres pressure in that as well well this is a quad two game for Carolina on the road against Syracuse and if not for that threegame stretch where they had losses at Georgia Tech and then the home loss against Clemson surrounding the big win against Duke Carolina would be on that wood line absolutely heres Davis whos had a quiet night so far scoring just three points for the ACC leader in points per game five on the shot clock into the middle out to Ryan hes got his third triple of the night Carolina up by four thats pretty good offense cuz theyre not just having kadoo play in there the entire possession hes picking and choosing when he flashes man when he does again just quickly finding that backside Bomb by core M Bryant he is a competitor three in Carolina blue he fights it now tough shot judin gets the roll but you didnt foul his tough shot if youre North Carolina you can live with it cant live with this Ingram kicks to the corner Davis gets a look offensive rebound Washington puts it up and in just powered right through did he not the arms of hea Washington that backup five guy behind bot getting a little more rugged as the season progresses yeah and after missing a year of high school ball with an ACL tear never really was fully himself last year continues to emerge ja a sophomore staring again to the midrange those are tough shots because theres no reason to be concerned about him as a ball screener so youre making that shot over your primary Defender and that secondary Defender look at Kad sitting there in that nail just very sneaky trying to find a gap Davis drives up and over Applause he Dar trying to push to Tempo cut off by Davis and the orange will bring it back out red ay the head coach says to Jud Min slow it down and set it up Syracuse got blasted blasted by 36 points a month ago at Chapel Hill why they play the game absolutely you just never know Starin from the left side still has the touch hes got 10 points I just feel like the seru guards feel like they can go get theirs anytime they want heres Theo from the nail out to Ingram T to shoot Taylor knocked it away Syracuse can retake the lead take the last one right I mean take the very last one of this half if youre Applause Syracuse youre not a great offensive rebounding team ideally you could take it with maybe 3 seconds its going to be a guard though Doug making a play thats been their best offense this half Starling has Davis to beat hea sets the screen now five on the shot clock on the switch staring through the legs on the pull up got great and we got more out of the first 20 minutes than perhaps we anticipated Jimmy a really good last possession though by Syracuse you took it at the perfect time you trusted your guard to make another play I question the fight that Syracuse would have in this game coming in I dont question it now what a performance by the home team Carolina and Syracuse tied at the Dome we send it back to the studio Kevin dandi eats up hes a Difference Maker those 13 points the most he has had in a half this year in a Carolina uniform no doubt hes big tall physical competitive guard that you have to have if youre going to be really really good in March I think North Carolina is built to do it are they built to get out of here tonight with a win is the present question well perhaps the best news for Carolina is that RJ Davis has only three points and yet the game is tied as Bell misses the three and the rebounding has been relatively even Syracuse has actually outscored Carolina in paint points Davis misses on the runner Bott misses on the footb Syracuse comes down with it mince Taylor Bell Brown Starin same starting five for Syracuse in the second Min picked up his dribble gets it back out to Starling Pau Davis Bott Ryan and Ingram same starting five for the T Bell for three what a pass by Malik Brown to roll out of the short roll passer and find that six s stroke on the backside from Bell Bells got 11 to lead Syracuse Starling has 10 minz with nine a pretty big Zone up top Starling and M both at 64 doing a good job of showing arms into the middle fdau calls his own number then Taps it back out to Ryan his pass right into the hands of mince third in the ACC and steals per game comes up with another theft mince shuffle pass Brown Taylor extra pass Starling for three a really good decision by Min not to force a tough one at the rim and keep the ball Applause alive on the night Syracuse collectively six of 11 from distance k turned it down to Davis for three off the back Applause iron Jimmy are you a believer of the importance of the first two or three minutes of each half and the last two or three minutes of each half oh no no doubt that it was middle four minutes got him in the face and down is Elliot CAU holding his face Bill G gambles back to try to get the steel and sticks that left hand right in the right eye of kadoo pretty tough shot heres Hubert Davis who played a couple of games in this building as a junior at North Carolina a couple of NCA tournament wins back in 91 when we asked him before the game what he remembered he thought for a second and said Jimmy we won both games w we won both games and he did pretty well 16 points in a blowout win over Northeastern and then he scored 18 against a good Carolina team in a game that was more competitive C do continues to try and gather himself and hell be replaced by Seth Trimble who is just back after missing a couple of games with what they call an upper body injury this is a tough few minutes now without kadoo on the floor cuz hes been the facilitator against this Zone better than anybody else wonder who theyll put in the middle at the uh nail now now theyre going to go with Ingram on this possession Trimble could get in there and make a play as well I think Davis bounces it out of bounds Syracuse the last to touch the Carolina keeps with 10 on the timer I think Syracuse will stay in this Zone with a short clock tend to work with you certainly have to tag four in Carolina blue on back side of the floor six to shoot Davis a long threepoint shot misses second opportunity and weve got a foul on the rebound thats going to go against Judah Min what a college basketball Saturday we have for y on ESPN weve got number nine Duke and Florida State and then its number six Kansas against 25th ranked Oklahoma and finally number 22 Kentucky and 13th ranked Auburn square off in a Sonic Blockbuster should be another great afternoon of Hoops yeah good luck to Kentucky trying to win in the jungle have you been a game with auburn in the last few years I have not it is a a level matching right there with the Cameron crazies that student section is as good as we have in all of college ball Bruce Pearl he doesnt have the best starting five but I think he has the best starting 11 thats how deep his bench Applause is that foul was on Judah minz just his first as Seth Trimble makes the second fivepoint Syracuse lead we were tied at halftime at Music 42 check in the left Stop what a ball fake by J uh Judah mince well hes got some Flash and some slickness doesnt he to his game mince just froze the defense by faking that pass to that corner 11 points now for the accs fourth leading score mint averaging over 18 per night like you can see why he gets there eight times a game to the free throw line three in WS he is just SLI Washington passes it out shot clock down to three tough shot for Trimble Washington got a hand on it but it comes to Starling and Syracuse continues to gain The Rebound in this game very very important Min got a whistle and he will head back to the line Jimmy hes just wired to get fouls call he is but you got to have discipline dont foul his tough shots and that ball Movement by Syracuse Starling averaging 19 over the last eight playing really well and Judah minz watch right here the ball fake the shot fake frees himself up kind a good one in Music Applause Syracuse just makes you wonder what if for Syracuse had Jim Brown played his senior year phenomenal person phenomenal man and an AllAmerican at Syracuse in football track and field lacrosse he was initially a walkon on this campus and overcame a ton of discrimination at multiple levels some would say the greatest football player in the history of the NFL rush for over 12000 yards average 5 yds per carry man what a stud was he and others would say hes the greatest lacrosse player of all time absolutely I didnt realize till today he was also a captain in the US Army Reserve just so wellrounded forac Ryan Carolinas been getting good looks from that corner a rare Miss for Ryan Applause tonight North Carolina has started the second half now 0 for eight from the floor Elliot kdo back out there defending mince hes got a cut on the bridge of his nose after taking that inadvertent shot from Chris Bell a few minutes ago pass to tall for brown Davis comes away with it by the way hes got three personal fouls and he is fouled by Judah Min talking about football that was pretty good Collision in what is the West End Zone in this building when the football teams play watch Davis bring this say thats youre right thats a thats a free safety coming up and taking on a little scatback in the open field what do you make of the quiet night scoring the basketball so far for RJ Davis as Kau leaves it short I think the length of the Zone has bothered RJ a little bit but RJs a kid that doesnt always Force things and he made a big statement to me against Duke earlier this year cuz Duke they trapped him they they put their body on him you look up at 38 minutes hes got 17 points five assists and no turnovers and hes always a threat to go on a 8 90 run all by himself well you know hes not thinking about the fact that he has scored 15 or more points in 10 straight games the longest for AAR Hill since Justin Jackson had a 13 game streak seven years ago and right on Q Davis with his second made three of the night to my point you better be there on the catch whether its man or Zone Music Music JJ Starling tied up by Ingram its a held ball possession Carolina and the versatility of Ingram defensively so impressive to tie up a ball out of the live Drive watch Davis right there youre hesitant your hands are down and Davis sees it that little rhythm dribble to his right hes also good with it to his left you have got to be there on the Applause catch B sets the screen Kau to the corner Ryan turns it down dribbles into the lane tough shot off the window no long rebound mins and Syracuse has numbers Bell to the left he gets the line cant make the shot and brown comes down with the basketball and were going to have a foul call look that is a ton of contact on an Airborne player with bell watch B get up trying to complete this lob and ton of contact from behind that goes uncalled and you got to protect those Airborne players ask the same thing cuz Ryan comes in from behind and you body some from behind like that an Airborne player safety becomes an issue Im surprised no foul call yeah none at all so its Syracuse basketball underneath the shot clock at 20 Bell catching release tough shot CER Copeland into the game with the offensive rebound Syracuse not winning the rebound battle but theyre not being blown out as well guards doing a good job of rebounding the elbows on the defensive end as Applause help five to shoot Starling ho angram tracks down the rebound for Carolina seventh right team in the country down by six on the road Pau yes a huge three for UNC shot with confidence did he not I mean he really snapped it off he made his first two threes of conference play on Saturday gber Davis tell him before the ball game we trust his threepoint shot its the good ones that hes got to take Carolina with six unanswered points good high low to find Brown defended by Ryan thats an easy two for the sophomore from Virginia yeah way too easy to give up a mismatch by North Carolina with Cormac on Mal Brown Syracuse has four in double figures and the lead is back to Applause five Ryan to the free throw line good do Davis up gets away from the double team tough pass to bacock and hell head to the line for Applause two a mismatch inside Syracuse does a good job of recognizing that Mal Browns got it and theres no pressure on the ball Bott is backed off and thats just an easy pass to make over the top and Koo with a ball fake frees himself up theres nothing wrong at all with his release no thats thats a kid thats just going to get better and better growing into a shooter at that point guard spot and now the third leading score in the history of North Carolina basketball Armando Bea who most recently passed the big smooth Sam Perkins he now Trails only Phil Ford who he might catch this year probably will but almost certainly wont catch Tyler hinb whose 2872 points should stand the test what I appreciate appreciate about bof this year hes averaging 31 minutes in conference play hes in very good condition he stays out of foul trouble hes a battler on both backboards on the switch mince attacks B and scores over him again just get that quick mismatch and attack this is a quad two game for North Carolina a win would not according to Joe lonardi moved them back to the one line but a loss certainly could be damaging a defensive La Bott found by Kad and he throws it down how good is kadoo inside that zone playing with his back to the basket as a point guard and knows exactly the feel of where botts going to be beautiful8 minutes gone here in the second Syracuse with a basketball up by three mince tries to escape the double team in the blocking foul goes against Elliot cadell Doug watch kadoo right here he continues to play inside that zone he catches it with his back to the basket and knows exactly where Bott is the ball fak to the outside knowing the entire time hes going Baseline Big Time play by Elliot kadoo inside the Zone dou I thought this was really interesting in pregame JJ Starling with 13 points in this ball game for Syracuse first guy Ive ever seen go through the first 45 minutes without shoes on he went through the entire stretching and actually did some over and back runs without his shoes on so I asked like why are you out here in your socks he said I started it this year I just want to get my whole body a feel for the wood and Im big into meditation right now I just want my body to really get engaged with the floor and the surroundings and very unique Ive never seen that out of a basketball player just to go that long he was a good 45 minutes before he finished off the last 30 with his game shoes on but its working for him playing a really good game six out of 10 from the floor meanwhile coming out of that last time out here it was clear that something is up with Armando Bott one of his legs Judah Min give him 17 points trying to find Kido in the middle of that zone hes got it Cross Court cor M Ryan great shot F wide open from 17 ft hes got two more but dug you will take that if youre Syracuse you may North Carolina work that ball and get to the third side of the floor and take a tough two by cormack Ryan those are his first two points of the second half after scoring 13 before the break Carolina trying to again get the ball out of mins hands they do that Copeland Bell 4 three Ingram with a Applause Music rebound Ryans pass anticipated nicely by Malik Brown who swaps it out of bounds kadoo cannot get stationary inside that zone hes got to move and Flash and give different looks find angles if he St magnet it makes it very difficult for two and blue to get a touch Ryan a little strong that time Starling with a defensive rebound and the orange will walk it up 1020 to go in regulation Adrian arry doing a good job of playing all gases sometimes and and a lot of breaks appli to sometimes in this game really controlling the speed he wants to play with bad pass by Malik Brown right into the hands of Ingram Pau bounce P Davis to the basket going to count it and he will head to the free throw line big sequence for Carolina how about the pass by kdo I mean I think hes the only one in the dome that saw enough of an angle to thread that ball through Carolina comes up with a steel they do play all G right here theres just hardly anything there its not just his sight its his feel for the game in the open floor that is at a next level for a freshman point guard they going to check Music it that is the second personal foul on JJ Starling and the officials over taking a look at the replay and it looks like its all just going to be a common foul and so Davis to the line with a chance for an oldfashioned threepoint play this kid takes no plays off Ive gone back Ive been here since Sundays Ive done everything you can do in Syracuse youre a central New Yorker without a cat on by the way I didnt bring a c to Syracuse such a southerner Dinosaur Barbecue but you go back and watch the last three games of North Carolina he does not take a play off that motor runs hot for 40 minutes every time he steps on the floor Davis now with nine points he has drawn Carolina even staring trying to get to that right hand they worked on that considerably during practice yesterday no doubt yeah thats called go action you catch that thing on the go and the action is all downhill oan had it knocked away Syracuse has it with numbers Copeland B orange by Applause four this place used to average 29000 when Adrien oy played here its not that number tonight but its starting to Roar Davis hes heaten up now into double figure he will not go away and he shoots that ball quick and he shoots it with Music guts one month ago in Chapel Hill at the Smith Center North Carolina blew out Syracuse by 36 points the worst droving Syracuse has endured in nearly 20 years a month later weve got a competitive ball game Syracuse by one b spins away from Brown missed it and Brown tracks Down The Long rebound Bott has not used his size in this game like he needs to hes the most physical forceful guy on the floor and Jimmy rebounds continue to be even Carolina 21 Syracuse 19 it was 53 30 in Chapel Hill in favor of North Carolina H Banks it in Doug time and time again its a different guard for Syracuse just winning their oneonone battle making 12T shots in this Applause game 8 minutes left in regulation Kido turns drops it off bot nice set for Carolina what a pass by kadoo again hes your point guard at 6 foot inside that zone playing through traffic to touch the field delivered to Perfection feels like a big 739 n for North Carolina this would be a damaging loss to their Chase of a number one seed in that NCAA tournament they got now 14 points six rebounds mince turned down the shot copelan fak the pass missed it numbers for Carolina if they heard Davis with a head of steam protects the ball and gets right to the goal great description by you that the protect the ball part he is so good and so clever and tough as nails and just drove that ball with Force Through contact playing like an allamerican has not been a better guard in the country from November turn now until now than RJ Davis Doug watch this drrive by Davis right there covers it up shifts sides the ball from the right to the left with a hard finish and there as part of their 10367 route a month ago down at the dean Carolina held Syracuse in the first half Jimmy to 29 shooting so far here tonight Syracuse is shooting 62 how can that be possible well the the the rise up in fight back of Syracuse very impressive in this game and Doug think about this Syracuse has not been ranked since 2018 that is amazing yeah 2018 the last time this program was ranked they havent had a player drafted in the NBA draft since 2019 so Adrien otrey in his first year trying to put the fight back in the Syracuse basketball and a massive opportunity right now with 708 to go to make a statement well Jimmy coming up next at 900 Eastern well take you to rup Arena number 22 Kentucky hosting Old Miss Chris beard texted me at halftime he said the ice cream at rup is overrated really yes yeah and I I kind of agree with him a little bit okay its good but Im not so its so much hype about it you know the next time youre in Lex team youre going to have to answer for the question I probably will as will Coach Pearl JJ St bouns it in to beat the buzzer a huge smile as he goes back and covers his face almost in shame Doug you got to have some of those though if youre trying to knock off the number seven team in the country that beat you by 36 a month Applause ago top 10 teams have lost more than they have won on the road this season against unranked opponents Carolina in trouble here tonight in Syracuse Ingram missed the layoff B tries to save it but it goes to Ingram when he was out of bounds its Syracuse ball well he goes the 45 minutes before the game without shoes on to get a feel for the floor and a feel for the surroundings pretty good feel by Starling in late clock to rise up and have the awareness I got to somehow snap this thing off 5 4 3 2 1y says thats my bank man Hugh hanging in a fist fight Music right Indy the win streak for number four Marette is at eight after beating Butler Tyler kak the story yeah come behind you cant go underneath that screen he had 27 this game five assists there next game is against

with 530 to go in this game Seth Trimble back into the game with the basketball for the heels Davis calls his own number from the wing no Ingram on the offensive blast bottled up goes up and over ground for two a grown mans rebound Harrison Ingram Doug how tough it is to rebound the ball behind the backboard and to carve out space and twist your body like you did to get it up on the glass man that was beautiful well hes every bit of 67 225 Jimmy he is a load he is leading everybody in ACC play at over 10 rebounds per game its quite a onetwo combo with him and Bon mince fastic pull Time and Time and Time Again those Syra guards knocking off contact and elevating that jump shot around the elbow and here comes the Dome again brown with yet another deflection Carolina will keep you saw the 21 points by mints theyve been efficient look at mints with the blow by and you get that second Defender B caught now chasing from behind thats thats win every time for Syracuse heres what Im talking about knock off the contact and pull up with confidence one of the great venues in college basketball starting to impact this game just a little right no doubt about it they were expecting the largest crowd of the season so far they had sold over 23000 tickets as of yesterday a will stay with Carolina with 11 on the shot clock Applause Ryans catching shoot ball coming this way I said that for your benefit by the way it was coming just in case Ive been ran over before sitting here whos gotten you several years ago Levi ran off for Alabama knocked me smooth on my back head headset went flying

basketball is brought to you by Progressive Insurance bundle home in Auto and save visit progressivecom over on ESPN 2 weve got a top 25 showdown in the Big 12 jacobe Walter we got Oklahoma and Baylor at Waco should be a great match up back to a good one at the Carrier Dome Doug and Jimmy take it Music away Kevin thank you well the Tar Heels highlight in ACC Network triple head Saturday as they host Virginia T 2 Eastern followed by Miami Boston College and then Louisville pit to cap off the Night with Jimmy Dykes Im Doug Sherman back inside the JMA Wireless Dome where Syracuse is giving seventh ranked Carolina all it can handle in a game that is a rematch from a month ago when the Tar Heels tardan feather the orange and the last time if youre wondering Syracuse took down a top 10 team you have to go back to 2019 when they beat Duke Zion had 35 points in losing effort the last time Syracuse beat any ranked team was just last February almost uh to the day a year ago taking down North Carolina State when the wolf pack was ranked 23rd well what a performance tonight by Judah Mintz and JJ Starling neither one has come out of the game minz now with 23 points Starling with 18 Adrien ay playing offense like the lane is on fire clearing people out of there letting his guard go to Applause work Ingram tries to quiet the crowd and does yeah missed his last one from the elbow shot but shot it with confidence that time that zone has been really good for Syracuse in this game they have taken away that drive ability to downhill a ball in the glass offensive rebounds all that stuff the Syracuse Zone has deleted Miss carving out some space against corm Ryan back to Starling with three on the timer that one in its a perfect switch Im going to start doing games without my shoes on it works really well for this guy warm up your in your socks and let the game Applause begin JJ Starling transfer from Notre Dame and does he step on that line or does he pull it back thats a three unless something happens as he rises that ball up no thats a three looked a little awkward with the left foot in front of the right a big time shot by JJ Starling and he was a big time shooter in high school at Baldwinsville and then transferring to prep school but his freshman year at Notre Dame he for the shoulder injury and the shooting went down it took him a while reworked the shot of the off season and has continued to work on it well from January till now hes been Syracuses best player hes got his swag back as Adrien AR told us yesterday Adrian op yesterday said you when I finished playing pro ball I started working for UPS then I got into the insurance title business and came to a Syracuse game and coach beheim said what are you doing you need to be coaching he says so I threw myself into being the head coach of a 13yearold AE team and I got bit and he said I never dreamed ever my first day on this campus as a player I would be the head man in charge of this basketball program and man The Pride that he has coaching his Alma moer a chance for a big upset right now Davis back from B cant let him get loose man thats the one guy you got a shade in that zone he slides so well into his threepoint shots Applause Starling decides not to attack and theyll set it up with 222 remaining RJ Davis with 17 points 14 here in the second half if its anything besides a mint or a starling drive I will be shocked in they go to Brown on the switch he tries to get rid of the ball instead of going straight up Syracuse will keep underneath well Min had to get rid of it they com to trap a life out of him and he threw it right where the trap came from from now short clock for Qs to work with Syracuse is shooting 65 from the floor wow 47 on three starlings been a big part of it deny Harrison Ingram blocks it it goes out of bounds Syracuse ball and D they cant check it its 202 on the clock just two seconds away from being able to check it right but they reset the shot clock and the ball did not hit the rim there was well maybe there was a change of possession there but the shot clock at the moment says 20 if there was a change of possession it should have gone back to 30 and now Jamie lucky is coming to the other officials to say did Ryan possess it Hubert Davis meanwhile from the Carolina bench trying to explain that there should not have been a shot clock reset unless of course they say cormack Ryan possessed it theres no review of who it went off of it can only be the the shot clock and where it should be set or reset right now with 202 to go in the Music game thats possession Carolina right when cornerback Ryan I mean he firmly has two hands on the ball well certainly in slow motion it seemed like he had it he he had it I think theyre going to get a full 20 a new 20 right ybert Davis received the explanation and that indeed is what it appears to be 202 remaining in regulation Syracuse has led most of the game as by as many as 10 in the first half Adrien ay looking for his first signature win as head coach at his Alma North Carolina only 14 fouls they can be aggressive right now now try to get a rip Music steel Starling comes to the basketball gets double teamed at the mid cour strike Bell back out to quader Copeland Bell to pull up on the Baseline the ball comes back to him and a fresh 20 on the shot clock Brown is fouled by corack Ryan Ryan went down hard and Im not sure Brown appreciated the way that foul was delivered that was a winning cut possibly by Malik Brown right there that is a winning cut and corack Ryan I they will probably take a look at this as he comes with really hard contact and I think all three officials will take a look at this one this could be a huge call but the cut by Brown possibly a winning cut man we talked about him in the Music Applause open the scoring of the two guards but the the overall play by Brown has been huge in this game is that excessive unnecessary I mean thats a definition of an F1 its it could be excessive he comes down hard on the arms not on the ball so on the official review Hubert Davis rallies his team together trying to avoid an upset that would be a quad 2 loss against Syracuse was that a basketball play a hard foul at The Rim was going to be viewed as excessive contact coming down that hard not on the ball but on the arms and Ron Gro Jamie lucky and Tim clogger a big call in this game to be Applause made you want all three official thats a good all three officials need to get their eyes on this Doug Music you they going to view this that cor macaran knows I I cant give up a layup here so Im going to you know commit the intentional foul we dont judge intent but if hes not making a legitimate play on that ball I can see where they would escalate this well Malik Brown is a 72 foul shooter he has not been to the line tonight just a common foul two shots if they did the right thing takeing a look at it I would have been fine with it going either way and now Brown with two big free throws you want your toughest most competitive dudes I do on the free throw stripe at this point not so much about the percentage but how competitive how tough are you this kid 66 in ACC play but he is tough this young man spent his youth traveling three plus hours round trip several times a week from cul pepper Virginia to the Uturn Sports Complex in Richmond just to ball with the best in the area he gets one out of two the Syracuse lead is five well get up on those threes right dont dare North Carolina to snap one off make out looking only to pass its Ingram on the right side knocked out of bounds carels will keep and reset the shot clock really alert play though by Copeland as that backline Defender asz he was up on the wing initially and it just flew at the ball with low hands and knock it out of bounds remember Syracuse over the years last year they played Zone 90 of the time LED division one in the amount of Zone possessions this year coming into this game tonight only 133 of the time but it has been a heavy dose of Zone the entire game by Adrien ay look at him fly in and get those low hands oh thats thats going to have to have a second or third look I love how Copeland comes in with low hands at ball level to get a piece of Applause it did that left hand of Ingram make contact after Copeland poked it away Applause well obviously up on the Jumbotron here in the dome they have shown the replay youre looking at and the 20 plus thousand are certain they are certain its Syracuse basketball was it the left pinky that was the last one to touch it for North Carolina Ron Grovers call he had a great view was definitive but he has overturned it to give it to the orange I think it was that when they magnified the look and it looked like it went off that the pinky finger the Carolina player thats it yeah good job by by us well done not you and I but our tape operators a big big possession for Syracuse right now they cannot turn turn it over they got to get a good look they got to run clock Carolina gives up the foul in the back court they will send Brown no that is team foul number six non shooting first on Trimble womens college basketball Thursday Prime Time a big one coming up number one South Carolina will take on the lady balls in Knoxville Thursday 700 eastern right here on ESPN South Carolina is rolling arent they mens and womens basball if youre Syracuse right now Doug you finish this game off with the intentions of there are no officials dont expect the whistle to be blown play through the contact be strong with the ball Chris Bell yesterday in practice heard from his coach red ay repeatedly from that exact Corner dont take a bad shot I guarantee that was running through his head when he turned down that threepoint shot you you got to keep the ball moving and now they put Malik Brown back on the line one out of two the last time he was there 66 an ACC play and to Now Syracuse is in the bonus the seventh team foul against Carolina cuse with a chance to get their first top 50 legit win of the Year Oregon kind of fluctuates back and forth right now depends on the day Im telling you I trust toughness at the free throw line in this situation toughness wins at the free throw line in close games that foul was number three on bot Syracuse takes its other four players and moves them off the lane as brown C delivers two Im telling you if I could handpick a guy for Syracuse in this situation Im going with number one in White Pass to bacot a little wide Copeland goes after it but Carolina will keep it no change of possession so the shot clock is 22 and Copeland is convinced that were going to get another replay review and another overturn in the same spot on the court yeah thats off of botts knee and that will be Syracuse ball well our tape operators Jake Christ and Meredith are going to get an assist if Syracuse hangs on to win this game a couple of big replay reviews late one has been overturned the other one based on what we see Jimmy looks like were going to have a second it sure does look like it it looks like that copelan with the effort to try to direct that ball back in bounds goes off of botts leg man what a massive performance by Syracuse this things not over but they got thumped in Chapel Hill by 36 points a month ago and I didnt know if they had the fight and the fire to come out and win this game but man they have answered every question coming in about Syracuse basketball so far tonight and the games not over they cant lose their mind this would be a big call to go in their favor this would be the 10th turnover committed by Carolina against the accs best team at turning you over probably just checking the clock now I think clearly The Possession is going to be Syracuse and then when did the ball go out of bounds and exactly how much time is going to be put on this game clock I think is what theyre determining right now yeah all smiles for JJ Starling in the orange with one minute on the clock and Doug aits in the back court Syracuse will have a full 30 seconds again there are no officials if youre Syracuse in your mind right now be extremely strong with the ball trying to give up the foul the whistle comes Ryan with the personal will send Copeland to the free throw line quader on the season is a 68 free throw shooter and this will be his first trip to the line well if Carolina loses this game the fact that three of their 10 turnovers have come in the last 90 seconds will be costly and think about the sound bite we had with Adrien atrey in the first half talking about after the Wake Force loss we did not compete everything about us was unacceptable and he dismissed a player in Benny Williams and boy he will be so proud of his guys how they fought back in this game they were the aggressor from the opening Music minutes Old Miss in Kentucky have gotten underway you can see that over on ESPN news well get you to rough Arena just as soon as were done here at the Dome pack Ryan three from the corner timeout Carolina Big Shot for poor M Ryan in North Carolina to hang in this game now the pressure is going to be on Syracuse again to get the ball in bounds be strong with it make free Music throws still not in the double bonus theyll have to be making a regular bonus for Syracuse on the next foul lets go to Kevin in the studio Doug for those who are just joining us Old Miss Kentucky underway at rup Arena right now on ESPN news number 22 Kentucky looking to snap a threegame home winning streak home losing streak I should say when we have a final at the Carrier Dome we will go to rup Arena out live on ESPN back to you what must be going through the mind of red ay first chance for a signature win as the head coach at is alma mater now the lead is down to 5 494 Seconds To Go Carolina with a big three from cormack Ryan to hang in there the entire focus is how we get the ball in bounds and Adrien backs his guys up so its a foot race to the ball right now mince and Starling have been hard to say in front of with the ball are they hard to stay in front of right now without the ball oand the trigger man along the Baseline mince gets free dribbles through the double team in the reach in both Davis and Ingram were on him and the foul goes against Ingram and now mince who leads this league in free throw attempts hes been there just 103 times coming in now 110 in NCC play at the free throw line and he hasnt missed one tonight perfect seven out of seven for Judah Music mitz the sophomore out of Gonzaga College High School in Washington DC makes the front end its back to a sixpoint game would they storm the court here well they take down North Carolina it certainly appears that the students are ready to our left in and out for mince oh they need to hold up this games not over RJ Davis again protects the ball gets it up on the rim Ingram tips it in timeout again Carolina 8177 will step away and be back to the dome in 30 seconds at the possession arrow belongs to Syracuse the Orange is in the bonus and holding on to a fourpoint lead with the basketball and Copeland again will inbound along the Baseline he can move and if youre Syracuse you have to want the ball right now all four guys have to want the ball good job by Brown to break up making a violent cut in a press Music break Ive been trusting his toughness the last two minutes at the free throw line Im not backing away from it brown is of four Syracuse players and double figures tonight and again the Orange is Led for about 32 or 33 minutes so far tonight trying to put on the finishing touches from the free throw Music line well you know those Tar Heels up next to him are chirping in his ear the whole time thats what they should that is a distraction and theyre theyre purposely talking and in the legal way but just enough sometimes getting ahead of a Applause shooter Carina no foul press off Davis gives it up Ryan has it taken away by cier Copeland a foul against Kack Ryan how hot has his hands been defensively Copeland as he walks by us I mean play after play after play in this right corner hes so good at getting ball level with his paws just rips it from Ryan I think were getting ready to see a good oldfashioned Syracuse Court Applause storm maybe foul number four on forac Music Ryan goand gets the second still plenty of time for the tar Hills down by six Davis pulls the trigger no Malik Brown Cadier copelan Judah minz and instead of putting it up he allows for Bott to foul in and so Mintz good sportsmanship on both sides will head to the line Im surprised mince is going to finish this thing off cuz hes way in front of everybody he stopped right there and Bott pulls him down by the Jersey I guess theyre not going to take a look at that well at this point although Jamie lucky has just blown his whistle I think you got to take a look at this Im Adrien ay Im beging them to go to the Monitor and they will its the fourth personal foul on Armando Bott will it be elevated to a flagrant well Armando Bott is a sweet kid but you cant you cant pull a guy down from the backside by grabbing his jersey and that is to me the definition of excessive un unnecessary when you jerk a guy down grabbing two fistfuls of Jersey and Adrien arre did a good job continuing to harp on the officials to take a look take a look take a look its a sixpoint game but you dont think anything for granted right now till it shows triple Zer on the clock if youre Syracuse yeah it is a flagrant one yeah thats thats a good job by Adrien ustri to fight for that to fight for that call result Two Shots possession two shots for mince who is eight for nine and possession for Syracuse Doug a potential very damaging loss to North Carolinas chance to be a one seed and they can still fight their way back theres a lot of ball left for those teams that theyre right there with them the Houston the arizonas the tennesses this ones going to Sting the tar Hills as it should gets the roll on number two hes got 25 the Le all scorers and now its orange basketball underneath its own Applause goal Im going to video this court storm just to show my grandkids Someday Im glad theyre coming from the baseline from Center Court and hopefully thats a long long time from now by the way Kennedy DS J staring will be the for Two Shots fourth foul on CAU KJ stying transferred home to Syracuse for moments like this Doug its amazing what your first year as a head coach a win like this does for the entire program the the momentum the confidence you gain as a head coach for the first time to take down a top 10 ranked team in North Carolina so much good comes out of this game for Syracuse and Adrien o really well done Davis the layup under 10 seconds to go and Carolina will call off the dogs and allow Syracuse to close out and upset of number seven North Carolina and here comes the student section from Syracuse number 79
