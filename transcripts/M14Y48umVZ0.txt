11 including five in a row in Coral Gables officials tonight Pat Driscoll Lamar Simpson Brent Hampton and Matthew Cleveland told rph and I at shoot around he needs one touch and then the nerves will go away we will see theyve tried to downplay the Cleveland return both sides have see I thought it was one shot you got to get one shot did the nerves go he said One Touch in Cleveland right now ding up Jaylen warley Darren Green catch and shoot he knocks down the three he had 20 at Miami a season ago and hes the one guy you got to find early you cant let his first shot attempt be an open looking three 41 from three on the season Miller and omir on the perimeter and the three good for Wagga poppler who might be the most improved player in this league hey its leading the country in division one threepoint I mean threepoint percentage and shooting at 49 both teams come out and make mistakes on the defensive end of the floor lets see if the nerves settle down here and they lock in you saw the starting lineup a moment ago for Florida State theres Deontay green on the inside and jir Watkins is Florida States leading score Green a sharpshooter starting five for Miami popper having a breakout Junior season omir is the teams leading score first look first shot first touch for Cleveland is is no good and a whistle just tying up a shoe there had a little trouble jir Watkins does over there tyy shoe Music up we got multiple guys doing it now that used to be the first thing John Wooden would teach his players how to put on your socks when you up your shoes well you I would you also would do it when you got tired this is so early early in this game dont underestimate that the anxiety and excitement in this game guys will fatigue early and just need to catch their second win thats why I wear Applause loafers Baba Miller inside against Cleveland theres the double green Applause walked great job by Boba Miller there seeing a double team coming see Miami is getting creative on the defensive end of the floor they lack size so when the ball goes in the post you see the double team there all the way to the rim its benley Joseph who came into the game in a 4 for 25 shooting slump you couldnt find two more polar opposite teams I mean one team is with the length and want to pressure you and the one thing you dont want to see is a team with multiple handlers and they got five handlers Miami does that can help handle this pressure and that I dont think theres another team in ACC that has that and its five handlers who all have the green light yes in transition yes they know theyre not coming out of the game so thats the good thing is you dont have to worry about taking a bad shot and coming out at the Clash of styles Miami has really only been about six deep in terms of scoring AJ Caseys their seventh Florida State under Leonard Hamilton has always employed a deep bench and a long rotation Cleveland Against One of his good buddies Deontay green over to popper its tipped around and green Darren Green corals the Music board green with his second to three the tendency on that dribble hand off the pitchback is to go under it and you got to chase him over youve got to run green off the line shooting 41 on the year extremely streaky Joseph pulls it back and the thing with Darren Green hes a microwave his threes come in bunches hes had games with five six seven threes or more in his career he has and Joseph and pack there didnt communicate the switch and cant make that mistake on a guy that shoots as well as he does Miller picked up by Cleveland now Watkins the seven o leading score a transfer from VCU Deonte green blocked at the rim and the draws the foul we talked about that earlier today with Coach L he can ill afford to get no chadow oir in foul TR and he Quicks up one early you often say I I say this all the time to guys protect the first foul you got to protect the first one so in that situation you give that up no you you just eleva walk hes trying to block the shot just go up wall up if he makes it what two points is not going to hurt you right now early in the game man he picks up another when hes done for the half or he gets real tentative if he has to play with two FS just do a better job of protecting that first one you can keep you can stay in your aggressive and attacking mindset foul trouble the first half of last season was an issue for omir once he figured out how to stay on the floor we saw what Miami can do a final four run but one thing about this team though different from last year is this team cannot be successful without him Nigel pack gets to the river Applause Music green off a nice feed from warley and you and I talked about Wy earlier as a point guard his size at 67 expect him to post up Nigel pack some this is what we talked about about multiple handlers omir strong to the 10 its difficult to press a team where the center can take break the press and do that last week we asked Jim Lena does omir have the green light to bring the ball up on a fast break and he goes until he loses the privilege hes got Applause it hes expending a lot of energy hedging that ball screen aint getting back green the turnaround too strong offensive rebound to Watkins and he uses the window Florida State five of its first Applause six at that time Miami has to be worried because air challeng is a shot he cant get under the under rim to rebound and thats where the Atlant of Florida State can take over a game pack whos got that quick release batt it around it comes to Watkins I love to see Nitro pack shoot a basketball that releas is so quick no wasted motion when we come back we will revisit Matthew Clevelands heroics from a season ago in Music the interaction with everybody here the service

of things it could mean how you feel it could mean how you take care of your body what you put into your body what you do for exercise how you sleep its not just about feeling good its being proactive and what you can do Miller for three for the lead got it final chance Florida State warley Cleveland for the win its good Matthew Cleveland stuns Miami the theatrics the heroics from Cleveland when he was a null last year but the story within the story is what happened in the second half and Jim Lena told us today Florida States depth their length it wore down Miami who ran out of gas after halftime yeah he mentioned that and they do that they tend to do that to everyone but he knows he has a limited bench and lets see if he goes to his seventh eighth and Ninth player to kind of minimize it lets see if he does it early Florida State already making a couple of substitutions Primo Spears into the game he hit the last three cam Corin comes in as Applause well AJ Casey is in there for Miami in place of omir popper of three and thats good 49 from three thats just from thre thats just an amazing number I mean you nearly making half of your threes hes not taking one a game hes hting them up and thats impressive greens knocked down a couple from the outside skip pass Miller to Spears blocked the defense by benley Joseph Primo Spears is a player to watch hes able to get his own shot he can create on his own when he plays within the structure of the offense though this is a really dangerous team it is because what he gives him is a guy that late clock situations you can give him the ball and he can go make a play and teams that want to reach their goals ultimately I closes and he hes a guy that can close a game for you Joseph thought about the three turns it over green that would have been his third triple offensive rebound Miller knocked Away by Cleveland Applause D Matthew Cleveland still looking for his first point Point averaging almost 16 half per game The Freshman kesan George out of Switzerland number seven with the hair for Miami into the Music game green this time the dribble Drive I think he can put it on the deck and drive he shoots it so well from behind the ark you got to close out to him look to see him do that more popper will get two shots Applause Music its a great drive there oneonone its hard to help when the ball is in the middle of the floor you know you dont know whether strong side or weak side floa state usually does a really good job of funneling you on one side but pushing this guy around is not an easy task I mean he gets wherever he wants hes so efficient on the floor I mean 50 from the field 50 from three and I just about to credit him on line and I jinxed him I was about to say he shoots 88 so Im going to take one off hes shooting 87 now Im going to knock him down one oh back in Poppers also a testament to something you dont often see in college basketball these days a guy who has developed at one program started as a reserve as a freshman started last year was still a role player and now hes become a Bonafide All Conference type for Miami hes turned himself into a heck of a player I mean he competes on the defense V he has a siid the athleticism and you see why hes on draft boards because that type of development tells you what hes about heres Chandler Jackson sophomore out of Memphis good defense by poppler up ahead to Applause George Miami scores in transition as well as anyone they get it up and down as quickly with so many handlers they usually attack you because you try to match up with them but this florid to State team that doesnt always work they get back and just match up with anybody but that time beat him down the floor that time omir who had the foul didnt want to pick up number two and Corin was like a matador going yeah you got to get out of the way if youre not there early get out of the way thats why I say protect the first one and then you can challenge that George is three offensive rebound omir blocked Away by Corin Applause Jackson leaning in the rebound by Joseph got numbers if they take advantage of it over to Casey who lays it in Miami in transition is lethal but one thing about Florida State team they they put so much pressure on the paint that sometimes that when their guards go rebound theres no defensive balance and Miami pushes as well as anybody hes had a couple transition baskets here early lets see if Florida State designate someone to get back on defense Applause Music Applause Miller that doesnt goir snags the carum When Baba Miller shoots I dont even know why you go out there to challenge it numbers for Florida State green drops it off for Spears you cannot hear Miami turn the basketball over because this is what Florida States Bank in the full court pressure turning you over getting layups getting in transition theyve done a really good job in half court knocking down threes but they really want to get out in Music transition omir through the trees and hes able to draw the foul frenetic case early on between these two Sunshine State rivals Casey on the drop off from Joseph its still Florida State by four as Spears finishes from Green on the other Music end the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I walk in theyre always glad to see me everyone that touches that

gillionaire now his new Ali has his whole place covered what Live Like a G millionaire ATT fiber with Music Ali Leonard Hamilton and Jim Lena now the Elder Statesmen amongst the coaches in the ACC and we talk about Matthew Cleveland coming back to play his former team Leonard Hamilton resurrected this Miami program many years ago he has and we joked with us early about hes never taken over a program when they were really good and and hes had to build him up and did that at Miami and hes definitely done that at Florida State I think hes a Hall of Fame in my book and just waiting on his in shrining Jim Lena hes up for the Hall of Fame for the second consecutive year as well the head coach at Miami coming off the second final four run took George Mason to the final four and then he took Miami to its first final four in program history a season ago he is in my book as well I mean one of the best basketball Minds just overall great guy they they say these guys are old but when you spend five minutes with them theyre just so young and energetic Spears back iron Taylor B bow and he has given this team energy Off the Bench and hes only scratching the surface of his potential yeah I spoke to their staff quite a bit about him and they just former Brewster Academy Stars just the next one in line theres been so many and hes just another freshman coming through he fits the coach H bill that 68 to 69 frame and just athletic and length and Coach ham tells you just learn how to play defense early well figure out the rest young man who was born in a refugee camp in Egypt moved to the US at age two heres Spears core in good position and again omir didnt want to pick up that second foul n he conceded it thats what we talked about hes now theyre in the 221 full court pressure here lot of dribbling by Applause pack Casey missing the flush but theyll get the foul and thats going to be two on BB just SL State just driving Rim running again they know Amir has one foul and it doesnt wasnt pick up that second so theyre going to continue to attack him inside 14 points in the paint for Florida State and thats generally how they play they attack the rim put pressure on you off the bounce when it attack you off the dribble theyve gotten off to a hot start tonight from behind the threepoint line knocking down three threes here early and theyre knocking down threes they are difficult to handle theyve been shooting it well in conference play 38 from three in League Play and thats why I think they theyre sitting at the top of the ACC because theyre going to defend theyre going to defend you for 40 minutes and if they get perimeter shooting the way they attack the paint just makes them a difficult out warley blocked by George oir keeps it in bounds and then gives it up and Spears stepped out of bounds now you think about how close Florida state is to being undefeated in League Play their one loss was to North Carolina in a game in which Florida State blew a 14point second half lead you know the old saying the teams that press dont like to be pressed I thought Carolina pressed them in that game and FSU was uncomfortable and kind of fell behind and had some careless turnovers and it cost him that one that the only loss in the Applause Music ACC pack over the taller Miller battle for the board its omir and hes got two free throws coming nor Chad oir averaged a double double the last three years has a chance to do it again 17 and N entering play I think hes well on his way NRA pack takes that three over to L and thats what you expect too when when the team switch like this if your guard takes that shot you tell youre big you got a point guard on you you dominate him inside and get the rebound and finish now not everybodys point guard is 67 but you still expect your big man to get that offensive Applause rebound Miamis not going to pull much pressure they want to get back in the pack line and kind of stay in the Gap theyre not going to deny much in the perimeter they want to stay in front make you take a loccent a shot Corin with great position and another nice feed from warley and now because of no Chad omir had that first foul hes not hedging he doesnt want to get a foul hedging the ball scream so they turning Corner hitting a Rog up omir stripped and Florida State knows that theyre attacking inside almost daring omir to be aggressive Here Comes Music Jackson cor knocks it away from George and the foul second turn over there for Miami not clearing a rebound just took it away from Applause him rph explained to me how this Florida State team lost to lipsk in its final nonconference game some of it is just theyre not healthy and and and Coach ham wants these guys he wants 12 guys he wants to constantly rotate them and they get their experience guys back they got the experience now before in the past the last couple years weve had guys that would be in the back of the rotation kind of starting and and the way Forida State kind of plays and saying hey you know what our starters will play you we and then 6 through 10 is where were going to make a difference and when you dont have that and theyre not available to you your guys run out of gas trying to play this style of play and I think thats whats hurt in the last couple years Leonard Hamilton also telling us guys have settled into more defined roles youre seeing players like Baba Miller take the next step in their progression even your transfers like guys arent accustomed to to play playing for Flor State I use it as a running a 400 the average person runs the 400 they just want to jog around and Sprint the last 100 he wants you to sprint out the gate and and and its difficult for most athletes to Applause do its like a relay really you Sprints around and thats how he want thats how he wants you to go and but as a player sometimes we always want to save it try to finish strong he doesnt want you to save anything give it all you got Tap Out sub the next guy comes in and does the same thing warley Applause walked W is important to this team because he settled down that point guard position for him now this Florida State team at points this season they werent sharing the ball today and of late theyve been better n assists tonight on 12 made field goals a Wy has a lot to do with that he defends and uses his length and hes first pass pass first point guard George the friendly roll warley has got four assists already W hes playing early as well we talked about the the dep George I think hes the best pro prospect on his Miami roster how about speed the Alchemy to split the defense and thats what we talked about thats what he can do he can get you a bucket and if he finds his role as he gets more comfortable within this lineup I think he can be a guy that coach ham can set up to be a closer Point Cleveland rims out hes still without a point still without a basket sometimes you think so much you kind of you tend to overthink it Music Spears just comes off the ball SC great split there getting in finishing with a nice Lefty leg got a good ball game here in cor GBL seminal up eight the interaction with everybody here the

germs without an overpowering smell Now isnt that refreshing Florida State on the season second in the ACC in Steels they are number one in turnovers forced per game tonight five Steels theyre playing at a Tempo which they can sustain for 40 minutes I dont know if Miamis got the depth to do it yeah I dont know if Miami wants to try to do that but this is what Florida state does they force you into it and lets see if n will packing these guys they got multiple handlers so theyre capable of doing so but sometimes that requires you Miami likes to score in transition as well Applause so the official there Brett Hampton got tied up with the photographer Applause Music that was some pretty good balance by Hampton yeah I would have went down I saw him setting it balancing himself on one leg Music Applause there what up go screen here D he up into a ball screen green of three and the tip in by gainy the brown transfer who was a twotime ivy league defensive player of the year hes not quite healthy yet you can see him kind of favoring and if anyone had an ACL you can tell by the brace physically hes fine and just take some adjustments mentally Joseph over Miller omir on cleanup Applause Duty I think thats the match upir has to dominate the switch when these guards switch as they switch five and the guards get on him he has to dominate the offensive GL Watkins underneath they continue to challenge omir numbers for Miami pack the head of the snake and miscommunication wanted Cleveland six turnovers for the GES yeah I thought pack had him early you see Matthew turn on the Jets coming across half court he had to angle if he gave it to him early I think we had a highlight reil Applause coming Matthew Cleveland needed a play like that kind of to get get going in this game he was 0 for two and sprinted out on a break right there point guard get didnt get it to him and a tie up down low omir and gainy if its on omir its his second its a lot of Music Applause mass trying to direct traffic they want both teams to go to their benches Applause Music yeah I dont think its a foul on omir I didnt I didnt see anything to think Amir should get a foul at Driscoll Lamar Simpson Brent Hampton will sort this out yeah I mean thats definitely an offensive file there on green he you see the two big guys in it was green who got in there yeah you cant lean like that he kept moving now they could have called the hold earlier but thats definitely an offensive foul on green so its just a matter which foul they call First oh given how this game ended a year ago so much obviously being made about Matthew Cleveland coming back and making his return against his old team but you know both sides downplayed Leonard Hamilton telling us this is a business trip Jim Lenas message to Matthew Cleveland dont get distracted Cleveland has not really made an impact so far no points no rebounds no assists and the foul yes went on omir yes thats a big foul there and obviously hes coming out of the game now coach El cant be happy with that call but its like we talked about it he tried to play tenative soon as he got that first foul early he got tenative gave up some some finishes in a paint he normally wouldnt give up and then he gets one fighting for position and now he has to sit the Freshman from Toronto 610 Michael Nook into the game for the first Music time he had not played in the last few games warley challenging him right away and able to get the deuce difficult spot for noo to be in the pace of this game and hes got a hand it on the perimeter Cleveland looking for that first basket there it is first time hes touched it he was just decisive just got it no hesitation at all attack the paint elevated got to his spot and finish warley the lob gy the Applause flush gainy is dunking everything around the rim youve got to get in front of him early 26 of Florida States 38 points in the painted area and Joseph fouled on the drive just a great drive there didnt hesitate woy comes down draws the help nobody over there to rotate gy just flushes it second foul on warley foul trouble not as much of concern for Leonard Hamilton never as it is for Jim Lena Primo Spears into the game warley though gave this team some nice minutes couple of points and five assists and I think you can see even with the Baseline out of bounds they theyre concerned with flota States LM aoko blocked from behind by G yeah the inexperience showed that should have been an easy two yeah he got to go up stronger in a and at length NAU Pac comes in you notice the Baseline out of bounds he gets in a paint hes going to get there all he wants I think nigu needs to start looking to finish that too you see the Baseline out of bounds nigu pack is not even in your screen hes all the way on the other end of the Court theyre concerned about Florida States in that Baseline out of bounds trap they throw the touchdown now were going to get the play in it yeah they dont have much time shot clock down to two pack oain rainbow itsit the front rim and it comes back to gaining sometimes as a point guard you dont want that screen its 5 Seconds just let me go Watkins the VCU transfer rebounded noo yeah I think Niger needs to get more Niger pack right here needs to get more aggressive I like his match up against gy give it back to him and let him go oneonone get in the paint dont settle for a jump shot here over to Joseph sets another rebound by gainy Applause Music Watkins only two points one of four make it two of five and four points and Jim Lena wants a timeout Florida State extends to its biggest lead of the game the seminal undefeated in the New Year up a dozen at Coral Gables the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I walk in theyre

has won 25 of its last 27 on this home court now the other loss besides Louisville was to Florida State last February yeah Miami has put so much pressure on him and been dominant here in their home court they got four guys shooting over 40 from three on this team and theyre struggling for two of 11 the length of Florida State their ability to switch everything is just bothering right Music now pack midair pass comes back to popler against Corin shot clock at two Poler has it taken away the L is bothering these guys on the perimeter Cleveland went for the steel nickelberry offensive foul I think Knight are packing these guards they got to get to the rim theyre settling theyre trying to Nigro pack in general wants to create space and back up the shooters three youre never going to get that off on the length as you see the rotation there comes over its the right call Josh nickelberry made his mind up there he was going to force some contact and melberry a 50the senior started in the a CC at Louisville spent the last couple of Seasons as a double digit score with Applause Lal Cleveland wants it popper from the corner even in wco there you need him he needs to get that offensive glass there if hes you know on the perimeter hes doing a DH stuff dribble handing off to the guards but he ran in there got to get that offensive rebound Spears created space toppler flies for the

Leagues biggest teams the games brightest stars NBA Wednesday on ABC Home of the NBA final Florida state has so many interchangeable parts but I dont think theres anyone that can do what jayen Wy does for this group his penetration his creativity he defends at a high level but hes so unselfish the ball moves and when the ball moves for this team and everyone touches their dangerous Music team he played well over the weekend that noted aim 10 points couple of blocks three assists to steal now the numbers for a lot of the Florida State players arent going to pop off the page their minutes are down but warley there was a time this year when Primo Spears was eligible you wondered are his minutes going to be limited the rest of the way hes figured out his role no I think he has and like I said hes so unselfish in his size at a 67 point guard thats just a hard matchup so he he post you up create match up when this team struggles to score thats one of their options that they go to and now Primo Spears is eligible he brings a scoring punch were watching this team Peak at the right time and just get healthier and it just scared stears thats what he can do and a two shot foul coming for the Georgetown transfer by way of Duane Saturday a triple header on accn Rand tilis will be in Tallahassee for Clemson and Florida State Clemson falling last night in double overtime to Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets take on Virginia how about Georgia Tech young team watching The Freshman point guard Nathan George hit that big shot at the end of regulation made big plays in overtime Damon starder has to be ecstatic over his freshman in Dongo and George those two freshman are just from a big and a point guard are as connected as any point guard big combination in the Music ACC pit and Duke the third game of that triple header pit coming off a loss to Syracuse last night coach ham invited me to take the plane up with those guys but Im afraid Im my trip will be messed up from there and Ill lose my flight so and your frequent fly miles yeah thats true too man dont forget about that Cleveland and the rebound by Watkins Spears quickly the other way ahead of George wild shot out of bounds it stays with Florida State coach ham is okay with that shot because he wants that pace he wants to get it out and and this game in the first half has been played at the Pace Florida State once you see n Pak hes leaned over there I wonder if you know with him rolling his ankles and his inability to practice a bunch of like whats his conditioning going to be like hes missed a couple of games this year poer Miss missed a couple of games Watkins down the lane pour him to Applause finish this is a dangerous moment of the game this last 2 minutes 25 seconds for Miami its they dont know where their offense is going to come from omir is such a big part of their identity on both ends of the floor popper no good Miami has got more than four minutes since its last point blob inside no woko The Intercept George was not aware of the outlet now its Watkins wide open Miller on the offensive glass Cleveland comes up with it heres Cleveland ahead of the pack all the way off balance it spins out aoko the putb and the foul Miami needed that play noo needed that play to settled his nerves a little bit great job by the a big guy running the floor cleaning up the Music glass and boy did Miami need that basket a timeout by Leonard Hamilton will take one two 150 left in this opening half Florida state with a double digit the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I walk in theyre always glad to see me everyone that touches that vehicle they take pride in being here for the brand we hold ourselves to you know very very high standard I think this is a Premier Place the way they attend to the customers is second to nine our customers are experience were like family here the dealership so when we sell you a car were not just selling you a car your family at the end of the day its a quad three loss 150 to go in this opening half Florida state has shot it well this is a team thats playing with some confidence you can see it you can feel it theyve won four in a row here in the New Year all conference games theyre just a game behind North Carolina for the ACCC lead nobody saw that coming when right before the calendar flipped to 2024 this team lost at home to lipam you didnt see it but again its been cuz he felt like the same theme coming into this year the last couple years they werent healthy they didnt have their full complimented roster players and and in order for Coach ham to play the style that he wants to play he needs everybody and theyve gotten healthy theyve got the experience Primo getting his eligibility getting his waiver and youre watching this team Ascend to the top of the Music Applause AC Watkins leaves it short another rebound for Applause noo youve got to attack the REM if your Miami you cant just sit outside the threepoint line he almost to back Fort violation saved by Pat T to shoot hler puts it on the floor and a foul on gaining on the drive and I think what Miami needs to do is you need to drive to get FL to state in rotation youre not driving to score because theyre collapsing the length is there drive get them in rotation and just one more pass and you get thats when your threes you start going down and that has been a staple of Miamis offense All Season not tonight yes no the length the length is bothering those guys and theyre backing up and theyre not accustomed to guys that is length B and it just fresh you that we looking at nin packing these guys theyre not coming out of the game and you look up and the fresh bodys on you and it just wears on you all the time and you start to see that you get under eight under four in that second half Florida State rolling out fresh bodies and again they want to play this tempo for the duration setting the hard screen calling for it on the inside gets it and we get a foul on Cleveland who went for the block from behind and two shots coming for Jaylen gainy the middle ball screen is giving Miami a ton of trouble theyre getting in a lane and Matthew cles do come over to block that shot and contest it theres a wide open Corner three there got to keep the ball out of the middle of the floor in the paint how do you do that well I think one thing they got to switch up their ball screen defense you can tell they scheme theyre expecting you to head that mle screen and theyre rolling hard and I think maybe even play in drop coverage just leave the big off youre not worried about gy beating you from Perimeter so you stay big on big let your guard Chase over the screen and force this Florida State team into some pull up midrange jump shots but youre big on big and then youre able to rebound the ball D missed them both this crowd with a little juice student section packed tonight rivalry game in po Gables 9 second meeting all time George driving on Danny hes going to be a good one he is so talented freshman with that the Julius Irving throw Im loving it showing you how he can elevating get to the basket and finish down to six Spears and thats what he can do end of a shot clock end of the half we saw it at the end of the game against Notre D yeah its another middle ball screen there too he comes off that middle screen and they rolling gy on the back side theyre going to theyre going to continue to run that action until Miami makes an adjustment theyre getting whatever they want final ticks first half toppler long distance Pat chases it down puts it up and the first half comes to an end Florida State led by as many as 15 they take go by it at time they have to fear you going by him and they just backing up and when you back up youre just helping their length affect your shot thats something the reason I think Nigel pack and Joseph have struggled from behind the threepoint line omir with a nice pass but popper could not finish and Florida State looking to push Miller using the window wow that is scary that size and athleticism to come down of trailing and he didnt just he took Matthew Cleveland to the basket on that drive theres P driving thats what he needs to do and he gets inside against Baba Miller thats what he needs to do get to the paint put your feet in that no that charge Zone and and then he can pass the teammates Force rotation often as pack goes so do the canes and theyre four losses 7 and2 points per game 29 from the field for Nigel PAC green denied at The Rim last Touch by Joseph Miami seems to be a little bit active on the defensive end of the floor here but pack just comes down and attacks the Baba Miller there at the rim and nice Lefty finish there but he needs to do more of that he doesnt need to settle shoot three 25 ft get in the paint get down heel and then thatll open up his threepoint shot Florida state only three of 11 from three in the opening half warley W inside Deontay green six assists for Jaylen warley wow look at that find I mean a r round pass Applause there just really in control of his game and his ability to switch and defend bigger guys inside thats why hes so valuable to this team and the pressure by the nlls forcing another turnover I mean just getting the paint finding knowing his teammates great job sealing there by green and this team is going to continue to attack the pink and they get off and start knocking out threes and just look Applause out Miamis got nine turnovers Florida state had seven steals in the first half they lead the ACC in that category and they wanted the best theyre well on their way to their season average with nine in the first half me s in the first half warley almost Applause Music traveled Watkins driving on omir the up and under and the put back by Deontay green hes got 10 points you get 10 from Green you get 11 from cam corn those are bonus points for Florida State and look how theyre getting them theyre theyre punishing the switching and this is where their size is a Applause problem pack hesitated now pulls the trigger it doesnt go batted around to warley a basket here and Florida State takes its largest lead of the game there just no resistance at The Rim Miller the runner follows his Miss and he is Applause fouled we talked about Miamis ability to attack you off the bouns Florida state possesses the same attributes I mean all five of these guys on the floor can can chat fake get to the rim and finish finish as well as as shoot as shoot from the threepoint line and wary is his size he doesnt have to but hes a 6 seven point guard so he he can post up your point guard thats always been the classic big guard that Leonard Hamilton likes yes he loves the big guards that can defend and but you see warley posting up there trying to get the put the ball inside shot clock down to seven Watkins turbines Green from the outside not close and they get Matthew Cleveland going facing his former team just two points one of five almost a Applause Music turnover and omir might be Applause hurt yeah training staffs coming Applause over says hes okay I think he took a shot on that loose ball thats an experienced player who is a walking double Applause Applause double didnt do anything there just hard to tell yeah maybe happened to a possession before or hes grabbing his ribs Clevelands three not there hes now one for six offensive rebound to wo and its taken away second time tonight woko was kind through that Aon pass in the threepoint line hes just slow now hes not used to playing hes a lot of minutes and hes forced to theyre going to attack the paint with the freshman in there and its Watkins for two time out Miami me Florida state has its largest lead of the game 53 37 noes on a 60 run the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I walk in theyre always glad to see me everyone that touches that vehicle

theyre excited for ACC womens basketball double header Sunday featuring three top 25 teams Duke at number four NC State number 13 Louisville goes to Chapel Hill tar Hills in the top 25 and then Sunday we have our next gymnastics meet right here on accn H Pittsburgh visiting number 19 Music Clemson well this Miami team ran off one of the best in the country from three better than 40 and not today theyve missed their last 10 from Deep they have and thats just the length of Florida State as well theyre switching theres nothing easy because its difficult to put them in rotation because they dont theyre not getting in rotation one is because Miami is not attacking the rim the force rotation they settled for some of those threes and I think thats why theyre shooting so poorly Matthew Cleveland only two points tonight one for six from the field and Nigel pack whos got the ball combined for 40 on Saturday and the win against Virginia Tech I think Nigel pack needs to pick his match up on the switch and get to the rim just like that wga popler with a chance at a threepoint play thats what you need to do you struggling from behind the line just turn the corner there get down get deep get put pressure on the paint get in the throw rotation if not just finish is athletic enough to get up there and dunk that as well so the length of Florida state will not bother him at the paint he needs to do this more his team needs it now these two teams played twice a season ago in Tallahassee Miami handed Florida State the seminal worst home loss in conference play since 2005 and then in Coral Gables Miami romed out to a big halftime lead led by as many as 25 in the second half before Florida State put together the biggest comeback in the history of the ACC and Matthew Cleveland capped it with a buzzer beater for Florida State now hes a Miami Hurricane and they try to downplay this hey its not a big deal Florida State said were more worried about the other four guys and this is a business trip and we talked to Cleveland he didnt betray a whole lot of emotion guys averaging 21 a game over his last four today two points on one of six Im not buying it Im not buying it get out of here with that both of them both sides it sounds cute its the right thing to say right but youre not buying it Matthew Cleveland wanted to come out here and drop 40 and I no this Florida State team wanted to shut him down as well right now Florida State to have an Applause advantage now the other thing you got to worry about if youre Miami Jim Lena said in the second meeting last year Florida States constant pressure wore down Miami they were gassed after halftime the first 20 minutes pace of play heavily favored Florida State they pressed they were active we know Miami right can play Fast theyre just not as deep well doesnt need to speed up because even this lineup on the FL they got multiple handlers I mean Joseph is a point guard and and paa can handle the rock as well so they got multiple decision makers they just need to settle down and I G stop settling and just attack the paint now easier said than done with this kind of defensive intensity youre up against just keep your spacing youre still a threat you got multiple guys like I said they got four guys out out there right now shooting over 40 from the threepoint line theres no reason to Applause settle Miami now two for 17 from Applause three the shots not falling for the Hurricanes Florida State in control here at the watsco the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I

folks m a cat hey you got to watch this Im watching oh oh Im watching you might be me me now on Sports Center another wild Night Watch Me watch me do Music Music this theres a lot at stake tonight for Miami a loss tonight would qualify for the moment as a quad three loss Florida State with a chance to pick up a quad one win and we can get in net rankings oh God some of it is skewed it doesnt make a whole lot of sense at times but the reality is the one thing you can kind of pick out and and people may not like this but if you schedule Pat season nonconference at home and you blow them out and you do it collectively as a league you boost your Leagues net ranking yeah now the net rankings of your team team within League Play can Shuffle but your Leagues net ranking holds so youre probably going to have the amount of teams to get into the tournament that you would when you started conference play the ACC with some scars and again you got a team like Florida state which had some ugly losses in nonconference including lipam different team now playing better it shouldnt count as a quad three loss but it will Joseph blocked and we get a f foul by Watkins and a goal T yeah no foul so itll be a go I thought he timed it well n it was close Miami now intensity theyre trying to make a run here to and with them it starts on the defensive end as well theyre challenging shots here at the rim and they have to do a better job of keeping the ball out of the paint they just allowed it its just gotten there too easy for Florida State and it feels like throw the stadi is up by lar margin than nine points and they feel like theyve dominated this game and this team is couple of possessions away Miami is one threepoint barrage away from being right back in this they go to the ball screen again good defense leads to a turnover Cleveland poked Away by B Bowen how about the Hustle by the freshman and I think they teed up Jim Lena he did coel thought it was a foul there doesnt think hes got a fair Shake of the whistle tonight hes been on him pretty hard today hes on a side line I hope thats not a if its a technical it must be for something he said because hes not out of line there hes right within the coachs box Brett Hampton was the official who called Len AGA for a technical and it looked like Len AA was trying to get out of the way yeah he he was within the heres one more look hey see Lenas trying to get out of the way makes contact yeah he said its because they bumped into each other I thought he was are you not allowed to stand up hes Applause wow oh we saw some interesting technical fouls called last night too yeah yeah that one there is I dont know what you expect your head a head coach to do now the Miami bench was looking over as if to say where do you want us to go yeah I I dont know what to say hes either that or sit in the coachs lap one of his players lap I dont know where coach hes found a seat now but I dont think hes going to sit there long popper picks up the Music foul Miamis trying right now they picked up their defensive intensity and have the issue becomes you dont have the depth to sustain it but they come up with the steel Joseph Spears trailing him and benley Joseph with two shots coming in the ACC and Steels I got to figure it out coach H saw what Kevin ke did last night how the game flipped down double digits he got a tech so he said you know what Im going to get it Tech Fire my guys up so we can get back in this game Im sure thats what he was thinking well part two of that equation is the Phantom technical as well hes got to get one more get thrown out though he he he probably dont want to throw get thrown out but hes hes going back over and have a seat second foul on Spears Joseph an 85 free throw shooter he has taken over really as the point guard this year it allows Nigel pack to play more off ball and what it really gives Jim Lona is luxury of having two Adept ball handers two Elite ball handers in his back court and hes also a really good on ball Defender as you see him now picking up Spears P PT and turning him hes a really good on really good Defender Watkins down the lane and hits the shot in tra we havt talked about Watkins much for God is leading his team in scoring rebound and assist and steals but thats just how talented this team is Joseph amongst the trees and stays with Miami Watkins just turns the corner here and accelerate picks his dribble up long strides and just elevates being an Applause athlete hes been Florida States leading scorer 13 a game helped VCU to the NCAA tournament last year a game that feels closer than it should yeah this is where air has has to dominate because Spears is a smaller guard Joseph swivel in and Spears was on air and he was so worried about boxing him out he never came over to rotate and continue to run that ball screen and switch with him and attack the paint Spears out of control another steal by Joseph gives it right Applause up Florida State now into its offense Watkins the lob for Corin br broken play and the NES take advantage its a big play there a chance to get it to six you had numbers if you dont turn it over and just a just sped up a little bit and thats what Florida state does to you they just speed you up make you play a little faster than you used to and you make mistakes like that youre not going to throw blobs over top of those guys on the post Here Comes B Bowen leading the break looking for help looked like he shered his feet no call they looking to put n pack in the post T to shoot Taylor B Bowen rebound omir just run another ball screen with air and get the switch pack along three its good the lid is off off the rim for him now hes got one they come in bunches lets see if he continues to shoot from outside forette in the Rings warley has sheld the threepoint shot this season Miami plays to The Scouting Report the lob broken up here comes poet ahead to Joseph gets the roll its a twopossession Applause game Miami can also turn defense into offense does a great job there great turnovers quick shots one of the best transition teams in America the pendulum is swung Watkins over to warley hes got to put it up over omir and Miami can make this a onep possession game they trailed by as many as 16 long three Applause good we say the threepoint line comes in bunches you got to get to him and Nigel pack is such a deadly shooter hes starting to find his range he struggling with the length early picking his match up there picking on the Freshman lines him up and that one he shoots it from the parking lot got ourselves a game here now come back and join me the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I walk in theyre always glad to

spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on Applause ESP feels a little like a reverse mirror of last season Florida State in this game led by 16 whats changed I think Miami since the technical foul theyve ramped up their intensity on the defensive end themselves and got turnovers got out the fast break got some uncontested layups and then Nigel pack is knocked in two bombs getting himself going and now we we got ourselves a ball game last year in this building late February Florida State rallied from 25 down in the second half largest comeback win in ACC history Cleveland with a game winner in that game for Florida State went for the steel Watkins directing traffic working on omir through the contact and the nolles needed that one three on omir great drive there knew he had omir on him and I him had his strong hand and just gets in the paint Cuts him off cuts the angle off and air has no choice but to go through his body here he gets there plays off two feet takes the contact its a great drive and a great finish youve been in this spot as a player as a coach Road team they got a big lead the home team comes back how do you arrest some of that momentum back to your side well you go back to whats got you here and your gu you notice on this possession they went to Watkins who has led this team in so many categories its like hey were in a big moment we need a bucket get him the ball he isos and makes a Applause play omir wanted it heres Cleveland George wide open and he knocks down the three seven straights made baskets for Miami so now what we talking about before attacking the rim now your forcing florid to State the rotation youre making it one more finding your Shooters thats the way Miamis basketball thats the way they want to play Spears from 15 and the canes with a chance to tie they can take their first lead on a three Cleveland that does not go Miami had made its previous four threepoint attempts I think Miami likes the match ups as well Watkins denied by omir they let them play now Baba Miller lets it Fly and Baba Miller with the three he releases it so high he you cant bother his shot P at the other end Greens been quiet knocked down a couple of early threes Spears spinning inside the tip by Miller tipped back green comes up short Cleveland gathers omir urging his team to get down Court he wanted it he knew he had green on him he had the mismatch he wanted to wanted the ball before gy came down the court Joseph now Miami spent a lot of energy to get back in this game lets see if they can sa it sustain it this is what we talked about about running out of energy Florida States going to be be able to sub here theyre going to bring bodies in this is where their six through 10th affects the game theyve got hockey line changes on their bench Here Comes George leaves it for omir and the chance of two free throws for nor Chad omir you can get this team in Florida State in transition because they guard rebound the basketball they go to the offensive end so if you can rebound you can get numbers here SC foul by B Miller there dont want to give up the Applause layup Miller tried to take responsibility for the foul they gave it to gaining his Applause second and now reinforcements for Florida State warley Corin B Bowen yeah they they they come in waves and not many teams can play this way but this is been a staple here at Florida State pack getting a breather for Miami now Mir is get traditional big hes shooting 80 from the free throw line and but I think its fatigue I think you know the fatigue of playing so much and playing so hard I mean he has to and their ball screen coverage he has to hedge he has to recover and hes down there battling amongst the trees he spends a lot of Applause energy hes six of his last 15 from the stripe and Florida state has built its cushion back up its now seven Spears with another basket hes got 13 yeah getting to that midrange going in that right hand is a strength of his and you let him get through his spots and he can score it clavels been quiet today against his old team that doesnt go hes now one for eight yeah sometimes you can psych yourself out you want it so bad you you rush in a little bit and You Hope by now he can settle in but hes got nothing easy you know thats where he needs his teammates to help him get some easy basket to get going to have have an impact on this game on the offensive Applause end Primo Spears the pull up rebound by omir Seven Points 11 rebounds for nor shadow Applause popper picked up by Corin Florida state will switch one through five it doesnt matter Joseph lost it regains it omir cant get the basket but has two shots coming Joseph almost lost that and gathered himself and was able to find air and draw the foul Miamis fought back in it got a CL one here come back and join us on the other side the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I

brighter par 3000 career points come on Cameron Frank Deja Kelly oh that was pretty aore magic some ruined Tonight Theres No Stopping Us Now this is just spectacular thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and ABC Anish R Randolph childr Florida state with a sevenpoint lead on Miami and our broadcast position is right next to the Florida state bench we get screened from time to time Time by Leonard Hamilton but we can also hear what he says and every time Florida State slows down he is imploring his team no go quickly go fast push Pace Pace he wants to continue to pace and he knows if it slows down youre allowing this Miami team to catch his breath they made a run he understands they slowed down a little bit theyre trying to sneak some rest for their guys he wants his guys to continue this pace and they did so trying to extend this lead again for both teams what are these fin eight minutes come down too I think for Miami its going to be continue to put pressure on the rim and try to get floto state in rotation I think theyve been it thats where their threes have been the most effective when they try to just shoot against their length and step back they struggle and it continue to defend theyve turned it up in on the defensive end of the floow and got transition layups themselves so both teams got to just stick to their identity and thats Florida State we talked about theyre not going to change theyre going to continue to play that way and this actually extended break here with the officials is given Miami a chance to recover yeah this is a free timeout and were trying to figure out what the discussion is at the scores table they didnt let us know anything that happen Music so so they changed the foul now that was it originally it was given to gainy it you made the point and Baba Miller too volunteered I volunteer his tribute and they changed the foul on Miller so gayy only has one foul and Baba Miller picks up his second its just bookkeeping and NORAD omir is at the free throw Music line omir today is now three points away from his eighth double double of the season and the 59th of his career and the Hurricanes since omir joined the team prior to last year 21 two when he gets a double double hes going to have to earn it tonight because he is in there battling amongst the trees got himself in some foul trouble early was a little tentative and a little more confident right now trying to get back in this game on the offensive end of the floor Watkins picked up by omir Miller the height advantage on Cleveland back door warley and one its a great cut by warley and we talked about it he he does just stretch it from threepoint line but hes a guard that attacks the rim goes to the offensive glass and great job here back doing The Freshman George and get the n one here you talked about in the open the different ways Baba Miller can impact the game you saw another example I mean he does everything well many he block shots hes versatile on the defensive end of the floor can guard all five positions when you dont have a dominant post and even when you do a physical post he uses his length on the offensive end hes more comfortable now shooting threes big offensive rebound for Music Applause Music Watkins orleys got six Music assists shot clock winding down Corin puts it up cam Corin seven for seven from the field hes got 16 points they were trying to get him to post up on Joseph he had to Advantage inside they couldnt get it to him and when Watkins drove Baseline he just popped up shot the 15t Applause jumper George got Spears in the air gets separation his fires omir on the put back you couldnt see him from from our angle you just saw this big claw just snatched the rebound to finish on the other side big guy carving out space now there what he maybe gives up in height against Florida State he makes up for and gir thats going to be over the back on Miller his Music Music third one thing to keep uh mindful eye of too is free throw shooting for these teams you know if this is a close game down the wire I mean Miami is the best free throw shooting team in the the ACC and FL States the worst so its just something to keep an eye on the NOS though have been better from the line in conference play pack from Deep his third three hes got 15 we said it threes coming waves he struggled early and its knocking him down now Miller wow follows his miss the Myan again starting to show signs of all the potential thats been talked about for almost two years now yeah the game is slowing down for him and took an offb balance shot there but when he rebounded he kept it high and there just theres no shot blockers there theres nothing they can do and I said that even when he shoots his jump shot they cant block it just a great job there he drove it avoided the charge got it on the glass just kept it high you know for this Miami officials back at the monitor now with this Primo Spears on the court now and the back court with hit warley it allows nigu Pac to kind of mat thats his match up on a smaller Defender its a clock and a timer issue the clock Music stopped you see there it stops at 19 Music seconds you dont have to worry about that the clock issue one stop in that layup Miller tonight seven points seven rebound rebounds you look what hes done in these last three games against Notre Dame over the weekend had three blocks and nine rebounds game prior against Wake Forest a big win for Florida State careerhigh 14 points against Virginia Tech 8 points 10 rebounds five assists three steals hes impacting the game in different ways maybe he came here as a highly touted flashy Superstar he he may not be that that type of player that type of scorer but hes able again to impact this Florida State basketball team in a multitude of ways I think hes indicative of of the young kids in general they want to come in and impact the game offensively and as talented as he is he wasnt ready for that at this level but what he could do and what coach ham has gotten him to do is impact it in other ways passing defending rebounding hes doing all the other things and then the scoring just comes and what you learn is you cant dig dictate what the defense is and for Florida State the ball just finds you your job is to move cut let the ball find you theyre not giving one guy the ball to take 15 to 20 shots weve had a couple of stoppages by the officials and these are free timeouts for a Miami team run six usually seven deep at the most I know coach ham cant be happy about that I I know he wants to face going and hes been harping on it all game long but we are in Coral Gable tonight Im not insinuating anything but Laughter we theres a wire someone could pull wow pack is starting to feel it a game high 17 there is no wasted Motion in his shot I I Im telling you its as quick as there is in the country and I can watch him shoot jump shots all day long Watkins defended by popper now warley they back off warley only attempted one three on the season Spears using the gainy screen Miami making Florida State work Miller that hits the side of the backboard Here Comes pack popper draws the Applause attention good recovery by the nolles Joseph underneath ohir the flush its a great pass and great find there I thought Baba Miller got away with one too stuck his hand in there but omir just powered through it and finished and a foul as Spears makes his move to the rim Joseph just drives there and keeps himself under control nice drop off and you see the hand in the back there P didnt see Music it thir foul on pack and Florida State in the bonus itll be a one and one for Primo Spears you mentioned Florida state is a team not a great free throw shooting team Primo Spears is a very good free throw shooter he is and if you notice when the shot clock gets low theyre trying to find him and as we talked before he can be that closer that guy to get the ball to and go make a play for you off the bounce you know every team needs a guy like that you got to be able to put a ball in a in a guards hands and he going to make a play for you and pack does that Miami has a few guys with ruga and Joseph but this Florida State team doesnt have a lot of guys like that and we get a foul on Miami it is on omir and that is number four Im the big guy and thats and thats the second offensive rebound on the free throw that theyve gotten Music I think some of this stuff is fatigue with him you know hes hedging ball screens hes recovering hes battling amongst the trees and he plays so hard his motor run so high and wheny when big guys fatigue like that they get to using their arms more than moving their feet and and nothing against Soko The Freshman who we saw come in to spell omir earlier but the drop off is significant when you go from a guy who basically is a walking double double to a freshman whos played sparingly All Season that would happen with any any team in the country outside of Duke with their freshman but takes five stars to to be able to handle that and no chatt is an all ACC caliber player and there just not many big guys like that de behind those caliber guys nital pack almost turned it over here comes popper working around Spears and will get Spears on the reaching his Music third theyre not settling anymore in the perimeter theyre starting to just drive the ball down and and if youre Miami youre okay with making this a free throw shooting contest Nigel pack favoring his ankle that has been problematic yeah of late missed a couple of games with the injury he tweaked it against Wake Forest seemed to tweak it last Wednesday against Louisville and hell come to the bench in favor of the Freshman Kean George hes been the best player in this second half with 13 points since halftime he has and hes shooting it well and the game is you know hes found some space hes been able to create some space and found his range and just for long term you dont have a deep bench in general you need your guys healthy and thats the thing with spraying ankles it just linger he rolled it and he keeps rolling it and its its not allowing him to be 100 now we asked Jim Lona and his response was hes okay when we posed him the question about Packs Health out of bounds off Miami so missed opportunity at the free throw line on the one and one and Florida State now can extend the seminal have not trailed in this game they led by as many as 16 in this app Miami cut it to two on a couple of occasions gaining and well get a foul benley Joseph trying to plead his case itll be his first Applause Music foul immediate timeout 4 minutes left in regulation Florida State looking to go to 5 one in conference Miami looking to pull off a comeback

college hoops on ESPN and ABC the Music Florida state has dominated this series of late having won 11 of the last 12 Matthew Cleveland played on the other side of this rivalry the last few years well today first game against his old team two points one for eight we know how good he could be in crunch time the game winner against against Miami last year gamewinning three against Virginia as a freshman hes been a nonfactor he has and had been playing so well coming into tonight averaging 20 points in the last four games that they played and I think the anxiety and the pressure of wanting to play great just got off to a slow start and just hadnt found any rhythm tonight for him this will be the easier one of the two itll be lets say noisy when Miami goes to Tallahasse yeah a little more friendlier here two possession game Joseph goes inside to omir and theyre going to get warley on the reaching his third even though youre 67 youre a 67 point guard you dont want to switch on the NORAD mirror I mean you dont want to be behind those shoulders and a post as a guard theres not much you can do but call for help that time W he tried to reach around and grabb his arm itll be a one and one and these are Big free throws for omir whos been struggling now for a couple of games at the free throw Applause Music line not much hesitation on that one looked good coming out of his hand and thought he was a little tentative early Applause Music Applause but gets Applause both coach Els asking his guys he wanted some full C pressure there after the free throw and not all of his guys Hur Applause him Spears against pack lets see Spears o Watkins here the ball in their hands and go make a play for you remember pack had to come out after favoring an ankle Spears Falling Away tipped up and the rebound to omir 15 points 13 rebounds for omir Joseph the drive turns it over so thats a thats a play Baba Miller that doesnt show up on his stats he comes over Joseph thinks hes going to block the shot and he doesnt anticipates the pass and creates a steal its a heck of a play there just showing you with the high Q of hey attempting to fake the block Applause shot Watkins in the paint its good great recognition there coming off the Baseline Runner tight curl with his size and athletic ability getting right there at the Music rim Miami uses a timeout one left its still a twopossession game game 233 to go here in the second half man just great job just curling the screen just far enough out where you cant help off the top and you definitely cant help up with that length theyll throw a lob theyve ran that a couple of times here late probably got to cut that screen a little bit and force them to shoot a three in the corner weve got a triple header on the ACC Network this Saturday it starts with Clemson going to Tallahasse Tigers coming off a double overtime loss to Georgia Tech last night Yellow Jackets home for Virginia thats a young Georgia Tech team that had been in a lot of these games they finally were able to close out an opponent last night they did and Virginias young I mean we dont we dont think of them that way but that Virginia teams young and and they need to take a step and and grow as we really get to the guts of the ACC season you look at free throws Florida State amongst the worst of the nation again theyve been better in conference play only five games and Miami amongst the very best in the nation and on this floor Miami has won 25 of its last 27 games but they did lose here last Wednesday to Louisville and Florida State last February packed bad ankle at all with 19 that release is so quick you have got to be up on that screen as a big or he gets it off so quick Watkins with the Applause hammer wow I almost fell out of my chair when I saw that trying to look back and get the Applause angle thats what this is how you break a press no shot Music blocker n Chad omir Im not throwing a l Im putting this on your head wow and Florida State got a warning after that last dunk packs three is not there omir another rebound and hell go back to the free throw line his 11th and 12th free throw attempts coming thats catching a body yeah thats one of those ones you got to make a business decision youre standing there flat footed hes getting a running start you might want to Olay that one next time no Im kidding I always admire the the the effort to block those shots now youre going to end up on Sports Center either as a bystander or a victim winning winning comes at a price it comes at a price and you got to make effort plays like that when you want to win a game like this trying to this game is getting down to two possession game and blocking that dunk saves your possession omir missed them both seven of 12 at the strike tonight he was three of his last nine from the stripe in his prior two games and gainy got three down low and Florida State are with a chance to extend its lead Miami sold out on the Press there trying to get a Ste left gain the under the basket unguarded and nothing Joseph could do butt foul Applause now Florida States going to go to their offensive defensive Applause package cam corn getting ready to check in the sophomore from Allen Texas Coach Jones tells him dont let oir push you underneath the basket I think its a lot easier said than done thats an NFL tight end yeah popper lets it Fly rebound Spears oh we come up on 90 seconds to play now were here now for Florida State its you need to you need to take this under 10 and look forward to getting Spears and Primos hand and under 8 seconds and let him go make a play this is what his role is on this team right now spear splits the D and is fouled on the way up thats why he was brought in yes he hes such a perfect fit for this team because hes the guy to do this if you come too early lazy he loves the split hes done it a couple times tonight steps in with the Euro and you afraid of his midrange he has a quick pullup jump shot and this is what hes here for close out game and he needs to prove he can do that he hasnt been that Geor time they werent winning and now hes had to change his game to fit into a team for them to win and he has a very important rooll for this s s back for Music team the lead is nine Corin checks in for gainy and now you got to wonder how much gas is left in the tank for Miami yeah this is they got to go for threes now theyre down nine and try to get some quick ones and pack from the logo and the rebound by warley if they dont foul here now I dont think they theyre going to dribble it out and just play they are not fouling theyre trying to tell them who to foul they want to foul warley would have been the guy at 68 free throw shooter yeah the Miami bch trying to tell them to foul warley and pack steals it away away they need threes popler from Deep short and the rebound to Watkins over to Spears and Miami will not foul a Florida State team that closed out the 2023 calendar year with a home loss to lipam is sitting a top of the ACC right now outside Carina and one in conference play the lone loss was to North Carolina a game in which they had a double digigit halftime lead a double digit second half lead and the seminal get their sixth straight win here in Coral Gables and there might be a second left because there was a small difference between the game clock and the shot clock so they have a second back out there and this is just bookkeeping yeah and just and getting a road win I mean winning on the road no matter what conference you wi is really hard its definitely hard in this league because there are no Bottom Feeders every team is tough at home heck of a win by Florida State Miamis now lost three out of four Florida state gets its 13 send me your ears oh boy were going off the crust again wait till I get warmed up
