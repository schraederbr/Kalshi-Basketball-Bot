and what was an eightpoint loss to Indiana after that last second loss to Texas one week from today Dennis Evans set the tip off with KY eago and the tip is won by the cards and here comes sky Clark he has scored in double figures in all games for the cards so far this season as has Trey white and this kind of the normal starting lineup weve seen seen it changed once but Trey white Scott Clark Mike James Brandon Huntley Hatfield and Dennis Evans Jody who has not done a lot the last couple I want to see I want to see more from Dennis Evans is going to have to as Mike James a shot from the corner he misses that one and Huntley Hatfield tries to get the rebound and does a good job but Carpenter comes down with it by is on you think trying to get him going early uh I do think so I think you got to get Mike James going he struggled a little bit we look at the starting lineup for New Mexico state theyre all new guys but hey guess what everybody on this team is New Kent 15 newcomers for New Mexico state well we do want to see Jordan RS getting a start you may recognize that name he played at Western not once but twice actually um and their best player we are told we will not see him today FEI oal the transfer from pit and seen Hall their leading scorers only been eligible for three games but out with a minor illness we do however expect to see Jaylen Jackson posy uh at some point and we see right there Robert Carpenter whos scored in double figures in five straight games get the first two points of the afternoon yeah Carpenter is a guy who can really score it at 12 and a half points per game he averaged about 18 points at Mississippi Valley State last season so he is a guy on this team that can score it you mention it though an entirely new roster a new coaching staff Jason hooton coming from as the balls thrown out of bance from Sam Houston um after a long long career there its not often that you see that that not one but the entire bench everyone on the bench from coaches and players are new from last year uh and theyve started out three and four against what what I would call uh uh you know some some some decent competition they played a couple of games that are pretty good opening night in R Arena as they were uh beaten by Kentucky a battle for the ball its going to be a jump ball and it will be New Mexico State ball as Dennis Evans and eago fighting for that one uh yeah you their entire obviously they had some off the court issues last year shut down their program um Jason Hoon come after 261 wins in 13 Seasons at Sam Houston State including some postseason appear appearances uh an nit appearance press from Louisville and I think we will see a little bit more of that I think Kenny Payne will see a little bit more aggressive attitude here from uh from the cards today as theyve improved theyve shown the Improvement uh in New York against good competition now playing a lesser competition or one that theyre favored over as Jordan RWS gets that step back one that theyre favored over I think he want to see him I think he wants to force the the action a little bit AG hes out to a quick 4 nothing lead Scott Clark still hasnt hit a three in this building although he shot the ball pretty well in Madison Square Garden yeah he did he was actually uh the the game against um Texas it was like thats what he all he wanted to do was shoot the three and it was going down for him four on the shot clock Hunley hfield is going to have to fire up the Triple and comes off the front of the rim white deflects it and here come the agies again here is Christian cook to rolls Music and Jason hooton is maybe the most active coach were going to see in here because he does not stop on that sideline over there well its not only that but I mean he is were going to get an offensive foul there skot Clark hits the deck and I believe thats going to be on Jaden Harris the First on Harris the first on the team as were going to see Jaylen Jackson posy come in here hes missed the last two games he was uh uh in cussion protocol he is uh averaging 10 and a half 102 points per game and has got 21 assists and four and a half rebounds per game he really is a really really good guard for these guys he mentioned didnt play in the two games in Cancun out in in concussion protocol but Scott Clark gets the screen from Evans and then well get another foul here our officials by the way Lee Castle Bill comington Jr and Tommy morresy this afternoon first foul on Kanga who just checked in at that last timeout along with Jackson posy Caleb Glenn who looked fantastic boy he helped to make the run in the Indiana game and again they he didnt play a ton against Texas but when he got in there in the last minute or so he actually made a positive play for for Louisville and then was really good uh against Indiana in the in the 12 minutes that he played he is active hes physical hes the one guy on this Louisville team I think the physicality is going to be over and back as that was off of Trey Whites foot I feel like he gets in trouble when he starts to dribble the ball when he starts to pound it back to Caleb Glenn hes the one guy on this team for Louisville that brings a physicality that we dont see this Louisville team they need that they need some Spark from him and thats what he gave him in the IU game cards 0 for three from three in their first five possessions with two turnovers so not a great start coming off what was an encouraging trip to New York five on the shot clock for New Mexico state RS is going to have to pull it he drives in the lane and misses and Hunley happy with another rebound something hes been doing consistently all year yeah hes been their best rebounder and he needs to be that he needs to be more assertive on the offensive end he has been in a couple of games as Trey white to the basket hell shoot it and he misses it but hes fouled I like that Trey white there wasnt a whole lot of dribbling there was a dribble and then he decided Im going to the basket and thats when he is at his best right there when hes dribbling a lot he gets himself in trouble as weve seen in the first couple possessions here hes got a turnover already i scoring double figures in all five of the cards games so far this season that foul on Jackson posy his first who I a 72 free throw shooter and hes gotten there quite a bit early in the season this will be his 33rd free throw already and hes able to knock it down thats what he does hes going to have to do that for this team as they get into the ACC play and theyre playing better competition he is a guy who can create hes got a mat hes going to always have a pretty good matchup on him he can take advantage of his size and the way he can handle the ball its just a matter of when he gets stuck in in in the dribbling mode hes just not as effective when he does what he did right there you see Louisville gets two points out of it first two of the game for the cards by the way Christian cook back into the game for New Mexico state as is monzi Jackson a transfer from among other places wi it tell state lot of these guys have have had more than one stop in their college careers heres Jackson posy off the roll to Jackson he goes under the basket and flips it up and in sorry kenanga that was kenanga Cale Glenn a little late coming over to help and thats where the Freshman he going to have to learn on the defensive end hes got to get better of reaction Applause time Jody how quickly you think well see tyar Johnson because I feel like when he was in the game in New York Louisville was better is that fair to say yeah I definitely think so but well take a break well talk about that when we come back New Mexico State out to a quick 62 lead Over Music Louisville a first child can be stressful welcome back to the KFC Im senator on this Sunday afternoon New Mexico state with a 62 lead Over Louisville cards coming off what was two losses but I think an encouraging performance in the Empire classic and really sky Clark and Trey white they both scored in double figures in every game this season jod Kent Taylor and jod demling here and jod they both played well in New York yeah know they really did I mean when you look at Scot Clark he shot the ball so much better from threepoint range he actually he actually made him he did better than he did the first three games here he didnt make one uh but Louisville got to the free throw line we talked about it with with Trey white when he was at the line you see nine of 12 for Clark 10 of 14 for White Mike James hits that one for Louisville and now all three of their points today here from the free throw line when this team is doing what theyre doing best theyre taking the ball to the baset yes theyre a good shooting team we havent seen them shoot it great here in this building yet they will shoot it better but theyre so much more effective when theyre taking it to the basket and James is a guy who as he misses the second free throw he he had been really their goto score in those first three games here double figures including 25 points 10 rebounds in the opener but only scored 10 points in the two games in New York including just two jod against Texas as we get a 10second violation here sky Clark guarding Jackson posy closely but were you surprised that L was able to they should have really won the Texas game I a Miss hits a yeah tough shot at the buzzer I mean when when Trey and sky are playing like they were and Tyler Johnson played like he did I mean remember Tyler Johnson with 20 points and six assists in those two games uh in New York as he gets off the bench and is getting ready to check in here uh but yeah I mean I like to see that that they dont have to rely on one guy and Mike didnt have a great tournament there a great two games there instead yet still Louisville should have won both of those games the deflection there Tyler Johnson had the game 35 seconds on the shot clock youll see cards down 63 still looking for their first field goal here against this New Mexico State team Trey white is going to have to get it off quick he just does hits the rim cant get it to go and eago with BL rebound Tyler Johnson had a a really unbelievable two games uh he had 14 against Texas Six assist against Texas got to the free throw line you see him there he has been limited some in that last run people were like why was he not out there I was he not out there he has a he had a little bit of a groin injury and was trying to stretch that out and get back out there he did but he has missed some practice so Im interested to see how good hell be here today three on the shot clock cook cant get it to go and trainer goes up and gets a rebound for the Cs Tyler Johnson JJ trainer Mike James Caleb Glen and Trey white on the court right now for U ofl white inside spins takes the hit but cant get the shot to go rebound by monzi Jackson some contact there but Treys got to finish that shot through contact this New Mexico State team coming off a 8154 loss to Southern Illinois in Cancun on Wednesday before that they lost 8176 to Fresno State in overtime in a game they LED in the final minute looked like they were going to win it but Fresno with a late three and forced overtime Caleb Glenn all the way to basket cant get it to go cards still without a field goal as were nearing the 13 and 1 half minute Mark in the first half and that is Christian cook with the triple for the and it is 93 New Mexico State Christian cook a 42 career threepoint shooter thats one thing you cant do is leave him open there hes already got a game with five this season trainers going to try a three cant get it to go another Miss for the cards and another rebound for the haggies in New Mexico State looking to build on a sixpoint lead here as Louisville is now 0 for seven from the field including 0 for four from three Applause Jackson posy gets in the lane cant get itago with a tip but James comes up with it and here comes Tyler Johnson can he push the pace yes he can he gets all the way to the basket the lefthander misses but trainer there for the follow slam and the cards finally have a field goal and Tyler creating something his speed his quickness his ability with the ball he creates that by getting a shot and a good shot at that he just missed it and JJ trainer there for the putb Jackson posy to cook iagos got a good matchup he likes hes got James posted up he spins the left handed shot off the glass is good yeah hes going to get that pretty much anytime yagu Music 610 from Ontario Canada James in the corner for three and that one rattles around and comes out yagu with the rebound hes iagos been at UTEP Kansas State and Sam Houston State and now here at New Mexico State this is his fourth stop he started 33 games at Sam Houston State last year started 18 games over two seasons at Kansas Applause State Jackson goes Baseline what that had to be something he went up and down the ball yeah that had to be totally well go to break though is uh Louisville just one for 10 from the field down 13 to C their leading scorer and rebounder uh 16 points 77 rebounds three assists the transfer from pit and Sean Hall most recently um just out with a little illness we mentioned they came straight from Cancun here and uh hes only played three games for him after he got his waiver from the NCAA but hes been impressive yeah a little late getting that waiver but 167 27 rebounds and uh uh he is a guy that is very very very talented Tyler Johnson kick to Curtis Williams misses a three shot one of better shots theyve had in then Johnson with a rebound and well see if they give him shots there it was he passing it but yeah theyre going to call it out of bounds passing look and Louisvilles got Louisville one for 11 on from the field Louisville has only scored three possessions and the three times they scored theyve gotten to the free throw line twice and the bucket from uh the putb from uh from JJ trainer all three times going to the basket and not settling for jump shots is where they have scored sky Clark get to the finds his angle and is able to score the second field goal of the afternoon for the cars what theyve done well so far theyve drawn fouls New Mexico state has five and theyve shot free throws pretty well so far and thats the fourth time theyve gotten the ball to the paint the fourth time theyve driven the ball to the basket and something positive has happening on all four Tyler Johnsons got to be on the court for this team I think as much as possible because he just ch as he gets out on the break oh and he was fouled and now hes hurt so yeah it looks like he reinjured maybe he reinjured that going hes down thats a yeah you can see him winsing you know thats an injury Jody that it only hurts when you move which can be a problem for a basketball player and its one of those things where you kind of got to let it heal before you come back but a lot of times just a certain step or a play like that can can trigger it and aggravate it as he goes to the free throw line and misses the first 14 of 16 before that its 10 of 12 in the Music game against Music Texas Tyler makes that one card showing a little life though out of that timeout and Tyler doesnt he appears to be okay I mean hes not really wincing now he was when he went down there Huntley Hatfield in for James so the cards a little bigger than what they were with trainer Williams and Huntley Hatfield in there RS by the way number two scored a point for Western Kentucky last year in the cards first win of the season when they beat the Toppers here in the kfcm center were going to get a foul in the Box out there on Huntley Hatfield as he was boxing out Robert Carpenter the first foul on Huntley Hatfield and the first foul on the cards here with 1019 to go in the first half just a little late reacting from Huntley Hatfield as they get Jackson posy back in the game easy AO back in the game for them as well R set to throw it in on the Music Baseline getting eago back to rolls this jumper over Huntley Hatfield is Music Applause good alls average has averaged five and a half or more points in four straight years three of them at Western Kentucky one at Georgia Applause Music Applause State stepped out of bounds Curtis Williams so the cards with a turnover there thats turnover number three for Applause Louisville just two of 12 from the Music field got to look at Kenny p over there on the sidelines Applause um the former New York Knicks assistant had a chance to coach in Madison Square Garden against the former Knicks assistant in their game on Monday and Mike Woodson in Indiana as cook pulls the trigger on another three and hits another three and its a 10point lead for New Mexico state here with 9 and a half minutes left to play in the first Music half Music kicking the corner to Traer for the wide open three that rattles out card settling for some threes here in this first half and so far they are 0 for seven well 0 for seven 0 for seven two for 13 from the field but the other thing too is Tyler takes that one away and hes going to go in and get a dunk thats what he does who can give him a spark on both ends of the floor but Kent the one thing that stands out more than maybe anything to me it was 11 to six in rebounding right now and that possession before was a perfect example of Huntley Hai just kind of watching as the ball was rebounded and uh they get an easy for the easy Music two oh takes the big hit from Carpenter sky Clark does and hell go to the line for two free throws how about skp lets take a look at Tyler with the steel and the dunk here Jody good job with the back tap get up for a littley doesnt seem too worried about the groin injury there looked fine were you surprised late in that Texas game when Kenny pay called the play for skot Clark who had hit a three at to to get three and then he knocked it right down and then another after that yeah I know because I I mean he looked confident up there in that game and thats the thing like Scott Clark can shoot the ball he hasnt shot it well here in this building but he can shoot the ball and I think youve got to show that confidence uh in your guys if youre going to to have that in them and you youve got to be confident with the with with those guys in those situations and I think that did a lot for sky Clark for him moving forward was four or six at game two of n against Indiana after starting 0 for eight from threepoint range as the Cs have been firing up threes this afternoon 0 for seven from three New Mexico state with a 126 advantage in the paint in the early going heres Jackson posy and hes going to add to Oh I thought he was going to add to it but he missed the wide open layup kicks out the rolls for the three its short but another offensive rebound this time its cook and his shot in the lane is good and its back to a 10point lead for the agies eight minutes to go Scott Clark Mike James JJ trainer Brandon Huntley atfield and Trey white on the court right now although Emanuel a COR for who has not seen a lot of minutes in the early going this season set to check in at that ball looking for somebody to get some rebounds nobody seems to want a rebound for Louisville Mike James takes it strong to the basket hell get a couple free throws when we return right now though New Mexico State leading little 222 the cards struggling Music early we are back here in the kfcm Center New Mexico state with a 2212 lead on Louisville and this Aggies roster well lets just say its loaded with transfers everybodys new and you just look at some of the school thing I mean all over the map Joe yeah theyre from everywhere I mean I think a total when you count up how many schools these guys have all been to at some point in their college career its over 20 different schools and when you look at it its guys from all over and like you said its the entire roster K its uh everyone 15 new players on this team seven seniors four Juniors and two freshmen on the team and by and five countries too new players new coaches new conference theyre in Conference USA now picked to finish eighth in that League um as Mike James Goes to the line for two free throws and a chance to get the cards a little closer and he misses that thats the second Miss in line by the way this this Jason hooton the Mexico State team came in shooting 40 from the field this season they are shooting 60 so far here in the KFC Yum Center as they built this 10point lead and James misses both Emanuel aor for in the game as the cards will try to get some paint touches which is something we hear so much about but theyve been kind of settling for threes and theyre 0 for seven from three in the early going and getting out rebounded 146 now by this New Mexico State team Scott Clark guarding RS heres cook 10 on the shot clock Jody yeah thats the biggest thing right now is getting just hammered giving up easy shots on the defensive end and getting hammered on the boards cards with a little more intensity I think at the defensive end on that possession out of the timeout Clark to the basket theive for trainer and dunck number two for JJ and a good job by sky Clark again get the ball in the paint and make something happened its been positive when theyve done that today they just havent done it very Music Applause often RS with it in the switch so now theyve got a mat matchup problem here is carpenter carpenter tries to swing it over but Trey white picks off the pass and see if the cards can get something going on the break but the defense catches up they missed that they had a huge Advantage underneath the basket and at one point trainer was wide open under the basket cant miss opportunities like that they should be able to get the big guy off the roll on one of these pick and rolls cuz New Mexico state does not switch on that pick and roll they they try to stay with the four4 misss but Trey white with the offensive rebound of the basket and the cards are within six so a bit of a run that was not a great shot by 44 but I like the idea because he recognized that he had to do something and he went to make a move again not a great shot but at least hes out there Mak something Happ he is fired up and not happy with the way that ended up CS though within six on this little run 22 16 New Mexico State what even is this dont touch my things gross Janice when you bundle your home or renters with your auto Progressive provides 247 protection for almost everything you own but you really need my weighted hoop its for my snatched waist my dog chase lounger foot treadmill thats my Tuesday chalice purse that says purse hypobaric oxygen therapy chamber I cant live without oxygen solid gold coffee machine Lake making kit really can Progressive cover that too yes but J Ill take five is my voice on TV right Music now all right we are back Louisville a little bit of a run there uh 212 scoring drought for New Mexico state as the cards have cut what was a 10point lead down to six at 2216 Jason hooton not at all happy about that offensive rebound Trey white got at the other end on that last basket with the quick timeout and were back to it here with sky Clark JJ trainer Emanuel Accord of four Mike James and Trey white on the court for the cards as we see Jason hooton he is very active on that New Mexico State sideline L more active the last couple possessions on the defensive end and they need to be and its going to be a good skott Clark with the deflection I thought we going to get a jump ball but Bill cing with a foul on skot Clark as he was had kind of knocked the ball away from Jackson posy I mentioned Jackson posie missed their last two games uh with a concussion theyre open an 8646 lost to Kentucky and upup Arena Jackson posie had 10 against Kentucky and then 12 points six assists and five rebounds against Western New Applause Mexico inside the dunk by eago and the leads back to Music Applause eight white drills into trouble again and almost has it taken away Applause but thatll be another foul thatll be a foul on eago on the quarter for screen as sky Clark tried to get to the basket thats their ninth team foul already L with just two team fouls 517 left in the half and be one and one for sky Clark shot the one Applause one two for two from the line so far to for Music Sky get Tyler Johnson back in here number four Tyler Johnson and hes coming in for Trey white so that this is the lineup I like white out there with Louisville but I like I like John CL together CL together I think thats when theyre at their Music Applause best Clark Mak makes both of those free throws Applause 248 Clark guarding Jackson posy Music closely Harris will try the three thats going to be short and the cars get the Applause Music rebound Music Johnson always looking to go to the basket a serious screen from a COR for over there and then the on the Baseline Tyler has that ball go out of bounds on the as he tried to get it to Clark in the corner yeah he just got too deep on that one is uh kind of got pushed a little to the line as were going get Huntley Hatfield back in for a COR for a not a bad couple minutes though for Emanuel as he best thing he did was that screen he set last Applause Music possession RS guarded by Johnson he goes by him James Applause Music switches three from Jackson misses off the back of the rim and Cars getting chances the Aggies have cooled off a little bit as the cards have picked up their defensive pressure James misses inside gets the rebound cant get it to go out to Clark thought about the three for a second now hes going to drive on cook to the basket and gets it to go and hell have a chance to complete the threepoint play and get the Cs within three yeah so Sky making something happen there for L and you can tell Mike James all the way down the floor on that possession was looking to go to the basket he did he couldnt get it but L with the offensive rebound and cook will go to the agies bench with his second personal foul their 10th team foul so the cards in the double bonus for the final four minutes of the half and again Louisville with just two personal fouls in this first half and I I dont does that speak to their aggressiveness at the defensive end I mean that no because they have been aggressive at the up top for a few of these I mean you know Tylers got the steel Skys got a couple that he almost had I think they need to be more physical and I think that speaks to some of the thing though they have cut the rebounding margin to 14 to 12 it was 146 just a few minutes ago M Clark has been all over Jackson posy bringing the ball up the courton shorten the shot clock for the offensive Applause possession they even have a 10sec call thats going to be an offensive foul there Cs back in it 2421 to Mexico State leads with 351 to play in the first half Prov greatly in the worlds most famous Serena J yeah I mean look at just look at those numbers I I dont Im not sure you can explain it I think it was just more of a p throw in the cop and State game as well right and you know the thing about it is in the Texas game um Texas didnt shoot it very well lble did a Indianas not a great shooting team so I think that helped a little bit today New Mexico state two of eight but on the flip side Louisville 0 for seven from three Louisville cant get anything going from outside but theyve also stopped settling for the threes the last couple possessions as trainer drives in the paint oh he spins and shoots it looked to me like he might have been able to get that ball to Huntley Hatfield but the rebound by Harris and here comes New Mexico State Scott Clark has already drawn five fouls in this first half a nice back door cut Hunley Hatfield with the block and trainer able to call over the loose ball and see if the carts can convert this to some offenses and cut into this threepoint lead Clark the trainer he cant handle it but hes able to come back up with it and then not sure if he hit monzi Jackson or that was just a he was looking for the foul and then Johnson has the ball knocked away and here come the Aggies a little ragged right now from both teams as uh quick shots turn overs and Miss shots a lot to much turkey Music maybe Lille has had more energy on defense in the last couple minutes though Harris to Jackson into Huntley Hatfield he scores and thatll be a foul on Brandon Huntley Hatfield which will be his second personal with 236 left here in the first half you can always tell Huntley Hatfield when he is into a game when hes active and today just doesnt look like he is very active hes late reacting thats the second time on defense that hes been late reacting its resulted in a foul uh and hes only got two rebounds in 10 minutes uh for him hes got to do more than that for this team and hes been the consistent rebounder for this team monzi Jackson 67 senior from Dublin Georgia to complete the threepoint play cant do it trainer with the rebound for the cards yeah Jackson now just had missed just one free throw coming into Music Applause Music that eight on the shot clock for the cards down five Clark to the basket over to White over to James less than one to shoot hes got to get it up quick and he did not get it up and a shot clock violation again that ball gets stuck at times for Louisville you saw it there early in the shot clock Trey white with a couple of too many dribbles then late in the shot clock is going to get foul on Tyler Johnson on the hold late in the shot clock sky Clark gets it in too many dribbles once he makes the idea for the pass across Court to Trey white its just too late for them to react and get a shot Music of K theres a lot of things that are that are that are not good with this team when you watch them thats one of the thing that has been consistent all year theres a lot of times on offense that ball just get stuck Iago just goes right through trainer and again with that lefthanded shot off the glass who seen that a couple times in the first half and the big fell with six points and seven Applause rebounds so Louisville got within three the Mexico States responded with with four straight Tyler has the ball knocked away as it gets in the paint then a loose ball a little raged out here Trey white comes up with it lays it up and in players laying all over the floor I thought Tyler was fouled and then fouled and then fou he fouled twice no call or anything but Trey white gets the bucket RS gets free on the Baseline and knocks down the jumper its another thing when this team does something positive it seems like it always they always compound that with doing something negative on the defensive end as theyre just a little locks down there sky Clark all the way to the basket and theyre they are going to count that and Clarks limping a little bit too coming out of that 542 seconds left to play that cuts the deficit to five and puts Clark into double figures with 11 points at the line for the c number 55 clarkk going to put Keon dorsy in the game for these final 54 seconds and let Jackson posy get a little bit of a breather they now have four players with two fouls cor for back in for Louisville his trainer goes to the bench rebounding now 1514 and it was what 146 it was 146 White knocks down that free throw he has 12 points is 6 for six from the line and has definitely been the star of this first half for Louisville as they Trail Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music 3026 RS doing a lot of dribbling on this possession 10 seconds on the shot clock Clark defending and were going to get an Bill com to call the offensive foul on rolls that he hooked CL I couldnt see it I couldnt tell from the from our angle but thats what he called and uh there was no complaint from the New Mexico State bench so must have been thatll be his his second personal as they have four players with five players with two personal fouls in their ninth turnover of the first half so got 14 second difference do you hold it for one here I think I do I mean I I think you you you if you get something because theyve been getting some good looks uh early in the shot clock because this of this New Mexico State Defense and the way they switch or lack of switching if you can get something but looks like lilles going to hold it oh almost lost it on the exchange there between white heart and 10 now on the shot clock Johnson nice pass to trainer and a third dunck for JJ in this first half that might have been their best offensive possession of the half and thats just the second assist of the half but that right there is what Tyler Johnson can bring to this team thats what he needs to bring to this team and if they can do that theyre Music more their first lead of the afternoon and well get a quick foul on skot Clark his second personal you see Jason hooton the coach for Mexico State RS Harris Carpenter cook and EAS auu on the court for the Aggies Jody mentioned the one change for the cars they get the easy back door and James beat by Cook and Cook now has 10 points hes in double figures and the agies are back in front at 323 Applause 31 cor for with it to Trey white and I like the cor for he is more active on the offensive end than Dennis Evans is right Applause now good look there from White just didnt go down I mean its a sky Clark gets into the paint gets deep and and passes back out rolls with the shot Trey white with the rebound Noble doing a much better job on the boards Kent than what they were again at one point it was 126 now it is 1615 Louisville I feel like we should see more of that in the second half though as a core for misses but he got the ball if the if the big men will roll off that pick and make themselves available its there theyll be open because theyre not switching on the pick and roll and that was actually perfect right there Trey white got it to the core for he just didnt really take his time and missed the shot were going to get a charge there as Mike James stands in there and takes the hit so there you have it on on The Possession before that Mike James not no help behind him he gets beat on the pick and roll but again makes a good defensive play there makes up for it hops outside of the circle of the arc under the basket there and takes the Music charge second foul on the big guy isaku core for pass was deflected it wasnt a great one but the C still end up with it James inside and have a core for coming up with a loose ball and putting it in attacking the basket though Mike James going to it making something happen in a core for there now Louisville ties up the rebounding battle as they take a onepoint Applause Music Applause Music lead Applause braws a clear path to the Baseline he pulls up and hits the 15t jumper and its 3433 the Mexico State back in front is little seaa the second half Scott CLK adding to his impressive afternoon 17 points for skot Applause Clark 20 against Texas was the most hes had this year for the cards a core for with the steel a nice play defensively CL the quick push to James has it knocked away and then a battle for it on the ground and boy Carpenter Dove down and got it James is he okay he gets up gingerly now its a five on four for New Mexico state and Harris pulls the trigger on the triple and thats the first three for the Aggies since the early going and I think going to check on James here Music the reason for the whistle but itll allow some substitutes to get in the game Tyler Johnson looked he was up but hes headed back to the bench now JJ trainer set the check in for the cards as a COR for will get a break after a pretty uh pretty good three and a half minutes for him to start the second half yeah cor for with a couple of rebounds and a a put back on an offensive board there doesnt get a ton of minutes and really if you look at what he gives you compared to Dennis sevens even Huntley Hatfield at time I think a COR for has got a chance to get more minutes ball movement there Clark white out to trainer they didnt dribble they didnt settle when they actually come down and get a little ball movement its amazing what an open shot will do for you as trainer knocks it down cards now two for three from three early in this second half as theyre back up one Applause Jackson spins and scores in the paint for a 39 38 the Mexico State Music leag little quick with that shot on that possession for the cards not a bad one but no what a bad shot just again a little quicker you dont want to settle for threes they did that early in this game and thats how they got behind RS with the Miss but nobody boxes him out he grabs the offensive rebound of the paint kicks it out to Jackson posy his three no good nice box out by Huntley Hadfield comes up with it Curtis Williams set the check in the next dead ball for the cards James thought about the three and James seems to be a little trigger shy right now on that shot as hes not been shooting it well the last couple games Hunley Hatfields Baseline jumper comes off James almost got the rebound but Jackson posy able to come up with it for the agies Hy Hatfield setting decent screens but hes not making himself available off that we really havent seen it yeah we only seen it one time and a COR for got a pass in the lane and score and almost scor but got a good shot its that little extra effort that youve got to give and we havent seen that from Huntley Hatfield so far but back in this one hit a couple of Threes early on the second half Trail web W 3938 a first child can be ball as we close out the month of November the ACCC challenge coming up this week and some notable matchups Tuesday in R Arina Miami fresh off that trip to the final four well visit the young cats yeah and then you look at it Texas Anum in Virginia thats one that I look forward to and then Duke in Arkansas but perhaps the best game of them all Tennessee North Carolina dont you think some good matchups Im Im excited about these two conferences the first time we do this Tennessee fresh off their trip to the Maui classic in Honolulu by the way we had eight lead changes in that last segment of this one New Mexico stay a 39 38 lead and by the way skot Clark has changed his jersey from 55 to 20 I guess the 20 Jersey is the oh my gosh beating the Scot clock shot clock rolls over Huntley Hatfield mil Wagner must keep a jersey back there the number 20 cuz we had JJ trainer a couple weeks ago have to change to it and you can see Skys got a little looks like a little blood on his shorts or something on his shorts as well but he is no longer number 55 hes number 20 although he played pretty well as 55 so far this afternoon he leads louville with 17 points and has not missed a shot six on the shot clock gets Taps it away on the double team Trey white a nice cut in the reverse nice job by trainer of seeing that and recognizing knowing that the shot Glock was winding down and getting it to White for the reverse layup Trey white now with eight yeah and you see Clark hes got a bandage on his leg so I think he must have uh as they missed a shot there and trainer with it hes got a bandage on that right leg on kind of the on kind of the calf area there so must have been a little cut or scrape there or something Music its knocked to the ground and foul thatll be the second team foul in the Mexico State here in the half and its the eighth foul that sky Clark has drawn in this game that foul on monzi Jackson his second personal and again the second team foul on the yies here in the second half L with just one foul Ls done a much better job in the last 12 minutes of this of game time is Clark the the threepointer well were going to get a I think were going to get a box out foul here on Harris underneath as he was trying to box that white white jumped up and he kind of undercut him a little bit will retain possession here down Music one thats the eighth player now that have two fouls for New Mexico Music state cant Ls done a much better job the last 10 minut 10 12 minutes of game action on the offensive end the thing they havent done is when theyve gotten that onepoint lead a couple times theyve not been able to extend it yet to to extend it to anything else one is the largest lead theyve had so far Clark all the way the basket takes the hit and he actually theyre going to call that a charge as Carpenter stood in there and took it looks he hit his head on the flooor hes grabbing his head thir a lot of bad things there for Louisville because the turnover the third foul on skott Clark who leads you with 17 points and for the first time here in the second half were going to see Tyler Johnson who has been impressive in his first half action hes going to come in for Clark who 17 points one assist Music Applause Music Jackson posy to Harris yagu all alone underneath Huntley Hatfield able to close the gap but eago goes under the basket and scores and Huntley Hatfield and Huntley Hatfield and Tyler when they came to the top there kind of ran into each other and Huntley had feel a little late reacting not able to get back trainer had a wide open three if he wanted then tries to go to White Harris knocks it away all the way to the basket and then misses but Jackson posy with the follow and New Mexico state has increased the lead to five with Under 12 to play here and Kenny Payne has seen enough he wants to talk about it because this team has fallen behind again the a of New Mexico State leaded 45 to 40 lead on Louisville you take a look at some of the notable nonconference games for the aies open this season at Kentucky a 40o loss here today theyll play New Mexico twice the Rivalry game stepen F Austin at Tulsa as well for Jason hooton Squad their last time out they lost by 27 to Southern Illinois in a Cancun challenge that was on Wednesday afternoon came into today shooting just 42 from the field and they are hitting 59 this this afternoon here in the KFC y Center Tyler Johnson shot clock under 10 for Louisville out of that timeout little jump Hook by JJ trainer goes and Louisvilles cut the lead of three Tyler Johnson Trey white Curtis Williams Brandon Huntley Hatfield and trainer on the court for Louisville and Tyler John Tyler just makes things happen thats just his second assist Kent but early in the C in the first half there were at least three passes that were either to the free throw line or should have been an assist because they missed an easy shot and theyre going to call who what did he did he hit him on the what happened he hes going to call the foul on trainer oh did he not let him land is that what the call was I am not Applause sure all right figured out 4542 to Mexico State 1114 to play at the University of Louisville we dont just live in the city see Im s real quick well take a look at that last play just before we went to the timeout you see Robert Carpenter tries the three JJ trainer comes out on him its an air ball but see doesnt give him room to land he lands on his foot and that that was the foul that was called the verticality cylinder Rule and were going to have an 88 free throw shooter get three free throws here in a threepoint game so a huge call there Jody and you see that pretty much every game in the NBA you see it three or four times but you dont see that call in college too often Im not sure Ive ever really seen it called in college and at a tough time in Kenny Payne and Lee Cel having some words there at the break and you saw the rule not surprisingly the 88 free throw shooter knocks them all three in a shame for Louisville cuz it was off an airball where they were going to get the ball down three and instead they have it down six with 11 minutes to play Tyler Johnson Curtis Williams Trey white JJ trainer and Brandon Hunley hat will get another foul here on the ages thatll be their fourth team Music foul was on Jackson posy that was his third personal F number zero Jackson posy thats his third Team Four BK card set to throw it in again Scott Clark leads Louisville with 17 point point were going to get another foul here as sky Clark on the UFL bench though with his three personal fouls how long can Kenny Payne afford to keep him I think I think he can put him back here in just a couple of minutes that was uncooked there as he just grabbed Tyler Johnson finds white wide open on the Baseline and he scores look Johnson makes the biggest difference in this team he has to be on the floor for Louisville in my opinion he is the playmaker on this team yes sky Clark is going to score points hes going to get to the basket and deflection another deflection hes about to force a turnover here and how about Curtis Williams diving for the ball and were going to get a 10sec violation the second one of the game here forced by Louisville and the fans who are here are up and cheering two freshman out there Curtis Williams diving on the floor Tyler creating this its one of those times where you wish it wasnt a 10second violation because it was an easy layup for Tyler Johnson but Louisville gets the ball oh and then turns it over we at a I thought we were going to get a jump ball here we we get a timeout for New Mexico state they had the possession arrow anyway so they could have just waited for the jump ball but theyll retain possession and Jason hoot Squad leads it 4844 with just over 10 to play heres look at skot Clark he leads little over 17 points this afternoon five of six shooting he does have three fouls right now hes on the bench with with 1037 to go and hes also changed jerseys because had a little blood on his number 55 so hes wearing number 20 the Mexico State set to throw it in they lead this one by four and K that turnover from Louisville was again Huntley Hatfield just give him a little bit of lack of effort there he didnt come to the ball it wasnt a bad pass good idea yes Cooks three off but isago the off offensive rebound and the basket and the lead is back to six for the agies and Jason hooton look at him running up in the side Tyler all the way to the basket and then just throws it away tried to get it to Huntley Hatfield this game getting away from Louisville a little bit as Harris drains the triple and the lead is back to nine and well see if Kenny Payne wants to take the time out and think about it he does not sky Clark still not set to check in Mike James and Emanuel at cor for are though and were going to get a foul on Carpenter out front for New Mexico state Here Comes skot Clark I would imagine Huntley Hatfield going Music out Curtis Williams going out cards need a little run we have not seen a whole bunch of Caleb Glenn who made such a uh positive difference in that Indiana game especially on the big run where L was able to grab the lead James set to throw it in Music in two or core four back to James 15 on the shot clock cards down nine and theyve only hit two threepointers in the game there you go a COR for with the nice roll and what do you know he gets the passer Johnson and this time a little more patient and lays it in by the way Jody a couple Louisville Ties on that New Mexico State bench as well Zach setember the St X grad an assisting coach and Noah brightenstein a graduate assistant played a Collegian and ballor second foul on Tyler theres Zach satm coached L Ellis in junior college Lis is junior college coach RS drives on James throw Carpenter comes up with the catch in the paint were going to get a foul I think on trainer as a four for Block that shot not a whole lot there but I think the foul actually a little push before foul is on trainer thats his second yeah and Carpenter who just hit three free throws is going back to the Line This is not trending good for the cards here no its not he does miss the first of the two free throws but uh lels going to have to do something and do something here in a hurry just to get the momentum back in this game again theyve never been able to get more than a onepoint lead they had a stretch where they were playing pretty decent basketball and this looked like theyre the most winnable game maybe uh for a while especially with New Mexico State as Johnson drives and scores New Mexico State coming off that trip to Cancun Tyler maybe can ignite something there with his chance for a threepoint play Bellin coming in here on Wednesday night Ken I know weve said this over and over again but look this this kid has to be out there for Lille to be successful you just see it the energy level with the team when he is running the show is different and it also makes sky Clark better in my opinion because hes playing a little bit off the ball Tyler completes the threepoint play cards back within five here 8 56 the play Comes A little pressure Clark on Jackson posy gets it across with 23 on the shot Applause Music clock RS gets caught in the air and a COR for with the steel I was going to say he doesnt want to dribble it up the court James just tackled at midcourt shot to the trainer in the corner for three and that one rattles is out theyve been close loose ball in the Baseline it goes out of bounds off eago and Tyler Johnson kept that alive he stuck his hand in there got a got a hand on the ball kept it alive and Iago falls down and goes out of bounds heres a look at it trainers three like it was going to go yeah theres Tyler just knocked it right off the leg and then eago had his foot out of bounds as he Dove on it see if the cards can get the ball in bounds as they get it to Music Clark Johnsons Corner three off the side of the backboard tipped by a core for trainer comes up it and inside JJ with I think that was a dunk got a little bit of the rim well count that as a dunk thats four for trainer as the cards have cut it to within three Tyler Johnson sparking this run for Louisville and the activity the intensity is what this crowd wants to see the fans who have decided to spend their Sunday afternoon in the KFC Yum Center Louisville trailing New Mexico state by three with under eight to play the lob to eago inside he scores and hes fouled and hell have a chance to complete a threepoint play the lead back up to five for the agies 744 remaining on this Sunday Music afternoon noon Joker and the thief playing here at the KFC Center and the crowd trying to get into this trying to get excited about what is a 5651 New Mexico State lead right now on Louisville and again Tyler Johnson spark in the second half the cards 10 of 19 from the field in the second half for 526 you see it six points four assists two rebounds and a steal he has been the Difference Maker when the cards have gotten in a hole they were down nine he came back in theyve sparked it now lets see if they can get the back into this fivepoint deficit in and and Mexico stayed at the line they got within three and then Casey isiagu with the basket in the paint he has not attempted a free throw yet today but this season you wouldnt know it shooting just over 50 from the line but he knocks that one in he hasnt missed a shot yet 6 for six from the field one for one from the line 13 points eight rebounds for their big guy and hes been the best big guy on the Court this afternoon yeah has been Louisville since uh they put a COR for in about 2 and 12 minutes ago has been the best big guy for Louisville he has been swing in the corner for Clark a nice triple and he got it Scott Clark now with 20 points this afternoon and Louisville back within three see no there wasnt a whole lot of dribbling its passing the ball there so much better offensively when you dont sit there and just dribble dribble dribble Applause Carpenter 15footer is good the cor for backed off of him thinking that he had he he that he had help there and there was no Music help almost a turnover and it is a turnover on the little exchange there between Johnson and Clark was it theyre arguing that that was deflected by a New Mexico State player but the officials do not agree and this New Mexico State team shooting 60 from the field Jody yeah New Mexico State team that coming into this was shooting 415 from the field and again we we mentioned it earlier but fota C their their best player is not playing today Christian cook drives in he hits the jumper on the Baseline and Lead is back to seven with 6 and 12 minutes left to go for New Mexico Music Music state James in the paint fouled by Carpenter no they call a foul on isiagu is third theying to give James Two Shots the I think he might just is he G to get two he going to get two hes getting two I dont know that he was Music shooting actually James just one for four from the Music line knocks that one in came in today shooting 88 but now just two for Music five cuts the lead to six with 615 to Music Applause go CS are going to have to get some stops here were going to get another foul on Tyler Johnson and that will be the seventh foul on the card so rolls will get a chance to shoot some free throws at the other end just a little late there from Tyler good job on the pressure that is his third personal foul R the former Western Kentucky Georgia State and Western Kentucky player 88 shooter so far from the line this season but hes only attempted eight as Trey White Checks back in for Louisville and a quarter for will head to the Louisville bench still havt seen Caleb Glenn all think in the second half have we we have not and we have not seen Dennis Evans since the first three minutes of this game R sh on the free throw were getting a foul on Carpenter over the back and guess what well get more free throws at the other end itll be trainer shooting trainers first free throws of the game today for JJ and the fourth foul there on Carpenter who has 10 points one of four double figure scores this afternoon for the agies so far trainer just 54 from the line on the season first one no good James with the offensive rebound to White he goes up gets the basket and the foul and Louisville will have a chance to get within two if Trey white can convert the threepoint play but Mike James made that play Mike James has not had a great day offensively hes over five from the field he struggled and he made that happen not only did he save it but he able to get it to White A lot of times guys will throw that ball back out a little bit but he recognized that white had position got it to him and Louisville has a chance for a threepoint play and that was the fourth personal on Christian cook so now two Aggies with four personal fouls with still 610 to go and another Miss at the line for the cards as white cannot get them any closer they Trail by three with 6 minutes left the play oh were going to get a screen here by Applause kenanga a little scuffle dust up between Music Johnson and rolls thatll be Lille possession an offensive foul cook and Kang whos kind of battled foul trouble all afternoon for the agies heads to the bench Applause for was his third personal in just five minutes all right Louisville could tie with a three or get within one Johnson all the way to the basket he misses the reverse layup but hes fouled by Jackson posy who does not agree with the call well I I dont know that he doesnt agree with the call he doesnt agree with this his teammate didnt help at all hes asking his teammate to slide over and take a charge there and uh Jackson posy thats his fourth personal coming back he missed a couple games in concussion protocol and has struggled a little bit that is three straight free throw misses for Louisville including the front end of a one and one by trainer and Johnson will get a second free throw here and a chance to get the cards within two now 13 of 20 from the line today he missed it he missed them both Applause I have to get some stops at this end they havent been a ton of them Mexico State shooting 67 from the field in the second half Harris all the way to the basket Jen Harris Music Applause oh were going to get an elbow from Music Applause James goodness everything kind of working against little this you can I mean he swung across his face I and now theyre going to review Applause that nothing really flagrant there I mean hes closely guarded its a basketball play to bring the ball across Im not thinking its anything I mean Ive always thought about that cylinder rule we showed earlier if your foot happens to be where you land if your your nose is is where Im going its the same kind of Music thing I dont know about that one the other one I if its just you dont see it in college right the the F called earlier on trainer but I cant imagine theyre going to elevate this at all but I also wont change it itll be a foul on moul going to be Mexico State ball theyre going to have the ball with theyre talking about it for a long time Music here lets see Bill Music Music Covington ball okay cool cylinder foul he said he said it will return to a cylinder foul so I guess maybe they had that cylinder foul has been a problem today for Louisville Louisville had all kind of trouble with the cylinder overturn oh he didnt explain it maybe you need to clean your ears out Joe he didnt explain that he said its a cylinder foul youre right I didnt get the impression there well that changes things is that what he told you is that what he told us I couldnt hear him he said its a cylinder foul he didnt say it will be overturn to a a Louisville cylinder foul apparently Harris was the one in the cylinder there and there we see the vertical cylinder rule again and thatll be the fourth foul on Harris and James will get a chance to hit some free throws and finally the cards will able to knock in a free throw four different AI players with four personal fouls and Jason hooton didnt seem too fired up with the final ruling there to me thats kind of incidental contact in a b game of basketball you know what I mean like its like I would not have thought any differently had they not called a foul on that either way well lets see if lble can get out of this cylinder that theyve been in be a good idea to get a stop here if they want to win the game 68 now but New Mexico state is shooting in the second half of this game eago has got the match up he likes on trainer he misses and James with a rebound and the cards will have a chance to get within one or Applause tie Johns to the basket looked like he was out of control but got it this guy Clark the swing to trainer had an open look Johnsons three from the corner wont go and Jackson posy the rebound pretty much everybody around the threepoint line on that possession yeah JJ I think if JJ had pulled the trigger he had probably a better shot Tyler got a good look Im just not sure he was as confident as trainer would have been and Ill remind you theyre now three for 16 from three this Music afternoon Mony Jackson drives on Clark and thatll be a foul on clarkk and thats going to be his fourth personal with 409 to play Clark leads Louisville with 20 points one of three Louisville players and double Music figures I dont know that that wasnt a hook on Jackson yeah it was it was close I think the foul I think he called the foul before he actually had the hook there Jackson line for one and a bonus and he hits the first one number 34 he is one for two from the free throw line this afternoon but so far this season hes 10 for 12 former Hulk State College witch State Jacksonville State player knocks down both and the lead is back to five for the ages and dont forget they have four guys with four fouls theyve got RS Harris Jackson eago and cook on the court right now Johnson all the way to the basket kicks it the white in the corner for the three almost banked in that was an awful quick trigger I think on that possession is that the shot you wanted I mean he came down and got it right to him I mean its a good look very quick in the shot Music clock again they lose eago and the big fella thats what I dont to Jackson for the easy TI you dont want a wide open Jackson flashing down the lane when eags got uh got positioned and give it to him for an easy Music layup Clark again with a quick trigger on the Applause three white in the lane draws the foul from Jackson and Trey W will go to the line for two with the cards down Music seven New Mexico state with the sevenpoint lead on Louisville some people just know thats not going to fit those are the people state with a sevenpoint lead on L the AES do have some foul trouble here for the final 36 team as you can see four different players with four personal fouls and one with three but Louisville has a little bit of foul trouble of its own because sky Clark leads the cards with 20 points this afternoon and you see him wearing number 20 there cuz he got some blood on his 55 Jersey he also has four personal fouls Tyler Johnson with three JJ trainer and Brandon Huntley atfield with two Trey white to the line right now for two free throws and a chance to get the cards a little bit closer and he has that one bounced out and now 15 of 24 from the free throw line and while New Mexico states hit seven of its last eight field goals Louisville has not scored a field goal in the last Music 254 white knocks in the second free throw and this is a sixpoint game with 316 and I would say a key 316 for this Louisville team coming off some positive momentum in New York thats the thing he cant you cant describe why I cant figure it out why do you play so much better when you go on the road youre playing much better competition no disrespect to New Mexico state but Indiana and Texas are a a lot better than this team and you play better a wide open shot in the lane for Jackson and he makes it which is what theyve done most of the time this afternoon when they have shot and the lead is to8 now with 248 to go it helps when nobodys guarding you the lob trainer tries the onehanded slam and that goes off the back of the backboard cook on the breakout he lays it up and misses and Clark with the rebound for Louisville hes got a one on Three Applause break what in the world was that Johnson fouled in the lane he took the contact and just wanted to get a shot out I think he originally was going to pass that because he had James kind of flashing and then when he got hit and then he realized uh Im not going to be able to make that and then he got hit and just kind of threw it up because theres no way I me that was not a good shot but well getting to the line is good in this situation cuz the clock stop but you got to make the free throws Louisville is 16 to 25 from the line this afternoon as Tyler knocks in the first one to get with them within seven again it does not get any easier for Louisville theyll have bman in here on Wednesday night and then at Virginia Tech at the Paul yeah that ad Virginia Tech One week from right now that is a tough tough opening game for this team an ACC Play Turn up the pressure a little bit almost go up with a steel but instead its an eago dunk and its starting to look more and more like New Mexico State might get out of here with a win eago having himself a day the big fella with 15 points and eight rebounds Music Applause Johnson the nice D the Traer inside so John Johnson now with six assists the rest of the team only has three though W with pressure do not get the steel sixpoint game 15 seconds on the shot clock and just 130 now to play here RS they have the mismatch with eago if hes able to post up trainer and instead R just drives in and scores because they cant Applause miss thats 10 of their last Music 12 w number three CHR thats going to be five on Music cook so cook is fouled Music out teams hitting 62 68 in the second half it does help that a lot of them have been wide open as Louisville has got missed assignments or just late on everything defensively but still theyre putting the ball in the basket when when your 61 that catches it that close to the basket though theres just not a lot you can do cards have gone with some smaller lineups but theyve also just been able to get some favorable matchups on yagu is skot Clark uh now with 21 points for L we see yagu 15 points and eight rebounds for the big Music fella Kenny Paynes going to take a timeout again I I I cant figure out this team and why we go back to the whole thing about New York they played so much better against better competition in New York City losing to Texas and then losing to Indiana in close games and the problem with this is this isnt going to get any easier Kent when you look at the schedule this is one of the most winnable games left on the schedule for Louisville its not getting any easier for this team theyve got to do some things better weve mentioned a few times but also dont forget that their best players is not playing today fota Calli their SE Hall transfer is uh out this afternoon as well so youre right this looked definitely like a winnable game beforehand but really its Louisville has only briefly LED in this game and a lot of the reasons cuz New Mexico state is shooting 62 from the field in the game 68 in the second half and when the game has gotten a little tight late theyre getting easy shots and making them four of their last five for the field and well see if the cards pressure can force a turnover Music and almost I thought he lost I thought lost Harris spinning grabbed by Johnson Jad Harris will go to the line thats the fourth foul now on Tyler Johnson Music going to have to hope they miss a couple free throws and you got to hit a shot at some point or another here Louisville just three of 18 from threepoint range they started 0 for eight in this game we saw Caleb Glenn for 6 minutes in that first half but have not seen him in the second half Dennis aans has played just three minutes a Miss of the free throw line and maybe some life for Louisville a minute to play Down Music six to trainer gets eago in the air scores and hell get a chance to convert the threepoint play JJ missed the front of a one and one earlier but Music L 20 of 29 from the free throw line so Taylor Wilson and Joe Styer in the front row there the Hollywood seats for Louisville hoping to cheer on the cards 7369 567 left the play trainer does have 17 points and nine rebounds this afternoon were going to get Caleb Glenn in here and trainer hits the free throw so Glenn for trainer better defensive matchup career high 18 points this afternoon for JJ 7370 567 left to play Harris to throw it in for New Mexico state into Jackson posy they trap him in the corner back to Harris now the key is not to give up an easy basket at the other end if youre Lille 20 on the shot clock Big Time defensive mismatch here of James having to guard is yagu its been a while since the cards have gotten a stop well see if they can get one here 5 seconds on the shot clock RS is probably going to take the shot his shot is short and Im not Trey white let that go and I wasnt sure it wasnt def I I almost thought it was deflected there think is Louis going to call timeout Louisville is going to call timeout I thought Tyler might have gotten a piece of it but Applause it okay somehow Ls got a chance to tie this game with 269 seconds left Lille takes the timeout now they did this against remember they could call a timeout in the play coming out of the time out against Texas was a three for Sky it was out under their basket this theyve got to go the full length of the Court as you see New Mexico states upcoming schedule University of the Southwest New Mexico and then Northern New Mexico all New Mexico New Mexico again and stepen after their little vacation they went from Cancun right to Louisville theyve been here for a couple days getting ready for this game and theyve already theyve already played Western New Mexico and theyll be back playing Western Kentucky later this year again now in conf all the conference movement you know you hear about all the big teams you know the the power five schools when they move conferences but New Mexico State moving from The Wack to Conference USA this year theyre looking at something and Im not sure what theyre looking they might be looking to see if that ball was deflected you think maybe timing as Music well 269 seconds left that was Kenny pay final time out and the possession arrow favors the Aggies and they were looking at the like we were looking at the Applause time do you go for a quick two I think I do especially because youve been drawing I mean look youve draw three for youre three for 18 youve drawn 30 fouls in the game okay I mean when you look at it Mike James has drawn six sky Clark has drawn eight and Tyler Johnson has drawn seven get one of those guys going downhill and get them going to the basket Trey white 13 points Scott Clark 22 JJ trainer 18 trainer Johnson white James and Clark to throw it in for the cards with 269 seconds left and a game where they have trailed virtually the entire way they have a shot to TI at 7370 in the final seconds and here we go Trey white pulls right up to a three and hits it and nobody tied at 73 as the Mexico State just let him have it his first triple of the afternoon and well see if Lis will can get a stop here because theyre going to have to guard for the final 15 seconds walls brings it across half court Jason hon will take his timeout he has one more left and hes yelling at Mony Jackson for just letting Trey white go Trey White just dribbled up the court pulled up hit a three from the top of the key and and and were going to watch that again I mean literally he took the ball in Balance hes the one that received the inbound pass dribbled right down the court and was like okay if nobodys going to guard me and and IU tries to kind of come at the last second but nothing there and were tied with 146 seconds left this is an 80 run for Louisville over the last 55 seconds of this game maybe a pivotal moment in their season because it certainly looked like they were well on their way to a loss this afternoon Ls last lead came at 1610 here in the second half when they LED 38 to 37 but right now we are all tied up at 73 loville has led for Just 2 minutes and 11 seconds in this game Kent again the possession arrow favors New Mexico State Louisville does not have a time out you see New Mexico state with one more timeout all kinds of agies players with four fouls sky Clark with four fouls for Louisville as well as Tyler Johnson the two guys who really make this Louisville team go but Clark with 22 points this afternoon so he would be a major loss should we head to over time Tyler Johnson with eight points and six assists this afternoon Trey white now one for five from three and well you never know it hes he up and just shot it three for 18 and white was 0 for four and he just pulled up and it was easy now theyve got to get a stop they do it like not to uh not to have a big guy in the game so theyll go with the same five they had before eago has gotten some easy baskets inside 15 points and eight rebounds for the big fella and he will have an advantage on trainer if hes able to post him up as the crowd now up and we are set to go haris set to throw it in he gets it into Jackson posy guarded by Applause Clark 5 Seconds rolls 4 seconds three to eago in the paint and were going to get a block on Mike James and eago is going to get some free throws with 15 seconds left and goodness I well have to see the replay here but ah he was kind of leaning Applause Music Applause in New Mexico state will use their final timeout with 15 seconds left and this will give Penny pay a chance to talk some strategy as well ah theyve replayed it a couple times on the big screen I mean he was not straight up and down Kent thats the thing I think lets take a look at as it I dont know hes set when he catches the ball hes set when he catches the ball that looks like a charge to me thats a charge all right so its going to be eago to the line he is one for one so far this afternoon from the line and 13 for 23 so far this season so just a little over 55 eaga with 15 points Scot clar 22 for the cards theyre seven of 11 from the line Louisville just 21 of 30 that was an issue but Trey white with a game time three with 146 seconds left and here we go 15 seconds left fans on their feet here in the KFC Yum Center and casy iagos free throw misses he misses the first hell get a second and again a chance to give them a onepoint lead nobody has a timeout possession arrow favors the aies 15 to play Iago his second free throw is short rebound by sky Clark his shot from go comes up short and we will head to overtime and boy that switch from his number 55 Jersey to number 20 he does have four fouls Tyler Johnson also with four fouls for Louisville and a slew of agies with four fouls so that could be an issue Traer on the cut gets to the basket and the foul and that is Louisvilles largest lead of the game right out of the gate in overtime and rs is going to pick up his fourth foul trainer getting to the basket rolling just like weve been talking about all day its there for you if you do it and a great pass there as trainer gets the bucket this is by the way the first overtime game of the Kenny pay era here at Louisville thats a 100 run for Louisville to take a twopoint lead JJ trainer to try and complete the three he has a career high 20 points to go with his nine rebounds as we see cook already fouled out and four Aggies with four personals and were going to get a foul right there on Jackson underneath as Trey white tried to get the rebound on the Miss free throw and thats going to be guess what Jacksons fourth foul so now every one of the guys in the game for New Mexico state has four fouls hes going to put Carpenter back in hes got four fouls Trey Whites going to shoot two and Kent this 10 run is in what a minute and about a minute and 15 seconds or so theyre going to review something the know hook and hold we back to that the hook and hold review you Music think not sure I was I dont know some classic van Halen though while the officials review that 7573 cards lead this game somehow with 443 left in overtime a 100 Music run eight lead changes in the first four minutes of the second half so we had eight real quick this is the ninth a 100 run for Louis close thats it 115 its 112 here we go yeah it might be the hook and hold like it is Music that as maybe Bill Covington will tell us the right thing this time illegal contact caused by hooking the opponent over or underarm with clamp to deceive the official into believing it was caused by the opponent a point of emphasis a couple years ago you saw it just about three or four times every game um havent seen it a lot that almost that looked pretty clear though didnt it we saw it a couple times in New York and Im surprised we dont see it more Music Applause often and well I Applause Music guess just two free throws two free throws Jackson on the bench now you see him with his four personal fouls and just about everybody on their roster has four personal fouls other than cook whos already fouled out with five they have five players in double f figes led by eago Music 15 Whites first free throw off the back of the rim L now 21 of 32 theyve been so good at the line at times and then other times just miss a lot of free throws white knocks in the second and the lead is three the largest of the afternoon for the car yards JJ trainer career high 20 points and a career as tight as career high with nine rebounds as see if Louisville can get another stop here in a 7673 game isago to Jackson posy on the road isago and the big fella is able to score in the paint this is too easy for him 17 points for casy Applause Iago if youre one of these lisal guys just take it to the basket like you have been youre going to get fouled 32 fouls 10 on the shot clock James will try the three in the corner that misses and a rebound for New Mexico state a great offensive possession there for Louisville no not a lot of movement some standing around and nobody taking it to the basket got to take it to the basket again Clark and Johnson for Louisville both with four fouls both pretty key to the operation for them Harris has the ball knocked away to Fleck it and a steal for the cards trainer and white combining to come up with that turnover both guys very active oh Music Applause Johnson Clark back to Johnson in the lane his jumper right went halfway down and then comes out I think were going to get a foul on Mike James there is it they call the yeah crashed into two Aggies so were going to get free throws at this end for New Mexico state and a chance for them to take the Applause Music Applause lead well see Brandon Huntley Hatfield for the first time since the under right before the Under 12 of the second half so he has sat out about 13 minutes hes coming back in R misses the free throw hes 0 for two from the line the aage is seven of 14 from the line so RS will get a second free throw a chance to tie this game 322 to go possession arrow favors the Aggies each team with just the one timeout they get here in overtime as rolls does tie the game at 76 yeah K I dont believe as much in the plus minus category here but today its pretty obvious Huntley Hatfields got to do something to affect the game here for Louisville theyre down 14 when hes been out there on the floor this afternoon white to the back cutting James who almost lost it but comes up with it thats its going to be all for Carpenter and Louisville is going to have to hit their free throws now Carpenter will head to the bench with 10 points to New Mexico state and the cards who are I mean such a huge Advantage 33 free throws to just 15 for New Mexico state with the cars is 22 of 33 from the line New Mexico State actually shooting ORS 8 of 15 I mean if they hit 33 fouls on the agies this afternoon just 15 for the card so Carpenter heads to the bench Jackson will come back and he also has four fouls yeah everybody on the floor again here with four fouls two guys already fouled out Trey white four for seven from the line this afternoon and remember the next guy that they would have to put in there is kinyonga and in five minutes of action hes got three Music fouls back in front white with 18 points Ian Clark have both scored double figures in every game this season for Louisville knocks them both in and the lead is back to two well to Jackson posy Diago again on the roll good job by catches up to him though 10 seconds on the shot clock theyre going to try the pick and roll again Jackson posy over in the corner to Jackson his triple misses and a nice box up by Huntley Hatfield to get the rebound weve been hard on him today because he didnt do a whole lot that possession was Brandon Huntley had covered on the roll he recovered in time where they couldnt get it to yagu and then he blocks out and gets a rebound Clark all the way to the basket and hes going to get thats going to be five fouls I think on Jackson posy or was going roll yeah know they called it on Jackson posy I thought they going to call it on rolls hes got a little bit of an argue hes like what on me cuz there really was I it almost looked like Clark just kind of lost it going I got to see the replay but Clarks going to get two free throws and Jackson posie is going to get a seat on the bench over there just two points and four rebounds but six assists for Jackson posie this afternoon his first game back after missing a couple because of a concussion Music and Kon dorsy will check in for them we just saw him briefly at the end of the first half thats tough call there freshman from Houston Texas skot Clark was there wasnt much cont eight for eight today from the free throw line 22 points three assists three rebounds just two turnovers in 36 minutes for Scott Clark career afternoons for JJ trainer and sky Clark for the cards and Sky knocks that one down and the lead is back to three which is the largest lead of the game for Applause Louisville last time they led by three was earlier in overtime and Clark extends the lead to now four their largest lead of the afternoon and 24 points for sky as he increases his career high Music Hatfield again a good job of getting back there rolls with it 10 seconds on the shot clock he pulls up BS hits the jumper though Aggies not going away just yet back within Applause two RS has 15 points Music Applause Clark to James in the corner his three off the back of the rim but Clark with the offensive rebound 15 on the shot clock Clark to a cutting white gets the fifth foul on isiagu and now Trey white will go back to the line and foul trouble really catching up to Jason hooton in this overtime Ive never seen fourth player foul out of the game have you ever seen a game with four players foul out I dont think I really ever have our statman Ken horn whos done thousands of games says hes never seen it before the crazy thing is theyve got four more with four Music fouls and kenanga has probably been their most prolific Fowler and he checks into the game with his three fouls and five minutes of action Trey white back to the line white with 19 points six of nine from the Applause Music line you might as well go ahead and join trainer and Clark with career highs his career high 22 points in college at least for Washington I mean for USC against Washington he knocks in that free throw seven of 10 from the free throw line hit the huge three to tie at the end of regulation he knocks that one down hes got 21 overall a new UFL career high for him he had 20 against Texas last Sunday as the lead is back to Fourth and they get trainer back in now without is yagu in there its not as big of a matchup problem trainer played throughout that he get it back in thats the first time lble had three 20 point scores in a game since Applause Music 2014 15 on the shot clock rolls kicks it in the corner Jackson is a wide open triple misses it and then the offensive rebound by by Harris but he didnt bring it down he Jackson tries to throw it deflected James comes up with it but Jackson takes it away and then deflected Applause and scramble down there its the end result is Louisville basketball with 532 seconds left at a fourpoint lead and I think theyre going to look at this are they going to look at it yeah its a its a its close enough you got to look at H look did it go off Trey white I cant I couldnt tell if hes got his hand on that I thought he theres a decent chance I thought he thought theyre going to call a foul on Jackson jumping into white there was a lot of fouls in that JY what can this do for this team because this looked like with about two or three minutes to go it looked like they were head for another Los with about a minute too this looked like they were headed for another loss as a matter of fact 556 seconds left they were headed for another loss and what this does look this is a game you should have won this is a game you have to win if youre loyal if you can close this out though I think its got to give you a little more confidence in okay look theyre going to get tougher were going to play against better teams but weve done something now that we really havent seen them do in the last 2 years and thats come from behind late and close out a game if they can close out this game theyve still got 532 seconds Music left theyre looking at this for a long time Jason Hoon running out of options on his bench he has four players who fouled out he has three players with four fouls and again hes without his leading scorer this afternoon fota CI who was not available out with a sickness 8278 532 left to play and the players went out there ready to go and the Tommy Morrison leak selo over at the monitor I mean either he touched it or he didnt from the angle the first angle we saw I dont I dont know that you could necessarily overturn it Im not sure how many different Ang its going to be New Mexico State ball how much oh how much time on the shot clock Music then are they going to give him 20 on the shot did did Louisville ever have possession of the Music ball the last play over Music basketball it has to be something other than 22 because if Trey white didnt touch it right then its not it wasnt ever Louisvilles possession all right heres the look all right so well first of all my question did Louisville ever have possession of the ball that it should have reset to 30 right exactly you see what I mean right there its 20 and the the shot clock almost re it did reset right there it reset when it went out of bounds but there were 18 seconds on the shot clock right 17 or Music 18 Music theyre looking at this even long to bring his team back down cuz that might this might take a now all three officials over looking at the monitor all the Music players the leading score for the Mexico State this afternoon afternoon Casey isiagu on their bench with 17 points and eight rebounds he has fouled Music out RS the leading score on the court with 12 points and Jackson also number 25 has 12 points and they are looking at this for a long time and continue to talk about it 17 seconds on the shot clock here now I think thats what we saw when we were watching that replay just a second ago so that should that should be Music Applause right Kenny Payne is telling them come on lets just go R has built a fourpoint lead here in overtime and theyve done it with just one field goal trainers basket to open the overtime when when he got fouled but the cards are seven of nine from the line in overtime so now thir I dont know how he got the 13 but its 13 seconds on the shot clock the ball was out off a white difficulty getting it in here you go RS now with 10 on the shot clock RS has 15 points Harris maybe looking for a three forces that one up it doesnt H anything thatll be a shot clock violation a great def maybe the best defensive possession of the game for Louisville and a good job by Louisville and again look who was in the middle of all that Tyler Johnson being active with his hands and not letting anything happen with now were going to talk about this again and dont forget Tyler Johnson and Scott cler both started the overtime with four fouls and theyve managed to stay on the floor while there have been a slew of New Mexico State players just about anybody who does foul is going to foul out 414 seconds they have three players on the court right now with four personal fouls and they have four players on the bench whove already fouled out but they have to foul you cant let them run the shot clock them right I mean they at this point they have to foul and thats going to be Jackson and hes gone and they were trying to get and thats a thats a mistake there on New Mexico State because what they were trying to do is they were trying to get dorsy who doesnt have a foul to foul and he just couldnt catch up he just couldnt get with it and now were going to see for these guys yak yak y yak yak yak yak seeing his first action the uh freshman from Applause Australia and the live for the cars number four CH shoot Tyler four for seven from the line this afternoon make it five for eight this is this is quite an escape by the cards this Applause afternoon up by five up by six Louisville does not have a field goal in the last 407 they lead by Applause six and rolls kind of has to do it all himself right now he takes that to the basket that was maybe easier than he wanted today but hes got 17 points now and with 266 seconds left R now its just a matter of getting the ball in theyre going to foul somebodys probably going to foul out L is going to have hit some free throws five guys have fouled out its unbelievable and two more have four fouls 36 fouls were going to get 37 youre guaranteed of Music that Louisville 30 of 41 from New Mexico State no more timeouts Louisville does have one time timeout left and the possession arrow favors the AES cards possession they can run the Baseline oh looking to improve to three and three ahead of a visit from bman here on Wednesday night in the KFC Yum Music Center in a game where New Mexico state is now shooting 59 from the field they Trail by four Scott Clark to throw it in nobody guarding the inbounds man and a hold right out of the gate and were going to get Trey Clark bumped his knee too and there Kon dorsy finally does commit a foul as he joins the gang and Trey W will go back to the line for two free throws no time off the clock Trey white to the line and a chance to for the maybe get a new college career high hes already got a UFL career high 21 points but scored 22 as a freshman last year at USC against Washington well get two free throws here and chance to increase his total today and he knocks the first one down to equal that 22 cars now 30 of 31 of 42 from the line this afternoon Music fight with a Miss James almost with the rebound and then did he throw that off of yak yak he did yep he did James off of yak yak out of bounds to Applause Louisville and were going to were not going to review that are we what are we doing blood or something on the Jersey or hes got blood on his jersey we weve already got the number we already used the number 20 Jersey whats the next one theyre reviewing this Applause Music play its either off Mike James out of Mounds or off yak yak and Lille possession cars with three 20 point scorers to when did you say the last time was 14 all right heres the review did the ball the only thing I can see is maybe did the ball bounce on the out of bounds line before James tapped it cuz it clearly he he he was in bounds and he knocked it off a yak yak a fivepoint lead for Louis no that was in it looks clean to Music me Applause and I think they maybe looking to time as well wble possession meanwhile Trey Whites got cleaned up the Mexico state has led this game for 36 minutes and 26 seconds but Louisville has led for just about the last 608 and all of overtime and Louisville leads right now 8580 245 seconds left the play Tyler Johnson set to throw it in on the Baseline for Louisville along along with JJ trainer Mike James K Clark and Trey white gets into Clark hes trapped in the corner and he is fouled anding on who that fouls on fouls on Harris and thatll be his fifth personal foul and he is the sixth different Aggie to foul out this afternoon Music Applause is Jason hudon going to check in are they going to play with four no Im serious I they dont have another they have another player thats it fota C is uh they dont have another player is out today hes not even in uniform he is on the bench but yeah so for the final 219 seconds the Mexico state is going to play with four players here as Clark knocks in the free throw every point he scores will increase his career high now has 25 points 11 of 11 from the line have you seen this Ive have seen it a few times Ive never seen it in person but Ive seen it a few times in games I was trying to figure out the most ever for a foul out and I dont know what it is is Jordan rolls pulls up and even with four he hits the triple and this games not over its a threepoint game and were going to get oh you know what though thats Kanga did thats just his I see every every player who fouls out from here on out they do have two players on the court with four fouls if either one of them commits another foul theyll be down to three players we joked about 3 minutes ago that we wouldnt get to they wouldnt get to 40 fouls well guess what theyre at 39 Louisville gets an offensive rebound here they might get to 40 Clark makes it a two possession game with 121 seconds left its one of those times where youre not really all that worried about going to double O because they might only have two guys on the court but L would much rather get out of here with a win here in this first overtime period and the lead is five 27 points now for sky Clark just double the ball oh my gosh Louisville foul was foul 22 oh my Music Applause Music goodness Whites first foul Keon dorsy to the line for two free throws he misses the Applause Music Applause Music Applause first thats going to be foul number 40 hey just the second on dorsy though Clark with 27 points 13 of 14 from the line cards are going to get close to shooting 50 free throws this afternoon these two will make it 49 assuming they dont get any Music Applause more yeah park now with 28 points hes third 14 of 15 from the free throw line I think its going to flip I think hes 15 to 16 no hes 14 to 15 okay youre sorry I know how to read a St sorry sorry 29 Applause Music Applause point 59 to go if youre just tuning in New Mexico state with just four players on the court because theyve had six foul out this afternoon and have another was unavailable no foul no foul no foul no foul the three at the buzzer is no good and Louisville Escapes in overtime the with a monster comeback in the final minute the first overtime win in the Kenny pay era Jody some final thoughts well
