Applause McNeely and the who in the road blue Virginia in the home white we are underway and its Virginia that starts with the basketball this is a Cavaliers team that has played a lot better since the Midway point of conference play theyve won seven of their last 12 Saunders cant connect on the opening possession good opening possession for Syracuse its important for them to get out to a good start in this game well theyve gotten out to good starts its in that has been the problem for the orange as of late you take a look at the Su starting five yeah late game execution has been has been you know hard for us I think thats something that hard for Syracuse I think thats something thats been uh you know its an experience thing do I need to get a a tally of the us and we tonight we might have to first time back in the dome for MCW and hes bleeding orange already Virginia starting five DayDay ases has really come on strong for The Who in the last nine games play his best basketball of the Season Andrew roie way Applause short JJ Starling travels before getting into Attack Mode Starling just three of 17 in that midweek loss to SMU one of those games we were just talking about that Syracuse has struggled to close yeah a bit of a slump for JJ you know hes a great player Im sure hell come tonight and and hell put on a better performance limiting turnovers is key for Syracuse just getting up some shots and and you know seeing the ball go through the net is key MC Ney spins free cant knock it down Eddie lampin Jr the rebound youd think Syracuse has the advantage inside lampin Jrs been playing really good averaging nearly a double double going against a young Virginia front Court thats grown up a lot but doesnt have the size to match lampin yeah hes been a double double machine Id like to see them kind of feed the post and play out of Eddie Davis fading away opens the scoring I like that fade away so does jier Applause Davis jday Ames stolen away Pride free by jquan Carlos jquan he had a great game last game I thought he really controlled the game well and of course he made some shots but the way he controlled the game was really important lampin Jr musers it home through the double team Eddie lampin doing the doing the grind work down low only one season spent here in Syracuse but a very meaningful one one of eight seniors honored pregame final game of the season here at the Dome when you watch Eddie l play he plays with so much passion he plays with a lot of energy hes really the spark plug for the Syracuse basketball Club Ro contested three cant connect Saunders battling Davis for the rebound keeps it with Virginia mcel a deep three no good another offensive rebound Saunders crushing the cuse on the glass and finally Cashes in Virginias first bucket of the night after they missed their first five shots all five got a crash for for Syracuse and limit Virginia to those offensive rebounds NE Jun backto back buckets for him yeah as he keeps scoring down low hes going to have more confidence down low hes letting him know hes the big fella down Music Applause there hes lost the handle Falls to Buchanan 10 seconds to Applause shoot MC Dy sends it for Saunders poked away and another turnover forced by the orange Starling rejected Andrew roie good transition defense that was great transition defense great Hustle by ro to get back and make a block Eddie Lin in the right position gets a deflection what a great play on the defensive end by roie to stop the JJ from getting two points an easy two Im liking the the pressure from the Syracuse team the theyre pressuring the ball on the defensive end they need to try to sustain that throughout the first and the second half come Virginia too early turnovers because of that Syracuse pressure pull up pop Taylor nothing but the bottom of the Applause net love to see his shot go down Syracuse you know hes hes a great scorer on this team you know if hes shooting the ball well it only helps this team Syracuse has made four of their last five an early sixpoint lead for the Applause orange Saunders lines up the Triple no good Buchanan slapped it out of bounds brings us to our first stoppage Syracuse a strong start in the final game of the ACC regular season all orange so far Lucas with a nice Lucas Taylor with a nice midrange jump shot you know the way if he can keep that going man throughout this whole game its going to be tough to stop watching Pittsburgh and Boston College a quadruple overtime game between Cal and Notre Dame before that this is the final game not just for these two teams of the regular season but the entire conference Syracuse with a strong start early MCW you got to be more heads up there I was about to get drilled with the ball list Ive been retired for a little while for a reason I thought the perk of having a guy who played nine years in the NBA was he could catch a ball I I I think they thought I had the Jersey on and try to get me a little pass I should have been I should have been more shot ready Virginia has struggled offensively to start just one of seven from the floor two turnovers Syracuse very dialed in defensively J Murray in traffic hoists it up and it goes in what a shot that was try to get the foul but got it to go Virginia with a win would secure the final first round Buy in the ACC tournament next week Lin continues to dominate inside hes got six of the oranges 10 yeah if Im Syracuse Im Im giving it to Eddie lamin every trip down letting him play out of it eventually theyll bring the double team and then you can start finding the shooters on the outside j a pull up pop missed it cleaning up the spill on the inside Jacob Kofi The Freshman Virginias been doing a great job in the offensive glass they havent converted on all of them but they are hustling to get there oh what a pass like caros that was a great great look to Eddie lampin down low L lampin now with eight of Syracuses 12 to start clear advantage on the inside and thats been the game plan early for Syracuse yeah finding him down low jquan Carlos that was a great pass with no look shot clock down to eight heres Andrew roie in attack mode into the lane loader does not fall Starling with a head of steam the trailer Davis lines up the three got it jier Davis drills it Syracuse is on fire but its its it all starts on the defensive end for them theyre pressuring the ball theyre getting in the passing Lanes theyre making it really tough for this Virginia Club to score the ball every shots contested besides that one Kofi answers hammering it home maybe thatll be a shot in the arm for Virginia on the road Syracuse has made their last four Applause shots Starling working against roie 5 Seconds to shoot spins and loses it good defense by roie got the reach in deflection caus a turnover and with Syracuse started this game shooting 78 from the floor Virginia desperately needed that stop not used to seeing this whos program give up so many points this season roie Lees that short Applause Applause lampin right into the lane splits two and scores Eddie lampin already has 10 he cannot be stop tonight that pick and roll finding him on the pick and roll heav going to the hoop finishing strong Virginia just doesnt have an answer for him Syracuse has now made five straight they are shooting 80 from the floor eight of 10 red hot start in the final home game of the season Kofi answers with a knockdown jumper great Touch by nice midrange jump shot hes having a game Applause himself going inside lampin hes been feasting double team trying to muscle through it loses the handle Kofi cant Corral it so itll stay Syracuses way now two programs that have traditionally been perennial powers in this sport of Rich Traditions particularly here at Syracuse well get a message from their for Syracuse to have a a a really good uh a really good you know a run at this thing where do you think it went wrong when you look at this season I think theres a lot of things right I mean injuries played a big part in this season right without Donnie here you know JJ and Donnie havent spent a lot of time on the court together the two best players you know you do that for a lot of teams in this ACC you know I think their their record looks a lot different as well you know Virginia another program that very tradition perennial power used to being in the top 25 used to playing in meaningful games in March this is unchartered territory for a who team that look theyre theyre still in the ACC tournament theyre playing for a first round by but theyre not used to being ninth in the ACC no theyre not youre youre totally right on that and and you know theyre theyre playing for you know everybodys playing for something at this point and some teams are you know not in the position they would like to be and I think Virginia is one of them they expect to be better and you know Syracuse as well with itam head coach Ron Sanchez again a lot of questions thatll need to be answered in the off season count it plus the foul Chris Bell an and one opportunity great deflection on the defensive Applause Music end great deflection get the steel a a great kick ahead and then a great finish by Chris Bell finishes the oldfashioned and one knocks it down so Syracuse doubling up Virginia 201 about Midway through this first half what can Virginia do to get their offense going here on the road and right on two another turnover offensive foul thats the fourth whos turnover in this first half yeah I mean I think one of the big things is they need to start taking care of the ball theyre not getting bad looks right mcne had a couple of open looks that havent gone down um you know that thats just the nature of the game but they got to start taking care of the ball maybe they can get some more easy looks Chris Chris Sanchez taking over for Tony Bennett on short notice they started ACC play one and six since that low Mark they are seven of their last 12 so seven and five in conference games they feel like they have made a ton of improvement but struggling on the road in the regular season Applause finale syracus has really found an opening on this Virginia Defense using that pick and roll and finding the rooll guy lets see if they keep going to it they have a tendency to go away from things that work and again this Syracuse defense is hist story continuing to dominate throughout this first half I mean forcing turnovers it starts with the ball pressure you know every single time the balls been brought up the court but Syracuse has been great with the ball pressure Virginias turned it over three times in the last two minutes alone five turnovers in the first half its allowed Syracuse to open up a 10point lead the Orange shooting nine of 14 in this first half and you know what one of the things is Syracuse has been able to capitalize off these turnovers Bell off the mark from three offensive rebound keeps it Applause alive Virginia in a two and a half minute scoring drought now just looking for something anything on the offensive end to provide a spark Kofi step back jumper got it the Freshman Jacob Kofi hes got eight of Virginias 12 yeah I mean hes like I said before hes having a game for himself hes got a AA touch McLoud it rolls in plus the foul nem McLoud using every inch of that 7 foot4 frame yeah again off the pick and roll right thats time it was a double drag found the rolling big I mean that that thats going to be open all night unless Virginia makes an Applause adjustment so McLoud hes got a date set with his his former team Florida State just before this game tipped off it was announced that no matter whether Syracuse wins or loses they have locked in to that first round match up against the seminal at 700 on acc Network to begin the ACC tournament what a game thats going to be so even though Syracuse cant improve their seating you want to go in with some momentum to postseason play surely no yeah momentum is huge momentum is huge going in off a win is is a big thing right you feel good and you play good well you never know what can happen during an ACC tournament or NCAA tournament Monday night you can relive it a documentary chronicling last seasons incredible runs by the ETC State mens and womens programs thats 7 Eastern on Monday right here on acc Network and how about that you go from winning the ACC tournament to not even playing in it as NC one of those three teams that misses out on the conference tournament this season yeah I mean you know its its got to be because of the you know the nil stuff and and and and guys leaving programs I feel like were going to see a lot of of of of movement like that you know further on in the coming years that rims out from Bell foul called on the rebound they tag Elijah Saunders with it well you can go from best to last but you can also go from worst to first like Louisville did ex I mean not first but theyre up there ex yeah they theyre up there and I mean Pat Kelsey has done an unbelievable jobs your coach of the year in the AC yeah no questions asked hes my coach of the year T hard taking the lane puts it off the window and in for two good strong move by CU off two feet balanced got it to go and again theyre right back with the pressure Syracuse not playing like a team thats sitting at six and 13 in ACC play and already locked in to a date with Florida State plenty to play for on senior night with Virginia in town and a good start for the orange a 2512 lead with 747 left in the first half for my partner Michael Carter Williams first time in the dome since your final game I cant believe that 10 years ago when you were part of that special final four team and 2013 so longer than 10 years yeah longer than 10 years man I mean it seems like it was yesterday though um you know I still talk to you know most of the guys on the team um just you know the good old days man as youre watching those highlights break that down uh it just brings back good memories man it just you know I I love you know I love Syracuse I loved wearing the Jersey I love playing for Coach beheim um you know it almost makes me want to shed one a little bit were trying to limit the we and the uses and youre shaking off the rust too because in the first half we had a ball coming right this way and I had to lean I had to get I I got to get the lean back I youre leaning back thank goodness for the monitor or else I I would have been Applause hit oh its great to have you back and its great to be back youve been a great addition to ACC Network and everybody at ESPN be honest you just missed uh coach beheim you wanted to follow him to ACC Network in ESPN yeah absolutely I I miss coach I missed our banter going back and forth his humor whats your best Syracuse story oh well be here all day if I if I best number one I if I get going theyre probably not not any uh stories I can tell on air been a strong first half for Syracuse against Virginia shot clock down the three step back contested three front rim from Carlos and a foul on the rebound the Syracuse bigs have given Virginia trouble tonight and thats been the Cavaliers vulnerable Point All Season just inexperienced through the front Court Blake Buchanan Jacob Kofi Anthony Robinson all under class for Ron Sanchez yeah I mean if we talk about what the keys for Syracuse to win right is to dominate the paint and thats what theyve been doing right they need to keep keep keep trying to dominate the paint oh what a pass great pass Movic the Serbian will get two at the line the 16 of Syracuses 25 points have come in the paint clear game plan tonight thats Saunders second foul and that hurts them because he is he is a big key to this team when him and McNeely got it going you know thats thats where most of their wins have come from Saunders having big nights mcney having big nights you know if they if theyre struggling to get it going you know they they they they struggle Day Day Ames has come on strong as well hes scoreless in this first half and the last nine games where Virginias looked a lot better hes been to focal point has the ball here I think they just need to be more aggressive right be more aggressive to the rim use Syracuses defensive pressure against them ases loses the handle and the turnovers continue to pile up thats now six Virginia turnovers in this first Applause half this is a Cavaliers team that in the second half of this season has looked a lot better than they do tonight they had won four of five before losses to Duke in North Carolina but responded with wins against Wake Forest from Florida State but make no mistake it is all orange in this first half Kyle cup adds another bucket well they really cant get it going offensively and and you know theyre having trouble getting good shots theyre turning over the ball but give credit to Syracuse the way theyre defending is you know is very good that time a foul called Applause underneath hard Fall by CU Jun no easy baskets right nothing easy a lot of ball right there too agrees with you he was looking at the replay there and now is letting the officials hear it shot for Isaac mcne Isaac mcney with two coming at the free throw line so Virginia when theyve been at their best theyre knocking down freees and tonight theyre 0 for six from three and maybe this will get mcney going a little bit finding his rhythm at the free throw Applause Virginia will take the points any way they can get him theyve been at a premium in this first half Syracuse in control 14point lead for the oranges we tick down to near six minutes remaining in this first half risky pass intercepted by Ames Applause Music Applause bothi hes been the bright spot of this first half draws the foul freshman has eight of Virginias 15 a chance to get two more at the free throw line but all that is right it all that is is is is Virginia being aggressive towards the rim you know some you know put it put it make put the refs in a bind a little bit go get some contact see if you can get to the free throw line just positive plays by this Virginia team not turning the ball over tomorrow willll have the ACC wrestling championship from Cameron indor coverage of the finals begins at 8 Eastern right here on acc Network Jay you think you could you could get in there and wrestle a little bit no I I know my limitations I know my limitations cant get in there and scrap and the last thing anybody needs to see is me and a Singler me Applause too heres Jer Davis hands off for Lucas Taylor Syracuse has found a good Rhythm offensively in this first half shooting better than 50 from the Applause floor and its really been without JJ right he hasnt had a you know speaking of JJ he heard me he heard me about first first basket of the night though first basket of the night right its its been coming from a lot of Eddie lampin um you know in a various guys on on the Syracuse team and thats a good sign for them cuz you know JJs going to get it going at some Applause Music point Ames connects thats Virginias first three of this first half a big one for DayDay ases trying to get going yeah and it was badly needed Applause Lucas Taylor pull up pop cant hit it Virginia needs to just focus on getting a string of stops you know three or four stops will really help them shot clock down to 10 Kofi Davis all over great defense finds Buchan and has to hurry two on the timer goes off the window and in Blake Buchanan his first basket of the night in Virginia cuts the Q lead to 10 with a sneaky layup underneath Davis quick trigger and he buries it Cher Davis hes having a game defensively and offensively Davis has eight two for two from three and a 13point lead restored for the orange DayDay ases to Kofi he tried to spin his way free and turns it over thats now seven turnovers for Virginia in this first half and Syracuse continues to capitalize jier Davis two for two from three hes got the orange up by 13 Justin Walters yeah it seems like duks in the drivers seat there here in Syracuse the orange on top of Virginia by 13 Jer Davis has had the hot hand in this first half eight points and combined with Eddie lampkins 10 theyve got 18 to the oranges 34 yeah hes been playing a great game and you know I know the offensive numbers show but defensively hes been really digging in Davis gives up the three goes in Kofi got a piece of it shot clock down to six Taylor step back contested three nothing but the bottom of the nette for Lucas Taylor man that was tough nice step back to the corner three just like just like Audrey drew it up and its a 16point lead for the orange dominant in this first half o by ro the double cross to the Flo and he gets the Finish as well but thats what Im saying if Syracuse wants the pressure right sometimes its you got to abandon the play and just go to the rim and make a play you know if you draw two dish it off but theyre theyre you know theyre letting the pressure get to it thrown man move Eddie lampin on the inside hes got 12 and hes got a mouse in the house and hes sh hes showing it off a little bit and hes letting him know about it Applause Canon trying to answer righty hook doesnt drop yeah good defense by Eddie defended the pick and roll then slid Applause over Lampkin leaves it for Davis those have been the top two for the orange and the iron is kind thats the type of first half its been for Syracuse I love the energy at he L is playing I wont use an exact language but he just told bu Canan you cant mess with me on the offensive end and thats what its looking like Syracuse has knocked down six of their last 841 points in this first Applause Music half but tomorrow 500 pm eastern time ACC gymnastics six all ranked teams Alabama Cal Michigan State and North Carolina competing in bars Bean Vault and floor 5 eastern time tomorrow right here on acc Network some talented wom out there go catch that go go watch them perform whenever theres numbers uh next to your team name that means youre really good at it yeah youre Elite youre Elite and these are two programs here in mens basketball that are used to having numbers next to their names Virginia and Syracuse unranked throughout this season and both programs committed to getting it back to the tradition the standard yeah I think its just a matter of time before we see both these teams Applause R Who do you think gets back to it first come on you know the answer you know you know true you know the answer the guy thats been using us and we uh throughout the first half yeah I think I Im at like uh I think youre under five I think Im under five Im going to try to stay under five tonight McNeely quick trigger cant connect Anthony Robinson the rebound and he draws the foul lamin says Im going straight up hes going straight up he might have got him with the body a little bit that A to B action I dont know he looks solid to me but you know nonetheless great Hustle by Robinson attacking the offensive glass doing whatever they need to do to cut this Applause lead the Virginia just nine of 23 from the floor one of eight from three theyre during this last 12 game stretch where theyre seven and five and the games theyve won its a simple game theyve shot the basketball really well and they have struggled in this first half yeah theyve struggled and they struggled to get good shots right the quality of shots they theyre not getting theyre turning over the ball theres no rhythm to their offense you know if youre watching Syracuse on the other end their pick and roll has been great theyre theyre doing what they want to do and Virginia cant seem to find their Rhythm lampin puts it up an in Eddie lampin 14 points of this first half he has such a soft touchdown there his right hand is really really soft mcne ancers and beats the buzzer and Virginia chips into a big Syracuse lead right before halftime final program but were going to fix this Eddie lampin wont be able to enjoy that success you want to get more wins for guys like him yeah you do you know you want to get more wins for guys like him cuz hes has such a great attitude he plays hard every single night he defends his teammates at all costs uh hes just a guy that you would love to have on your team how does Virginia turn this around in the second half well I think it starts by taking care of the ball right you cant turn over the ball and expect to win games um obviously they got to put some points up on the board but taking care of the balls they should be their primary Applause focus battle for the ball Falls to Starling 15 seconds duel to shoot plenty of time Taylor got it Lucas Taylor nothing but the bottom of the net again Lucas Taylor great start for Syracuse a 20po lead for the orange and Virginia still struggling defensively and this is a Cavaliers team with the backbone of this program as Buchanan gets it plus the foul yeah I mean hes hes you know he hes definitely a big piece to their team that was a nice play pick and roll going strong right at Eddie Lampton and using that left hand to Finish Well Syracuse this season its been that you a Seinfeld guy Im not a huge Seinfeld guy but I its a I heard you can take the reservation but you cant keep the reservation they can take the lead but they failed to keep the lead you take a look at those last three losses they led by double digits in the second half in all three games and lost all of them listen thats not going to happen tonight but yes they do have a little bit of trouble uh keeping the lead Applause a collision on the inside Adrian arrey not happy with the call def number two goes again Applause Syracuse so could this be the game the final one of the regular season where Syracuse could see a double digit second half lead to the Finish Line well I mean look its a place where you want to be no matter what right you want to be in this double digit lead you want to be up you know 17 with 18 minutes left its giving you a chance to win they just need to keep doing what theyre doing sticking to their principles defend and keep running the pick and roll and finding the bigs down low dominate the paint in this half Elijah Saunders rocks the rim and again this is what Virginia needs right they they need some buckets they need some some energy they need some juice right seems like theyve all been silent out there you know dont accept that you know be vocal you know get your teammates going and I think more than anything Virginia just needs to string together those defensive stops theyve struggled to do it that rims in count it plus the foul Eddie lampin continues the feast yeah I mean again its its its the pick and roll the dive to the rim theyve been doing it the whole night you know Virginia cant stop it well you say they cant stop it in the first half they allowed more than 40 points for just the 12th time and the last 149 games what a that and they have struggle to get stops of the second half as well as Syracuse extends the lead to 18 and here goes Syracuse again with the pressure Virginia has been stifled on the offensive end Canon goes into lampin puts it home for two and now Virginias running a little bit of pick and roll on their own the Virginias made their last three shots but theyve struggled to get stops they get one there right on Q oh DayDay Ames turns it into two taking care of the ballia starting to force some turnovers of their own and make it four straight makes for the Cavaliers seems like Virginia has woken up a little bit see what Syracuse does they go down to their bread and butter Starling a three no good follows his own Miss rips down the rebound com harc Im going right back to Eddie L well hes got 17 points Lucas Taylor takes it himself and that rattles home go to Lucas Taylor now Im with you though l 8 for n 17 points senior night hes been the dude hes just been a positive play every single time down and a block on the defensive end lamin doing it on both ends Lin calling for it on the Block Starling backs it Applause out starling to the corner Taylor the hot hand continues Lucas Taylor his third three of the night hey theyre getting good looks you find a rhythm you let guys get going early thats what happens it becomes they get in a rhythm they catch and shoot nothing with the bottom of the Applause net Saunders wide open three cant answer those are the ones Virginia needs to knock down if theyre going to come back in this game what a good look Syracuse shooting near 60 on the night Starling leaves it short some contact Applause there Saunders takes it inside this time lot more successful yeah a thats a tough strong move right you want to see more out of that from Saunders got to be aggressive got to be aggressive you want to cut this lead down got to keep being aggressive to the rim especially if youre one of the goto guys on this team and you got somebodys got to take control and take charge of the game kick out Davis good look cant connect if youan it fouls lamin on the rebound number Music Z Eddie lkin with a big time block then Syracuse retriev the ball kicks it out to Luke Taylor for the corner pocket three Music ball you know everybody wants to see North Carolina in the tournament so come on true you think the brand actually could a tieer 100 wow no doubt about it what about the Integrity no Im teasing Im just say I think youre right but a lot of people are scared to say that out loud so I give you credit um when you take a look at the ACC tournament for North Carolina you said if they have a solid ACC tournament what constitutes as solid thats a good question I mean I think they have to advance you know I I think they have to at least ah I dont know I dont thats thats tough to call they got to make a run they have to make some sort of run I dont know what that looks like I dont know how many games but it but it has to be significant enough for them to for people to watch North Carolina and say you know what let me ask you this do you think theres an NC State like team from a year ago that makes a run so right now Duke Clemson and louiser in is there a fourth team that makes a run and either wins it or does enough to secure a spot like a North Carolina it would if it was a a team it would for me it would be North Carolina I mean the only other two teams that I can think of really are are Georgia Tech and and and uh Wake Forest but I I I I doubt it right the only the only team that I have you know semi confidence in to do that is North Carolina but even then I think its a th line I think before tonight Virginia fans were hoping maybe they could make some noise they had been playing a lot better on seven of their last last 12 ACC games where they have really struggled to shoot the ball tonight 26 of their 37 points have come in the paint just one of 10 from three and with a win the Cavaliers would secure that first round by be the number nine seed even with the loss believe they have the tiebreaker against Virginia Tech so they would be locked in to nine win or lose great steal by Eddie lamp he having active hands and Carlos catches in in transition thats a tough layup by Carlos and hes been playing really well these past couple of games right maybe not the numbers shown but hes controlled the pace of the game he hes making the right plays he doesnt Force anything he hes really shown that hes a a good point guard for this te were talking ACC tournament as Virginia calls a timeout well take a look at the bracket that is set as we step aside when we come back Music going in with a big win against Virginia going to Florida State you know can grind out a tough win and then you know anything can happen in the SMU game hey and for Virginia this is not the performance you want to go into postseason play with that could be the shot in the arm the Cavaliers need Anthony Robinson in perfect position for the follow fly that was a big time slam right there you see Virginia switching up the defense a little bit a little looks like a maybe a a one two two now theres plenty of time in this game for Virginia and Syracuse has struggled throughout the season to keep leads they forced a turnover there and their last three losses Syracuse is led by double digits in the second half in all of them but failed to get it to the finish line and you can see coach arrey is not playing games at all hes bringing JJ right back in Robinson couldnt get the Finish but a foul called hes given Virginia a good boost off the bench we just took a look at the ACC tournament which is now locked in that is no longer a projection last meeting between these two teams January 4th when they met in the regular season Florida State got the better of Syracuse and now a rematch slated for Tuesday night yeah I mean I think Syracuse is is a little bit of a different team right now theyre playing really really well defensively theyre playing well that that match up between Malik Y and Eddie lamp get is something to look forward to we were talking with Adrien ay before the game and we were asking him so what needs to change for next season and he goes Im not dodging your question but I owe it to these guys to give my everything my full attention to the rest of this season including the ACC tournament before you turn that page yeah I I mean credit to coach a right hes staying in the moment hes not looking too far ahead you know he knows he wants to bring in you know some guys for this team and for this program but you know all his attention is on you know whats right now and you know credit to him for that Starling draws the foul trying to lip it off the contact in the paint hes all right hes got on those high top Kobes Virginia what did you play in I played in Nikes was a Nike guy low tops yeah those are sharp you didnt play in anything as nice as that no I didnt I I didnt have that swag I didnt have the headband the tights hanging below the shorts you would have done pretty well uh nier I I I would have done all right I asked beheim on air one time I said what do you think my bag would be looking like if uh if nil was going on whats so interesting is you know you played just over 10 years ago for this Syracuse program and you were saying your freshman year you came off the bench 10 minutes a game now he was being generous with the that 10 minutes too I dont remember 10 minutes a night for me what do you remember I remember two to three possessions and I was coming sitting right next to GMAC and and coacha McNeely missed fires there battle for the ball one by cuff good hustle its a different era though it is the Freshman need to play right away Syracuse has a great class coming in and those freshmen will be getting a lot more minutes than you did oh absolutely and you got to its its a new its a new day and age cant lose any freshmen that that are you know talented these days got to play them now Syracuse in the driver seat an 18point lead with Under 12 to play Music Music well Syracuse got off to a strong start and theyve maintained it so far in this second half its the second halfs that have hurt this orange team throughout the season but an 18point lead on Under 12 to play what do you think has been different tonight for this Syracuse team I think its the defensive intensity man I mean they have played so well on the defensive end since the beginning of the game theyve been picking up full court theyve been making it tough on this Virginia team to get in their sets to find any sort of Rhythm at all I I think the defense is is does it for me and on the offensive Ed Eddie lampin 17 points Lucas Taylor 13 have led the way those two guys sitting on the bench right now for the orange though a beautiful play out of the timeout Anthony Robinson delivers a rimrocker thats a great set right Applause there but Cloud couldnt hang on underneath in Virginia so out of the timeout they get get a great set out of the timeout and then Force the turnover on the other end yeah I mean thats exactly how You want to come out of a timeout a nice easy two and then a turnover you see right here they set the back screen for Robinson and he catches a great lob what a set for this Virginia team thats exactly what they needed coach Drew that up perfectly can Virginia string together some positive momentum backto back baskets mcne delivers that one and the lead down to 14 yeah I this this this one 31 Zone has been you know has been uh giving Syracuse some trouble they need to find a guy in the middle lamin and Taylor back into the game those two have been the Catal tonight didnt sit long good pass finds Carlos who drills the three jquan Carlos thats a big shot if Syracuse could move the ball side to side they have the alley with the guy down Applause low Robinson set the screen wasnt ready for the pass Sharma improvises there and draws the foul big three by Carlos number twoj St thats his first def number six sh will be at the line for Two Applause Shots Sharma knocks down the first hean Sharma The Freshman from Milton Ontario Applause Music limited minutes this season but makes them both from the line and Virginia settles back into their Zone before that Carlos 3 and had certainly disrupted the orange offense which has been in a good Rhythm tonight shooting 56 from the floor and Eddie lampin is open down low if they can just find him maybe it came too late there went five hole right through the legs of lamin yeah just got to take care of the ball cant keep turning the ball Applause over go Kofi hes been hunting

he needed to get out of the state of Texass home state and goes to Colorado where it didnt work and then finally found a safe harbor here at Syracuse a great article written this week by Mike Waters syracusecom his sister Reza quoted this is the happiest Ive ever seen him I just wish he could have found Syracuse sooner and you just felt like lampin put it together both on the court off the court and a great story despite a disappointing season when you look at the record yeah I mean you can see his energy every single time that he comes in you know I mean he he he gives energy he does you know all the right things out there and you know he you know hes just seems like such a great kid such a great teammate you know hes really found a home at Syracuse and uh you know he hes you know he he hes a special guy checks out for nem McLoud with the orange leading by 14 and red ay told us how much hes enjoyed coaching Eddie lampin this season despite again not having the success that they hoped 9 minutes remaining in regulation Syracuse still in the drivers seat with the 14point lead Starling in traffic throws it up and draws the Applause foul Syracuse has done a good job tonight getting to the foul line where theyre 11 to 15 two more coming here from Starling Starling averaging 18 points per game on the season he scored 10 or more in every game but two and only four points tonight that free throw rims out from Starling nothing but net Crew live from Greensboro site of the ACC womens tournament going on right now Championship Sunday theyll have the preview for you at noon and the post game at 3 right here on acc Network five Virginia Duke with a big upset win against Notre Dame anything can happen it postseason play Anything Can Happen and as the mens tournament tips off on Tuesday we saw a year ago NC State is a 10 seed win at all you just never know you think this is the year that its all chalk and and a Duke wins it theyve been so good and if they do I wouldnt be surprised but I also wouldnt be surprised if somebody comes from the clouds to win it yeah I mean wouldnt be surprised if Duke wins it right they theyve been dominant all season they play great they play together theyre so poised out there um you know theyre obviously the heavy Applause favorite and Virginia could very well face the Blue Devils in that quarterfinal they have a first round by but well have Georgia Tech in the 89 game with the winner taking on Duke yeah I mean that Dukes a tall task man I dont know you know what its going to take to beat that ball Club well Clemson did it once in ACC play Clemson has the talent to do so I think Clemsons poised for a a deep postseason run El leite ate a year ago wouldnt surprise if they get back there or even one round further the final four yeah it wouldnt surprise me either theyve got the the depth theyve got the age Sharma cant connect from the corner and heres the thing about the ACC everybody year in and year out feels like for the last three years the Leagues down the Leagues down the Leagues down you look at the metrics over the last three postseason NCAA tournaments they are by far the best league when you look at the results as McLoud hammers it home yeah I mean listen when I watch the ACC and I watch I know the records arent great but I compare them to some of the other teams in the other conferences and know even the the mid tier teams in the ACC I I think match up very well great play thats a big time play a big time charge on the defensive end Virginia still struggling offensively its allowed Syracuse to be comfortable in this second half a 16point lead for the Music orange look at that 89 matchup you can get preing if F Ron Sanchez on the flight back to charlotts Virginia beat Georgia Tech 7561 when they met about a month ago theyll have to bounce back particularly on the offensive end they have really never found their offensive footing in credit Syracuse defensively for making things difficult yeah I mean Virginias played a little bit better you know this second half but you know still overall I mean you know Syracuse has been defending great and theyve got no answer for Eddie lampin hell get two free throws here with an opportunity to make it 21 points to his name tonight I mean Jay you said it you said it before the game right Eddie lamin is is going to have a field day tonight you know against you know these Virginia bigs because you know hes so big and so strong and you know he can use the hes got a soft touch around the rim Syracuse could really take advantage of it and he and they have just feels like hes playing his best basketball at the end of this season Applause absolutely a season high of 26 points against North Carolina five games ago and hes just carried it throughout the home stretch of this regular season 21 points tonight as he sinks them both from the line feed him well they have its an inexperienced Virginia front court that has been a weakness throughout the season for the Cavaliers and theyve had no answer for lamp on the inside tonight the other thing thats played Virginia usually can count on Isaac being Neely to knock down a couple of Threes with the Cavaliers one of 12 from three their only success offensively has come inside like that yeah I mean it just doesnt seem like they have a rhythm you know they got no Pace to their offense theyre not moving the ball well like theyve theyve had some plays where you know theyve been somewhat successful but for the most part good pressure there full court pressure and it pays off Andrew roie the steel puts it up for two yeah big time steal for them you know they still got plenty of time they got seven minutes thats thats long right its only a 14point game Dave has been quiet in this second half draws the Applause Music foul second personal deep foul Davis will be at the line for Two Shots Monday night well debut our documentary chronicling last seasons NC State mens and womens basketball teams magical runs to the final four never seen before footage in interviews with players and coaches the 1hour special why not both Premier 7 Eastern Monday right here on a ACC Network what time is it Sy the ETC State womens team plays for an ACC Championship tomorrow against Duke whereas the mens team doesnt even qualify for the postseason tournament this season what a difference a year makes bottom three teams not making it for the first time this year as that rims out from DayDay a so red ay told us before the game and I agree with him I dont like these three teams missing the post season tournament I I think you put in the work day in and day out you deserve to play in I agree your conf tournament you deserve to play in your conference tournament these guys travel from the west coast to the east coast you know they they work hard all year long they deserve a because you never know when an NC State can happen exactly you never know you never know thats the beauty of basketball its a beauty of sport lampin trying to shake off some contact hes all right its senior night Shake It Off hes got 21 to lead the orange 15point lead for Syracuse 5 and 12 minutes left to play catch and shoot thats the type of night has been for Lucas Taylor I dont think hes touched rim on any of his shots pure sure and they if did they count that as a two oh no that was a three ball it was a three man I mean look at listen they just need to run play for him to get shots in the corner at this point you cant you cant he doesnt hit the Rim Yeah four threes and I think theyve all been nothing but the bottom of the net and two of them have been La you know shot clock running down Hees Hees step backs right back to Taylor offensive foul called against Lucas Taylor tlor coach Ary does not like that that call I think they called him for a push off the red Entre is hot over on the Syracuse sideline I think hes throwing its the same call on the other end and I I I cant I cant blame him I Ive seen the the same hook on the other end and it hasnt been called all game long I dont understand why we call it now little makeup little makeup they give rre what he was hollering for there it Applause is and thats four fouls against Blake Buchanan he has to come Applause out heres lampin dumps it to Davis for two those two have been terrific Jer Davis and Eddie lampin dynamic duo tonight in the regular season finale Im telling you whenever hes touched the ball its been a positive play whether if its a score foul you know or or you know an assist MC NE answers with a three those have been few and far between only the second made three tonight for Virginia and McNeal first after missing his first five attempts from Beyond The Arc MCN even though he misses early man hes got to keep shooting you know any open look hes got to put it up on this team you know they dont have too many Dynamic scorers you know sometimes the best shot is you know him taking the ball to the hoop or scoring the ball Andie lampin you know its coming you still cant stop it cant stop it cant stop wont stop Eddie lampin lets go 10 of 11 from the field his final game in the dome what a performance three shy of a season high and I hope he gets it good answer count it plus the foul Day Day a aim still battling for Virginia as they cut it to 14 Addie lamin doing his thing orang up by 14 get the baby out the street right final game of the regular season and that means its our final game here at Syracuse great control room theyve been doing it all season long we got Scotty and Liam up top and uh our camera operators every home game this season Duffy this is this is a veteran crew here its here Syracuse theres Scott and then ham who uh has been doing it since I was a student here at Syracuse love seeing him there he is under the basket Old Reliable uh El Guapo our audio guy here at Syracuse otherwise known as Bill and these are the people behind the scenes that you never see that have made every Syracuse home basketball game go this year Michael Carter Williams J aler with you on the air thats who you unfortunately have to deal with but these are all the people that make it happen behind the scenes you got Greg our TD Jake and pton in replay Melissa and Scott in graphics Kristen Hennessy our producer David tasa our director and Neil and Bill our engineer quality dudes right there man they make the show go yeah were nothing without them and theyve been doing it throughout a long season greatly greatly appreciate it not just here at Syracuse but every ACC school what they do behind the scenes to bring these games to life absolutely and Syracuse on the court theyve saved the best for last for This Crew thats been watching this team all season a difficult season worst record in more than 50 years you wouldnt know it by looking at this game in fact their largest margin of Victory with 17 points against Albany right now theyre up by 13 against the Virginia team that had been playing pretty well the last five weeks Starling no Davis the cham W thats a great pass right there STL and thats the type of night it has been for the orange Applause absolutely jday Ames cant answer lampin the rebound now during the break they reviewed Lucas Taylors three his foot was on the line so it only counted for two and a double double for lampin 14th dou double this season he has averaged a double double in ACC play and he has feasted tonight 23 and 10 backing down Kofi double team comes in passes out of it Starling right down the lane and hell get two at the line this is no doubt the best Syracuse has played offensively all season long I mean getting the ball in the inside to pass to the corner the Around the Horn to the dribble the dribble drivve just great Music basketball and this is a Virginia program that is not accustomed to giving up 80 under Tony Bennett Virginia only allowed 80 12 times in 500 games this will be the seventh game this year that theyve allowed 80 and I think you look at that and go okay no Tony Bennett I think thats a little bit of a lazy narrative you also lost two of the best defensive players in the ACC and Rees beakman and Ryan dun yeah yeah you know I think you know I dont get me wrong you know Bennett was an unbelievable coach but losing those two guys you know on the floor your best defenders you know I think that you know attributes to you know that conversation a little bit more um Its a combination its not just all Tony Bennett all Tony Bennett I think losing Ryan dun and Rees beakman hasnt been brought up enough this season its been just very easy and I use the word lazy to just go no Tony Bennett it all fall fell apart defensively I think even if Tony Bennett was there it might have been better but they still would have struggled defensively without beakman and Don who they failed to replace yeah absolutely I couldnt agree with you more on that Jay and look Ron Sanchez at ACC play one and six hes rallied this group in the last 12 to go seven and five although certainly far from their best tonight I still think he deserves a lot more credit than hes gotten throughout this season and you know its okay to be disappointed the standard is the standard as lampin adds another two one shy of a season High hey hes putting on a is mid post post game Clinic down there I think he needs to host a camp this summer post up post up Eddie Lin okay do you go to him one more time for the season High absolutely hes got 25 the season high is 26 against Carolina and red ay takes a timeout well step aside for 30 seconds As clearing the bench on senior night with the orange up big this is this is what we this is what we live for right here baby Music Applause Music Applause well with this game all but finished Syracuse in command here with a little more than a minute to go Adrien ay takes a time out to clear the bench on senior d Chaz Owens who is honored pregame looks to be coming in again we just shouted out the crew behind the scenes this is the equivalent right the practice players that do it every single day but dont get the credit on the court now coming in Anthony clayon another one from the Albany area yeah I mean this is great man I mean I mean they they deserve moments like this they come into practice they work hard every single day they never get the credit of what they do anything they do anything theyre f up they do you know this is this is unbelievable for them to to get to be here and to get minutes and and to be recognized I hope they perform well right now and this 17point lead would match Syracuses largest margin of Victory on the year and to do it on your final game of the regular season here at home been a disappointing year red arrey knows that John wild hack the athletic director spoke about it this year but to end on a high note here at home get the walk on in up 17 feels good oh it feels amazing and who gets the shot thats the question Tangled Up CH Davis still in there shot clock down the one nothing but air unfortunately for Anthony Clayton Applause oh we were just getting told that uh one of the WalkOns Chaz Owens had an earring in so couldnt get onto the floor so Jer Davis has stayed out there hes got he was trying to get his swag right from the court and Davis trying to get the turnover giving the WalkOns another chance CH and Virginia steals it back Sharma right down the lane for Applause two see Im the Im the type of guy Im down 15 the WalkOns are in Im letting him get one up at least red Entre saying to hold it final 15 seconds ticken down Anthony Clayton will go to the foul line with a chance to get into the box score Ben loves Music it look at the strong drive to the hoop creates the contact and look at the bench go crazy thats what its all about oh thats what its all about I remember uh my year when I think it was Albert Nasser that had a that had a bucket I mean Griff Hoffman had buckets Nick res had buckets might be the biggest Roar of the night biggest Roar Nolan hard head all my all my walk on guys I appreciate everything that they did got got him Che the final 10 seconds in the ACC regular season Sharma knocks down to three field goal and it is on to the ACC tournament which tips off Tuesday Syracuse lab Florida state in the 700 matchup and theyll go in with some momentum a 14point win to close out the regular season at the Dome
