So this is their third ACC game North Carolina meanwhile coming off a win at Kentucky They have beaten Kansas as well A challenge on the road for the Hoya against the Tar Hills and Georgetown Starts with the ball Rogers Ron Groover Bert Smith are officials today Hoya immediately go inside to Julius Haleifenua and Haleifenua who scored 16 and three of the last four games has the opening two as you look at the starting five for UNC all newcomers this year Ken Evans runs the point Luca Bogavots a junior from Montenegro Wilson Jiren Stevenson and Henry Vessar maybe the biggest front court in America 610 610 and 7 ft as we get an early Georgetown foul against Isaiah Abraham And you see just how much attention Caleb Wilson draws even when he doesnt have the basketball in his hand Isaiah Abraham did not want to allow Caleb Wilson to have any room to operate off that screen Ed Kulie talked about he wants to make sure this is a physical matchup against the Tar Hills here this evening We heard Akulie say a couple of times in shoot around take away their length with our strength So Georgetown which is unders sized in terms of height will try to be very physical with the heels Evans with a three That is a great sign for North Carolina Ken Evans who was 0 for seven from three in the last two games But of course when you get opportunity to get back in the front into your home confines and where the people are cheering for you it changes your energy and Evans able to get see one go through early Georgetown starting five featuring Henua whos rejected by Bessaras have a couple of great guards Malik Mack and Lewis preseason all big east Caleb Williams Isaiah Abraham and there is the first shot for Caleb Wilson the Tar Hills leading scoreer and thats going to be an advantage for North Carolina throughout this game Caleb Wilsons ability to score over the top of smaller defenders He will get many opportunities throughout this evening Lake Mack a step back three is too strong That balls out of bounds and it will go to North Carolina which is in year five under Hubert Davis This is so far and its early on the best offensive rebounding team hes had He feels like this is a group core that fits the identity he wants at Carolina We wont say the best offensive rebounding team hes had but one of the better ones He also mentioned to you of course with Harrison Ingram and Armando Bacott that was the best offensive rebounding team Heres a breakaway steel KJ Lewis puts it in Im only saying so far percentagewise they have the best but they havent faced the ACC schedule yet So well see if that indeed holds up But they are big much bigger than last years team which of course was the last team into the tournament Evans with a slithery move Hes got an early five and its 74 And its an encouraging sign for the Tar Hill faithful to see Evans off to an early aggressive start Thats what they need to see more of from him Mack hits a three over the 610 Stevenson Malik Mack 16 per game score And on the other side that ball is tied up and out of bounds as Lewis thought he had a jump Its out of bounds off of Lewis Ed Kulie year three at Georgetown big jump last year to 18 and 16 after a 9 and 23 season one Hes bringing this program really back from the depths of power conference college basketball And when you consider one of the best conversations that you can have is to spend time with Ed Kulie you walk away of course educated and entertained at the same time Evans around for three Theres Fesar Wilson with a third chance sticks it home But thats the true gift of Caleb Wilson his continuous motor He never slows down Hes always looking to be aggressive on both ends of the floor Wilsons got four Evans five and Buggots rebounds the jumper by Mack Good offensive start Heels are four for six Evans Stevenson for three in and out And thats really what the Tar Hills are waiting for Jiren Stevenson to start showing more of an aggressive attitude on the offensive end He is a very capable threepoint shooter Hasnt shown up yet in the box Theres a three for Lewis 35 from deep to give Georgetown the lead On paper it looks like a game where Georgetown has a guard advantage Carolina has the big Is that too simplistic It is not simplistic at all Its a great observation by you Mr Brown When you consider the fact that you know Malik Mack and KJ Lewis both combined to average close to 33 points a game when you think about these guys and their ability to be able to score the basketball more importantly how they can make plays attacking the paint on the other end of the floor when you think of Basar and Caleb Wilson you mentioned it early its one of the best front courts in the country those two guys especially when you consider as a starting lineup So the advantage up front is absolutely in favor of the Tar Hills but I believe the Hoya have the advantage in the back court Ed Cool is going to make a sub here Long conversation with Isaiah Abraham Abraham may have taken a shot on that play as well Looks like a little bit of a bloody mouth here for Isaiah Abraham Langston Love checked in for Abraham whos being looked at on the bench Boabots too deep from three off of Stevenson Itll go to the Hoya cheering But when you look at the Tarhill lineup Jiren Stevenson at 69 who plays a small forward position but can guard guards Thats the really what Hubert Davis loved so much about him And part of the reason why he went after him in the transfer portal is because of the job that Jiren Stevenson did a year ago in the SEC ACC challenge defending RJ Davis Hubert Davis recruited Jiren Stevenson out of high school but had no idea he had the ability to guard on the perimeter the way that he did And of course here we are a year later Hes the starting small forward for the Tar Hills Heres a steal for Evans North Carolina with the ball in the early stages Hasnt been at home for the last really three weeks Heres Wilson Hes short on a three Heels are one for their first five from deep and a foul underneath Thatll be the third against Georgetown Thats Hifanua with his first But thats that pressure that the Tar Hills put on you on that offensive glass Alifanua doesnt have much choice If he doesnt foul Bessar on that Besar gets second chance points Leanu is going to take a seat Jaden Fort Jeremiah Williams are in off the bench So Fort at 69 is the biggest player on the floor for Georgetown Jiren Stevenson out of the game Jonathan Powell is in the West Virginia transfer Wilson they like when hes doubled because they say hes such an elite passer And out of the double they ended up getting a good look for Powell who misses the three KJ Lewis driving off the back of the rim and Lewis has seven of the first 12 And its already double figures for the back court of Georgetown as we talked about Malik Mack knocking down the three cheering Wild pass by Wilson is stolen by Lewis Langston Love great shooter drills it That will be reviewed at the next timeout Its called a two on the floor So its 149 Georgetown Wilson now into the body of Caleb Williams He draws a foul by the Hoya Starting the game out ultra aggressive going against his former teammate Henry Basar attack Those two guys were together at Arizona last year and KJ told Henry pregame Im going to dunk on you today He text him and let him know But you see KJs numbers at Arizona 61 108 points per game for the last two seasons and the jump that hes made this year as the leading man for the Georgetown Hoyas Couple of steals too How about what Ed said at Big East media day He said I feel the Big East at Georgetown has the best defensive player in America in KJ Lewis And in classic Ed fashion he said Now Im writing his check and he has to cash it laughter But two and a half steals early leads a Big East 17 points six rebounds three assists The versatility Ed Coulie wanted he has gotten But I think its more just of a mentality I think he brings that aggressive mentality that Ed Kohley appreciates so much When you think back of the guys that hes coached you go back to Chris Dunn You look at the different players that hes put in the NBA KJ Lewis fits right into that mold of an athletic combo guard that can score but more importantly affects the game on both ends Lewis with seven of the 14 The Langston Love shot was reviewed and remained at two So 1411 is the Georgetown lead Heres Caleb Williams backing down Powell Williams rises way off the top of the glass and tracked down by Vessard Heres the freshman Derek Dixon for the first time Cory I was going to say Derek Dixon in the game now The hero from the win at Kentucky Score the final Well scored five points down the stretch including a gamewinner applause scores it Dip Bogots attacking the rim is able to get the hoop and the harm Picks up the foul on Caleb Williams who Boots off the bounce Known much more for his shooting but has the ability to be a playmaker as well Its one of the things that Huber Davis talked to us about prior his ability to pass and make plays off the bounce complement his shooting and absolutely compliment this team And its a big foul Its the second on Caleb Williams with 1439 to go Georgetowns leading scoreer the last two games will take a seat Theyre averaging over 20 points per game in the last two had 23 verse Miami Five of 10 from beyond the threepoint arc So his production will absolutely be missed especially when you consider that one of the two Ed says theres one of two ways theyre going to beat North Carolina in this game Theyre either going to outrebound them or theyre going to make 13 threes Well Caleb Williams is their best threepoint shooter Theyre going to need production from him Heres Lewis Little seal from Halifanua and a terrific finish for Lewis whos four for four for nine If you remember Hubert Day was telling us that shoot around earlier today where the Tar Hills need to be better Uhoh Great pass by Wilson Then a better rejection by Lewis on Powell What havent What hasnt Lewis done in this game Hes able to hes unable to get the three to go but hes done it all really in the first six minutes of this contest Nine points two rebounds an assist a block and two steals Bogots known for two rebounded by Fort Back to Hubert Davis He was telling us they have to do a better job of protecting the paint whether its off the drive or through postups And you see KJ Lewis on the previous possession able to attack with really little to no resistance for the reverse layup Lewis operates again Good find inside the bucket Missed at the rim by Fort Dixon bounces for Powell Around and out Carolina just one for seven from three Jeremiah Williams now Terrific turn through the lane and a finish for Williams Nice take by Jeremiah Williams really going one on three on that possession but not deterred Able to use the rim as a shield for the reverse layup Uhoh He just got hit hard by Zaden High Got taken out on a screen We could hear Williams You probably could hear him in the upper deck as he crashed to the ground and he was holding his shoulder Yeah Grabbing at that right shoulder and just immediately like right in front of us See Williams trying to fight through the screen by Zaden High that right shoulder and immediately reacting No foul called on the play Just a hard screen by Zaden High as Williams who has been a real connector for this team is helped to his feet and hes going to walk immediately into the locker room Georgetown is already shorthanded today They were without their big man Vincy Wuku whos going to be reevaluated He had a medical procedure late November reevaluated after 6 to eight weeks And then Desan Harris Smith is out for personal reasons So they are down a couple of players already And now down another in Williams Yeah Desan Harris Smith a strong physical guard transfer from Maryland who gives Ed Culie depth off the bench Another playmaker as well So without Williams and Harris Smith the depth in this back court drops off significantly for the Hoy Jaden Young getting some minutes for North Carolina Hadnt had a lot of those of late Evans and Dixon in the game together Evans leans into a three at the end of the shot clock Its high and tried to save it Was out of bounds but gives a high a lot of credit Once again thats another offensive rebounding opportunity And thats going to be a struggle for the Hoy As you look at the lineup theres still a smaller lineup in comparison to the Tar Hills Even with Caleb Wilson on the bench you put Jiren Stevenson now at the four position hes still 69 Alifanua from Malik Mack Mack former Harvard Crimson Rookie of the Year in the Ivy League spins it out Thats old WCAC matchup right there Mack from St Johns Derek Dixon from Gonzaga Those guys Im sure have a little history playing against each other Couple of former Gatorade players of the year in DC Two years removed Young inside to Vesar Double team comes quickly Leaves Dixon alone Hixon starting to play with more and more confidence as a freshman took getting a more responsibility from Duba Davis and taking advantage of it Alai Fenua unable to answer off the rebound Here is Dixon who was the hero in Lexington on Tuesday with five points in the final minute Heres Dixon again Hard screen by Vesar Dixon foul line jumper is good But you can see after that performance in Lexington Derek Dixon comes into the game hes playing with so much more confidence And its often what you see from guards especially at North Carolina You think back in years past how their freshman guards have just grown in the nonconference game by game Hills are back in front only for a moment as Langston Love scores and gets fouled Returning Georgetown to the lead at the TWing Kentucky Tuesday was Derek Dixon with a late game takeover Two go ahead shots the threepointer and then this gamewinning layup for the freshman out of Vienna Virginia went to Gonzaga and DC What a state championship there as North Carolina won in Lexington The threepointer with 53 seconds to go for the layup with 167 to go We asked Hubert Davis about Derek Dixon today Cory He said I saw three plays and I said Lets offer that kid a scholarship That was all he needed Well he saw his basketball IQ He saw his feel and knows that Derek Dixon is a basketball player that could absolutely help them But I got to give a shout out to his pops John who went to James Madison I used to actually hang out with John over at James Madison And it is a miserable day to be a UVA wondered if you were going to go there Its one thing for us to lose in the ACC championship right Uhhuh I mean you know much shout out to to my guys for making it to the AC Amazing year right Amazing year But to lose and let JMU in Do you know how many family members friends that I have that texted me as soon as the interception was thrown in overtime thanking me for JMU making it into the college football playoff And more importantly JMU gets in before Virginia absolutely does that That in itself is torture enough for a UVA fan I dont know how many but I think at halftime were going to run the full highlights of the Sunb Belt and ACC championships if you want to stick around for that laughter So youre just going to pour salt on the moon By the way Jeremiah Williams is back on the bench for Georgetown after taking that hard hit to the right shoulder That shoulders wrapped up Someone who has dealt with that and had shoulder injuries etc If Jeremiah Williams comes back into this game he is the toughest man on earth Im telling you that right now I had to sleep sitting up in a chair for two months with a shoulder injury And so if youre able to come back and play that is one courageous young man Shot clock down to six as Williams watches on the Georgetown bench Heres Vesar for three Vesar has that in his game and more importantly finds the spot inside the zone at the with the shot clock going down to be able to knock down a three ball at a crucial point Seven for 16 on the year and Carolinas back on top Lewis well off the mark as Caleb Wilsons got his second rebound Wilson trying to go coast to coast will draw the foul Driving it into Jaden Fort Georgetown is zone defensively on underneath out of bounds play And you see Vessar really just sneaking into the open spot as the zone is extended to try to keep the basketball away from the guard Smart play by the big fella whos going up against a former teammate today Great that those guys still have a relationship but enemies here to this evening Tuesday night the 31st annual Jimmy V Classic at the Garden on ESPN and the ESPN app Great double hitter starting with Clemson against number nine BYU Then 15th ranked Florida and fifth ranked Yukon the last three national championships won by those two schools Always a wonderful night for one of the great causes we have here at ESPN Go to vorg to donate to the V Foundation today I love this from North Carolina pressuring full court but thats the one thing that cannot happen against the press You cannot get beat and allow the ball handler to split that trap because it puts your defense in such a tough predicament as Lewis is able to attack Vessar on that possession Yeah he didnt get the dunk that he called but he laid it in strong over his old teammate as Bogamots answers with the three And and Lewis never considered giving that basketball up He saw his former teammate waiting back there and Im attacking him going straight to the chest Lewis has 11 but Carolinas lead is four Theyve gotten hot and hit their last four shots Alifenua looking for a cutter Lewis was covered up by Stevenson Heres Kavon Moretti sophomore from Worcester A tough two at the end of the shot clock is grabbed and put back in by Fort Thats not something that Caleb Wilson is used to Hes used to being the guy thats bullying someone and coming up with offensive rebound Hes not used to being the guy that gets bullied Evans rolls it home in a first half seven for the seven point per game score 2925 about nine to go in this first half Lewis leading Georgetown with 11 Malik Macks only got three Mack has the ball right now against Evans Mack behind the back and he draws a foul against Evans Just the third in the half on Carolina Evans first KJ Lewis splitting the trap and then of course has advantaged basketball But even twoonone he never considered giving that basketball up Hes practiced against Henry Bessar too many times to know that he can go right to the big mans chest If thats not his old teammate is he giving the ball up Yeah he might have thought about it Yeah 13 for Lewis right now with half of Georgetowns points What a find by Mack Good That was a find that was much better than the shot it got Alleadua keeps it alive Shot clocks at four Ball didnt hit Ram Didnt hit anything Mack short for three and Vesar grabs the bobbled rebound Those are the plays that you would just pray that a guy makes a shot so you can see the pass Once again that pass was unbelievable by Malik Knight BESSAR ON THE POCKET pass from Evans in a Georgetown timeout The pass from Evans nowhere near as spectacular However the finish from Bessar was even more spectacular A simple pocket pass gets a big dunk away from cancer You see the UNC memorial pictures there Stew in the North Carolina shirt Tar Hill class of 87 wide receiver defensive back news and sports reporter And appropriate that we honor Stu today Cory because in just three days were going to get a 30 for30 Were really looking forward to on ESPN Wednesday night Booyah A portrait of Stuart Scott I will absolutely be locked in 900 pm when you consider that Steuart Scott truly changed the culture of sports on television Again I can remember just tuning in to see what he would say next Of course Steuart Stock more importantly cheering a proud representative and alumnest of the University of North Carolina but he paved the way to really truly be yourself on television and he brought a different culture into watching Sports Center I mean Sports Center at the time was mustsee TV when youve got Steuart Scott coming on and just the different you know cohost that he had alongside him It it really did change the culture of how we view television watching Steuart Scott I dont want to age myself but I will I was probably 9 10 years old watching Stuart Scott Yeah When I said when I said we I wasnt talking about you to to a 9yearold kid its like the coolest most mindblowing thing in the world And by the way its still just as mindblowing all these years later By the way were talking about the V Foundation the Steuart Scott Cancer Research Fund set up after Steus passing which awards grants to scientists who are addressing racial disparities in cancer outcomes opportunities to researchers from underrepresented groups So vorgstewart thats how you can support that fund in Stuarts honor Uh not just VW week celebrating the life of Jim Valvano here but Steuart Scott and the cancer research fund Again thats vorgstewart orgste on our minds as we celebrate North Carolina on this Sunday By the way on the floor theres Jeremiah Williams who you now have to call the toughest guy youve ever seen He absolutely is He Hes the toughest guy when you consider the way he went down with that shoulder injury to be back on the court right now recognizing that there will be more contact to that shoulder Hes the toughest guy Absolutely the toughest guy in this game Dixon misses a three and its rebounded by Powell and then turned over by Bogabot Heres Lewis again But look at the steal and look at the two points Thats Williams sticking his nose in there Was not fearful of guarding Caleb Wilson on the block Comes away with the steal and turns it into two points on the other end Four points off the bench Powell spins out a three Rebound to Lewis And Georgetown hanging tough here as Lewis tries to burst his way past Powell and hes cut off Im not even sure if Williams has the wrap on the shoulder He took it off but hes got Jay Williams on And when you consider that theres another guy by the name that had Jay Williams on his jersey the junkyard dog JYD and hes about as tough as that guy Wilson too tall for Vesar Backtoback turnovers for the Tarheelss You can see Williams not afraid at all as hes defending Caleb Williams does great job positioning himself to come up with the steal and then running the floor and is able as you see look how he goes down I mean the immediate pain in that right shoulder but just like that back on the floor and not only back on the floor back on the floor performing when his team needs you already You mentioned theyre already down Deshawn Harris Smith dont have a lot of depth in the back court Caleb Williams floats it off the rim Hes back in the game with two fouls Sat for about six and a half minutes But Carolinas brought Stevenson back in for Bogavot Stevenson has yet to score just one shot Wilson with eight Evans with seven Vesar and Dixon with five for the balanced Tarheelss And and right now Caleb Williams has to be very careful playing against Caleb Wilson on the block with those two fouls You dont want to put yourself in position to pick up another one But as North Carolina continues to hustle and come up with an offensive rebound Roger is going to stop play here The shot clocks at 20 which should not be the case Now its a 30 which certainly shouldnt So the Hoya actually had possession of the basketball and throwing it back in So instead of it being a 20 second reset to the shot clock its a new shot clock which results in turnover for the Hoya which would be just the second turnover for Georgetown Ed Koulies team the lowest turnover rate in the nation just edging out Penn State Stevenson The Hoya is now in the zone trying to see if they can neutralize what North Carolina does on the interior Nice job here defensively Little change up from Ed who wants this to be a team that has an edge defensively Williams inside Fort stopped by Vessar applause and Fort thought he had avoided the defender going to the other side of the basket but Besar is on the other side Nothing but trees along that front line for the Tar Hills Second block for their leading shot blocker of the year Powell long two is good Powell who continues to play with more confidence as well Knocked down two hu huge threes against Kentucky in that threepoint win And hes starting to solidify his spot as a reserve that Hubert Davis can count on Williams Hale Fenua He is denied but fouled by Caleb Wilson who got him low Its the first against Wilson North Carolina doing the job on both ends of the floor You think you get away from one of the trees but the other catches you on the other side And then Jonathan Powell going to the midrange to pull up knocking down the twopoint basket extending the lead to four for the Tar Hills Besar has now got five points five rebounds two assists and two blocks A very wellrounded game for the Estonian junior Told you about the mens Jimmy B Classic on Tuesday the 24th annual womens Jimmy B Classic Wednesday night Iowa State hosting Iowa in a top 12 matchup 7 Eastern on ESPN and the ESPN app You will see at the moment at least the number one score in the country Audi Krooks 27 a game for the Cyclones Getting the job done A true post player which you dont see as many of in todays game But Audi Crook shooting 74 from the field Again that is automatic Anytime you throw it in there youre normally going to get a bucket So you got to give this young lady a tremendous amount of props for the performance hes had throughout this season And Iowa obviously a couple of national title game appearances in recent years Theyre still a great program and Iowa State right there with him A great matchup Wednesday night 7 Eastern Vesar the long step through Hell go to the line for one more with a couple of roars But how about the energy the effort after the bucket Thats what they love to see here in the Dean E Smith Center The emotion of Henry Vesar after the bucket great footwork the up and under step through allows him to finish but you see the emotion afterwards Excited about his effort and wants his teammates to join along Its a second foul on Jaden for the back up big for Georgetown as Vesar is up to seven points for the game averaging 16 points eight and a half rebounds per game on the year KJ Lewis is now leaving the floor for Georgetown They already lost Jeremiah Williams for a good chunk of this first half And now remember the Georgetown staff is checking on Lewis at the end of the bench Vessar continues his wellrounded game with a threepoint play and this matches the largest lead for North Carolina which pressures again More pressure that time they were able to stay solid in the trap But Georgetown very well prepared We saw Ed Kohley working on the pressure in their shootound earlier today He knew they were going to press and he also really invites it He feels like that gives them opportunities on the offensive end Max had a quiet first half Leans in to Dixon who did really well to disrupt that shot 65 freshman We thought he disrupted shots very well in a win over Kentucky Not just the baskets at the end Vessar from Powell Another finish And thats the second time theyve been able to get Bessar on that pocket pass And hes able to finish right at the rim Georgetown right now struggling with that side pick and roll coverage No help there to take the big fella away from the basket Jeremiah Williams into Vessar Couldnt finish Landed hard again Rebound spills out to Bogamots One more Powell No cheering Got a great look in transition One of the things that Ed Kohley talked to us about was their defensive transition Dodged a bullet on that possession Powell got a great look out of the corner Mack sticks it in for two His second make First thing Ed Coulie said he just walked up to us and just said Defensive rebounding in transition Defensive rebounding in transition Vesar again going to work Wipe off the bucket He was fouled before he started the move But Vesar has got 10 of the last 18 for UNCC And Bessar has been aggressive attacking the rim A number of nice pocket passes has allowed the big fella to find his way and then hes done it on his own as well They absolutely are Coach Greenberg and talking with Seth Trimble earlier today theyre targeting right around Christmas give or take a few days when you consider he wants to come back against Ohio State on December 20th I I think thats a little bit aggressive but Seth Trimble has truly appreciated his time away from being able to play but still leading this team doing a tremendous job Five points the North Carolina lead KJ Lewis with 11 Caleb Wilsons got eight Henry Vessar makes the first of a one and one The foul before break was a critical one It was the second on Julius Hale Fenua Georgetown starting center and the Hoya who are a little underman again No Vincy Wuku for the rest of the calendar year No Deshawn Harris Smith today for personal reasons Now have three players with two fouls including Caleb Williams their leading scoreer the last two games Hifenua and Jaden Fort with seven points the North Carolina lead Two and a half to go in this first half Danger zone for Georgetown to not let this slip away before the break Thats a good start Hifanua gets the feed and scores it But I love the attack by Malik Mack getting downhill as Georgetown once again retreats back into the zone trying to see if they can protect their guys in foul trouble But the problem with the zone it opens up opportunities on the offensive glass where North Carolina is so strong Wilson with a pretty spin around and score Hes in the double figures and he just shows off his ability to score the basketball in so many different ways Hubert Davis made it plain If he faces up as a defender what can you do And thats often why weve seen so many different defenders in his way for the Ooy A three for Hifanua Just his third of the year Hes got the last five for the Hoya Dixon Carolina trying to find a soft spot That will do But Wilson couldnt finish That was a late pass though The the problem with the pass and again its small things but small things matter so much in this game The pass had too much arc on it in comparison to Mo line drive that gets there quicker and allows Caleb to finish that home Off a missed three by Love Tar Hills leading by four shooting 48 Georgetown 44 Teams have both struggled from three Wilson Stevenson Dixon got it Great ball movement all initiated by Caleb Wilson Attacking the basket and getting rid of the basketball putting Georgetown in rotation opens up another opportunity for Derek Dixon who is playing great basketball Hai Fenua down to Jeremiah Williams He lands near the left shoulder and he got bumped and fouled Caleb Wilson draws so much attention as you see him catch the basketball He immediately goes into attack mode but that puts the Hoya look at all the jerseys in the same area Puts the Hoya in rotation allowing Derek Dixon to find another great look beyond the arc Dixons got eight His season high which he tied last game was nine Its a nonshooting foul against Davidson And as the crowd saw the replay they found some fault with it So Williams will inbound It was a six and a half on Carolina Heres a miss shot by Seal Joff in the lane His first action and the offensive rebound and the putback Langston Love with all the foul trouble Ed Kulie going to get both Caleb Williams and Alan Dua out of the game cheering not putting him in a position to pick up that third foul here with only 15 seconds remaining in the first Carolina has its first half timeout with 10 to play Not looking to use it Dixon Vesar driving it Lost it Got it back Finished short Rebound to Georgetown And a heave from Williams off the back of the rim to end a pretty entertaining first half They also won at Maryland Tarheelss who beaten Kansas and Kentucky going to play Ohio State in a couple of weeks Its a good test for both teams A home and home Carolina will head to DC some point in the next couple of years Caleb Williams will throw it in for Georgetown He had a scoreless first half Malikite Mack just two of seven for five points Lewis led the way with 11 and Julius Halifanua nine Lewis with a drive to start the half and he gets fouled by Jiren Stevenson So free throws are coming in the first nine seconds And you see KJ Lewis starting off the second half the same way he started the game being aggressive attacking downhill and forcing the Tar Hills to have to deal with him on every offensive possession of the Hoya KJ got off to a great start in this game Georgetowns leading scorer rebounder and the Big Easts leading steeler Two and a half a game He had an early two steals today Double figures in every game this year for the junior out of El Paso Texas But you saw the graphic talking about the rest of the team Malik Mack Caleb Williams they have to be aggressive on the offensive end not having KJ Lewis put everything on his shoulders And immediately you see to start the second half some fullcourt pressure by the Hoyers to see if they can find a way to turn over the Tarheels just as you imagine And it did slow him down halfway through the shot clock The ball hasnt been inside the threepoint arc until now Wilson trying to back down Isaiah Abraham and he gets fouled Abraham who did not put up a shot in that first half picks up his second foul Abraham giving away about three inches in that matchup when you consider Caleb Wilson with his back to the basket Kyle Evans who had a good start Seven points three assists no turnovers Nearly a turnover there Vesar regains possession Wilson will try to back down Mack with 8 in of height And Wilson tropes the jumper But see the thing about that is and many people will look at that and say thats not a great shot because hes shooting over a double team But one Malik Mack is is 6 one So he doesnt really see him when he elevates But more importantly if he does miss that shot there are four Tar Hills on the backside taken away to for three points to try to keep off the offensive glass So the smart play is to get a shot in the air Abraham pulls up for three Thats rebounded by Caleb Williams Fourth offensive rebound for Georgetown Mack speeds around the baseline Alifua takes the pass and scores it And once again Malik Mack getting downhill That was one of the things that Huber Davis said was a point of emphasis for his team They have to do a better job of protecting the paint 4643 the UNC lead Evans Bogavatz Wilson backtoback buckets The Tar Hills are doing a tremendous job against the zone finding those soft spots and more importantly getting a shot on the glass not overpassing and for and chancing turnovers giving themselves a chance to make a bucket or get an offensive rebound Lewiss layup knocked out of bounds to UNC Caleb Wilson is such a problem and a matchup problem You see two defenders but shooting over the smaller guard and Malik Mack and then finding that soft spot in the zone to be able to get a bucket on the next possession What Hubert Davis told us he said You cant have a better player person teammate than Caleb Wilson After the turnover Mack misses a three and Bogots has it for the Heels Bogots going oneon two will draw the foul Its amazing the way the game has changed When I was playing basketball many many years ago if you went oneonone four you would hear a horn Youre coming out of the game Now coaches encourage it one because you see it works out very well for Boas on that possession to get to the basket But look at the jerseys back This is one on three and he attacks and it turns out in his favor But its just amazing the mentality of coaches and what they encourage in comparison to the long time ago when I actually played this game I sense only a little acidity in your tongue Next Sunday ACC Network 11th ranked North Carolinas womens basketball team takes on Louisville in a top 22 matchup at Carmichael Arena All begins at 4 Eastern on ESPN or ACC Network and the ESPN app Just youre pleading with I mean past Cory coaches just let me go one on three Let me cook So many opportunities I had to give up Let Cory so many opportunities I had to give up back laughter in the day Bavad hits the free throws The foul was Haleenuas third Hes going to stay in there for Georgetown which again is under man without Vincy Wuku for the rest of the calendar Hell be reevaluated from a medical procedure in January Mack got a good clean look Rebounded by Wilson His sixth 14 and six for Caleb Into Vesar and threw it right through the hands of Wilson KJ Lewis having a conversation with Roger Ays asking him to watch the two hands on the push in the back But look at Georgetown Only one turnover in this game North Carolina of course no points off those turnovers and and thats one of the strengths of this Hoya team They get a shot on every possession and when they get this guy shots it normally turns out well Lewis who started the first half brilliantly has four early in the second 15 in the game One thing about a Ed coach team theyre not going to beat themselves Haleenua stuffed Wilson and then fouls him on the dunk try and thats the fourth foul against Julius Haleenua But a smart play by Caleb Wilson continuing to attack the basket The nice find and Hifanua does a great job staying vertical on the first one but you see the left arm sweep down on the second one and thats going to be the fourth foul putting him in a tough predicament and forcing Ed Kulie to have to make decisions bringing the big fella off the floor with 1650 to go against this big this physical of a North Carolina team Without Halai Fenua and again without whos unavailable this is going to be a tough uphill battle How does Georgetown combat this Georgetown has to find a way to speed up the Tar Hills and see if they can turn them over Theyre not going to be able and coming into this game this was nothing new to coach Kulie He understands that they are not going to be able to beat the Tar Hills on the interior Their guards have to be better KJ Lewis Malik Mack the perimeter has to be more effective Lewis misses Wilsons got it A number five ranked prospect in his class Caleb Wilson with 16 and eight I dont think hes that far down five Personally I I when you look at Caleb Wilson he and AJ Devonsa in my opinion have the greatest potential to be superstars at the NBA level And a class that you and a lot of folks think is a really truly special class as well Absolutely Is that I mean you can think of at least 10 different prospects in this freshman class that you look at and say These guys would be productive NBA players M misses Trip Dixon but no foul And now theres a whistle back behind the play Ron Groover has stopped the play here So as Bessar goes down they look they look to see is this an intentional a trip from Malik Mack but no whistle was blown This is going to be an official review Well take us to the 16minute timeout So well get you an answer when we return set up for the alpaca world famous chicken cups where today three contestants will have a rubber chicken These are not real chickens for those of you that have just joined us today The closest person to getting the chicken to center the 25 alpaca gift card Courtney you are up first with the pink rubber chicken Courtney really David youre up next Yellow chicken The object is to get it to center court Not bad Noah you got a chance to win a gift card Center court Get the chicken to center court Noah listen Congratulations You just won a gift card to unlock a ticket for chicken by Malik Mack The left foot right there goes down trips Derek Dixon The officials determined that it was an unobserved play So theres no common foul You cant assess a common foul but Ron Groover said it was an unnatural act not a basketball act And so itll be a flagrant foul against Malik Mack and two free throws for North Carolina And it was an official review It was not a challenge from Huba Davis That was an official review by the officiating crew and unobserved as they said going to the break it was unobserved in regular play but as they went over and looked at it they deemed that that was not a necessary action or a basketball play which resulted in a flagrant one So Derek Dixon the freshman is going to shoot free throws leaves the first short You agree with the call Um yes But if they had come back and said that there was nothing there I would have agreed with that also I mean again you could go either way on that one because I asked you all the question in our break How else does Malik Mack get up without putting his feet on the ground And so Bert Smith has a great look on it but hes shielded because its the other side of his body but his feet do have to come down before he can try to get up to get up And so Im fine with either way they decide to go with the flagrant one I dont think anyone is bothered by that If youre a Georgetown fan youre saying Hey hes trying to get up If youre a Carolina fan youre saying Hey he tripped my guy The beauty of the game Largest lead tonight Versar tried to extend it Missed the dunk through Jaden Fort Mack in transition will leave it threepointer short And the rebound spills out to Lewis He has one thing on his mind and he delivers it for 17 points But Huber Davis talked to us about the fact that they were not getting to enough of the 5050 balls It was a great opportunity on that possession to come up with the ball and get out in transition but it ends up being second chance points for the Hoy Georgetown hanging around down six Wilson tapped up by Vesar to Abraham And Georgetown right at this point just has to be the quicker more explosive team on the perimeter see if they can find their way into knocking down some threes and being aggressive This guy is absolutely going to do everything that he can to try to get them back in front Vesar sealed off his eighth rebound after his old Arizona teammate missed Vesar Dixon hes got another AND A SEASON HIGH 12 FOR THE FRESHMAN And there Dix is playing with so much confidence You can see that those two big buckets at Kentucky in crunch time have really propelled him to be one of the guys that Huber Davis is going to depend on going down the stretch Largest lead again for Carolina Mack got held up by Evans on the cut Thats Evans third foul Henry Basar does a tremendous job catching this and forcing his former teammate to have to defend him at the rim makes the nice play to Derek Dixon on the wing knocking down another three and he has shot a confident basketball here this evening in Chapel Hill Evans out of the game with his third foul Stevenson and Powell return Wilson takes a seat as well Lewis bouncer for Mack Two for 11 shooting night Mack lost it and that will probably be a turnover Itll be the second one of the game for Georgetown But coming into this game this this really was the advantage that everyone looked at for Georgetown Malik was the guy that really when you talk to the coaching staff from North Carolina they say Hey these guys got some really quick smaller guards that could cause problems for us Malik Mack really hasnt been able to get it going here in the first 26 minutes of action Carolina breaks pressure again Vessar is going to shoot a three Hes going to make it right over Lewis And Vessar once again the most vocal Tarhill down the floor And its always a bonus when your bigs talk especially on the defensive end Cant You want guys that are going to be vocal cheering for no good Offensive rebound Caleb Williams Jeremiah Williams misses a three Stevenson grabs it Heels by a dozen First double figure lead in the game Stevenson extends it attempting cheering what would be a school record 25 threepoint field goals per game but theyre only shooting 317 But not in the second half three or four from beyond the arc getting production from multiple guys as theyve been able to stretch it out to a 122 run and their biggest lead of the ball game at Georgetown 0 for five from three in the second half Henry Vesar leading the way with 15 or right behind Caleb Wilson should say with 16 Its a 122 Tarheel run as Malik Mack whos had a tough shooting night scores it right at the rim Desperate times here for Georgetown which has brought Julius Hale Fenua starting center back into the game with four fouls and over 13 minutes to play And you see now Ed Kulie extending the pressure trying to find a way to see if they can force North Carolina into some turnovers Thats the only way Georgetown will be able to get back into this game North Carolina has proven that the zone nor guarding the mantoman in the half court will not be effective Tory Hills five for nine from the field Three for four threes five for six free throws in the second half Zayen High off the bench High misses a three Has only gone one for three on the year from deep Can Mack get it going Hes fouled before he has a chance Satan High picks up his first Three on the heels four on the Hoya here in the second half as Caleb Wilson will return to the game Can there be such a thing as a quiet 168 for a guy whos in the conversation to be one of the top picks in the NBA draft What it is we havent seen the guy that leads the country and dunks right with a monstrous dunk yet Thats the only reason it doesnt look as though hes got 16 and eight on the way to another 20 and 10 performance which is pretty much his averages for the game Alifenua got inside there 13 for Julius Benua Wilson against Williams Wilson tough try bobbled out to Langston Love Georgetown with the last four after Ed Culie took timeout M set back Tar Hills have not attacked Taiua since he came back in with those four fouls Hes got Wilson right now Powell driving Powell stripped and fouled by Jeremiah Williams So free throws when we return And most people wouldnt realize the friendship that was between those two guys Believe it or not one of the most beloved North Carolina Tar Hills of all time Rasheed Wallace was actually encouraged by John Thompson She wanted to go to Georgetown And when Georgetown had so many players up front of course Georgetown was big man University in the 90s When they had so many players up front John Thompson actually encouraged Rasheed to just listen to Dean Smith And the rest is history Of course Rasheed Wallace loves Dean Smith Hes one of his favorite people of all time but when you consider that it was the urging of John Thompson for Rasheed to actually have the conversation and ends up being a Tar Hill An amazing sliding doors moment That is only the 10th time these teams have played but theyve had their fingerprints all over college basketball for the last several decades Georgetown which would recover from that national title loss in 82 and win their championship their loan won just two years later 1984 Three final fours in a span of four years while Patrick Euing was at Georgetown Jeremiah Williams with a kick Langston Love three Thats a big shot It gets Georgetown within eight and its a 7 nothing Hoya Surge Well we talked about how could Georgetown get back into this game Thats it Theyve got to be more explosive on the perimeter and allowing their guards to be the advantage in comparison to the Tar Hills Theyre not going to beat him up front Theyre going to have to beat him on the outside Dixon bounce pass Powell He gets it Powell with his first three in five tries But the great answer from Jonathan Powell And the threepointer has been a weapon for the Tarheelss Eight of 21 on the evening But the second half the threes been great tonight Four for six now since the break from three Halifanua Williams who came back from that hard shoulder injury in the first half sets up Caleb Williams He has yet to score today Hes taken just three shots in 21 minutes Hey Caleb Williams has been shooting the basketball extremely well coming into this Averaging 205 points per game for his last two including 23 against Miami Dixon inside Vesar against the four fouls of Falenua Kicks out of it Stevenson no on a three and the foul will be on Vesar there over the top of Fifua Henry picks up just his first Alifua coming up with the rebound and a little friendly fire after the play Vesar not really overreacting there So brings no attention to the officials Its the first time Ive seen Vesar play in person He is always talking always moving around as Lewis bricks a three Remind you of me Absolutely what laughter I was going to say Yep He however does have the freedom to go oneonree unlike you did back in the 90 Not Besar Hes not bringing it up the court doing that Into Henua Thats an offensive foul So Vesar trying to get that fifth foul against Alifenua is called for backto back fouls himself and give Hifanua a tremendous amount of credit for standing his ground doing a great job defensively playing with those four fouls but absorbing the contact and you have to sell that call Youve got to go down If he doesnt more than likely thats going to be his fifth foul Hes played really well of late too careerhigh 16 and three of his last four 13 today Chance for two more Vesar denies him Heres Evans back in the game with Dixon Carolina has not scored it much here of late since the Georgetown timeout as Dixon bricks an open three Vesar is on the offensive glass Lost it to Lewis Williams though threeon two Caleb Williams Not a great pass to catch Theyll reset it And well get a foul called by Bert Smith away from the action Its on Evans Thats his fourth Evans was trying to keep KJ Lewis from getting post position against him on the block Of course KJ Lewis extremely physical He doesnt mind being the guy that throws the first punch And you see the battle on the interior Its Lewis really just trying to get post position Evans using his hands is going to get him a foul each and every time He had that early seven He hasnt scored since Carolina has been hoping for more production from Evans whos a Colorado State transfer And foul trouble been one of the big reasons why they havent gotten that much out of him But Evans is more of a shooter than a playmaker Hes playing the point guard position for North Carolina but really played off the ball more so last year at Colorado State Nick Clifford was the guy with the ball in his hands making majority of the plays Jeremiah Williams know at the rim Jeremiahs just two for seven with a double double The fact that Jeremiahs playing is a win in itself after taking that shot to the shoulder in the first half Coming back in the game Coach Kley just happy to have him on the floor Wilson is fouled Thats the sixth on Georgetown Youre talking about Evans Where do you think North Carolina ends up going at the point guard spot Does Dixon play more Is there another answer they have as the year goes on Well remember were not yet seeing the best version of the University of North Carolina Tar Hills basketball team because quite possibly their best player is sitting on the bench with a cash on his wrist Seth Trimble who is the only true returner that got minutes for the Tar Hills a season ago will absolutely make this team much better when he gets back And when it comes to the point guard position he can play the point So its going to be interesting to see if they come back when its all when they get to the end of it A healthy septum exhibition game went for 33 Has the ability to score in bunches but that may not be the best part of his game He truly gives the Tar Hills a lock down defender on the perimeter Saw it against Aaron Peterson in that Kansas win Heres Fort Strong into Vesar Vesar took a shot to the face Fort blocked from in front and behind by Wilson and Stevenson Its still Hoya ball with Lewis driving into Vesar Caught in the air trying to find Fort It spills out of bounds The Heels will take over A sloppy last few minutes of the game Ed Kulie Hoy down 11 to Hubert Daviss heels Two guys averaging 16 and eight was 30 years ago That would have been Jerry Stockhouse and Rasheed Wallace And when you look at this combo up front they may be able to do similar damage than to what my both my little brothers were able to do when they were along the front line here at Carolina They both had double doubles in a Kentucky win on Tuesday 6764 654 the lead here Neither team has scored in the last three minutes And Carolina once again has done its job on the glass Dixon Bogavots got it from the corner of the ninth Carolina three And thats the key for North Carolina If they continue to shoot the three this well that takes this team to a completely different level It hasnt been a strength of the Tar Hills heroes throughout this season but a great performance here Loving to get back on their home court Allighten rims it out Wilsons got his 11th rebound His season average is 19 and 10 Hes at 16 and 11 tonight And he hasnt really forced the action much I think the zone has really put him in a predicament where hes just trying to make the right play Once again that pass gets Stevenson a great look And then Vesar nobody put a body on at 725 and hes got 17 But thats the challenge of the zone right You double team Caleb Wilson on the block He gets the pass out The one more to the corner gets Stevenson a good look and even though hes unable to finish it Besar has an easy put back because now the Hoya are in rotation This is the advantage of having a guy that commands a double team That means theres no one there to box out Emry Bessar who comes up with another offensive rebound and put back Hes picked up his third foul but hes got 17 points 13 boards three assists and two blocks And newua 75 foul shooter is at the line Hes two for three 31st annual Jimmy B Classic Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden Clemson in BYU Were talking about fabulous freshman AJ Devansa along with Caleb Wilson a number one pick contender Then Florida and Yukon to follow All starts at 630 Eastern on ESPN and the ESPN app Go to vorg to donate Ali Venua hits the second The crowd was screaming because if an opponent misses both free throws in the second half you can get a crumble cookie which means for the moment North Carolina turned into BYU as the biggest supporter of crumble cookies in college athletics 15 points the Tarheel lead Up top Wilson couldnt throw it down Vesar got the rebound and got fouled by Caleb Williams who picks up his for and Caleb Wilson and Derek Dixon This is the second time they havent really been able to communicate on the alley oop but against the pressure This is the way you want to be able to react Wilson unable to get that into both hands to finish it off A little behind the backboard but Henry Vessar there once again to clean up the mess So Williams and Hifanua each with four Caleb Williams 23 a careerhigh two games ago against Miami 18 against UNMBC Tuesday Has not scored Hes played 23 minutes He has four fouls and three shot attempts Vesar with a careerhigh 14 rebounds Goes one for two at the line This is Carolinas largest lead 16 points They have shut Georgetown down defensively in this second half Mack still weaving with a dribble Mack bad miss Grabbed by Lewis Shot clock five Lewis off the mark from three Careerhigh scoring night for Dixon feeds Wilson Boavots Stevenson and its going to be Carolina ball as Vesar forced the issue again cheering but who did not force the issue with Ca was Caleb Wilson against the double team once again and he wanted to get to the rim on that possession but as you saw the second defender makes the right play gets rid of the basketball and gets a great attempt for his teammate and Hubert Davis said this week more teams are double teaming Caleb and that actually helps us because hes such an elite passer it helps them too because one guy has not been able to guard so so therefore hes shown he cant guard me with one Dixons pass knocked away Its funny Wilson does not have an assist today but hes been involved in the action for several baskets Yeah a number of that If they did keep hockey assists in the game of basketball he would have a number of those but he continues to make the right play as Derek Dixons able to knock down the twopointer as the shot clock reaches zero Thats going to be his first assist right off the inbound to Dixon who continues his career night with 14 But that shows you how good of a passer Caleb Wilson is the fact that Hubert Davis trusts him to take the ball out of bounds and underneath out of bounds play Thats not a position you put a guy that isnt capable of making plays and making decisions Theres the first bucket for Caleb Williams today Hell have an N1 opportunity Im guessing the list of 610 freshman who are inbound passers under the basket is pretty short one across the nation I would agree that it most likely is a very short list Theres another one thats close to 610 but I would give him 69 that youll see on Tuesday night AJ Deansa who at BYU has been spectacular I think he and Caleb Wilson in my opinion those two guys have the highest ceiling when you consider this elite group of freshman Caleb Wilson definitely a better rebounder than AJ AJ more of a perimeter player but these two guys I think have a tremendous amount of potential moving forward to the next level but theres a lot of guys to choose from Poke draws the fifth foul against Tailayua Scores two Could be one more And he just about puts Georgetown to bed Nice action from the Tar Hills Bogots getting downhill Khalifa who is trying his best to stay out of harms way doesnt have much of an option but to let go and it was not actually the fifth foul KJ Lewis reached in and picked up that foul but because of continuous motion Vogabots able to get the bucket to go Yeah my mistake stays in the game Lewis only is first And lifeua has played now about nine minutes with four fouls But heres Georgetown team whos fallen behind 18 Heres Abraham who rises and strokes the jumper for his first points Is Abraham who was in double figures at 11 points in their win overc And thats really been the issue for Ed Kulie Theyre trying to figure out who that fourth fifth guy is going to be They have pretty much strong production on most nights between KJ Lewis Malik Mack and Caleb Williams but theyve got to find out who is going to be that other guy Lifeua has really shown that he can be that post presence that they need especially with out with injury Wilson need more production on the perimeter Wilson up to 18 with a jumper as Mack barrels his way in A lot of fouls in this second half but Carolinas extended the lead Caleb Wilson at 610 the ability music to do it all even off the bounce working on another 2010 game Of all the great University of North Carolina teams they have never had a team that shot 25 or more threepoint field goals per game until now This Carolina team averaging a school record 25 threes per game nine of 26 here this evening But most importantly theyve had six different players make a three on the evening Second half both teams have put up 11 threes Carolinas hit five Georgetown only one Derek Dixon the freshman with three threes and a careerhigh 14 Vesar Stevenson Evans Bogavat and Powell have hit as well Dont forget the 24th annual Womens Jimmy B Classic Iowa State and Iowa Two top 12 teams Wednesday night seven Eastern six local Want to remind you again about Audi Crooks 27 a game leading the nation in scoring hitting three quarters of her shots A ridiculous year for the Cyclones Mens Jimmy V Classic Tuesday night the womens on Wednesday both on ESPN And as always you can go to vorg Every penny goes directly to cancer research for the V Foundation Heres Wilson whos got 18 13 rebounds for North Carolina and hits a really pretty jumper there to get to 20 And the degree of difficulty is high but its a shot that you can see that he is more than capable of making as hes now had a average game up to 20 points A little up on the rebounds but he continues to be aggressive on both ends of the floor attacking the glass off the M miss Abraham short George York Georgetown is just 4 for 21 from three This is a big test for Ed Culie He said he asked his team today where has your edge gone defensively and I think hell have a lot of defensive questions again though this is a great step up class When you consider the disadvantage that the Hoyers were at coming into this game in the post I think thats really where the difference is between these two teams I dont know that Ed Koulie will be extremely disappointed in the defensive effort but its difficult to guard guys like Caleb Ed Koulie told us straight up we have not seen a guy in college basketball like Caleb Wilson in a very very long time And cheering when you consider that type of praise coming from an opposing coach who has watched them on film to try to prepare to defend him I think Georgetown did a pretty good job He just opened up so many opportunities for others Evans five to shoot Its Vesar Its short He knew it Rebounded by Moretti as we go to two minutes on the clock Moretti will drive it into Vesar Has got four fouls lost control on the way up and Hubert Davis says Lets slow this thing down Carolina wearing the retro uniforms the throwback uniforms today in this matchup a rematch of the 1982 championship game Can basically four corners this thing for the rest of the game if they want No they cant Basically four corners Theres a shot clock now I know Thats why I said basically laughter Evans Im sure Mr Four Corners is in the building somewhere Somewhere around here Hey Phil Ford normally a frequent visitor to the Dean Smith Center to watch the Tar Hills Its not hard to find a Tar Hill great pretty much anywhere you look Yeah you look around Theyre pretty much everywhere doing radio Tyler Zeller over there today when he switches off with Hanssboro Ogavads no for three Final minute of play Malik Mack really needed Mack to have a big game He should have a big season in the Big East Having a great year so far but Mack goes just three for 17 today Well you got to give the the Tar Hills a tremendous amount of credit You consider Huba Davis talked about their rim protection and defending the paint had to be so much better and they were that today against a number of tough guards to defend And then Malik Mack KJ Lewis Lewis had a great first half but really wasnt able to get much going here in the second Tip your cap to the Tar Hills for the effort theyve done defensively A bucket for Bogots Makes it a 20point spread Jumper by Moretti is short Another rebound to Vessar An appropriate way for the game to end He had 18 points and 15 rebounds Wilson 20 points and 14 rebounds And Carolina had length and strength to take down Georgetown They pull away and win by
