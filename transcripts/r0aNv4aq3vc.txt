game is to force SMU to play half court basketball SMU won the first meeting back in Dallas on December 7th the opening tip is controlled by Virginia and their home white and were underway here at jpj changing the starting 5 for Virginia Day Day Ames is back in the starting lineup Saunders tries it from the outside cant get it and here comes SMU boy Miller runs the show with a point they go with this small lineup second time theyve used this in the row work well for them last time against Georgia Tech with BJ Edwards Chuck Harris C yigu and mat cross well look the first time Virginia and SMU played actually Virginia had the lead was playing really well and then DayDay their point guard ended up getting hurt and and SMU really extended the defense and they just ended up taking control of the game cuz Virginia struggles on the point guard play and then s s the last time they played kicked Virginias butt inside and you can see them starting off again to establish interior presence in that first possession right there for SMU Isaac M leading the team in scor for Virginia 12 points a game here he is kicks it to the corner open three as Virginia looks for their first points off the mark from Jacob Kofi the freshman and off the miss you can see how quickly SMU gets into the front court and Chuck Harris was fouled again the first time because these two teams have already played a few weeks ago and what happened the first game Kofi and Saunders had a poor game against smus interor in CET CET had a big game they really played through to him and so for Virginia to have success tonight Kofi and Saunders on the interior by committee has to play well theyve got to put up really good numbers and right there you can see the transition by SMU how fast they go the the the emphases for Virginia to really get back and Build That Wall in transition defense to force SMU to have to play in the half court I could see where youre going with this as well as Millers F youre going with just CET and making me go with Yu right thats thats how were working together youre the pro Im still new at this cement it is there is a 7 foot2 freshman from istan bull who had 16 points and 16 boards is Josh referenc in that win on December 7th in Dallas heres Edwards Harris launching 4 three Chuck Harris getting his second start of the Season went for a team High 21 in the win against Georgia Tech last time out one of the things about SMU that probably doesnt get enough talk you credit for what theyre how theyre playing this year as part of is their balance of their scoring theyve literally got five guys almost in double figure so you have to guard multiple guys on the floor and thats what makes them so dangerous mcne unlimited range cant knock it down and cross excellent rebounder leading the team in that category pulls it down and starts things the other way McNeely gets whistled for the foul Eric you can see on the Miss threepoint shooting how quick SMU rebounds and they dont dribble dribble dribble they move that pass up ahead the ball moves so much faster with the pass ahead and that puts so much pressure on Virginias transition defense Virginia forces a turnover and a foul given by smus Harris as Kofi took it away SMU takes good care of the basketball 11 turnovers a game and they will turn you over and score off those turnovers big part of their offense thats been an issue for Virginia this year thats one of the things that the historically in Tony Bennetts time theyve never had an issue turning it over but unfortunately this year because of some issues with point guard play injuries today day theyre trying to find point guard out of midi at times and they struggled at times with turning it over but right there its a big time shot for DayDay to get him on the board so Ames back in the starting lineup we talked to Ron Sanchez about that wants him out there for his defense but also hes a guy who can create offensively in a foul as igu will go to the free throw line to shoot a couple what is the aims difference for Virginia here tonight well as you can see right here hes their best guy at creating his own shot off the bouns he doesnt need greens now there he got a pick and roll but he can beat the defender off the dribble off of one or two dribbles into the paint he can also get into the paint to create for guys like MC Neely to get him threepoint shots so hes a key cog for Virginia but again Eric you can see them trying to establish inside presence and really playing inside to go against Virginias interior defense because that was such a successful weapon they had the first time they played with some just going through him and he really uh uh gave it to Virginias bigs the last time they played they didnt get any production from Kofi and S Saunders at first time empty trip off the two Miss free throws and here comes roie roie was dealing with an illness last time out Virginia had the West Coast trip to Cal and Stanford went ow and2 on the trip Ro played just about 5 minutes in the second half against Stanford dealing with nausea roie ases catches it cant get it to go and the rebound for Applause Harris Miller shut up by Ames good job by day day Ames defensively almost thrown away Harris has it Virginia digging in defensively Harris tough shot and good finish that was good defense by Virginia both transition defense and into the half court Virginia will have success if they make SMU play with those type of shot attempts right there theyre only going to make so many of those SMU but the key was how Virginia played defensively starting with Applause transition Saunders Buchanan left open on the Baseline nope and cross has the rebound SMU 12 wins on the season three coming in conference play they beat Georgia Tech on Saturday and Dallas 9371 they led by 31 at halftime stretched it to 37 in the second half they had five in double figures if you notice with smus defense CET is just playing they call it drop coverage Eric where where he plays in the pain on pick and rolls when he can clog the pain up to use his 72 size and so what Virginia is got to do is try to get him away from the basket as much as possible to to not let him be to affect an interior on those drives good start for Ames back in the starting 54 Virginia Harris Saunders came out the challenge got a piece of it and Buchanan has it for UVA Virginia has settled down from that initial start that I thought SMU had better energy RO with the L to Buchanan but again Eric for the for the viewer at home if youre watching cement hes playing in drop coverage meaning hes off again in the paint and so that pick and roll day day gets in there B can get in there roie can get in there and then what happens is is he gets get stuck in in between land because when you play Drop coverage youre trying to force the guy that the the ball handler have to shoot a midrange jump shot Roy was all over Harris but then Harris turned around saw the opening and knocked it down he has seven thats what Miller can do he can put points on the board in a hurry hes smus leading score again right there you can see on the ball screen crosses up but Miller we call it like getting your lead leg over the screen which he was able to do Saunders can hit the baby hook and cross has another Applause rebound panan had the dunk on one end gets a block on the other end numbers back the other way for roie mcney steps into a deep three trying to find the range in the early going 0 for two from the floor knocked out of bounds and itll be SMU Basketball when we come back you can see injury and when that happened they moved roie to the point guard spot and he had some key turnovers and then McNeely they what they did is they took him out by pressuring him and denying him the ball and they had no one who could cocreate a shot or get a bucket and SMU went on one of those big runs and end up winning the game plus as I mentioned already the interior C just had his had his way against Virginias interior in that game also hean Sharma The Freshman from Ontario into the game for the first time started last time out against Stanford Kofi back on the floor Johan tror is on for SMU trying to set the screen for Chuck Harris who has seven of the SMU points so far yanans been active in the early going guans G has given really good minutes and if you noticed on on trayor there on the catch out of the timeout Virginia doubled them I think thats going to be an adjustment now when the ball goes inside theyre going they call the they use the word red or or Monster which is meaning two guys to the to the post double theyre going to start trapping the post man when he catches the ball I think thats an adjustment that Virginia has made out of that timeout ases playing well back in the starting lineup he had come off the bench the last three games scored five points in 14 minutes against Stanford hes got six already here in the first half Applause carry o quendo into the game for SMU number eight because of the half court defense when you get them playing the half court Virginias good they its theyre hard to score on you can see the double there coming from Big to Big on the double good Hustle by Sharma and he was fouled foul on SMU so Sharma making a good play I think the adjustment cuz they knew you can see the r the big to big double that means the the other big man comes to double he had both hands up which created the deflection but because of the first time they played in cement having his way against Virginia and he and SMU starting out the game going right into him and him having some success out of the last time out Ron coach Sanchez Ron Sanchez said Weve Got to Now double the post and thats been a good adjustment for Virginia the last two trips Tate Murray on the floor for Virginia here he is number 10 the only senior on this Virginia roster and he was fouled cross had just picked up the foul on the other end and now he just picked up the foul and hes got two theres Ron Sanchez interim head coach you know the backstory took over for Tony Bennett when Bennett retired on October 18th tough spot to be put in to take over program that close to the start of the Season look Coach Ron Sanchez did a really good job at Charlotte when he was the head coach there at Charlotte been a long time assistant with Tony Bennett whether it was at Washington State or at Virginia and he came back here to be his associate head coach not planning to take over the program obviously Tony Bennett had retired which surprised everybody uh and and its not an easy situation for Coach Sanchez and hes done a really good job one of the great people in the profession hes a very good coach uh and hes done a good job with this to this team and they look theyve had some tough losses over these last couple you know week and a half but they right now theyre playing well and this is a you can see the energy theyre playing with thats a credit to coach Sanchez Virginia with their first lead and a foul is called on Kofi so Kofi picks up the personal foul thats his second hell have to head to the bench as Elijah Saunders comes back on for for Virginia whether its Kofi Saunders buan again just by committee theyve got to have good numbers by committee on the glass and scoring the ball if they can do that that gives Virginia another a weapon for them to have a chance to to win this game heres Miller fourth in the ACC in a sis per game just under six that shot is off the mark from BJ Edwards but a second chance here for SMU Miller nice little fake turns around cant get it and Buchanan has another rebound and theres another foul good guard and when he wasnt playing Virginia struggled and for Virginia to win they need DayDay aims to create offense like hes doing in this game hes three for four six points hes their best guy at being able to create shots hes a key for what Virginia does and hes got the speed to be able to get to the paint draw multiple Defenders and find guys like MCM and Ro for the open threepoint shot as you mentioned earlier suffered a spray and ankle in that first meeting December 7th with SMU so that knocked him out of the game just his third start in ACC play averaging 9 Minutes a game in the ACC so hes been fine since the ankle heal its just been a little bit of a change in the rotation for Ron Sanchez but a change night putting him back in the starting five and its worked out seven to shoot for Virginia out of the timeout Ro in trouble finds Murray with one and a shot from the corner is good from Sharma that beat the clock thats what sharmas in there for is to catch and shoot and make the three and thats what he is hes a freshman hes a goodlook prospect from Canada going to be a good player but thats what he does hes got good size on him as well too and again when they make those shots it forces SMU to have to play against Virginias half court defense heres a quendo splitting Defenders fouled on the drive with 1101 to go in the first half you can see here late clock and Murray drew two see cuz Virginia really helps off the ball side so theyre going to plug that ball side so you have to be able to make threes and a guy like Sharma he stretches the floor because thats what he does you know hes going to take threes all but six of his field goal attempts this season threepointers SMU is in a bit of a funk right now and thats one way to break the funk thats that stuffs a seven nothing run for Virginia SMU had missed six straight before that tryo dunk again thats been thats been in Achilles heel for Virginia this year has been rebounding and we talked for them to be successful in this game theyve got to be really good on the glass both defensively especially defensively but also trying to get some extra rebounds on the offensive if theyre able to thats just the first turnover for Virginia tonight m makes him pay for that first turnover his first points again its a live ball turnover and when I say a live ball that means there was there wasnt a stoppage of play so it happened in real time and because of it it doesnt allow Virginia to get back in their defense and theyre chaotic in their transition defense you have to avoid live ball turnovers thats similar to a pick six in football where it goes to a touchdown theyre just those things can end up uh demoralizing you as a as unit roie misses the Deep three so heres Miller again oh beautiful little finish by boopy Miller with his back to the basket flips it up and smus back in front some guys like Miller just have that inate ability to score the ball they just find ways to be able to score and you can see the pick and roll covers there theyre doing you know trayor is more up on the screen Millers getting over the screen where cement is playing in drop coverage and was easier for Virginia to attack that yanan kept it alive so it wasnt another turnover theres that finish by boy I love the name too by the way but you see he plays off of two feet he usually is hes really good at playing off of two and using his pivot foot on that particular position possession he just he he he went off his right pivot foot there but he usually comes with two foot stops and uses his pivot foot to get an up and under on the defense got a name like boy you got to be able to make shots like that you got have you got to have the confidence to take shots and you know how to make those shots trying to get going not his night so far an elite shooter second in the ACC at 44 but hasnt found the range so far Applause tonight theyre going to need McNeely to make threes hes got some good looks hes just got to put in the basket mcne oh0 for three tonight that one rolls in and SMU pushing back after that seven nothing run by Virginia its an eight nothing run right now for the Applause Mustangs this is Virginia now going into kind of their mover blocker which is one side screening a flare the other side down screening which created then for Saunders to get an open shot because of the flare screen that he sent when you set a good screen the screener usually the best person to get open for an open shot over the top off the mark cleaned up by Robinson Saunders getting his first points he was 0 for six from the field in the first meeting with SMU roie cant get that to drop and the rebound for Keon Ambrose Hilton the more Saunders can do like can make shots from the perimeter it forces smus big to move away from the basket which allows guys like DayDay more room to get into the paint DayDay defending a window nice little finish by the senior from Toronto Keon Ambrose Hilton averaging Four Points a game getting his first two Ambrose Hilt has been active in this game so far in this first half hes been bouncing hes playing Above the Rim hes kept balls alive on the offensive end I like his energy again you can see Virginia theyre kind of in that they call like the wheel offense in a sense Baseline screen on one side flare screen on the other side neie you dont say this too often when it comes to iMac but hes ice cold from outside the threepoint line 0 for four so far a quendo rebound SMU Second Chance opportunity Miller no fight for the loose ball mcney if youre not going to get the shot the fall do something else to thats absolutely right you got to get on the floor you got to win those 5050 balls but thats one thing thats been in weakness of Virginia this season has been defensive rebounding FES with a good feed and the Finish By Robinson and when SMU is shooting threes thats a longer shot so when its a longer shot theres a better chance that its going to be on a miss that its going to be a longer rebound thats why the perimeter guys of Virginia have to get inside to rebound the ball again another double on C when the ball went in the post thats the adjustment that Ron Sanchez met out made out of that first time out another offensive rebound thats five offensive rebounds now for SMU we talked about that is such a huge key probably the number one key in this game besides transition defense is being able to rebound the ball for Virginia talking to their staff earlier today Virginia said hey you can look at one stat on the box score just look at the on the glass look at the backboards if were getting our butts kicked on the backboard its going to be hard for us to beat SMU one and done and you know Virginia is not very strong on the offensive glass they are 351st in division one out of 355 teams in D1 and the Finish inside and a run now for SMU and stretching it out six points now for the big freshman fivepoint lead SMU when you see CED in person the big freshman as you mentioned hes big I mean and he can move and hes got good hands and hes got Good Feet hes got some skills you can tell he hes hes hes a talent what a goodl looking Prospect you can see again smus in that kind of that Baseline screen flare screen action which allows Saunders to flare screen out to pop out after he sets the flare Applause screen knocked away defense by roie long inter Ed run here were still inside the 8 Minute media timeout window so you can see how long weve been going here without a stoppage for these two teams both of them are breathing heavy and a little Gass thats for certain so much to be successful in basketball its about cardio conditioning all about cardio got to be in great shape Saunders for Applause three Eric that could be a really good weapon for Virginia because again Saunders second threepointer he made which forces cement out of the paint so that that makes it really hard for for for for S guard good Sanchez said weve got to start doubling in the post because we cant let allow them to to just to hurt us and continue to hurt us inside on that and then on the second part theyve been destroyed on the offensive glass thats been a weakness of Virginia five offensive rebounds already by SMU Virginias lucky theyre possession only one possession Down based on that stat line cross on the floor for SMU playing with the two fouls SMU is ice cold from outside the threepoint line theyre now one for 10 on threes theyre 10 for 13 on twos here in the first half thats kept them around thats allowed Virginia to stay around is based on smus lack of threepoint shooting right now and theyre a good threepoint shooting team 38 which is second in the Applause ACC again you can see kind of the Lo remove the wheel offense one side low Baseline The Other Side High flare screen ases open look for three and a rebound for SMU Mustangs by two looking for their fourth ACC Applause win cross has been out of the flow after picking up a couple of Applause fouls heres Miller Miller tough shot wont drop and theyre going to say goal tending thats yatu interfered with it so it will be Virginia basketball when we come back to Charlottesville 320 to go in the first is a critical game for SMU one Joe lonardi has them on the second four out for the nc2 tournament so right now technically theyre on the theyre on the bubble and a loss to Virginia can hurt them based on their numbers because Virginia has not the best of numbers based on noncon confence play and some of the previous losses in the last week or so roie from the corner nope and the rebound for Edwards the other thing is in the ACC theres not as many opportunities for Quad one opportunities because the numbers already baked in based on nonconference play unfortunately thats just the way it goes when youre looking at numbers that the committee looks at quad one quad 2 quad three Quad 4 a lot of that happens based on your nonconference wins and losses thats us n 46 entering this week Saunders rips it away two and a half to go in the first half I look at the scoreboard two and a half to go I say this is exactly where Virginia would want this game and we talked about in the opening about the the the pace of play the style of play whos going to impose your will and right now this pace of play the possessions the length of the possessions favors Virginia SMU wants to play higher Pace more possessions faster quicker shooting within the shot clock everythings Advantage right now for Applause Virginia foul on Edwards thats his second so Junior from Knoxville goes to the bench you Canon looks for the LA how about the impact that the sophomore Blake bu canons had tonight for this Virginia team hes given him a great lift Eric a great lift and that back screen action there out of the base out of bounds you can steal points they call it special team situations base out of Bounce basketball there was a back screen there and a lack of communication by SMU McNeely gets fouled trying to get to the loose ball foul on SMU going back to that base out of bounds when theres a back screen because the guy thats getting back screen doesnt see anything happening so that if theres not communication you can see here in the replay the back screen without communication and talk two guys guard the screener leav Saunders wide open and cement who is guarding the passer bu Canon his hands were down CET 72 hes got to get his hands up so he cant throw a direct pass like that no strikes in basketball its like a bowling ter no strikes McNeely gets on the scoreboard his first point coming up Saturday ACC Network basketball triple header starts with Virginia Tech and Wake Forest thats at 2 Eastern then Notre Dame Syracuse at 4 and then Kalen NC State cap off the day and night Saturday on acc Network Virginia back in front they start switching the ball screen on Miller is where theyve started doing an adjustment as well too Kendo takes it down the lane to get his first points missed his first three field goal attempts a senior from Florida averaging just under 10 points a game you see how quick his first step was that explosiveness it wasnt catch and go it was go and catch and he got again another two points in the paint where SMU has dominated Virginia in that category tonight roie trying to post up o quendo knocked out of bounds by SMU Virginia ball with eight to shoot again another special team situation eight on the shot clock here so theyre going to have to have something quick to get a shot roie with four crowd counts it down roie off balance three front iron and here comes boy drops it back open threepointer no ice cold SMU from outside the threepoint line they made their first threepoint attempt but theyve missed their last 11 I think they left it all in Dallas on Saturday versus Georgia Tech the way they shot the ball against them they were at 80 the first half and three 14 of 28 for the game against the yellow jackets Ames throws it back out o quendo takes it away one on two hes not afraid to attack a one on two trying to sell a foul roie and wers timing up and then igu throws it down hes got eight what have weve talked about Eric live ball turnovers live ball turnovers are like pick sixes day day gets off in the air back for Notre a she missed the last game so to see one of the best players of the country tune in tomorrow nights double header on the ACC Network final seconds first half SMU on top by two Virginia final possession hey hey roie with four roie for three off the IR no good and that will do it for the first half lows scoring first half High powerered offensive teams especially in transition credit to Ron Sanchez and his group for getting back in transition defense continuing to build a wall and taking away smus fast break points SMU usually gets a lot from their bench as well just six bench points in the first half theyre averaging 31 bench points game thats top 30 in the country so a low scoring game much like it was in Dallas on December 7th SMU won that battle thats the first Miss of the night but a second chance here for SMU and they get the first points of the second half thats Harris thats their six offensive rebound and their 25th and 26th point in the paint again they nonnegotiable I love the word you use nonnegotiable and that is youve got to rebound the ball and and the Virginia staff talked about that you can look at that stat is going to be a big deal if theyre going to want to win this game heres mcne shot clock at four McNeely on the turnaround still looking for his first field goal if I told you that Isaac mcney was 0 for five from the field and 0 for four from outside the threepoint line youd think Virginia was down by 10 12 14 points but theyre still in this game Edwards couldnt get it battle for the loose ball that is the 7 foot2 cement yigu battling down on the court its a long way for him to go from there onto the floor and then to get back up as well as who thats not just one floor in the elevator thats two floors down you know but Ive been we and we talked about it we Ive been impressed by his Mobility you a lot of times guys at that size when youre and hes a legit 72 mhm they dont move real well he moves well for his Applause size roie back for Ames you can see in the ball screen coverage they have now moved cement up hes no longer in drop coverage hes we call at at the line of scrimmage but bucanan has given Virginia outstanding minutes gets on the pop there great pass there by day day finds Buchanan with a nice soft touch for the two Four Points five rebounds and an assist for Blake Buchanan tonight and the foul is going to be called on roie thats two on roie roie did not score in the first half he is 0 for five from the floor 0 for four from outside the threepoint line now with the two fouls Applause Miller gets it back he was the one who triggered the inbound another offensive rebound for SMU theyve been unable to cash in though on those Second Chance Point opportunities theyve got seven offensive rebounds but only six points off of those and thats a you know Virginias getting is lucky on that live ball turnover just the third turnover for Virginia but Miller makes it pay for it hes got six and SMU is on top here in the second half by four Eric you going back to nonnegotiables nonnegotiables of live ball turnovers youre better off just falling out of bounds and letting your defense set up and making SMU play against your half court defense mcne to Kofi for two first two for Kofi Josh both Kofi and Buchanan on the screen and rolls instead of them rolling to the rim they kind of they they short roll its called a short roll meaning they stop around the 12 13t Mark its not an all the way roll to the rim its a short roll and thats what theyre doing now against smus ball screen coverage cross good catch by Harris Miller back to Harris Harris launches fourth three Harris hit the first three of the game and then it was 13 straight misses from outside the threeo point line for SMU before Harris knocked down that triple Virginia native with 12 points from Ashburn about two hours north of here another turnover another live ball turnover and a foul called on Virginia a lot of times in a game like this where smus the better team coming in and you play a good close first half the First Media timeout the first four or five minut of that second half really can dictate the game right now its been Advantage SMU of them being able to get out in transition based on live ball turnovers Virginia is get a little bit of a danger zone right now they dont want to get this stretched too much tomorrow 10 eastern time after our womens basketball double header nothing but net crew will be in Southbend to break down the night in the ACC highlights analysis of every womens game and a look ahead to the best matchups for the weekend weve got you covered all season right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app pretty sure nothing up at net crew is going to be there at 530 to preview the double header live in South Bend tomorrow night thats how big a night it is tomorrow night SMU gets a couple of free throws from Edwards they have their largest lead of the game theyre on top by six Virginias largest lead was four in the first half a looks like he kept that pivot foot in place just long enough and a rebound for SMU one and done for Applause Virginia Miller and Ames gets whistled for the foul thatll be the third team foul on Virginia SMU good start to the second half on top by six here in Charlottesville you can see here we talked about nonnegotiables one of them is live ball turnovers right there Virginia has one of those Miller takes advantage of it thats equivalent to a pick six in football where he runs it back for a touchdown on an interception its the same type of thing that can happen Virginia has struggled this year in taking care of the ball and ball security we look at last year the best in division one basketball thats a big deal a big difference and Eric I dont care what sport it is if you dont turn it over you give yourself a great chance to to win the game or give your or at least be in the game when you do turn it over your margin of error if you dont overpower over talent teams really goes down small to to a low level yeah their turnover margin theyre minus two which is 15th in the ACC of the timeout SMU looks back inside Buchanan once again being disruptive and thats going to be a whistle against SMU I think Blake Buchanan is done little bit of everything here tonight all of it positive and it maybe doesnt all show up in the Box Score either some of the things that hes doing are plays that that are not going to be a statline deal its going to be energy its going to be a a win of a 5050 ball its going to be sticking his nose in there and making cement lose the ball those type of things and a great pass by banan to mcne on the back screen just again banan has given them great great lift great energy things are not not shown up on the back for and a great cut by McNeely player movement and ball movement Harris back off for Miller Miller makes the extra pass and igu flushes it down 10 points now for cement one of the deals for Virginia if you want to be effective in in the packline defense which they play is you got to keep the ball in front of you you got to guard the ball you cannot get beaten off that bounce on the first drib thats a no no in that packline defense that was started by Dick Bennett and then made famous by obviously Tony Bennett after that tough pass for you can in a handle its a turnover thats the third turnover of the second half for Virginia five for the game yeah I mean again the turnovers but thats that you can no turnovers are good great move there by Miller Missed It But Eric no turnovers are good nobody wants turnovers but if youre going to have have one youre better off having that type of turnover where its a dead ball where Virginia can get back and build their wall set their defense up and make SMU have to play against their half court Applause Music defense roie defended by Harris six minutes gone by in the second half roie and a fouls to be called on Buchanan thats his first there hasnt been a lot of fouls called in this game the referees have let him the officials have done a nice job and let the flow happen usually when Virginia plays they dont foul a lot fouls in not a lot of fouls lot so credit to the officials on letting the flow of the game going but what smus up six I I said it about a minute or two ago this is a little bit of a danger zone for Virginia because theyre not a team thats a pressing type of team if they get down into that double digit that becomes a scary for Virgin they dont have the to be able to get back in a hurry and theyre not shooting the ball well enough to do it either so they need stops and they get one cross turns it over so Virginia will take it over the best way to get back in the game is on the defensive end on getting stops you got to get stops you got to score and then get stops again turnover number six for SMU Ro has not scored tonight McNeely has not made a threepoint field goal heres Applause Sharma Sharma working with Buchanan now back to Applause McNeely once again the shot clock winding down for Virginia down to five great feed and the Finish but you Canon roie with the dish really good ball movement they were patient got dribble penetration great cut by bucanan great find by roie second assist for roie and a foul called on Sharma for Virginia Virginia bench not very happy with it I think Ron Sanchez is stepping out towards mid Court to play Peacemaker cuz his bench was making a little noise yeah thats a foul Sharma had both hands on the drive there thats a point of emphasis anytime you get put both hands on a dribbler it should be automatically called good call by the official okendo on the floor for SMU here he is okendo on the drive leans in on Sharma but he gets called for a travel turnover Applause SMU SMU is using the ball screen to throw it back they in in basketball terminology they call it the shake man from the weak side he lifts up and thats what endos doing is shaking up is coming up lifting up and hes before he even catches the ball hes just going before the catch and attacking downhill as the balls coming to him hes explosive powerful and a tremendous athlete speaking of explosive and Powerful thats Saunders but he cant get it to go and back the other way quickly how else would he do it is booping good job by Buchanan little thing not going to show up on the stat sheet but thats a positive hes making plays hes being an energy Giver you know you hear a lot of the terminology youre either either an energy taker or youre an energy giver and what hes doing with his minutes hes right now been the MVP for Virginia based on his play and and and and his energy that and his positive contributions that dont even show up in the box right now Robinson on the floor here it wont be a very long trip to the bench I with think for if you can immediate timeout coming up and just a little bit by him a little time another turnover for SMU theyre piling up the turnover so Andy enfields going to go into his bench hell bring BJ Edwards Jr back on the floor Millers going to get AR rest cross checks out tror is on Ambrose Hilton is on as well for SMU neither neither team has and partly based on how theyre shooting it Eric in the first half has not even shot of three this half in the first eight minutes part of that is because I dont think theyve they knew they werent going to shoot they havent shot the ball well in the first half one three smus one for three Harris made that three thats right youre right Virginia Virginia has not attempted a a three knocked out of bounds youre right Harris made the three but both teams in the first half shot very poorly and Im thinking if Im either one of those coaches in the halftime were saying guys we cant keep just shooting weve got to keep attacking the paint and if youre SMU you have kicked their butt in the paint lets keep attacking the paint and keep making that Mark good catch thats why youre a pro you caught me Miss MCN is just out of rhythm we have not seen that too often this season he is now 0 for five from outside the threepoint line and you can see Buchanan right here look at this drive by roie great find great cut by lanan and a dunk at home I love it hes giv great energy love this energy see before taking over at SMU hes been following it very closely where he used to live Manhattan Beach area is fine but obviously very concerned about how its impacting so many people that he came in contact with during his 11 years in the Los Angeles area as weve all been watching from a distance out of the media timeout 11 and a half to go now here in the second half SMU with possession T to shoot Harris trying to break down Saunders off the dribble Applause Music they have DayDay aims out of the game so roie is playing their point guard spot right now whos not a its not his game as a Creator but right off of that off of I say that he gets to the paint kicks it one more and find sh for an open three threepoint Wes continue though for Virginia they have missed their last six threepoint attempts theyre three for 17 Music tonight that one drops in good work done again by Keon Ambrose Hilton yeah Ambrose Hilton just came straight down the paint there and transition MCN tried to pick them up cuz they were caught off guard on the on the mismatch they were crossmatched and he was able to get a good post seal and a good find heres roie Applause Ro threw it up gets it back no reset on the shot clock swing it over to Sharma Sharma fade away no good and here comes Edwards Edwards turn it over roie drops it off Sharma steps into a three another miss one and done and a rebound for SMU Eric is a coach when a guy like Chara gets those open threes and misses them like thats what youre in there for thats youre you got to get you got to make those and those things can be demoralizing internally from the coaching standpoint because you know what hes in there for a job to do is qu like a field goal kicker you want to make the field go t you got to make these threes thats your number one job Virginias fortunate because SMU hasnt been able to get things going and you can see now Ron Sanchez has to get his guys that have been connected the best on the offensive end on the floor right now and thats even though McNeil is struggling things flow through him but weve talked quite a bit about Buchanan hes coming into the game Kofi is coming into the game right now for Virginia just feel like games on the line right now as you said before sixpoint game doesnt feel like a big deficit but were closing in on 9 minutes and Virginia just cant fall too far behind because they just dont have the ability to close the gap if it gets too wide they theyve got to keep it within Striking Distance the best they can and on the other hand for SMU they dont want to let Virginia continue to hang around cuz you know it gets into that mold where Virginia starts getting confident they hit a couple shots here or there and then it becomes a different type of game because of the possessions and the pace of play is favoring Virginia McNeely lit continues to be on the basket for McNeely tonight one for eight from the field Endo Kofi slowed him down Virginia digging in on defense inside of 9 minutes to play here in the second half Edwards weaving through CH traffic for two two more points in the paint Thats where SMU has lived tonight they have not shot the three ball well but they have lived in the paint and have dominated that area 34 of their 41 points in the paint tonight this is the largest lead for the Mustangs and a foul is going to be called on Ambrose Hilton good teams find ways to score when youre not shooting the ball well and a lot of that offensive rebounding attacking the paint creating turnovers to get scoring opportunities getting to the free throw line smus ability tonight to score in the paint even though theyre not making threes and theyre a very good threepoint shooting team those are signs of what a good basketball team does another threepointer Miss frustration on the face of Ro as he turns around five minute scoring drought right now for Virginia and SMU theyve struggled to take care of the basketball at times here in the second half thats helping to keep this a single digit deficit right now for Virginia now D Day Ames will come in with 807 to go in the second half Eric because of Virginias lack of fir power to put a bunch of points on the board then being three for 20 for three just puts so much pressure in other areas of the game because theres nothing gets loosened up bu Canon with the finish and the foul well if youre not going to knock down threepointers why dont you go for the conventional threepoint play and thats what Blake Buchanan will do when we come back another big time play but another Bas line fine great F by bia and a great cut by lanan to find him there and a score like you said oldfashioned an one based on them being three for 20 from the threepoint line Eric they needed somebody else to give them something and thats been Buchanan now theyre fortunate that smus two for 16 from threepoint range and theyre one of the best threepoint theyre the best one of the best in the country and one of the best in the ACC so for them theyve been very fortunate on that duana finishes off the threepoint play so he has nine to lead Virginia in scoring inside of8 minutes to play in the second half fivepoint game SMU in front their largest lead eight here comes the double big to Big open look o quendo no you can end with the rebound thats his eighth Applause Kofi Sharma Virginia is three for 20 from outside the threepoint line can Sharma turn their fortunes not this time you got a really good look again a short Roll by buan and and he found Sharma open three in the corner again thats charmas job hes got to hes got to put those in hes had some really good looks thats what hes in the game for to make those open threes heres cross whos had a quiet day picked up two early fouls looking to make something happen Miller grabs it five to shoot Miller on the turnaround nope and charmas got the rebound well Virginia keeps getting stops can they score on this end is the question as we approach six and a half to Applause play mcne has it it taken away from behind by BJ Edwards and the foul is going to be called on Edwards no MC call for the foul I saw the reaction from Andy Enfield the SMU bench they werent happy but then the call 21s went up and thats McNeely number 11 and you can just see here his lack of ball security he wasnt tough with the ball he just was non look hes nonchalant with it and then what happens is Edwards just gets in there and just tougher with than McNeely on that particular play and mcne ends up getting the foul mcne has not played well this evening Edwards 40 steals in the in the for the season thats second in the ACC so you know hes going to be all over the ball and mcne didnt protect it like you said Josh but again SMU comes up empty on the other end and and I dont know if Andy enfields coach enfields happy with some of the previous possessions including that one shot selection based on the time and score of the game right now Applause ases Slams on the brakes in front of the sevenfooter heres McNeely on the double pump that wont drop but he will go to the free throw line if you notice there again day day ases being able to get to the paint to create he gets to the paint hes able to then use his pivot foot plays off of his two feet plays off of his pivot McNeely finds behind relocates Day Day finds him and then a MC can reack the close out which is the hard one of of the hardest things to guard in college basketball is Closeouts a reminder coming up on Saturday ACC Network basketball triple head of Virginia Tech and Wake Forest get it started at 2 Eastern then its Notre name in Syracuse and Cal and NC State all Saturday on acc Music Network well its helped a little bit here tonight that Virginia is a perfect seven for seven from the free throw line can they continue to get stops its now a one possession game inside of 6 minutes to go crowd starts to get a little louder here at jpj a quendo is fouled on his take to the basket if you watch Endo you everything he does is just I Ive said it a few times its not catch the ball hold and go he literally as the balls in his air is coming to him in the air its hes literally going towards the ball in movement catching it while hes already in his movement and thats based on his athleticism his explosiveness his first step he he becomes really really hard to guard based on his power to get down hill and really conquer the paint seventh team foul on for Ginia as Sharma picks up his second person quendo makes the front end of the one one not a lot of trips to the line for SMU tonight come to expect that against the Virginia team that just does not foul a lot fivepoint lead McNeely going to give him the benefit of the doubt that saying SM you got a piece of that one but he has had a tough night tough nights and understatement and and again for Virginia to hang around is because lanan has been able to give him really good minut andu hasnt shot the three ball well but for Virginia to win m is going to have to make a three at some point here a quendo with a little contortion in the lane to get the shot off hes got six and its back to a sevenpoint Advantage with five minutes to go in the second half Virginia came with the double big to big and cement was able to find the cutter oeno didnt stand again moving without the ball cutting and the balls down at the Block the cutter and good find and pass there by C foul on Edwards thats his third personal foul McNeely will head to the bench as roie comes back on Virginias three for 22 from outside the threepoint line they are 0 for seven in the second half came in at 37 third in the ACC making on average eight a game Kofi the RO deep three that wont drop Kofi kept it alive into the hands of Buchanan second chance for Virginia 12 straight misses from Beyond The Arc forth Virginia on the drive the floater is Good from roie first points of the game in a Timeout called by Virginia Roy was 0 for eight from the floor before knocking that one now yeah this is a big Series right here can Virginia get stopped score sto coming out his timeout and 16 I mean he was outstanding and as a freshman in his first ACC game and you can see here in the adjustment Virginias going to double him now here comes Kofi his hands are down but at the top of the screen Endo sees the double coming and he they call him basketball a 45 cut from that weak side slot thats what they call 45 cut from the weak side part of the B from the floor he cut into the paint great find by CIT but the hands were down by Kofi which allowed C to have a direct line strike on that Applause pass four minutes to Applause go Edwards five on the shot clock Edwards High arcing three wont drop and the rebound for Kofi I dont think that was the shot that coach Enfield wanted out of that timeout there contested three Kofi gets it to Trum So a contested three the Miss by SMU and then Kofi scores on the other end to bring it back to a onep position game again here in Charlottesville Harris kicked across cross trying to work on Buchanan Buchanan with the block he has been awesome with eight exclamation points the way hes played this game hes been incredible Virginias MVP in this game to this point even though theyre still down by three but he has allowed him to keep in the game Sharma Virginia had missed 12 threepoint attempts in a row Sharma drains assists a steal and a couple of blocks couple of blocks that was a big one right there which led to Sharma SMU goes underneath the screen you cant do that against a good shooter Sharma steps up does his job and makes a big three to tie the game Eric SMU was up six up five uh they allowed Virginia to hang around I thought some of the shots that they shot in that stretch there were some forced threes contested threes off balance twos in which Virginia was able to come down and score instead of putting them away they let Virginia hang around and now weve got ourselves tie ball game largest lead for SMU eight this half yeah so theyve been up by as many as eight points they get Miller back on the floor here for the final 245 Edwards thrown away turnover SMU out of the timeout Kofi into the hands of Buchanan why not hes been the glue guy for this team now roie charma uses a screen cant get the three but whos got the rebound who else Blake Buchanon and a second chance here for Virginia unbelievable it just out efforted C men on that possession just wanted it more Ros got to feed him here cant get it cross has the rebound and a foul called by Kofi in the back court thatll be his third personal eighth team foul on Virginia so one of one coming for SM you not a smart play there by kof you to foul 94 ft away from the basket when the score is tied just no need for that he should have just got back get back in transition defense build a wall but youre putting up a good free throw shooter on the free throw line not a smart play there by Kofi cross at 69 he has not scored and he still has it great foul by Kofi I said it its a great foul oh youre walking that one back I can sense it 145 to go and a foul is going to be called on SMU and thats going to be Harris who gets called for the foul and that will be team foul number seven on SMU so now 101 for Virginia theyre seven for seven from the line tonight kofis first trip coming up brs first trip coming up I Bart Applause Music Applause Music Applause Virginia has led for a grand total of 2 minutes and 38 seconds Kofi with the offensive rebound and a jump ball possession arrow SMU Music the fans are booing Kofi doesnt like it but it was the right call I thought there wasnt a foul it was a jump ball situation both hands on the ball but the bottom line is Virginia made one of two so theyve got the lead lets see what SMU runs here theyre going to keep the ball in Millers hands Miller threw it away throw it right to roie the lock for bu Cannon Music Applause with a great D started with the steal and then the Finish then the finish and a good twoand catch but it all started on the defensive end Ro gets down but how about lanan sprinting the floor and transition offense again something that might not show up on the box score but he out efforted everybody down the Applause floor Virginia on top by three SMU with the basketball Miller defended by roie Miller what a take but it wont drop if you can it adds to his rebound total thats 13 no rush here for Applause Virginia Kofi one minute to go for McNeely Kofi seven to shoot he will shoot wont drop you can in rips down another one heres mcney shot clock at seven Sharma takes a peak oh thats a costly foul for SMU cross gets called for the foul with 5 Seconds on the shot clock youre fouling in that 5 seconds on the shot clock really 44 and it was 30 some odd feet away Eric I dont know if he understood the score I mean youre still at a one possession game and I dont think coach Enfield did not want in to foul not a smart play there by Co by cross whos a older guy in college basketball hes got to know that score and time Applause situation Sharma has not been at the line very much this year but hes delivering when it counts one for two on the season and he knocks down the first to put Virginia on top by four if SMU goes on to lose this game they can look back at some key times as I mentioned where they just did not get good shot selections and had an opportunity to put and two by four shot selection in key times when they had opportunities to put Virginia away let Music go Virginia will try to slow things down here for SMU as they bring it across half court inside a 30 to go kick to the corner Edwards for three hes got it that ends the 12 nothing virgin run and now some pressure from SMU with 25 seconds to Applause go and a timeout is called by Ron Applause Sanchez really well executed late game play by snu here you can see Miller with his speed draws into the defense sucks everybody inside and was able to kick out and find Edwards for the open Music three really quick action with Miller speed and that cross checks out for SMU hes got four personal Applause fouls Ambrose Hilton will try to make it tough on McNeely roie in the back court trouble deflected Sharma comes up to get it Sharma gets fouled right in front of the SMU bench Andy Enfield giving Rock gr an earful Sharma was selling the foul and he got the whistle and hell go to the free throw line look at the but look at Sharma the ball is loose and instead of him waiting for the ball his ability to go meet the ball and run through the ball might have been a game saving play for Virginia if he waited for the ball to come to him SM you would have picked it up and scored and was it he and then he sold himself to get the foul uh you saw it was it going to be traveling violation or a foul called the foul was called Sharm at the free throw line makes the front end that was team foul number nine on SMU that could be a game saving play by what Sharma did by running through the ball not waiting for it on a loose 5050 ball on that press break that got deflected so big free throws for the Freshman from Canada because its a twopossession game heres bopy Miller Miller on the drive Kofi stands his ground Miller deep three is good smus not Done Yet a miner no timeouts remaining for Virginia 91 to go McNeely to Murray Murray in the back court and Miller gets called for the foul and tan Murray who is nine of 11 from the free throw line this season will walk to the other end and shoot two again another really good push on the pace by Miller gets to the paint gets to a relocation passes out and then comes and follows his pass behind look at the relocation uses footwork and then again behind and Kofi ends up losing Miller there because they got mismatched based on that transition on Millers speed and a big time shot by Miller a Murray comes up well short on the first one timeout remaining for SMU theyll get CR back into the Applause game lot of time on the clock 74 with Miller speed hell be in the front Court in a blink if they make this look for Andy infield to get to the half court and call timeout and set up the side out of bounds play its a Miss Harris with the push into the front Court timeout called by SMU good call 41 to go yeah coach Enfield likes to use the half court sort of like the NBA teams do when you call a CL out you can advance the ball was up 50 to 45 with 31 seconds to go SMU got the threepointer from Miller misses at the free throw line help so the door is wide open here for SMU with 41 to go you know how we talked about SMU allowed Virginia to hang around by taking bad shots how about credit to SMU on their late game execution on making big plays late in the game and big shots so treor is on the floor right now for SMU its cross who will trigger the inbound and here we go no timeouts remaining for SMU heres Miller Miller throws it up its good its good it beats the buzzer and SMU wins in Charlottesville they will make it official at the monitor but this is certainly a game winner for SMU on the road and its poopy Miller who comes through theyre going to look at it but I think it was all I think it was all good but Miller got a running start on the speed field goal successpoint shot be point4 on the game clock Virginia can run the Baseline coach Enfield put Miller at the top of the key on the other side and then you can see him running in here catches it it was actually pretty good defense on by Buchanan but he just hit a tough shot all right so point four is critical the catch is its 94 ft away from the basketball and he can run the Baseline and you get around the Baseline point four you can still catch and shoot yes but it all has to line up perfectly here when you youre out of timeouts and youre on your Baseline 94 ft away know a couple Miss free throws late I I Virginias late game defense they theyve been really good defensively but late game defense they allowed Miller multiple times to get ahead of steam and really get into the paint to make plays whether it was Edwards and the three in the corner or when Miller came back out and took the hand off for another three theyve hit big threes late part of it is because Miller has gotten a head start on 94 ft and it just created allowed him to get right into that paint without any duress or stoppage from Virginia Ron grs over at the monitor he was there briefly and you heard them announced point four on the clock again point four you can catch and shoot three is a tap only no one is in front of the inbounds passer roie so hell have a clear look down Court twopoint lead for SMU Ro throws Kofi turns and throws at the buzzer and it catches the bottom of the net and thats the ball game and SMU gets the win in Charlottesville
