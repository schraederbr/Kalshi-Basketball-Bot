you know its going to take time and hell find his way in the offense and the name sounds familiar to ACC historians his dad played at Clemson back when I played has some great battles against him and in the NBA as well Lambton wins the tip over baycott and the Cougars begin with the basketball its great to have you with us tonight wherever you may be and look for Lambton to get a little scripted play here see if they can get something to him off the back cut well defended by baycott Dalton bowling takes love Baseline and scores this first five minutes or so would be very important to the College of Charleston good start for them very aggressive they had a very upbeat practice and shoot around today Applause Music 11 to shoot black finds Caleb love D3 and the rebound track for Jalen Scott were averaging about 19 points per game last year at Bethel Junior College deeper look that time for bowling he comes up short the rebound last Touch by Carolinas across the ball but that last possession the college and cougars will theyll settle for that shot with K LOVE any time you know to try to keep him out of the lane let him shoot long jump shots Applause gonna stay the same way Roger Ayers John Gaffney and Jamel Spearman the three officials presiding tonight all right Applause College of Charleston 1715 a year ago as Pat Kelseys first season in the Low Country after a long and successful tenure at Winthrop obviously ACC roots for the Charleston coach long time under skip Prosser at Wake Forest also worked with Dino gaadio after skip tragically passed away when youre around Pat Kelsey you cant help but share skip pross their memories no and uh you know he played me a high compliment to seeing me brought back memories of skip and that first came started broadcasting the league when they had their run in the early 2000s but uh you know he is just a walking fivehour energy yeah it just so much enthusiasm Applause Texas first foul against the Cougars 85 seconds gone now the Tar Heels were not exactly in sync offensively and theyre opener on Monday Pat Kelseys assistant Brian Coleman was maybe asking the officials to check on a potential elbow to the face but they move on wide open look from the corner blackberries and thats one that they were going to live with in The Scouting Report black not a great shooter but uh what a nice start for him you saw how wide open he was Lambton missed it they caught battling for the board Lampton creates another possession this is the one thing the Cougars very good on the offensive glass North Carolina makes a point of emphasis to rebound the ball oh what a block by Pete Nance and then diving on the floor is blocked loves contacts and hell get to the line well heres the thing this is you know just great man on man defense right there times it cuts off Scott gets the block and then they retain possession and thats where North Carolina is really at their best and as they have been for years is out in the open floor Caleb loves so very difficult to guard in that situation and they get an early foul on Rayne Smith not his first Caleb scored 17 on Monday night the win over Wilmington lets take a quick look at the keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer What You Got Tonight GMan well for and Pat Kelsey talked about be great at uh so he just wants them to stay within themselves but be at their very best against this team here the number one team in the nation into North Carolina Huber Dave is not happy with the rebounding in game one they want to come back strong in that category Applause two for two at the line for love beautiful ball movement Bolens got all four for the Cougars yeah and with the smaller lineup out there theyll lift theres no real Center presence for the Cougars its its they have great spacing and you really have to talk on those back screens beautiful offense that time Scotland for the steal came up empty Davis sets his feet and Nance comes up with another loose ball rebounds the Miss from Love babicar five six eight from Senegal out of the NBA Academy in Africa gives them a completely different look from Lampton bowling they call him psycho d Roger Applause Ayers hand to Ryan Larson its either Carolina ball or a foul which one do you want all right Ill go back and play defense theres psycho D no relation to Psycho T but Im you know if youre the College of Charleston pack it in make North Carolina prove themselves from the perimeter and let them have anything easy inside I love that moment Roger Ayers and Larson right in front of us Ayers obviously as accomplished as any official in the sport somehow Raekwon Horton able to keep the dribble alive through the pressure Applause Rayne Smith made five threes on opening night for the Cougars and they have leaky black on him a big cover and their best perimeter Defender thats going to be a tough defense for Smith takes it and Larson sneaks in gets his hand and creates another possession Smith unable to pay it off you see the hustle for the offensive boards Tar Heels in transition its a block and its a bucket for black and Pat Kelsey cannot believe Applause yeah at first look that looks like a that looks like a charge to me but a very bang bang play that being said leaky black has had a nice start to this game offensively do you think its a different whistle the TD Arena compared to the Dean Smith Center theyre not here so it really doesnt matter just an unconscious bias that goes into things like that and actually you know in in practice that Kelsey was looking for five charges from his team he knew he was going to get two from Ryan Larson he thought he had one there for sure Music fouls caught on love first on Caleb and it takes us to a timeout 5 15 gone here in Chapel Hill photo who kind of weighed in heavily on that year theyre in their run to the championship I think it was called Mike at that point but uh yeah great stuff and uh you know so happy for Hubert Davis had a terrific year last year set up the inbounds play for Ryan Larsons three Music well you know for for College of Charleston theyre getting shots they havent turned the ball over theyre not making shots to this point theyre getting offensive rebounds and baycott has not touched the ball so far in the game so theyve cut the ball in his hands Seth Trimble the first man off Hubert Daviss bench tonight and a travel called on RJ Davis first Carolina turnover a lot of conversation about the Tar Heel bench coming into the season and Hubert Davis is excited to mix and match the different pieces he has to see what works I love Swift Terminal I was watching the practice yesterday and uh you will you will see some different combinations with him on the floor and the ball in his hands because he is a Lockdown Defender different level of quickness Larson with a left hand gets two finished that time gave him a clear out Trimble beats everyone down the floor well see thats the function of Larson getting that layup they had no transition defense back and thats just too easy after a made basket youve got to have people on the other side back rotating defensively if youre from College of Charleston busy 46 seconds for Trimble he gets a bucket and then picks up the foul at the other end that Kelsey has sent uh Ben Burnham into the game sophomore from Fort Mill South Carolina is a freshman he had a big game against the Tar Heels 17 a year ago Music Applause quick hands from Black and able to maintain possession this is Burnham to start that possession everybody for the College of Charleston lifted above the free throw line what are they trying to do anything just live just cutting Lanes back screens oh tremendous Applause fouled by Burnham thats you know Huber Dave you love the block but you want to get the initial rebound right and Im sure that hes a little upset so far about the Cougars presence on their offensive glass five offensive rebounds so far for Charleston heres the thing I mean you know theyre fighting inside but great and thats the thing with leaky black six eight long arms quick reaction quick off the floor leaky making his 99th career start for the Tar Heels tonight running at his 124th game for UNC Davis pops and hits Applause Music hes cleared that side twoperson game with him and Baker strong take Jalen Scott what you want to do take away whos shot blocking ability to go right through the body long two wont go rebound for Pat Robinson III one of the several D2 transfers on this cougars roster and baycott comes up with a loose ball only Charleston will play 10 people in this game theyll have a lot of bodies in and out Applause Mondo offensive foul Applause and sometimes he can get into trouble when he puts the ball on the floor and a good anticipation they really worked on that in their film session today anticipating that spin back good call foreign you know the Cougars have a lot of bodies that they can throw up front a lot of fouls they can burn Croatian big man Dante berzovic into the game and the three is good for bowling hes got seven of Charlestons first 11 Applause after picking up the foul the previous possession comes up empty this one Charleston can take the lead here really converging on him three bodies around him on that shot open look buries it back threes for the Cougars nothing spurt over the last 75 seconds and thats going to draw bacon out their Biggs can shoot threes Applause Mike we are over seven minutes again in Pete Nance hasnt taken a shot yet hes one for one and a flop warning was just assessed to Charleston Applause its going to put a lot of pressure on the referees that time and uh see the thing that bailed Nance Audi didnt put his shoulder down that time and thats why there was a no call he did a good job keeping his balance and finishing the play but theres no warning anymore so thats a technical foul and Caleb loves at the line just made the free throw for the Tar Heels ties the game so its a technical foul on Horton the Flopper no team foul no personal foul but it is his first tech 10th meeting ever between these two programs Applause cougars have beaten UNC three times including once when the Tar Heels were in the top five Dante berzevich the Croatian big man gets on the board nice patience that time theyre going to let Nance guard him one on one so he got a few dribbles and was able to back him down well good finish with his left off hand Mr Marco done Andres Styles in the game as well done rise is up Horton tracks down the miss you can see it there but uh people in North Carolina talking about how well and hes improved into the basket goodness didnt look like anybody in North Carolina was expecting that that was explosive Pat Kelsey pointed to rayquan Horton yesterday as Caleb love answers and he said that guy rayquan Horton is an athletic Beast we just saw it up close and personal lets see look youve got five guys out theres a lot of driving Lanes so The Bigs are hitting threes a quick five Off the Bench extending the Cougars lead to five after missing her first five threes made their last three in a row full of love glass Styles keeps it alive and thatll be a kickball Raekwon Horton giving us an early candidate for highlight of the night GMan yeah they get getting to that right hand Fearless going inside hard for their last five after starting four of 16 Gmail and its been inside and out good work inside that time for zorge with his left hand and then this finish really got his team ignited theyve been knocking down threes as well so a good balance inside and out nice spacing of the offense with a lot of confidence right now Evan already 10 different guys have played for Pat Kelsey six of them have scored in uh bench bench points ten to two in favor of the Cougars too so those guys are coming in and producing as well and the thing that Pat Kelsey talked about was its gonna maybe different guys on different nights I mean the minutes are going to be sort of the same but uh theyve got different guys who can contribute I think too you know we talk about him building this program and hes such an infectious guy and he came there were two guys last year uh Tim and he called it the great experiment and he was able to Cobble together a terrific season the thing I think they might have found something in going through the portal to the division two guys getting really good players from that level to come up and step up and he may have found something there Pat Kelsey very excited about the class that he just signed a couple days ago the number one mid major class in the country fourstar combo guard Isaiah Coleman fourstar mayor wall and then a threestar big man from Fayetteville James Scott at least one of those guys is here tonight I spent a lot of time in Charleston it is a beautiful city and its a great sell for a recruit Music foreign Charleston so if you get to the rim you can finish Five Guys on the perimeter Larson off balance comes up empty Styles the rebound and Seth Trimble running the offense here thats a little smaller team Nifty dish by Nance Dunn wasnt expecting excuse me Styles yeah and thats a great passer though and hes playing the five right now so it gives him a different look with bacon out of the game Music theyll stay with Charleston Applause cougars went back and forth in their Monday game against Chattanooga took a 1715 lead with about eight minutes to go in the first half and never trailed again Applause 8578 was the final well and this is the pace that they play at so this theyre not going to try to slow or eat any clock against North Carolina they like an Up Tempo game as well literally the fastest Pace team in the country a year ago Bolin quick shot sticks it over Caleb love loving his hands down that time and uh Boland is hes caught fire as well the threepoint shot a nice weapon 10 points for bowling largest lead love tries to respond with authority and Poland fouled him on the arm hes not just quick Caleb but he is springy and you know can go either way he can go right left finish in that time and I like the aggressiveness to go in get to the freethrow line quit settling for jump shots attack the rim Monday night was Calebs 50th time in his Tar Heel career scoring in double figures and he is closing in on the thousand Point plateau he makes both of these theyll be just 50 points away well pause for a moment quick word from Works Nitro meet work Snyder Applause rare mystical line for love hes 51 away from the thousand well and the thing about kill of Love is that he can have horrible stretches but then explode at just the right time and wind up with huge gains does humor Davis have to be a different kind of patient with Caleb and wait out the stretches that arent going so well you know who he is at this point and uh you know hes not going to change that was on Styles so that being said I mean you know College of Charleston finds himself in this game with Smith not having scored so far their leading scorer great point its only taking one shot Court cross contact theyll get free throws the thing you like about a board please and hes got a strong body and they are not afraid to post him up against other Wings inside on DeMarco done five different Tar Heels with one foul a piece Applause thank you Pat Kelsey in his nine years at Winthrop he became the fifth alltime winningest Coast coach in the history of the Big South Conference averaging our 2021 wins a year what was the draw there and he said well a lot of people from Ohio go down to the Low Country to Vacation yep so he said hes been coming down to Charleston in that area for years and it was it was really a natural fit for him and his family Applause nine minutes to play in the half Tar Heels down seven love comes up short rebound tapped out to Dunn steps into the jumper Applause and he looks really confident in his game Smith for three beautiful extra pass that time unselfish you want to get your guy into the game get him some rhythm Music come on Styles no by the rebound chance to extend the lead to double figures here five back outside for Horton beats Davis sets up the best shooter and Smith comes up empty itll be Tar Heels ball you know the thing in getting this lead the Cougars have not let North Carolina run the ball out theyve had to work in the half court and thats because the offense has been very efficient North Carolinas been taking the ball out of the basket College of Charleston able to set their defense in the half court foreign its just game one of a doubleheader tonight Virginia Cavaliers who Mike you saw on Monday up in Charlottesville taking among the at nine oclock Bob Rathbun and Ryan Oliver are getting set to call that one from Charlottesville Applause Music Applause an interesting first dozen minutes here tonight oh love off the dribble explodes to the bucket they gave him that whole right side there was no help quick shot Charleston quick rebound what a pass ahead black to Baker and a foul you can just feel the energy in this building Crescendo when the Tar Heels play fast and you triggered a quick shot and that just leads to a run out every time with North Carolina and he is our Hardys star to watch hes got a quick 10 points against the number one team in the land and it really showed a lot of Versatility on offense great back screen that time this is a staple of this offense hes shown the ability to knock down the three can also get into the lane area six for him very efficient scoring so far in double figures hes been around college basketball for a long time he redshirted his true freshman year back in 20162017 played four years at West Liberty where he was the conference freshman of the year and then a threetime division two AllAmerican taught a class there too he came to Charleston last year played the first three games suffered a foot injury got a medical hardship so with the coven year this is what his 15th year of college basketball Ive lost track yes a dean of students now down at the College of Charleston but you know but a great story and uh so far great first half for him 41 threepoint shooter in over 800 attempts at West Liberty one thing a little bit of a flag for North Carolina two assists so far in the game on nine made field goals a lot of oneonone basketball that is half as many as they had in Mondays game what a bizarre statistic for a system 22 field goals on Monday us assists its a double overtime loss to Texas A M in the 1980 NCAA tournament they caught on the lineup theres one weakness for him Evan its its here 67 last year had a rough night against uh the UNC Williams six of 11 from July oh Nintendo has played nine minutes Applause Music after 31 double doubles a year ago high in the NCAA record but defensively against this team hes lifted away from the basket a lot hes chasing outside playing defense inside this possession on the big Croatian who scores no double team again just taking his time nice spin move kind of guard him against that left hand Charleston showing an impressive depth in this first half bench Point scoring now 146 Applause DeMarco done with four off the Tar Heels bench Davis cash from the corner Ill tell you what hes he gets sometimes overlooked I think on this ball Club he is a terrific player could argue hes the best player on the team yeah I can make a very strong argument for that that was a good pass if he was trying to get it to a guy in the third row the energy of this crowd fans were filing in good 90 minutes before tipoff tonight opening week of the season number one Tar Heels preseason number one for the 10th time breaking the tie of course with your Blue Devils who have been preseason number one nine times tell you what its its a whole different vibe you become the game not like you werent that way anyway as as North Carolina on your jersey but with that number one ranking whole different deal five quick points the last couple trips for RJ Davis missed three from Robinson but another offensive rebound the sixth of the game for Charleston and they pay it off with Burnham inside Second Chance opportunities those three is the perimeter for North Carolina is going to have to hang in there a little bit more and get long rebounds again Burnham his first two tonight he had 17 last year against UNC Tyler nickel bacon tips it out leaky black knocks it down you can see theyre still daring I mean not down that three early from the same exact spot that is a huge lift for this offense second three tonight for leakies now got 50 from downtown in his career but Horton right down the boulevard its just that spacing creates great cutting lanes and driving lanes and thats important is showing me some skills here in the first half bows on Burnham away from the ball and thats going to be his second Mike on Monday night Hubert Davis was very pleased with the North Carolina defense the offense wasnt quite in sync I think its a little bit of a different story tonight yeah and uh well and you know especially defensively this uh this college Charleston team they were Fearless coming into this game uh they you know they were getting shots early not making them all of a sudden they settled in and the offense started to click inside and outside so Armando baycott going back to the line one for two his first trip to the front end of the one and one I think Charlestons done a good job staying true to themselves being us as they put it and theyre theyre being them at a high level what a move by Dalton Bowlin punching himself in the head living up to his nickname nickel a tax Baseline Lambton late getting over that time in the rotation of the versatility these guys are showing not to you know Poland and not just the threes but and then taking their time no double team recognizing that they can go one on one in the paint not being in a big hurry Lambton just picked up his second Mike I want to correct myself I thought Burnham was getting called for the foul the previous possession away from the ball when bacott went to the line missed the front end but it was berzevich so Burnham actually no fouls in the game lamped in the first player in the game with two and Tyler nickel has his first point as a tar heel scored over 2 900 points in his high school career the mountains in Virginia Applause Harrisonburg Applause see alltime great Ralph Sampson he had a pretty good career yeah not bad threetime National player of the year he would have made some money in nil you would think Robinson Lambton on the weak side has the rebound because baycott went for the block and that was a block that he wasnt going to get and it just gave Lampton all kinds of room to wait on that offensive rebound sometimes you have to stay at home and take care of the glass Applause Davis lost his dribble pretty good defense there from Pat Robinson the third blacks feeling it right now hes got 10 first half points and who would have thought before this game started leaky black was bailing this team out offensively hes four for four from the field including two threes hes been terrific Applause Burnham has size this match shoots over love battle for the board gonna stay with Charleston well get ourselves a timeout Tar Heels getting a test tonight against the Cougars kind of bailed out North Carolinas offense hes made all his shots hes got 10 points well look I mean theres not a Defender within 15 feet of him they are daring him to take that shot and hes come up big and using his size right there hes now hes starting to feel a little bit of a rhythm now I think if youre a College of Charleston you got to change your game plan and come out and defend him a little bit more this is 124th college basketball game and the vast majority he has now scored in double figures today the 13th career double figure scoring game for leaky speaking about double figures about Bowen he was three for ten from the floor on opening night for Charleston that has not deterred his confidence at all hes five for seven make it six of eight 14 points for bowling make your pardon 15 for bowling in the first half Davis in and out rebound tips love finds it Cross Court sets up nickel for three nice time to Cross Court that time Nichols spotting up on the opposite Baseline freshman starting to get a little confidence now got 80 points on the board with three minutes to play in the first half Friday night lets lets look at zero zero right now in the last three minutes see if North Carolina can make a run here if youre a College of Charleston youve done a nice job of carving a lead you dont want to see that evaporate going into the locker room Charleston led by six at the half last year had a lead as large as 11 UNC didnt leave until Brady manic hit a triple under 17 minutes to play in the second half and were still a onepoint game late bowling has had the hot hand for Charleston Applause leaky black is going to find him they put him on bowling to try to calm him down nickel goes down nice dish inside and a strong finish they have a car five gets his first points inside and its its a different game with uh you know without bacon out there Applause Music nickel outside for Nance heat one for two so far lost it recovers and then just threw up a prayer still almost went in but FYE has the rebound nine different players have scored for Charleston swatted Away by Nance second block of the game for him nickel attacks blocking foul and free throws coming for Tyler nickel who was a big time scorer at East Rockingham High School averaged 28 and a half per game for his career and again one of the few runouts that North Carolina has had but its all triggered by the block on the other end psycho D just picked up his second personal foul for Charleston and it looks like Pat Kelsey is going to take him out of the game Ryan Larson and then they come in with theyre going to come in with Burnham too as well Applause placing Bolton uh bowling important but its you know what the thing too about the Cougars they substitute theres not a big drop off youre coming in and producing yeah Kelsey is six guys back from last year please poor sophomores who he says played enough as freshmen that theyre basically Junior yeah they grew up it happens Burnham throws it away but Davis cant Corral it better help us to drive that time by North Carolina game number 41 for Hubert Davis as head coach of the Tar Heels hes 30 and 10 Music Applause leaky black for the quick hands got a tough bye finds a cutter Larson tough bucket and hes undersized too but not afraid to go in there pretty nice move little floater in the paint Applause man both teams are shooting exactly 50 right now cougars 19 of 38 Tar Heels are 14 of 28 you do the math 10 additional field goal attempts for Charleston thats a large byproduct of the offensive rebounds eight offensive rebounds for them in this game the thing they like too theyre not turning the ball over theyre getting shots Applause Nance in the double bonus Tar Heels get two free throws after the five foul and the North Carolina not taking advantage of the freethrow line to this point eight of 14 now theyre getting to the line just leaving some points there Applause been almost 13 minutes since North Carolina had a lead see the free throw disparity but Charleston despite that not just hanging around but dictating Tempo at the offensive end one of two for Nance and most of Pat Kelseys Winthrop teams played really fast and he has brought the fast tempo to the Low Country Baseline jumper is good Applause Off the Bench with nine first half points and hes perfect from the floors along with the made three as well Applause Caleb love Music Scott the other way Music 40 seconds in the half berzevich kind of poked Away by big that was the postmans edition of the heat check Music really been Davis and leaky black could have uh carried North Carolina offensively Kelsey takes his use it or lose it time out Music what an interesting first half this has been we protect the paint brought to you by CPI Security a couple first half blocks for Pete Nance yeah hes convinced and leaky black who have done the uh and most in the times theyve gotten those blocks theyve triggered breaks down the other end of the floor four blocks in the half for Carolina are you surprised that the Tar Heels havent gotten more offense in the first half from the two big men bigot enhanced well the thing that the College of Charleston has done a nice job its been just a lot of oneonone basketball for North Carolina its been guys who you know kind of facing up doing things off the dribble uh the Cougars have allowed leaky black to get some shots which hes knocked down come up big with but there really havent been a lot of opportunities inside for the big players they havent gotten a lot of touches in there shot clock is off here so the Cougars take the final shot if theyd like Jalen Scott marked by Pete Nance 10 and a half Scott going one on one sets up berzovic for three puts it in ante berzevich with a dozen Off the Bench for Charleston in the first half the Cougars hang half a hundred on the heels this is a guy who had three points good well cougars had a sick with some shots here to get him in some Rhythm for this last 20 minutes he really wasnt a factor in that first half Applause Tar Heels begin the second 20 with possession quick touch for bacon who had just one point and just one Rebound in the first half Nance feeds him inside baycott doubled plays through it and scores came along the Baseline with the double team bacon really showing some good patience turning away from that and finishing with that right hand first field goal for Armando and a bad pass love with a skip to his step Applause and Bowen didnt want to pick up the third foul early here in the half so he had to give a little bit of ground that time and that was a terrific finish proud all of a sudden into the game Smith cannot hit the mute button that is an offensive foul on RJ Davis to the dismay of everyone claddin Carolina blue and Davis hanging the crowd on a little bit uh boy is this the that takes a lot to step in there Larson just giving it up but thats what he does I mean he is he is so tough he takes charges in games Pat Kelsey needs he said he needs two of him two charges a game from him Ryan Larsons career began playing for Mike young at Wofford another bad pass good anticipation this deal for leaky black black to Bangkok Nance pokes it away from Lambton inside and a foul on Charleston whole different energy from UNC to start the second half yeah they needed that to just break up the Rhythm College of Charleston really fell into an easy rhythm in that first half shooting uh that been a little more frenetic here recapturing the energy I mean recapturing the whole vibe from the end of last year is virtually impossible its all new so this this team has to create a new Vibe and their own just think from last year how did you go about doing that 40 something years ago when it was all feeling different its its its not easy and people think its going to happen in the first one or two games and its not for this golf club a guarantee from the corner theyve got a whole different Factor on the glass in the first minute 44 in the second half evident and the thing is I mean even as even his story does this program is for this group playing with the number one ranking is really hard every single game Monday was their first time playing his number one because November 15 ties the game oh God when hes making those shots this team is really dangerous great start to the second half with a big bucket to quiet the crowd what an answer 16 for Dalton bowling thats his career high as a cougar in just his fifth game three last year two this year loves the floater gets the bounce Ill tell you he wasnt invisible in the first half but he has come out with a completely different energy as well first time out of the second half taken by Charleston the dean Dome tonight thats Mia Hamm sitting to the left of the legendary statistician Freddie Kiger whos a hero in his own right Courtside here in Chapel Hill 92 Run for the Tar Heels start the second half and really its been the defensive end of the floor thats triggered this whole thing it just the energy there the points theyve gotten as a result uh just playing just a completely different team from that first 20 minutes Caleb love seven points so far in the second half Galen Scott hes strong you can get to that right hand and you show him the ability to finish in the lane regardless of whos in there caught mismatched double doesnt matter and he gets to catch that deep to get a nice job keeping the ball up and finishing extra pass to the corner In and Out by another offensive rebound ninth of the game for the cougs lets put a Bobby on North Carolina ball watching at this point Scott goes over Davis this time and scores again boy and it was Smith who said a really tough screen that time he was open on the pop but they got to finish inside it was three cougar turnovers that really allowed UNC to take the run which they didnt do in the first half they did a nice job taking care of the ball second turnover of the half just a fifth of the game Bolin sets his feet right left third rebound for leaky black the threepoint percentage should come down in the second half for the College of Charleston Caleb two more I talked about it I mean he can go along and all of a sudden explode on you Horton no he skipped past the defender but then off balance did not convert North Carolina comes up Shy with the three trying to take their first lead since the 1414 mark of the first half Horton goes at baycott brings it back outside Music Applause so many fans around the Dean Smith Center on their feet trying to implore the Tar Heels to defend and they do five minutes gone second half love on the attack contact no whistle but thank God hes there Tar Heels back in front yeah getting the big man involved already nine points in the second half to so active defensively and this is where hes the most dangerous I talked about it earlier no secret out in the open floor but then he just gets into Rhythm and uh you know those shots those are not easy shots that hes taking but nice pullup floater that time under control youll live with some of the heat check shots that hes taken in this stretch and the other thing Loves gotten hot bacott has got involved Caleb and mondo have all 15 points for the Tar Heels in the second half playing off one another too North Carolina practice yesterday and and he thought the energy was fine but it wasnt Championship level and Hubert Davis talked to his team after the practice about we got to have fun we got to play without a burden of expectations on our shoulders yeah and its its hard again this this is one of the other things that thats hard to manage you know and uh you know have some joy out there especially early on but if you notice no substitute so far for North Carolina to this point in the half hes gone with his starters Larson on the dribble Cross Lane feed and a fouls going on bacon before the shot from five on Armando Baker who said coming into this season thinking about what he needs to do to get ready to play at the next level he said I know its the NBA Im not going to be some big time scorer so Im just trying to be that janitor everybody needs a janitor that does all the little things underappreciated things Applause Music Applause are people going to start to question if he doesnt put up those gaudy double double numbers like he did last year is he having not as good a season and that may not be the case right well you worry about that when you have four guys coming back like they did thats just the noise and theyre just a solid you know solid move inside hes clearly gotten into a ribbon hes got some touches court gets into the paint sets up berzovic another offensive rebound and important finishes just there were a lot of white jerseys around the ball that time and they cant let that offensive rebound happen Music and offensive rebounds 10 second chance points and a steal Horton intercepts the pass Robinson cant finish on the first try but he stays with it okay Ive been impressed there have been some moments in this second half where it looked like the game could get a little out of shape but the Cougars have had an answer front by one just down to the floor Tar Heels have made six of their last seven shots love oh Robinson thought he got it clean Jamal Spearman thought otherwise the guide is if the ball goes up in the air you probably got hand if the ball goes straight down then youve got to steal its a good rule of thumb Music its okay A little love to the line a free throw in the first half and dont see that very often Applause one of the final loses to Kentucky number one where you felt settled in or did that burden stick with you all year long well because we went we went down to Clemson ranked number one in the country and lost our first accs out there because Pete Nancys Dad yeah and uh you know that that just showed us again you know how the ACC was viewing us at that point and Clemson was always a tough place to go and play after Caleb missed his second free throw of the night is charged with a foul at the other end which will send Pat Robinson a third to the line but you got to remember to it at no point last year was this team ranked number one right this team it was a shot they were about to get to the final four so they never had to deal with that app for sure Applause one of two for Robinson Applause Music back outside nickel the first man off the bench in the second half and he if you get himself to the freethrow line Tyler Nichol does not want to be thought of as just a shooter Mike wants to be thought of as a score right and thats the thing too that need to be shown it here you know hes mixing his game up he can spot up and shoot the three hes not going down earlier but also at least putting in The Scouting Report that he can put the ball on the floor and get to the rim 19 year old freshman Music smooth stroke Tar Heels back in front four or five in the second half from the freethrow line its an improvement there fifth lead change of the night there have been eight ties as you see Charleston with the largest lead of eight terzevich got him and thats the tough cover for bacon hes got to close out bernovich has knocked that shot down youve got to get a handout test they kind of looking over the bench saying I dont know but I dont know how to get out there Keen points for brucevich who had three points in the first game of the year for Charleston make him defend against fouls at it has played with a whole different mentality in the second half much more active presenting himself inside making a Target I got a threepoint play for you down the other end Applause actually gave it to Robinson not first of it important Again official stats cousins second half points now for Armando Baker this is what they like about trundle being able to pick up threequarter full court defensively Applause on nickel Applause Music which is what you find yourself in right now I think youd say yes 12minute game zero zero Applause cougars led by one last year with six and a half to go theyve beaten North Carolina a few times historically oh nice move inside Ben Barnum and one we remind you to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer coming up a little bit later here in the second half you know the players walk by that every single day Evan and it keeps you accountable you know it it reminds you every single day of the standard uh that you have to set every time you go out on the floor and whats expected of you Applause you need a certain mentality to be able to handle that pressure and the expectations that go with it Burnham had a chance to extend the lead and complete the threepoint play couldnt do it Caleb love off the dribble and hell get to the line Applause this is the look and its going to be interesting to see us this season unfolds with Nance really is the five stepping in with bakade when hes out of the game Applause one thing to note you mentioned just the four assists on Monday night GMan Tar Heels have nine assists so far tonight on 24 field goals Caleb love himself has four assists a year ago North Carolina was 140 when Caleb love had at least five assists in a game of Love is also their leading rebounder by a lot with seven so really filling up every line on the statue to them with this group out there theyre theyre a little bit better suited to defend the three for the bigs from the College of Charleston dance can get out and guard that shot him defended by nickel travel just in a hurry to attack the Freshman inside nickel actually earning himself a little playing time in this game in the second half no question about it between eight minutes now more than he played on Monday there you see the movement of the feet Applause 6868 11 and a half to play Applause deep dance still hasnt really left his imprints on the game but he draws contact on the drive here I think its going on first of it and that possession they really tried to cut for the first time in the low post to try to keep him from Catching actually gave it to Burnham number two on Ben Burnham Larson gets it really psycho D is back into the game fouryearold graduates dude from Ohio and look Pete Nance is not Brady manic broadcaster for North Carolina game this year is going to want to make that comparison and talk about the difference between the two its just the reality of the situation with him being the one newcomer in the starting lineup I think and then you know youre also going to be working Trimble in and uh you know nickel youve got guys who are hurt puff Johnson is not played so far so theres still some bodies to be incorporated into this whole thing right yeah I think only on first couple games you know referring to manic is you know hes wanted but it eventually he just all right yeah we know that lets move on reaching foul call it on Trimble D his second Applause the fans voicing theyre just pleasurable not triple second personal if Trimble can give the Tar Heels the defensive spark on Scott how about that he picks up the foul comes back with the same intensity and gets it offensive five thats showing an Optimum heres the look again just great stance moving his feet Applause came official Darnell Spearman both go both those calls Applause Music much better job holding his man off inside theyve really given him a lot of space to work in the paint area in this half heres the look pass up top to seal and thats again what Nance gives you out front hes a big can pass over the top great high low action Pete Nance was asked about that exact action by the local media after Mondays game and he kind of said with a smile yeah dont want to give away this guiding report but there may be a little bit of an emphasis on getting the ball to the big guy down low Applause and thats all right now were seeing all right this were talking about the difference in players yes is he a different player absolutely but hes got his own skill set and you saw it right there and it ended up in a pretty good basket I think I think Pete Nance is going to settle in nicely with this group okay 107 Northwestern he scored over a thousand points he made over a hundred threes but again Brady manic made almost 103 his last year for Carolina a different expectation and its actually shot three is at a higher percentage than manic did a year ago so you see that oh 45 611 guy that can shoot oh hes going to be the next Brady manic but its different and in many ways Evan I think its its harder to incorporate an older guy whos been used to being the guy into this system and as opposed to a freshman like a trimble or a nickel you made a great point about that a shoot around today saying when freshmen come in even high profile freshmen theres a little bit of a hierarchy you know with the portal you have such accomplished players joining new teams its a different Dynamic yep sure is Applause time out this is a guy thats quieted down for the Cougars pocket love to Trimble to the basket largest lead of the night for Carolina all right how about this you got you got love youve got Davis youve got Trimble out on the floor we talked about that with Hubert Davis and saw that early in the preseason saying we may have something here and I think North Carolina has found something with that group out on the floor during the secret scrimmage against Rutgers Hubert Davis had those three little guys out on the floor looked at his assistant said yeah were gonna do some more of this well you know what turtles not little and hes a big guard he can guard bigger guards out on the floor and then you take Davis and love off the ball free them up to be scores pretty potent IAL that was called on RJ Davis it was number three on RJ sending Horton to the line to shoot a 11 Applause John Gaffney the official under the bucket letting everybody know to cool off well this is you know one thing Pat Kelsey talked about today is we want to be the physical team we dont want to react we want to be the one out there thats bringing it to North Carolina so this thing this team has not backed down at all in this game in the first 30 minutes confident to throw stroke from rayquan Horton didnt have a free throw in the first game but its been perfect so far 10 points for Horton moves back within four Applause play Applause at this point College of Charleston has let him go one on one inside they have a little bit of a leak dig that time but hes been able to kind of work on his own that time planting on an island thats a tough task especially this second half where baycott has really come alive offensively by the way you think Armandos hairstyle here is designed to look like Ramses the North Carolina mascot could be youre going to have to ask him on that one Ive had a lot of different stuff yeah hes had some different dudes over the course of his career were into the fourth quarter tonight here at the dean Dome Tar Heels trailed by as many as eight now up by six and Lambton who just picked up his fourth foul just turned it over on the walk yeah he was actually passed into that turnover was a tough catch for him to make Applause were going to bring fire in get a little bit smaller a little more active out on the floor Applause Carolina by six with the ball hello Applause from the high post solid move really got was under control ball fake nicely done and Charleston get a stop Music they cant they cant find him though Caleb love offensive I saw the same thing you did Mike Spearman saw it differently Applause dip of the shoulder is usually what gets the call but saw it the other way and its its really amazing this score is the way it is with rain Smith three points and hes saying its not just hes only taken four shots he had 19 against Carolina last year he had 24 in the season opener on Monday night but North Carolina is taking him completely out of visibility Music Applause free throw gave him 20 points the game 21 now for love Caleb also picked up his fifth assist earlier Tar Heels are undefeated last year when he had at least five dunks see at that streak continues tend to shoot important attacks Big Cup whos ready for it and then Trimble had the block on the stick pack but the foul going on the Carolina freshman number three well offensive rebound of the game so far for Charleston thats whats kept it is close to this point as well you know you look at it 17 maybe a little defense for leaky coming back in replacing Trimble D you get defense for defense there but you know with leaky black on the perimeter more so I really like that three guard combination for North Carolina five goes one for two Tar Heels trailed by seven at the half seven right now love is just feeling it the Larson the rebound Larson Baseline slam back in on the stick back by the car five and a little bit smaller but five is giving them a lift on the offensive glass cougars just will not go away completely Applause beautiful Kick Out Pass Loves going on Jalen Scott for Charleston here Applause take us to a timeout with 7 38 to go North Carolina a fivepoint lead Music congratulations Music Applause Music number one North Carolina in the midst of a fourgame season opening home stand have a fivepoint lead with just under eight to play trailed by as many as eight in the first half a lot of new uh faces and teams in the colonial but uh Towson a very good team this year but I think this team is gonna Theyre Gonna Make some noise in that conference as well so first second year for me yeah going through that first year and all the things that he faced from beginning to end a lot for a first year coach especially at this program to deal with and hes just dealt with it so so well Applause different year different challenges Larson rejected Caleb loves Scott s for the block Love In transition where hes at his best when hes running down just you know he can go both ways but when he gets through that right hand the old finish moved more times than not Big Shot for five nope Davis tracks down the miss Applause had it poked away Music common question that Hubert Davis is getting you know whats the biggest difference from last year to this year and he doesnt want to make it sound like he knows everything now just because its here too because as you said in Huberts words this is his first ever second year as a head coach and its different everythings different Music foreign telling Pete to shoot it instead he drove and kicked leaky black will shoot it and itll shoot two at the line yeah that was a tough bailout foul and black was going to have a tough time converting and uh Charleston did him a favor by following him I dont know if Pete dance heard his head coach what do you think of the coach Yellen shoot it Pete hes going to hear that a lot I think early on in the year and uh you know he he talked to us about you know I may have to step up and and run some plays for him and get him involved that way maybe force feeding him a little bit into the offense College of Charleston won their first game on Monday over Chattanooga a game in which the Cougars made more free throws than the MOX attempted you can flip that storyline tonight North Carolina 20 of 30 at the line theyve missed 10 free throws but theyve made twice as many more than twice as many as Charleston has attempted well on the road and the way these two teams are constructed you you know you didnt think it would be the same result thank you yeah leaky black scored 10 in the first half he has not scored yet in the second half until now and thats okay you know it was a great job by him of stepping up in that first half and carrying the load offensively and now do other things that he does so well love has 23 big cot has 20 this is the largest lead of the night although Robinson able to crawl the Cougars closer scattering report you got to know hes lefthanded and wants to get that way off the dribble lets shave that a little bit cut power dribble excellent defense by Poland came in on the low side on the double and got him on the dribble under six to play only one made three in the second half for Charleston good quick hands there by bacon Davis finds some daylight in the corner RJ then turns it over Robinson the other way lost it Carolina ball yeah bad decision one on two that time didnt have numbers you got to pull it out and wait for some help to come behind you and they still rainsmith still sitting on the bench Tar Heels will take the time out Hubert Davis wants to chat Huber Davis one of 50 coaches currently leading a D1 program at his alma mater on a four in the ACC very few of a player like bacon oh man no big cut one point one Rebound in that first half completely different story here high low action getting him deep position inside 19 points so far in the second 20 minutes good follow on that Miss foreign Music interesting nugget 528 to go the College of Charleston bench has scored more points than the starters and to to be honest I dont think that thats going to be an unusual stat for this team as this season unfolds um you know granted youre not going to have a ton of games where your leading scoring Smith has has been effectively taken out of the game that being said you know I said earlier in the game when they go to their bench they dont lose a whole lot Music acot still needs four rebounds in the final 5 28 to pick up his 50th career double double currently third in North Carolina history in that department chasing the great Billy Cunningham kangaroo kid who had 60 double doubles in the 60s probably played about having some teams too different era he was way ahead of his time unbelievable athletes tend to shoot here for pretty good athlete love the black black takes it takes it all started early knocks down those threes that they were daring him to shoot and hes had a lot of confidence in his offense Applause Vernon has nine points Off the Bench Robinson has five hes got five seconds to shoot working on Davis gets two their their guards can get inside theyre strong they can get in off the dribble and work inside but uh you know for North Carolina I think theyre theyre just fine defending them off the threepoint line at this point do you think other teams will look at this Carolina film and see that theres a weakness going guard on guard inside if you have the guards you can do that yes Applause Caleb now one for nine from three in the game yeah ball from verzevich but kept alive on the Baseline by Burnham second effort wouldnt fall though and love has his eighth rebound of the night yeah those were shots and plays that they were scoring on in the first half that they have not been able to convert in during this stretch for North Carolina Music could not make the Clean Catch but he was bailed out berzovic fouled him from behind with 3 32 to play number one by seven actually defended the three the College of Charleston one of seven in this half after making only after making six threes in that first half well you know last year when these two teams played Carolina won but Charleston had a lead for more minutes in the game and its the same story tonight Charleston has led for longer than Carolina but Tar Heels have to like their spot up seven with 332 remaining and baycott at the line outside 20 in the second half 21 for the game for the senior from Richmond Applause 22 and six for baycow big possession for the Cougars massive theyve been answering uh for most of the game theyre gonna burn them is there for the defense one on one off the dribble two Applause that was a big sequence right there the good defensive stand and it turns into two points Tar Heels get another turnover this is what the fans were expecting much tighter rotation for North Carolina in the second half fewer substitutions better defense a lot more energy Applause one on one with Scott heres where you want to see him go go to work there you go put the whole side of the floor to work with no double team good patience seven points for Nance Applause cougars now one of eight from three in the second half free throws coming at the other end third personal on Burnham Music Applause this is you know games like this again we talk about you know working into the lineup you know I think weve seen a step forward for Nance youve definitely seen a step for Trimble and gaining a lot of confidence in him in game situations Tyler Nichol made a nice contribution this evening as well so just a few miles away Duke beat USC Upstate by 46 earlier tonight an Upstate is not the quality of a team that Charleston is whats the importance and value of North Carolina getting pushed like they were this evening well you know you theres nothing like the game there is nothing like game situations and uh you know this was a this was a terrific nonconference opponent to play at home thank you was fouled officials do not agree Applause Dalton bowling had 14 in the first half but hes only got two cents Tar Heels on an 80 run to really put this thing away Applause Applause North Carolina a hosts Gardner Webb the running Bulldogs out of the Big South coach by Tim Craft theyll be here on Tuesday RJ Davis cant connect Music and Pat Kelsey takes quick timeout we will take it two 95 seconds left Music we are back inside the Dean Smith Center with number one North Carolina possessing a 13point lead four nights ago UNC won its 18th consecutive season opener and now Buck 35 away from a 20 start GardnerWebb James Madison next week before the trip to the Pacific Northwest and the Phil Knight classic out in Portland some pretty stout competition out there as well opening game will be against the University of Portland and then either Iowa State or Villanova and then the third game will be either Alabama UConn Michigan State or Oregon Applause Villanova its a new era there is Jay Wright stepping down after last season a little bit of a surprise to me actually Kyle Neptune taking over Applause Michigan State fell just short against number two Gonzaga tonight the zags win it 6463 over Tom izzos Spartans and the Armed Forces classic play it on the aircraft carrier on this Veterans Day and wed be remiss if we didnt wish all the veterans out there happy Veterans Day played that game on the USS Abraham Lincoln as an awesome venue when they do that Applause Music dont forget Monmouth Virginia coming up Davis tonight thank you amen Robinson with just a second three and a half for College of Charleston two little too late a kickball on the inbounds under a minute here but its really the defensive intensity was the difference in the two halves I mean they came out as North Carolina came out second half and they were breathing fired and they got off to a quick start and uh its carried over for the for the entire house heck Kelsey is saying they cant travel in the inbounds pass the timeout was called by Carolina dance was running the Baseline like it was after a made bucket it was the second inbounds pass after the make with a kickball previously anyway not gonna be the difference in the game you mentioned the defensive intensity is a key difference in the second half what about Bay Cuts first half versus pay cut second half well and they they made a concerted effort to get him touchless I just thought that they let College of Charleston get into a nice rhythm in that first half you know they were seeing a big basket they were doing whatever they wanted to do offensively but that first five minutes North Carolina set a different tone and they spread the floor they got Bay cuts and touches deep in the paint he converted and uh was a different player and I I think again theyve they found a nice combination with that high low with with Nance up at the at the top of the key I think eventually hes going to be taking that shot GMan through two games almost two full games the Tar Heels are seven for 30 from three 23 are you concerned at all about that Applause and thats thats gonna be an issue again for you know the absence of manic was a big part of their threepoint shooting last year because yeah I mean its not and you know for for that matter for for a lot of you know his great teams for Roy Williams threepoint shooting was not a huge part of their Arsenal they relied on Tempo pace of play you know theyre theyre still putting 96 up on the board with only five made threes in this game oh thats thats the Carolina basketball Applause last year these two teams Roy Williams was down to Charleston too sitting next to the legendary cougars coach John Kress whos been a huge Mentor for Pat Kelsey and nobody has really gained any traction down there since John Cross become a little surprised at but I think I think Pats got a chance to do that thats some good coaches obviously Bobby kremmons was there for six seasons Earl Grant most recently but that you know Bobby was not for the long haul you know he was not going to stay there 20 plus years Earl Grant used it as the Supreme Court to the ACC were going to Boston College he sees 20 two close wins Eagles to Cornell on a last second shot Mercy today theyre a banged up team they need to get healthy UCF beating Florida State giving them their second Lawson too Applause Clemson lost their Town middle State rivalry to South Carolina so the Tigers take their first loss of the Year tonight as well RJ Davis circles the wagons back Kelsey wants the Cougars to maintain the pressure Caleb love for a slam the nations fourth largest college basketball arena is mighty loud right now Caleb love all by himself Applause Music 239 rebounds six assists on a night he went one of nine from three Tar Heels concede the final two of the night more than likely the number one team in the land to 86 as Huber Davis gets his 31st win at the Helm of the Tar Heels really really liked what I saw that second half tightened up the rotation you know I think Pete Nance starting to feel his way through into this lineup his Niche out on the floor you know big hot giving him touches inside and then Caleb love was killed he was
