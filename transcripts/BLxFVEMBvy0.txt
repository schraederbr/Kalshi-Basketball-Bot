16 after beating Louisville in round one yesterday and a trying season for Hubert Davis but trying to get to that NCAA tournament they were oh so close to winning the whole thing just about a year ago and they played their way into the national championship game had the lead in the second half against Kansas underway as Carolina wins the opening tip Dave this game in large measure is going to come down to whether Boston College can Rebound with North Carolina the first time these two teams played it came down to offensive rebounding Carolina had 19 Second Chance points to only five for Boston College Tar Heels winning that one and theyre only meeting of the Season 7264 club inside Miss fires on his first shot of the knights the BC to 10 seed and a pair of nice wins this season over top 25 opponents theyd be Clemson in January they upset number six Virginia as well and that one Switched in Makai Ashton Langford Off to the Races RJ Davis went underneath that screen and Ashton Langford only shoots 30 percent from three thats his 32nd three of the year and its 16 yesterday as Carolina gets on the board 32 BC Earl Grant the head coach for Boston College hes 31 in this tournament they had a great run last year now McLaughlin The 67 Freshman out of coming Georgia knocks that one down doesnt shoot a lot of Threes thats only his seventh on the season but he shoots over 45 percent from three those little slice Cuts screen for the screener in order to get Armando baycott down to the low post then the quick double on the spin getting inside the lane and thatll roll in for him every time Dave that hes on the left side of the floor that left block hes going to face up and when he faces up you can expect him to spin thats exactly what he did there and any time that Armando baycott gets single coverage they got a quick double but he needs to go to work on Boston College 69 senior gives it away Huber Davis looking for win number 20 tonight as I mentioned Earl Grant year number two at BC and a head coach and assistant stops in Wichita State Clemson College of Charleston and now Chestnut Hill Massachusetts when you were working with Hubert Davis did you ever did you ever ask him why he would want to leave a job as difficult and challenging his broadcast and go into something as easy as kosher I never did hey nothing easy about that move leaky black going up high for two well North Carolina really trying to attack the rim Caleb love leaky black and I think they should continue to do that because thats going to lead them to free throw opportunities and certainly easier baskets well Ashton Langford feeling it early the native of Worcester Massachusetts in year number five hes been around a long time did you pronounce that correctly I thought it was Woodstock that is correct thats really good pass inside for baycott knocks that one down and Armando headed to the Line North Carolina passing out of that little ball screen action and then fakeot just rolling to the basket he had to be picked up by a tag man and as soon as he set the screen rolls out and Makai Ashton Langford just jumps in front of him and its a foul and a bucket for Armando Baker Armando coming in averaging 17 and 11 just about exactly his numbers the first time they played Boston College 16 and 11 cant finish off the threepoint play when he in that first game against Boston College he had 16 rebounds its remarkable the career that Armando baycott has had at North Carolina would be the alltime leading rebounder with all the amazing players that North Carolinas had over the decades shot clock down to seven Lockton will kick it early Bay will turn and fire left and well short good challenge by Caleb love used his body Force to difficult two he caught again despite getting double up gives it up tough shot there by Black bacon right back to the glass working strong and draws another foul Baker is so good at wedging himself in there and getting that inside position on the offensive glass and again working off that left block hes able to use his right hand to pass out but just spins out of it and gets it to Leaky black but just he keeps going to the boards just making himself available and the number of times he gets to the offensive glass Zachary with his first foul they got 66 at the line and here comes Quentin post the seven foot senior and Holly that is a great sign for BC thats right hes their leading scorer at seven feet tall a huge piece of their offense at 15 points a game but he injured his mid sprain left foot against Georgia Tech he did not play against Louisville yesterday but if hes gone through the entire warmup he looked pretty good and theyre going to try to let him play as much as hes comfortable with here tonight this is a huge deal his seven foot frame against Armando Baker you could already see them getting hurt on the boards and having him back in is a huge deal right now listen Langford again hes the hot hand right out of the gate Ashton Langford is a worker and hes so good in the open floor and hes really improved those shooting mechanics over his time in college 156 rebounds again its a huge get back and Hollys right about Quentin post but I think having his ability to stretch the floor is going to be really key because he can pull Armando bacon away from the basket and Boston College has to attack the paint they are not a proficient threepoint shooting team Davis with a triple Ashton Langford number 11 for Boston College getting every shot hes taking Zachary handles at the top of the key and hell lift the long one in and out and I think leaky black being on Jade Zachary shows how much respect that Hubert Davis has for Zachary put the best defender on him on the drive what a quick step that was how many times this year would we have seen Caleb love pull up for a jumper there but that was just a strong lefthanded drive and I just think hes a better player when hes putting the ball in the deck and using that athleticism to get to the rim and pick up fouls you saw him go over six against Duke three for 12 shooting into the post four posts and a traveling violation he was around a shocked by that ball from Roger Ayers thats going to be the third turnover North Carolina on top 1510 ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times and by hotelscom find your perfect somewhere BC said yes be who we are all right be let us in the race thats on them a lot of people dont want to invite us were here okay we here I believe in each other believing what were doing okay Jimmy is at a high level do it for 40 minutes all right and all youre doing is playing BC basketball we dont gotta make nothing up this be Who We Are going well thats the Mantra come tournament time right survive and immense best you can love on the drive will kick it Nance shot clock a factor down to two long one on the way off the back of the Iron by Davis hell get a second chance though black keeping it alive heres love yes better retouch it is amazing Dave how many threes you see after offensive rebounds Boston College was thinking about taking the ball the other way all of a sudden theyve got to get matched up and Caleb love gets a wide open step in three as a result of leaky blacks offensive rebound to Langford nice feed there and a Better Block there by Nas now Pete Nance is 10th in the ACC and blocked shots and got all ball with that right hand saving the basket good back cut but Nance was alert to it on the weak side came over and just erased it by Demar Langford guys brother wondering why he went in against number 32 eight seconds to get off a shot here for BC Anniston Lankford hunting for another one and heres a three and a misfire there deflected out however off of North Carolina 1810 the heels late clock RJ Davis had to get off a deep one but leaky black able to Corral that rebound took a dribble and then when you turn your head Taylor block wide open for that three thats the best time to shoot a three and the analytics prove it after an offensive rebound he has seven Coast with a triple as you said thats a shot he can hit hes 24 out there and that takes Armando bake out away from the basket but it also allows him to get down Court a little bit early and establish low post positions good pass out his love got a great look but off the front of the iron thats just good inside out basketball knocked away and North Carolina will save it done going into the corner Caleb love has been active early in this game taking it to the basket hes made some good defensive plays especially as a weak side Defender over the swing gun backs it out and a whistle and theyll get Bay caught for foul number one and Bangkok saying that was a flop he wants the referees to look at it and they are going to take a look at it it seems Rogers and Lee Cassell heading over there and well take a look right underneath the basket Clinton post going up against Armando baycod he put that arm out but it didnt look like there was enough contact to Warrant that yeah thats youre not supposed to have your arm out I get it but that happens all the time but theres no way that that minimal contact caused that kind of reaction and especially with Armando Baker telling the referee take a look at that like come on used to be a warning those days are over 12 46 to go here in the first half looks like theyre keeping the offensive foul and Roger coming over attack with the arm not the elbow I just dont think it had had Quentin post not falling down theres no way that call would have been made so that was just a flop rewarded Jay want to ask you before we get too deep about the news about Jim behind today 78 years old hes no longer the head coach at Syracuse University after an incredible run an incredible career 47 years at his alma mater theres no way to even put in perspective the profound impact that Jim behinds had on the game of basketball 47 years at Syracuse even longer when you consider him as a player 1962 was his first year as a player at Syracuse played with a great Dave Bing but hes been not only a champion a winner but an innovator amazing strategist uh youre looking at one of the the great coaches of all time in any sport five final fours won it all with carmel of course 2003 35 NCAA tournament apparently most conferences dont have that incredible Kelly too strong with a triple Applause love gives it off for Nance Carolina running their offense long one coming and that didnt touch a thing by Johnson did not even get to the iron really what North Carolina wants to do yeah put that little chicken wing out got an offensive foul since North Carolina wants to just keep Boston College in front of him and not let him into the lane protect the paint noticing the very distinctive pink whistles around the necks of all of the officials throughout this weekend it is for a very beautiful reason Roger Ayers one of the longtime officials in this league his daughter Lakin was previously diagnosed with thyroid cancer he said you know my daughter doesnt call me all the time so I knew when I was in the locker room at Maryland when she called something was wrong she said Dad Ive got cancer he said its been very devastating shes a young vibrant woman just getting out of grad school but she will undergo surgery in a few weeks but they wanted him to know that he is supported he is loved and they presented these pink whistles at their officials dinner when they got here to Greensboro he said it means the world to me that everybodys got my back isnt that wonderful John will lift one and swish it in from threepoint land Roger a terrific official his daughter an incredibly bright young lady she graduated the University of Virginia in three years Applause well we wish her all the best on the entire Ayers family and everybody going through cancer and its been so important the V foundation and all the work thats been done theres Lincoln and Roger Ayers I mean if youre a parent heck even if youre not but especially if you are can you imagine when you get that Paul what goes through your mind its unimaginable Boston College scoreless in the last five minutes battle for a loose ball scooped up by an ants yeah as Johnson with him and he will finish it a lot of contact on that pass but leaky black getting the deflection and the Steal and transition has been harder to come by this year for North Carolina theyre not a team that forces a lot of turnovers they look very comfortable a 13nothing run for the heels nice drive on the reverse there by Jade Zachary for two he was really good against Louisville at 15 points eight assists three steals against the Cardinals excellent Defender as well for BC 2312 North Carolina DC really needs to stick with RJ Davis and Caleb love and then help off a leaky black and you cannot allow him an open shot like that that was a rhythm jumper I mean that statement not even gotten out of your mouth yet he drilled one from way downtown you just have to those are the two guys love and Davis that can really hurt you from the perimeter if you can shut them off and essentially face guard them you can help off other players North Carolina looking to add to it 2612 advantage and he quit moving first half here in Greensboro there havent been a lot of fouls because there hasnt been a lot of physicality on the part of Boston College and thats jumping inside cant get it to go Eagles have struggled to hit the three all season long theres 32 percent they rely on this guy post tough shot there as he draws the foul looked like he got hit in the mouth I was trying to make it back from that foot injury and itll be on Pete Nance number two Applause so itll be post headed for the line most improved player in the ACC ENT put a six 20point gains in Notre Dame he had a Dandy 29 Points and 14 rebounds so as it turns out here in Greensboro two head coaches ended their careers with their schools during this tournament now Mike Bray of Notre Dame and then it turns out Jim Boeheim that was his last game at Syracuse and that wasnt one that I necessarily saw coming we knew that Mike gray was gonna lead Notre Dame after this tournament but I wasnt quite sure about Jim Boeheim and from his press conference we didnt get a whole lot of clarity actually no but I dont speak behind so I I didnt have a didnt have a translator I went to school there and I dont Davis will drop in points number seven and eight for him thats too easy and hes so good in that midrange RJ Davis I think I think hes the most dangerous tourer that North Carolina has and he would be number one on The Scouting Report coming out 16 again love interrupted that pass and itll go the other way thatll belong to North Carolina leading 2814 RJ Davis has taken over most of the ball handling responsibilities just gets a high screen turns it down and Boston College and drops coverage that means the big guy Quinn post wasnt up to touch with the screener just playing sort of center field on it Boston College zoning up right now the middle of that zone is going to be the playmaker spot and then Armando baycod will just roam around stay behind it if possible flashed up top heres Davis again Bangkok with the board and he said to the line again his 611 senior draws the foul the nothing but net crew will be back at 11 30 Eastern after the Virginia Tech NC State game to break down all four New York Life ACC tournament second round games the post game interviews plus a look ahead at Thursdays quarterfinals all on the ACC Network staff his first hello Grant deciding to go with a little Zone to try to keep North Carolina out of the lane Carolinas been dominating the pain getting to the rim but when you do that one of the things youre gonna give up or offensive rebound opportunities and the primary guy you have to worry about is Armando baycod who averages or four and a half offensive rebounds a game leads the league again out of Richmond Virginia makes the pair and now Carolina really looking comfortable he has eight obviously is a double double machine Langford to get BC off quick hose trying to back down banging with Baka swooping in a lane nice shot but he can play out on the perimeter and that allowed him to keep off that dribble handoff and then he could just go into back down mode as you mentioned Clinton post one of the most improved player in the ACC I I thought that Hunter Tyson of Clemson might get back but another Rhythm jumper for Caleb love and North Carolina has not been made to feel uncomfortable on the offensive end theres just not any pressure on them right now from Boston College very homey environment certainly here Greensboro for the Tar Heels Carolina blue everywhere you look as anticipated tough angle Nation Langford with a misfire loose ball on the deck its a good pass got it inside and a foul 709 to go here in the first half of North Carolina looking good 3316 over the Eagles of Boston College around a spring one tonight but they have a long way to come back Boston College trying to ramp up the emotions to try to keep up with North Carolina in another mustwin game for the Tar Heels Johnson Wisconsin needs a win and theyre getting crushed Rojo and a must win for the Badgers its been all Buckeyes Bruce Thornton Sean McNeil outscored the entire team in the first half 4018 in Texas Tech theyre outside looking in right now well they wont that wont get any easier right than it was right there 16 points already in the paint for Texas Tech theyll never get too easier than that WVU up seven now though back to OB and Jake down thank you very much 3316 North Carolina so Joy Brackett says the Big Ten with nine bids SEC with eight seven for the big 12 theres five for the ACC right now feel right yeah I guess so I mean it it has not been a banner year for the ACC I know that the the ACC coaches and some of the players specifically Clemson Hunter Tyson I dont like to hear that but in most really good years in the ACC were talking about how many number one and number two overall seeds theyre gonna have in the NCAA tournament this year theres theres nobody in that conversation and so theres no question it hasnt been thats quote unquote normal year for the ACC Boston College back to man now they got to find a way to put more pressure because North Carolinas getting anything they want theyre shooting 65 percent in this first half I couldnt find the angle nickel into the game gets the rebound in the second try Davis the threepoint last the TJ picker staff put some late pressure on that shot to try to adjust it but still off the window and in and another offensive rebound basket the bank is open here in Greensboro I guess it is it is good call but with Jaden Zachary Carolinas going under screens with Makai Ashton Langford theyre going over but thats forcing length Ashland Langford in to help and thats a tough two he had to make well he has 11 Stiles will drive into three from the corner and North Carolina cannot miss Beyond The Arc well their shots are Rhythm jumpers and that came off of the third side of the floor Caroline is moving the ball but theres not a ton of pressure on the ball from Boston College theyre not out in passing Lanes lets not get the kind of defensive team they are but they can certainly make it a little more difficult by impacting the ball a little bit more passes are made so easily love with a foul yeah and thats leading to those open threes in North Carolinas hits seven out of 10 for the year theres 31 percent beyond the threepoint line but youre betting they were going to be better than that coming into the season at times they have been but certainly not over the entirety of the seasons one of the reasons they are where they are I always remember what the the late great Michigan State coach Judd heathcote used to say when when Mark Hugh would in a Scouting Report lay off with a guy that couldnt shoot so why arent you guarding that guy and Mark will say well he cant shoot and Judd would say do you ever think thats because people were getting a hand up on him the league Bay found a very tough sledding there and North Carolina comes away with a basketball leading 3920 as we approach the fiveminute March and its still to come tonight Virginia Tech and NC State thats at 9 30 in the finale Davis off the front iron tough shot they ran a little High screen roll replace action with Caleb love coming up top and Armando baycott rolling to the basket now that Bangkok should have gotten the ball there Zachary with some contact no whistle or he should have gotten a foul that was the foul Applause love jumping inside and finish Bangkok can either but another effort heres nickel jaycock grabs another one slapped away Ashton Langford with the fence Bay cuts down slow to get back and another basket here for BC and an official timeout as bacon hobbles off not sure whether he twisted that left ankle but after Ashton Langford was able to poke that ball away bacon went down didnt get up and Zachary drilled it and he hobbled Armando baycott heads to the bench to take a seat he just grabbed his head saying not again we have an ankle last year that was a difficulty in the NCAA tournament hobbled him in the final against Kansas but he gutted it out set the screen and then rolled into the basket went for the Duncan draws the foul good screen and roll right out of the slot and an excellent pass from RJ Davis take a look at Armando baycott grabs the rebound oh they it wasnt even because of the the strip it happened just when he went down it was basically a noncontact and just rolled that left ankle yeah and he is headed for their locker room and off he goes well get you an update as soon as one becomes available everything has been going so well to that point for the Tar Heels they got eight points five rebounds also three assists and so Johnston and Holly well guys you might remember he twisted that same ankle against Virginia January 10th and you heard him say not again thats the same ankle hes definitely limping heavy limp and hes going to the locker room well keep you updated all right Holly thank you very much BC to try and run Zachary with a kick out Kenya blocks did he get it back though Applause fight for that a whistle there on the Baseline with 357 to go in the half North Carolina leading his 3923 just under four to play here in the first half of round two and his postgame comments whats interesting to say the least we also our first buzzer beater in the Big East what do you make a North Carolina starter been great I make the medical staff has got to work really really hard right now to get Armando Bay cut back the Pete Nance has got to bring more hes got hes got to absolutely step up uh more around the bucket and inspired start for the Tar Heels they attacked the paint early its opened up their perimeter shot on defensively theyve kept Boston College out of the paint must win game theyve started well well see it half OB Jay back to you gallon thank you 357 a goal before we see it halftime in for Clinton post and well see if he can get a little damage done as he rolls and drops in two and he has half a dozen Quentin post can play inside he can play outside physical but I think Pete Nash can drive him if he gets an opportunity you dont want to do it on the first side of the floor but when he catches it I think he can put it on the floor and get it into the paint black to make a move with a shot clock at six hes in the paint Davis again oh its spun out man that was in the cylinder that was a good shot but a really good relocation rather than just stand and let leaky black try to find you RJ Davis got within his line of vision just a good job to relocate himself now black was such an outstanding Defender with the block there and finally leaky black was named to the ACC all defensive team sort of a shock last year he wasnt included in that but that was all ball a lot of contact on the drive by Zachary but leaky black ended it all there of course and its in the back down on post thats a sweet shot off the windows oh fading away Nance was open a little bit earlier but RJ Davis didnt see him right away but finally got it to him and to Tom creans point you know he can operate in there and hes got a good little midrange game but its his opportunity now to take over with Armando baycod out post straight on nice touch well thats what makes things so difficult to deal with because he can knock down a three he can post a couple minutes before the break a little more than that Boston College hoping to make some inroads here with Bay caught out love on the drive no rebound Tipton controlled by the Eagles the number 10 seed trying to knock off number seven seed North Carolina what was your take on the uh lemon Oreo thing with uh I loved it actually do you like lemon Oreos I love them really I was glad to hear somebody else did well he definitely does I dont know if its for the taste as much as for the effect yes but Im not a lemon Oreo guy I dont want Citrus in my Oreos I just I dont have scurvy this will take care of that Music Caney at the line 4128 Applause ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business CJ Payne is 67 grad well drop that one in so its 4129 oh boy head Johnson open and its kicked but who came up with the whole lemon Oreo thing I mean its a great question I dont know why youd want to go that direction when youve got all that chocolatey goodness I wouldnt put chocolate in my lemonade why would you put lemon in your Oreo well now that youve run it down like that I feel terrible to even try it what was I thinking just absolutely nuts Holly well I want to know if Jay actually tried one so that if its his opinion valid on this it feels like its vanilla wafers with a little lemon cream inside I did try them last week for the first time and I can confirm theyre better than the vanilla cream Oreos for sure yeah you lost me on that one like I did try them uh when we we did the 94 feet with Pete Nance and I was uh unimpressed its peoples taste different yeah but uh yeah I just didnt get the whole lemon thing you should all be on the Oreo payroll at this point Zachary with foul number two because I know everyone who hasnt tried Im gonna run out try them now well they led to a 229 Outburst for for Pete Nance against Virginia so clearly like I know Roy Williams a little bit superstitious at times and Im not a superstitious guy but why risk it if its working why risk it no doubt love off the fake hell Spin and Fire a good job by Clinton post to come over and help Pena lines up a long one that clangs away Applause no big story of this first half certainly North Carolina hitting their threepointers but also the exit of Armando bakehot First Team all ACC certainly looked like that ankle again which has been a problem for him David says it knocked away shot clock at nine love will shoot it manager short a lot of those threes that North Carolina Hit early a couple of them came off offensive rebounds but they were also because our they were playing inside out with Armando bacon and since hes been out you know North Carolinas found it more difficult to get open looks at any time out Boston College Joe Graham will take one here were going to go away for 30 and return to Greensboro what does it mean that were going to see some shot making in that game and Mike Young formerly the coach at Wofford now at Virginia Tech and he he hes not a lemon Oreo guy he likes popcorn sure does big popcorn guy before every game youll see him on the sideline watching guys take shots and eating the popcorn jumper on the way from the win and man but I dont know if he got it he did not I think theyre still in his hands when the red light came on and Demar Langford made the catch went up for the slam but they say no take a look referees waved It Off yeah right above I thought that red light went off yep still in his hands on the shot clock 29 remaining here in the first half as they go to the monitor make sure they have this right now North Carolina make whether its counted or not and it wont be well have an opportunity to go link to the floor here and certainly the focus when we get to halftime in the second half will be the status of the 611 senior Armando baycod he was saying you know even if he can come back if they have the game you know relatively handled if thats the case why bring it back yeah why take the risk I mean they can make that determination with their medical staff but Im assuming here that the officials are going to put a little bit more time on the clock I thought it was over three but I I cant tell you to the exact second but that gives North Carolina an opportunity if they want to to throw it to a round mid court and then call another timeout and then run a play where they can actually get a better shot now if they decide just to do it here you want to throw it as long as you can youre correct they reset the 36 black gets it into Dunn and as he gets to Mid Court heres the heave and too strong and thats how the first half ends with North Carolina on top 4329 they scored a field goal on all six forced turnovers so they made those counts and we are at the break here in Greensboro North Carolina leading BC I love Armando and I love all the players the game means absolutely nothing its about its about them its about the players thank you coach and he just scored as he opens up on the court in the second half well that was the same sort of move that he got an offensive foul in the first half when Clinton post we thought flopped and that was a lot more substantial shot that he took there went down but the referees didnt call him Zachary too strong black up high for the rebound with Carolina leading to 4529 looking to play their way into the quarterfinals baycod had to roll off the hand BC comes away with it but big guys dont like it when you throw the ball at their feet throw it up Langford Nifty little spin underneath but no North Carolina the 7th seed BC to 10 seed and getting off quickly here Caleb love and he has 14 and thats more of the transition were used to seeing from North Carolina the nice pass ahead and Armando baycott trying to post up Quentin post took him a while to get around him and then love just went right underneath that right arm and post got a piece of him going out so love looking for the threepoint play and he connects different player when hes attacking the basket first with that body and that athleticism Caleb love should make a living at the freethrow line 76 percent foul shooter master link returns to fire but no early in the game he couldnt miss late pressure by leaky black Davis takes the bump almost made the shot two so Dave for Boston College Im a little surprised that right away they didnt go right at Armando bakai Boston College should be the one testing out his ankle now get Quinn Post in the post get him out on the perimeter but go to Quentin post and see whether Armando baycott can move around a little trouble on that one thats another pass at his feet maybe the best news for North Carolina in that first half they had 16 field goals to 10 assists and this has not been a high assist team loved with the deflection very active defensively all the way to the base line throws it away picked up by Zachary pulling up against Davis and thats a nice move for two well Jayden Zachary is a very good Defender he averages close to one and a half steals per game thats seventh in the ACC but that was just a poor pass by Caleb love get down on the Baseline you throw that diagonal pass back out youre just asking for that to be picked off 4831 Carolina Applause touch into that paint with a Fall Away yeah he knew that Makai Ashland Langford was not going to be able to bother that shot Im not sure he even needed to fade away but thats Pete Nances game winner of this one to get the two seed Virginia theyve got Virginia Tech and NC State coming up later on tonight here in Greensboro Post in the lane needing some help and thats going to be a threesecond violation good job by Armando Baker just to stay in front of Clinton post when he picked up his dribble and just stay between him and the basket Nance theres no way that Makai Ashton Lankford at that size is really going to be able to bother that shot and Nance has a really nice touch hes just a different player than Brady manic was last year I mean manic at 610 was a great offensive rebounder but he could also hit six or seven threes in a game and could really space the floor and stretch a defense and that opened up so many things not just for bacon inside but somebody driving and cutting Lanes its a player in a lot of the early season voters kind of forgot about when they made North Carolina the number one team in the country Davis bumps and fouled on the play as he gets hit by McLaughlin okay and to your point Dave I think we could certainly have done a better job as far as you know North Carolina being ranked preseason number one maybe that was a little bit too lofty given the year they had last year we did it based upon the Finish but they still would have been top ten and they havent performed to the top 10 level this year thats picks the rebound right back up and takes another foul so the 611 grad out of Akron Ohio working hard because staff with foul number two and North Carolina I mean theyre theyre a good offensive rebounding team largely because of Armando baycat but their offensive rebound rate is around 30 percent you know last year it was up at like 38 percent it was up among the the best in the country this year theyre theyre outside the top 100 in generating Second Chance opportunities well the wolf pack coming in with their standout backcourts and getting ready to take on Virginia Tech looking forward to that one thats at 9 30 right here as Nance connects and this is the biggest lead 5231 from North Carolina North Carolina has been good defensively for the most part theyve kept Boston College out of the paint and turned him into a jump shooting team which is not the strength of the Eagles Ashton Langford only makes 31 percent from threepoint land and again early on he was hitting them black slice it in long one coming and thatll spin by Caleb long he has 18 and that was off of penetration you know the penetration by leaky black collapsed the defense and then a good relocation by Caleb love and that was another Rhythm jumper theyre not challenged shots so the lead balloons to 5531 here in the second half leaky black with the penetration from the left wing and as he gets into the middle draws the defense you see Makai Ashton Lankford helping off in the relocation cut by Caleb love for a simple little jump shot at least they made it look easy and another assist Berg holding off a very stubborn Georgia Tech team as they play their way into the quarterfinals here in Greensboro oh Big Block there by Nancy got up high well thats his second block right out of the hands of a Boston College shooter at The Rim well his timing is really good North Carolina guards have combined for 29 Davis got the switch Clinton post was guarding him and he was just able to size him up and comfortably step into that shot North Carolina opening up the second half on a 152 run and North Carolina basically guarding inside of the threepoint line theyre not extending out beyond that just trying to take away any penetration and force Boston College to prove it over the top and thus far the Eagles have been unable to do it they hit a couple threes to start but thats been it how has baycot look to you so far he just went down on the seat of his pants hes moving gingerly as you would expect but you wonder how long you know North Carolina is going to keep him out there because the game is pretty much in hand right now and you give them a little bit extra time to rest and and then you take the rest of the evening the rest in recovery and the rehab that they can do is so Advanced post throwing that one away he has had a rough goal but playing on a bad foot now Pete Nance has had a couple of spectacular blocks basket saving blocks in this game well timed all leather and then for North Carolina their guards Caleb love and RJ Davis have been excellent combining for six made threes college basketball is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business dad taking care of his little boy here at halftime halftime show in Greensboro North Carolina by 27 its their biggest lead in any ACC game this year well Carolina has been good defensively one three one zone from Boston College up top for Davis shot clock inside 10 the drive and kick shot clock to five love going around the back and one pass too many just a difficult pass to try to complete along the Baseline in traffic only five turnovers for the heels Carolinas not even going out to the threepoint line theyre just packing it in and trying to take away any penetration muddy things up in the lane and protect the paint Kelly left alone for a triple and nothing but net you dont want to DARE Boston College to make shots but so far the Eagles havent proven they can make them over the top and Carolinas going to make them prove it Kelly freshman out of Houston Texas as we approach the 13minute mark in the second half resting that angle shot clock is at six black they need a shot heres love to Launch ants try to keep it alive and go the other way Boston College ball well with that zone that was a little more of a one two two in that Exchange its making North Carolina use a lot of the clock Im not sure thats necessarily in Boston College in their interest they got to make some things happen long one off the front iron by Langford and one and done Tar Heels feeling good trying to trap BC but cant come up with a ball and onehander by Johnson sailed right over the iron Matson looking for the paint tough move in a foul too RJ Davis tried to slide in to get in front of Matson but he wasnt sent by the time Matson had left the floor lefthanded drive and he was probably in the restricted area as well just have his heels on it two fouls on Davis Madison makes 74 percent at the line played two years at Cincinnati before coming to Boston College he made 48 threes as a bearcat and hes been good Off the Bench the last 12 or 13 games average in about seven points a game and he was good against Louisville he had nine points in that one North Carolina Boston College two of the most beautiful campuses anywhere in America and as Davis will back it out now the drive he wanted the shot all the way he was going to take it and give him 16 this got a little screen found an opening he is such a good player onehander up and in by Kelly the freshmans come on to hit Five Points probably did a really nice job of keeping RJ Davis on his hip coming into this game 15 of his 31 field goals have been threes and as mentioned Virginia Tech and the number six seed NC State to have at it in The nightcap on blocked by McLaughlin and will trigger a break here for Boston College Vickers staff contact aired an offensive foul Applause fisherstaff picks up his third North Carolina on top 60391120 to go here in Greensboro absolute domination for Oral Roberts Applause once again the Gonzaga Bulldogs WCC tournament champions league well we certainly get Punchy around champ week and all those schools punching their tickets the NCAA tournament probably my favorite is Furman thats a great story its been decades since they went 1980 yeah Bob Ritchie has done a great job with that program and Ill tell you if youre looking for upset picks though some of the teams that have a great chance to pull early round upsets and maybe Advance or you know Drake could be one thats a another quick release by Matson to knock down the three and Boston College is starting to chip away at this lead you wonder if theres enough time left to make up a an 18point deficit but Oral Roberts is another team Max acemus still there averages about 22 points a game theyve got a big guy 74 Conor van over played at Arkansas before transferring to Oral Roberts they may be better this year than they were a couple years ago when they beat Ohio State in the tournament Davis shot clock had down to one and he dropped it in his midrange game is so good the average is about 16 points a game and hes such a good guard rebounder averages over five rebounds a game and hes barely six feet tall is getting down another one yeah hes had a terrific game defensively and that pass was whistled right past his ear and still Pete Nance was able to recover to block that shot under 10 to play Boston College back to mantoman comes three love thought he got hit Nancy just hit a long three a moment ago working on Davis who pokes it away but commits a foul Lee casell got him for the personal and thatll be his third he just had his right arm around Madisons waist Applause well guys RJ Davis is an undersized player at 61 but he is so aggressive hes so tough his nickname from childhood is the weasel his mom Vanessa gave him that nickname um and it has stuck ever since he said still to this day Mom calls him the weasel and its because weasels are small ferocious animals and that is how they think he still plays to this day so every time I see him go for a steal or make a tough play Im like well there he goes there goes the weasel again Goes the Weasel again I didnt I didnt know that weasels were considered ferocious thats a good its a great report I learned something depends on the weasel North Carolina with a commanding lead they have had for most of the night a commanding lead working it around the perimeter love pulls up and drains another one there guards have been tremendous he has 20 just a comfortable little shot fake against the zone and the close out of the Zone but Caleb love has been completely in control of what hes doing in this game at both ends of the floor but North Carolinas not been playing with much pressure I mean Boston College does not put pressure on the ball at least they have it in this game Langford steps back from 17 cant hit it and its with another rebound so hes doing a lot of that dirty work that usually see Armando Baker do underneath with the switch Applause love with a quick step slicing pretty move just took the switch on with a little hesitation move and he is stronger going to his right than he is to his left got to that right hand so Carolina on Easy Street despite playing a big chunk of the ball game without their outstanding big man a whistle with 7 56 to play love and Davis this reminds you of their NCAA tournament run and they have been dominating tonight here in Greensboro second half they made it close though incredible comeback by the Badgers they held Ohio State scoreless for almost seven minutes of game time in the second half and Tyler wall led the way with 17 second half points but they fell short they are on the outside looking in for Joe Leonard in Texas Tech on the bubble team shot bangs at three not every day you see an offensive rebound kick out for the guy who gets the three was the offensive rebounder but Joe tasant did it good news for North Carolina both those bubble teams went down OB J back to you down thank you last four in says Joe lunardi that includes Rutgers and first four out North Carolina Arizona State Oklahoma state Wisconsin post back in the ball game a little righthand Drive hes a skilled big guy just love watching him play he has 11 North Carolina playing their way into the next round a quarterfinal round number two seed Virginia awaits the winner of this one love has been on fire tonight easy cleanup there by Don the sophomore who has five its so hard to hit blockout responsibilities in a 131 Zone and you know the corners against that one three one are going to be open if Carolina pushes it down there strong drive there by match now how are you seeing Virginia Tech and NC State our second game a lot of shop makers and turquavin Smith and jarkel Joyner youre not going to find better shop makers in college basketball than those two Ned Casey Marcel in there but turquoise Smith does not play hes not shot the ball well over his last five games or so and he needs to get on track eight points for Nance but defensively hes been a menace against the Eagles Langford wants the paint now Falls away and hits it his first basket its tough to make a comeback when youre having to make so many tough twos but thats been North Carolinas game plan and make Boston College prove it over the top and keep him out of the lane for the most part Carolinas done that because of an ankle injury a Montague played only five minutes of the second half but North Carolina continues to look very good five to get up a shot here though for love Nance swings it long one coming and far too strong there for Dunn chasing it down Davis good job to keep that alive and the reset shot clocks at 14 late in the clock youre going to see Boston College you look like theyre going to man late tipped out by BC with 24 on the shot clock those tournaments all around the country of course the Pac12 mens tournament presented by New York Life UCLA a final four favorite before Jalen Clark got hurt and the announcement came today that Jalen Clark is out for the season right I had to hurry that one high off the back we never got to the rims so its a shot clock violation from baycot grinning enjoying his time on the bench leaky black going over there as well so some of the reserves will get a chance to play some loving Davis have combined for 40 of Carolinas 70 points most getting in for two good tip dunk by Quentin post from the Netherlands bet you didnt know this about the Netherlands Dave that uh Dutch men are known to be the worlds

bit back for Nance Criminal on the drive made a tough shot youngster out of Wisconsin for two or even in a Zone you have to know your personnel and that was a great drive by Seth Trimble but it was made by that shot faked and hes only made one three on the year you want to close out short to him on the other end Zachary strikes making 7455 cant pick the ball up there now the winner of Virginia Tech and NC State will take on the number three seed Clemson tomorrow night at 9 30 its hard to believe with the year that Clemsons had that theyre considered on the bubble or you know theyve got a win here Nance will give it up North Carolina really good balance nine players have scored nine have at least one rebounds six players have at least one assist Ive got four players in double figures Music but the assists have been one of the most impressive things about North Carolina in this game theyve got what 15 or 16 assists in this game and theyre a team that only averages about 12 on the year Applause well Loves going to take some time off that clock at 2 48 to play shot clock inside 10 knocked Away by Ashton Langford but he didnt earn a turnover Carolina will continue with it so look at our bracket the New York Life ACC mens tournaments Miami and weight coming your way Newton tomorrow Duke and Kent four and five game at 2 30 Virginia getting the winner of this one Clemson awaiting the winner of the nightcaps still hard for me to look at those brackets when I played in the ACC in the 80s you know the bracket was the only one it was the one furthest to the right everything started the quarterfinals there were only eight teams in the lead back there Dunn will bury a triple got eight Off the Bench or if he can come in and give meaningful minutes at the start of the year I think it was October went to uh maybe November early November went to North Carolina practice and DeMarco Dunn was so confident hes battled injuries but if he can step in and play some meaningful minutes Carolina has had some injury issues almost out of her Jalen Washington there that just picked up that foul he had a knee injury coming out of high school did not have any continuity to start the year and then that game against Virginia where baycott twisted his ankle Washington came in I remember right at 136 rebounds and he was really starting to Blossom then he twisted his ankle against Boston College and sort of slowed his development rebound there yeah super talented player and hes got a bright future Dunn gets it free tremble with a nice bounce speed but a slam by Styles so everybody getting into the act for the Tar Heels tonight in Greensboro oh thats the way you break pressure what a nice pass so the cutting Don Tres Styles out of the right corner so the bench contributing as well on the blow by Ashton Langford into his totally as 16 but has not had a lot of help from anybody else in this one Clinton post had that left foot injury and clearly still bothering him although hes working through it a little bit tonight North Carolina breaking his pressure to score just a really intelligent cut by Styles out of the corner and a beautiful little bounce pass from Seth Trimble and Seth Trimble is such a good Defender I mean hes so Dynamic getting through screens its like hes born in a stance Music Dunn will head to the bench Emmy Huber Davis an opportunity to play some more guys off the pine with 90 seconds to go Washington doubled up got it free to tremble nickel would not shoot it Nichols going to be open and left it short from threepoint land McCoy back up and two Justin McCoy transferred in before last season from the University of Virginia thats in quick move its a zacharya there for two under a minute to play right now for North Carolina as they finish out this game the jobs going to be rehab for tonight for Armando bacard to work on that ankle that tremble with the bucket there now its good to see him smiling over there on the bench he wasnt smiling when he came off hobbling on a bad angle only played five minutes in the second half but well see how the training staff does its work and Armando does have the ability to come back from injury weve seen that a bunch of times with him North Carolina emptying the bench now Jackson Watkins Creighton Libo coming into the game Rob Landry also Creighton levo number 25 his father Jeff Lebo former pet coach at East Carolina Tennessee Tech and now the Tar Heel great Jeff Lebo is one of the best Cutters I ever played against really yeah I mean both he and Steve Hale those guys back doored us so much couldnt see straight three left that pass short trying to be post either is going to jump inside cant get it to roll in well North Carolina impressive in this one their backcourt is outstanding as Zachary takes a hit drops it in as well he continues to play hard Creighton levo trying to take that charge I think hes just in the restricted area he was there but just like his dad willing to take a hit yeah he was there he just had his feet in the restricted areas he was moving backwards and you can still move backwards to take a charge theres Jeff Carlisle Pennsylvania his dad Dave Lebo was the head coach of his high school team and Jeff was a McDonalds AllAmerican and just a great player Carolina Trimble comes away with it final 10 seconds Landry will line up a long line that will drop its going to be stuffed in anyway by McCoy he got up there to provide the last highlight on an evening in which there were plenty for North Carolina they sailed to an 8561 Victory theyre on into the quarterfinals a game
