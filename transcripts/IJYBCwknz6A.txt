in the ACC this season they come in the number two seed Duke the number one we are ready to go underway and Duke wins the opening tip as they chase their 31st win of the Season Louisville as hot as anybody in college basketball as they come into the championship game Obie it seems like forever since these two teams have met it was December the 8th in their first matchup and the cards got the blue doubles down 14 in the first half but it was a tremendous run in the second half Cooper flag had a little to do with that though yeah Cooper flag was tremendous in the second half of that game hes not going to be able to help him here tonight on the floor he and Malik Brown in fact combining for 23 rebounds in that game yeah 26 points 20 of them for Cooper but also Malik Brown with three steals in that game we know what he does defensively and how he helps his Blue Devil Spa Edwards Jr with a shock loock of factor now down to three hell be a huge Factor tonight as he lifts and cant hit it the other side of the iron a second effort heres heurn Chucky heurn often times as he goes Thats How Louisville will go and hell knock down that shot he is special leads him with scoring assists hes a great defender in fact his Defensive Player of the Year in the AC thats amazing he is a menace had six steals in their semifinal win over the Clemson Tigers and was all over the place last night proor cant hit it but the slam down by B blocks the 72 freshman hes been playing really well first two games he had a total of 27 points and 18 rebounds he has been a Difference Maker Cory and hes a different player than he was when these two teams met the first time Dicky V he only played about 10 minutes in that game was one for one from the field hes already matched that here in the first two minutes of this game hes not going to play 10 minutes tonight adley trying to back down taken away by Proctor great play defensively by Proctor thats a vet move OB James negotiating his way Proctor will try a long one cant get that this has been a major problem for Duke in the tournament dick they are 12 for 52 from threepoint L they have not shot the ball well youre right Obie they have not shut the ball well here in the tournament from the three theyre going to have to make some good threes here tonight saw tyres Proctor there with the steel thats Old Scotty Pippen move fake to the front take it away from you from behind another turnover yeah he just flat lost the dribble I like that Scotty pipping analogy Scott used to do that to all the young guys Proctor one of the veterans getting it done on this last possession watch High post Proctor with a floating pass for the big guy who slams it down what potential what a future he has he didnt start Play of basketball until four years ago are you kidding me and he teach that size either yeah hes been a a centerpiece for the Blue Devils throughout this tournament on the offensive end as a la threat Edwards off the fake harassed he cant get it to drop James of the rebound Bach made that happen no question about it goodle on the drive little hesitation he took a shot both guys going down Waterman the other he was clutching at his shoulder back to the alop a moment ago we saw this time and time again in the semifinal match up against the tar Hills last night for the Blue Devils getting inside the painted area throwing it up whether its Mala watch or its GBA the Blue Devils have two La threats on the interior J White Cory he get a 60c dunp for the lob the whole team the opposition is that only 53 hes got 62 by himself man you hit the books over the last week home preparation the key to life you got to be prepared to whatever you do good it bull at the line 91 said he made 12 out of 13 the other day against Georgia Tech hes such a fierce competitor Ill tell you one thing his stock is going up Up and Up Cory like your stock when you played in Virginia was going up up and up I called your games you called everybodys games with another one thatll go down for the point guard the 62 senior from Omaha Nebraska but he is special he really is special shot he made to get them to advance against Stanford yes at the buzzer bat and going to be a traveling violation Obie one of the things you and I have talked about and we know that to beat the Blue Devils you absolutely have to have guards that can win a oneonone matchup so when you think about Chucky heurn Terence Edwards both guys really could have been First Team all AC performance they can often times win their matchups individually especially when you switch I tell you this they also got a good Wing player in Hadley Hadley with 20 points last night a bir with a triple and again the ability to be able to move heurn off the ball and place the ball in the hands of Edwards allow him to be the facilitator allows Chucky to get loose without 10 defensive eyes watching him the nipple right by everyone a strong move for two I get a real feel year that guys like kipo and heer they love the big stage they love the urn again a little bit short this time and that goes up and over the top of the backboard and back over to Duke Dicky V I agree they love the big stage and the stage doesnt get any bigger than the ACC tournament Championship with dick vau on the call of course these guys are going to show up with the brightest lights for that bedazzled Laughter basketball ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by tro price invest with confidence back in Charlotte time for us to toss it over to Angel gray well guys Dukes dominance gets them back into the ACC Championship game and while their roster has significant changes since 2023 the significant change for them or what stands true is that Tyrese Proctor enters this game with the most experience on how to win in this particular game I was asking coach Shyer how he has changed and how he has grown since that time and he said he understands the value and of each possession but also that his value is beyond how he can score he said he hasnt been really putting up big numbers he did score in double figures in the semis but hes been impactful in every other category he also reminded me they both came came in at the same time searching for how they had to add to the program success in their own unique way tyres once a rookie now a vet in learning how to lead this particular group yeah Angel tyres proor was the point guard two seasons ago when Duke was able to win the ACC tournament Championship he has stars like Derek Lively KY filipowski alongside him now he has to lead this group and the group of freshman on the floor with them outside of seon James so the difference in the makeup of these two teams and The rosters OB and Dicky V you got freshman playing against transfers a lot of older guys from M playing against some young for the blue doubles its a big difference a big difference got that experience they reshaped their whole lineup when you look oh wow a Target Isaiah Evans for the Tripper they needed that he helped a big time two games ago when he made four big threes at 16 minutes he had four big threes he can shoot the basketball had 14 points in that game so heurn looking to counter crosscourt is Waterman wide open he sticks it the big guy knock one down Waterman has been a forced from the exterior knocked down two threes in their semifinal win yesterday of vers Clemson but hes been an addition to the starting lineup with R Smith being unable to play has added defense and some timely shooting as well and if we cant hit Waterman is also the Marco Polo of college hes been ATT traveling man man hes been a Detroit Mercy to dece inside Waterman downstairs he has five OB Waterman just looked over to the bench hes lipping back down the floor grabbing his hip he fell hard on the foul with kipple and he asked for a substitution after getting the layup on the last possession yeah hes still pointing to the bench that one comes free GLE hitting the deck D comes away with it seven to get off a shot James in the corner kiple will swing it shot clock winding down heres Evans got it thats big thats big fine Evans hes a very streaky shooter when they beat orber he came off the bench in the first half and made six threes but let me tell you how locked in Isaiah Evans is right now hes made two threes and has not celebrated on either one of them he is looking for an ACC tournament championship in his hometown and that foul will go the other way goes on to Cardinals OB weve seen a lot of Isaiah Evans knocking down threes but watch as he hits the first one boom runs back on defense no celebration heres the next one off the bounce the step back boom three ball no celebration he is locked in and intent on winning a game here today hes got a future hes going to make a lot of money anybody can shoot the basketball like that is going to make a lot of cash not as much as you Cory Hey listen my moneys going up right now hanging out beside you people might think Im a big deal Chung bu whos been really aggressive offensively in this tournament heres Foster took a big of the shot clock as he goes between the legs and kicks it and heres Proctor and swishes into triple theyre making frees tonight they came into this game 12 to 52 shooting the three in a tournament yes in fact miss their first thir of the tournament and this is the best threepoint shooting the two top threepoint shooting teams in the ACC this year and Edwards answers not to be outdone by any of the Blue Devils Edward scored 21 in the first matchup but he came off the bench he wasnt a starter at the time but he had success against the Blue Devils on December 8th they one thing hes been starting since that game foul on the bille with 126 seven to go here in the first half collapsing on GBA 1715 Duke by two Terrence Edwards who often times plays with the basketball in his hands to relieve Chucky heurn of some of the ball handling responsibilities gets the switch and decides to go off the bounce docking down to three over Patrick G college basketball when you get a strong back court you got a chance and when they can go on a floor with guys like heurn and Edwards you got a chance and same thing with Duke when you look at Duke think about this in the whole nation they are the only team that is in the top four in the nation offensively and defensively ranked by Ken pomoy urn just picked up his first foul a moment ago Foster cant get that one to drop 1151 to go here in the first half Louisville with a pair of Razor thin wins in Charlotte at the buzzer against Stanford and by three last night Louisville and the Blue Devils playing for that gorgeous trophy as Cory said be dazzling I want that trophy I want that Music trophy e Noah Waterman off to a great start for the cards but takes a hard fall on that right hip holding the elbow but coming back toward the bench is telling his bench to get me out but goes to the bench get some help from the Theon a very important member of This Global Squad of course playing without R Smith the Waterman replacing R Smith in the starting lineup and it adds to their defense especially although hes knocked down a few threes here in Charlotte Waterman really gives him a glot of help I said he was the Marco B guy cuz hes been in Niagara Detroit Mercy BYU and now Louis thats four scores a sixyear player a veteran but has been has had a large hand in helping Pat Kelce rebuild the Louisville program and on the drive Proctor sealed him shot clock at seven for Louisville his heurn has got off to a quick start hes denied and a pass never got there picked off by kiple kiple coming off a couple of strong performances here at 28 in Dukes first game in the tournament but a turnover and On The Run theyll fire it out and pretty sloppy yeah real sloppy you know hurg when you saw that pass he tried to throw diagonally it was intercepted that same pass was intercepted against Stanford and almost cost a big but he came back showed his guts in his heart and he ball loose ball bounced him at the elbow he knocked it down and Stanford was heartbroken this would be Dukes first outright regular season ACC and tournament Championship since 2006 canle inside such a smart play by kiple going and using that 66 frame to get in front of his Defender and then playing off two feet to get the easy bu what really makes him special is his ability to drive and to shoot the three as well ruths inside nice bounce feed for the basket and a wellrun play and Hadley for two I really like Handley hes multidimensional hes versatile great movement right there without the basketball Twan play really efficient Applause Music Applause Kip malaan rolling inside and it is tipped out of play itll be Duke ball here Dicky B you said it best its great Movement by Hatley he doesnt wait in the corner looking for the three He makes himself available to Roots as he attacks the basket as malawat turns his head gets the easy layup the L art in basketball moving without the basketball every really wants to put it on the floor guys one one Proctor heating up I mean he was in no mans land threepoint land the first two games he was 0 for 10 yeah hes the kind of guy that could come back and go five for five looking for the answer itll be offt Target by Edwards a loose ball save back to the bill great Hustle by Kai Rose to come up with that second chance opportunity Scott wearing that protective mask gets it right back to Foster big pump hell lay it up charge it go the other way smart play by Chucky heer getting back in legal guarding position and now there are times where its okay to lead with the shoulder but when you dislodge a player as Caleb Foster does here and also extends that right arm a bit that is going to be an automatic call offensive foul but just a smart play by Chucky heurn getting back in position thats why he was Defensive Player of the Year in the ACC of an honor for a guy like that with his size he showed that right there hes a winner man hes just a winner came from Wisconsin transfer portal but start transfer portal for us broadcast I like that idea that one tipped up and in as Scott got a high Scott came from Charleston Al with Coach Kelsey big guy inside and wearing that protective mask that we mentioned yesterday he got took a real big shot in the face in February in a game and lost some teeth and a facial fracture too heres Proctor to launch again he feeling it adley on the Run Edwards trying to finish it he banks it in and a whistle too this this a really good Louis V te really good they are Dicky B and theyre looking for some national recognition right now when you consider that The Narrative of the ACC being down Im not sure if people respected their 18 and two Conference record however winning an ACC tournament championship against the Blue Devil would absolutely Open the Eyes to the public and I think it would increase the seed in NCAA tournament C Pat Kel talking to before the game I wanted to play for him I can tell you that right now he has that kind of personality he really does and so these are two rising stars in coaching no doubt about it the future for these two is so bright they get it they know how to manage them roster they know how to really go get players the key is getting quality trans if going to get him goodle grabbing the Miss proor got hit with a foul P Kelce called last nights win over Clemson the most physical game he has ever coached and this ones getting pretty physical too Waterman getting back in the game and immediately involved in this gunba hitting the deck take a look and gangba taking the worst of that walk man grabbing the back of his head taking gangba a second to get up off of the floor after that one the officials are going to go over and look at this to see if there was anything extra looked to be a common foul they what they got has been a big big plus for D coming off that bench hes got one hech of the future 61 he play against more playing time in the future hes going to be really special yeah 12 points against North Carolina really got involved as you take another look so the officials tonight Roger SS Ron Gro and Clarence Armstrong heading over to the monitor with 840 to go here in the first half now you take a look at Scott I mentioned before how you look at malawan shes got 61 dunks hes got 76 dunks hes second in the nation second to CL brener from out of freon who has 100 and you talk about Scott with the 76 dunks and wearing the mask so when you go to Louisville Obie of course when you see a mask like that you think of two separate movies one of course Bane and Batman but also Hannibal Lecter okay so when you look at the mask people are have thought of different nicknames for it with him being second nationally in dun scky B how what do you think about Silence of the slams wow are you you worked on that all day you were her State you looked in the mirror hey I was saying earlier can you manage your broadcasting if we had nil and we had transfer Port upgraded to a FL one foul itll be two shots and the ball for dke I love that thought but this one upgraded to a flagrant one on the collision between Gung buub and Waterman whos had a rough first half and thatll send Patrick gunba to the line so what its going to be they had to have looked looked at that as excessive and thats the only reason it was upgraded to a flagrant one is because they thought it was excessive with the contact from Waterman running in to gunga on that possession now gunga just 64 at the foul line tell you one thing he got a nice stand evation though gunga from the Louisville bench when he miss that free throw so he makes the second and of course the basketball for Duke two you know in a way I I agree with Roy Williams Roy Williams Hall of Famer said once I I I remember him saying this he said the tournament is like a cocktail party because the real steak and potatoes is coming up next and I think Duke in a way is going to benefit in this have guys getting really important minutes toing at Cooper back proor too long and a foul will go the opposite direction with 826 remain and theyre not only missing Cooper missing Malik Brown as well as you take a look at Cooper and Malik of course gangba picks up the personal Malik with that shoulder problem no sling there for brown so good sign there out with that left shoulder which has been so Troublesome many people confuse OB they see Cooper with the chain on with the number 32 on it that was his high school number that was his main unit n it number of course wears the number two for the BL Devils but thats a old chain yeah shout out to Maine United M wow I think its a little expensive too oh yeah I think the nil money was the help with that baby were going to cap up champ week tomorrow by the way two more Championship Games SEC title game at one and then on the final automatic turnning ticket thatll be punched by the winner of the American championship game hey what about today Florida blowing out Alabama putting a like a 100 on them its unbelievable what Floridas done Bruce Pearl told me when I did an allberg game he said Dicky be take it to the bank Florida is the best team in the country he said thats coming out of Bruce BR well Florida was the team that actually went to Auburn and beat them on their home floor so if anyone knows it would be Bruce Pearl that got to have a chance against Tennessee tomorrow got clock down to one H bur he did get it to the rim and thatll go in the opposite direction with 743 left in the half Duke on top 2321 the ACC Championship in Charlotte e e now Dicky and Cory lilles tournament resume they have been as hot as to firecracker winning 21 of their last 22 four and five against the quad ones well you know we hear so much about quad ones and the average fan doesnt know what people are talking about let me quickly Define for you a quad one win is if you beat a team who is one to 30 ranked and you beat that team and thats a big big win for you and then at home and then if you beat a team on a neutral floor thats 1 to 50 and 1 to 7 5 away those are quad one wins saying all that North Carolina there a charge right there North Carolina for example my eyes my my one eye actually my one eye tells me they belong in a tournament that team is a different team Quarry they theyre a different team than they were earlier in the year the last 10 games youve seen them with the big lineup now but whats going to hurt them the Dukes going to his own whats going to hurt them is the fact they won and I believe 11 or 12 in the quad once I mean thats going to really hurt that if if the committee lives by all that talk about quad one your strength schedule thats going to hurt them to tomorrow when the selections over but I think we both know exactly what you mean about Carolina they just look like a tournament team Hadley will scoop it and lay it in they did not in the first half yesterday when they were down by 21 and eventually 24 but by the end of the game they look like a tournament team thats kind of the the story of the Carolina season right right now lardy has them out of the tournament theyve been yoyoing back and forth James on the attack cant get it up there hwat tried he couldnt do it his hook and thatll drop in h watch has been spectacular for the Blue Devils to start this game all over the offensive glass being a la threat and a presence on the interior of both ends of the floor great second effort heurn no Hadley grabs it Edwards 25 points 21 points in the first two games of the tournament for Louisville the number two seed theres a chance for the MVP if they win this game indeed on his spin move couldnt quite get it there loose ball and scooped up by Mason Gillis quickly heres Evans you dont mind that shot by Evans though thats one of the things John Shire knows hes not going to be bash but when he gets his opportunities hes going to take it Troyer with a kick out heurn is open from three great close out by Mason Gillis there getting out not allowing Chucky heurn to see a clean basket and thats the extra effort John Shire is looking for from his team defensively they won johnon great job teaching defense theyre one of the five best defensive teams Ive seen this year James Quick Step got Scott on the move and a whistle itll go the other way on the turnover Duke had 13 turnovers against North Carolina and that didnt please John shy talking up before the game K malawat continues to hang around the basket even though he gets his first attempt block he has the soft touch going to the jump hook able to finish it off but the Cardinals making everything difficult on both ends of the floor for the Blue Devils there testing Dukes defense getting into the painted area theyve been doing that all year against everybody they really have Im not sure people recognize how good of a team this is and theyre down a number of players boy Proctor went down hard and hell pick up the foul as he tried to stick with heurn easier said than done thats a great point you made there querry because you know why people have looked at the ACC in the down year they look basically three teams in this league in terms of when you talk about Clemson talk about Louisville and Duke and they look at the rest those arent quad one wins when you win those games against those people its amazing this Leagues going to do a better job of handling the nil and the transfer portal and get stronger this conference for years was the best and Im telling you right now it has taken a real hit well to your Point Louisville is Dukes first ranked opponent since December 4th when they face number two Auburn wow you do your research up and in for two and tie to 25 thats the second time weve seen that corner cut Edwards cutting making himself available to Chucky heurn instead of waiting in the corner for the three ball he gives him an outlet around the rim you beat me to the point again I was ready to talk about that cuz I remember when the movement without the ball first thanks a lot Nick V do you realize how long I have sat in front of a TV and watched you I can dock I understand exactly what youre watching because you taught me this game a long time ago and when you see guys cutting like that youre always going to point it out yeah I I love it I love to see movement in the basketball movement of the ball Evans got a good look malat had it knocked out of his hands but chased down by Foster rockers open he wont wait down it goes he feels it today baby get me the rock hes say get me The Rock I feel it baby I feel it I feel the excitement here really anytime you play for trophy special boy Edwards with another quick answer hes got that Knack doesnt he thats who hes been he is averaging 21 points per game over their last 14 games I thought he was right on the cuss for being a first team all ACC performer but he is the reason why Louisville is 182 they changed their defense because of ever piple around and out rebound comes to heurn and were tied at 28 here in the championship game he got a little di for Dandy little baby yeah follow its high up with a rebound and a foul 338 left here in the first half Tyrese Proctor knocking him down from Deep his third threepoint field goal low go range and of course theres a former Blue Devil who has got to throw up the three low Music go ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours physical we talked about Joy and Pain coming on the air but also physical basketball a big part of it when you reach the ACC Championship game is basketball considered a contact sport cuz if it werent somebody classified it wrong when you think about this game you have to be prepared for the physicality especially with a game as such high stakes as what youre going to see a ACC tournament Championship both these teams wanting to hold that Trophy and laying everything on the floor here tell you one thing we talk about Talent you look at Duke they got three players being charted in the top 10 of the NBA draft loan Cooper kipo and malivar watch proor to give Chase thats going to be Louisville ball Caleb Foster could have allowed that ball to go into the back court thats what John shires telling him he could have because it was tipped he could have allowed that basketball to go into the back court and just grabbed it in comparison to trying to save it in the front Court John shy called Carolinas comeback from 24 down yesterday in the second half of blur and we would agree that was some performance by North Carolina but Falling short in the end tough shot by Hadley as he is a rash going in strong Im glad you mentioned that because I thought yubert Davis you know I worked with him at ESPN and he never ever had that I thought that kind of unbelievably fire that he demonstrates on the bench and I think reflects his players his players really see their coach fighting like Heck on their behalf and the bottom line is they never quit they could have rolled over they went down four I believe with 16 minutes left in the game yes unbelievable selection Sunday coming your way weve got you covered it all starts at 600 Eastern Sports Center on ESPN Reese and the guys will have at it and then at 800 the womens field of 68 is on the way in Bracketology at 900 eastn on ESPN 2 so its the bill by one seion Smith such an important part of this team he really is what a job he does to transfer to Lane does a great job the deck real hard got it free somehow and one as James came in to clean it up and took the foul two Dicky B you were right on Q talking about seon James and once again you see guys not waiting around Cooper flag Malik Brown reacting to the strong play by James but James not waiting for the basketball he is making a play moving his body getting to the spot and is able to get an opportunity for an and one because of the playing Point has really really helped this team I mean James has been so efficient so effective and hes got a physicality strong Body by the way give me a turnover I said seion Smith I believe bottom line is give me a turnover turnover you just said seon no turnover on that one believe me if you turn one over Ill let you know Ill chop it up you Dicky be Zone man two three Zone he already weve had seven lead changes in the championship that there for Scott how about the preparation you talked about preparation the Pat Kelsey had his group prepared for the zone that was a called play by Design to be able to get the dunk along the back line great screen set by Terence Edwards to free Chucky vble takes the bum leans in got it off the window oh he is strong on drive he really is got away maybe with a little charge right there hey bottom line is Heburn got right in the gap of that zone you got to get the gaps and seams of the zone and also right behind the foul line area Edwards with a triple thats some high level stuff here it absolutely is OB but when you play zone you have to be prepared for the threepoint shooters that is the third threepoint field goal made in this game by Terence Edwards Jr you have to identify where he is if youre going to to play two three James around the back same with Foster the scoop no rebound comes free to the Cardinals here they come tell you what people aren going to want to look at this Louisville team early in the first the second round of that tournament this a real strong basketball team they versatility they can handle the ball Shooters Edwards directing traffic shot clock down to eight Scott again for Edwards on malawat Airborne no the tip no trari right back up for two what a great effort on the glass right there unbelievable this is a tough tenacious Louisville te you talk about guys that star in their role abubacar trari is absolutely a star role player for the cars hipple from the corner wont drop what a difference a year makes to be a l B wow little Wild by Tori he got it free anyway to Edwards he will attack again and thatll drop uncles in the house baby Uncle momentum has gone the way of Louis bille a 70 run by the cards trying to close out this half second Music Edwards was at James Madison he was the Sun Belt well the Louisville Cardinals playing in their first ACC tournament Championship Louisville coming into the ACC in 2014 they have won 21 of their last 22 games and they are cooking on all cylinders right now in the ACC Championship a 70 run over over the last 138 and now looking to get a stop to take a fivepoint lead or more into the halftime locker room but OB on December 8th when these two teams met lisal had a fourpoint halftime lead the Blue Devils came out played an excellent second half ended up winning that game by double digits yeah they had a guy by Cooper flag who went off in his second half right now hes being a coaching assistant and if you Shire he doesnt need him as an assistant he needs him as a Music player 9 seconds to shoot final shot coming up for the Duke Blue Devils James James on the spin and cant get it at the horn so thats our halftime score Louisville on top the number two seed leading the number one seed the Duke Blue Devils 38 33 a highly entertaining first half really with a 17 rebounding Edge neither team had larger than a fivepoint lead Edwards Air Mail on that one to begin the second half lets check in with Angel guys I was able to catch up with Coach H he told me that their streaky offense was impacted impacted their defense it led to the seven turnovers just a reminder guys they only average nine turnovers per game he said hes challenging his team at half to work to get open I also asked about the zone that he put on Louisville as well he said Tyrese proor right now now was in foul trouble in the first half he was trying to protect him so just being mindful of where he is in this game as far as foul trouble yeah Angel when you consider this is the first time the Blue Devils have played a ranked team as proor knocks down his four three of the game but this the first time they played a ranked team and this Louisville team is great defensively it starts with Chucky heer and of course the point of attack defensively and Terence Edward so there are a number of really good Defenders for this Lille team thats what caused a lot of turnover man who took a pretty good shot in the first half although he was called for a foul on that with a misfire but a foul here Ill tell you one thing Cory when you have a guy like at the point that can defend like he can Chucky Hepper thats such a positive move look at this guy cheering his head off I tell you what a great teammate he is not only a superstar players love him Cooper Hes just a great great teammate it really is dicki B when you consider Cooper flag during fall break didnt want to go back to Greensboro with the rest of his family because he wanted to stay on campus with Comm malawat and Tyrese Proctor who of course couldnt go home we got a little extracurricular here just a little gathering amongst friends thatll be Duke ball after the tie up so getting a little bit chippy but because when you seek malawat and Waterman both trying to hang on to the B basketball afterwards and malat was having words with tayori on the way out of the game at Halftime both and tayori clapping in his face but this game is going to be testy its supposed to be its March this is what youre looking at trophies are one right now and its supposed to be testy between these competitors tell you what you talk about testy you know in a handshake after the game last night there was an incident BR almost started players shoved the player I personally think we shouldnt have shaking hands after the game should do it before the game I agree with you hardly I think after the game emotional P ble with a big drive for two and he has eight he can drive the basketball he really attacks with great competitiveness Edwards after the airball to begin the second half kicks it out here for Hadley and Chucky hurn one of the most electrifying point guards in the game botman with a kick himself heres Edwards and and sinks it a threepointer that was a good three it wasnt not a bad shot quality shot it was set up with the diagonal pass and he was squared with his body he squares the body you can encounter but doesnt it seem as though Edwards is always the guy responding with a three every time the Blue Devils go on a run yes he has 18 points Im shocked hes a third Team all ACC should higher than that he was higher on my list Nick B kiple takes the foul he gets hit thats with 17 47 left to go and keep an eye in this game at the 5minute Mark if Louisvilles in front they have not lost a game all season long and theyre ahead with 5 minutes to go theyre 27 and0 and you do your research wow thats unbeliev Che wait you do seven games Im my doctor DRS and said I can only do one game a week after having five major vocal Court canas C but Im telling you Im honored for be a for one game with you guys as you work so hard its a thrill man to have you it always is got my guy John Madre here we go back a lot of years you go back a lot of years with John Madrick you go back decades with John madri whos as good as he gets hes done 43 championship games in the ACC Lov by one and the ball Javon Hadley dangerous beyond the threepoint line himself seon really treding to play as tough as he can they switched there and hes playing certainly Edwards he wants to shoot it backing into Proctor can he get it up he did in time and he hit it right at the heart he can score hes got versatility in scorer hes not just the guy going to shoot the three hell beat you off the bounce you inside hes a special player he really is and Edwards was the Sun Belt player of the year here a season to go for James Madison team that won an NCAA Tournament game so he has experience in March otherwise was not expecting the pass by Evans youre right Cory he s over 1300 points was that James M who has a real strong program rounding out by Hadley Duke down three its been Whiplash for Duke here and Charlotte they down 14 to Geor Tech in the quarterfinals then they were up 24 on North Carolina in the semifinals James going in strong hell draw the foul he was a great pickup you know you think about these pickups I think of they got a general manager in Rachel Baker she is terrific Im tell you that now you watch North Carolinas going really improve with Jim Tanner as a general manager three fouls by the way Rachel does a terrific job and so it will be James to line 81 played 31 minutes against Georgia Tech in their first game didnt turn the ball over hes had one turnover in the tourn hes so steady with it I know you know Cory did he come from chain he did yeah chain he was a good player at Terin and tomorrow night at 9 Eastern on acc Network the nothing but Ned mens and womens selection special coming way they break it all down the brackets and preview all the the games ACC teams are going to be playing in at the moment Joe lardi says three teams in the NCAA tournament out of the ACC its a shame when you think of the ACC I think of the years of all those great great teams in the conference but right now only looking at three in the NCA tournament theyre going to do something with that n and something in roster management and thats what Duke does a great job at by having Rachel Baker there Edwards working on a 20point game gives it up for Hadley taking on gunga downstairs got really deep Waterman on the attack air mailed it Duke with an opportunity to retake the lead I love the potential of Ganga Cory and he came in this year Dicky B he was injured missed his entire senior year of high school as Proctor lines up another three unable to get it to go but but he was a guy that Duke really wasnt planning to have to play much this year but because of the entries to Malik Brown he is absolutely had to help them and stayed in shape got himself in great condition and has been a bonus for John Shire in his roster and its going to help certainly when it gets down to really the meat and potatoes what its all about the NC tournament five to get off a shot here Edwards fumbled it on James leaning in are you Ser are you serious serious come on now come on now thats for LeBron James and the big stars of the NBA wow hes pressured had a head in his face and hes still delivered thats a PG beer baby a prime time performer well his son who was born back in the middle of

Edwards by the way with all seven second half points for Louisville and his second half began with an airball from three put that in the rear viw mirror he bur to the line outstanding foul shooter at 84 Edwards is so confident OB he forgot all about that air ball its almost like like it never happened and again when you got a great player as such youre talking about a young man whos had success at four years at James Madison and then coming to louisv started off coming off the bench you had him in the Bahamas he was not this type of guy but now as you look the second half of this season he really has been the most valuable player for the Applause Cardinals High post for gangba and off for Proctor the big man rolling inside batted away James flips it up cant make it but hell be at the line I want to pay tribute to two people who lost their lives this week two really superstar people at what they did Junior Bridgeman from Louisville tremendous player great great businessman educated

that adley working on Proctor and swatted Away by gunot maybe control Bly and at 20 against f and in the first match up he had 32 tonight hes got five well he didnt get any here because Patrick gumba denying that opportunity gumba with the reputation of a big time offensive player which he is but he is truly steing it up on a defensive end for a Blue Devil Ed be denied by Gillis flipped it no and he got the rebound toois gets him a little rebound hes also capable of shooting the three the up Purdue really well on a team that went to the final game and got beat by the Huskies Connecticut who dominated everyone six man of the year the Big 10 from the corner James yes sir hes so valuable hes so valuable doesnt get a whole lot of publicity but what an a he is to do oh they love it the dookies are love it they love it we have seen these runs by the Blue Devils Forever at Cameron Indoor however now in the Charlotte College see him it feels like Cameron South in the Music building Duke on top of the ACC title game 247 if you can indulge us for just a moment I would just like to thank over 100 incredibly talented and hardworking men and women for ESPN the ACC Network putting on this show all week long here in Charlotte at the ACC tournament they are incredible they are amazingly gifted theyre passionate at what they do just want to say thanks to each and every one of them they have been incredible thats really classy of you David and youve been and Bary with do seven games here I have great respect and admiration for you that burn with a misfire in close piple comes away with a loose ball and now its Duke with the big mole James with 12 points in this half another triple by proor and thats whats been avoiding the Blue Devils since theyve been here in Charlotte however they found the threepoint touch they averaged over 10 a game in the regular season and now it is showing up in the post season season they got nine in this game they got nine a 10 nothing run for Duke Edward pushed out to the logo tell one thing they play defense they really get after it defensively you always hes got a chance to win when you defend Proctor again around and out this Applause time Edwards trying to bring back a recovery here for the Cardinals a long one on the way and too strong by ruths hipple on hurn oneonone a block but count that that basket will be good kiple got it on the glass first before Scott was able to get to it but its starting to sound like Cameron indor in the building right now the blue doubles on one of their patented runs and it normally starts with transition threes kiple finding tyres Proctor in the corner as the Blue Devil faithful here in the Spectrum Center applaud their squad Music Applause right here Applause Applause right champ week rolling on the ACC Championship Duke is rolling they have their biggest lead of the night played really well here in the second half but this Louisville teams not going to go away little bounce Inside by Chucky heurn for two he has 11 nice drive by heer theyre not going to go away theres no quitting there proor left open again and he cant miss all of a sudden hes up fire how do you lose Tes Pro he has been the best player on the floor for the blue doubles in this championship game and you run down the floor and no one matches up with him that is a thats a shoot around shot OB thats playing horse out there theres no one within 10 ft tell you one thing hes been a fire how many thre he made in he six I believe hes at yes hes at six on the drive Edwards denied in heavy traffic double fake what a score that was I mean the way he scores in traffic separates him so many players he scores in traffic and Edwards has been the answer for the cars throughout this game thats going to be an offensive on kipo Edwards kind of crumbling at his feed and kiple called for his second tyres proor that was a good call tyres Proctor wide open in the corner and lets him know you cant hold me you cannot leave me open not tonight he strug would to shoot the basketball here in Charlotte but the change of fortess have been completely different on Championship Saturday was over for 10 from three in Charlotte before tonight 6 for 22 hes a different guy in the championship game H watch High out of the sky for another rejection look at that hustle look at that hustle are you kidding me coming in the water are you serious Bo Nick sa would like to get those guys in the football uniform wow ball on the possession arrow unbel but look at him diving on the floor believable unbelievable watch the shot block right there great block unbelievable now watch this hustle its incredible diving on the floor look at these guys look at them right there unbelievable kipo it means so much man and that is all because what they get from their coaches about we got to hustle we got to scrap a lot of guys talk that game but the players dont relate and do it these guys do it absolutely and Dicky V you know Nick savs one of us now yeah I know like a little public well he does a similar job I dont know if hes one both I know one thing is checks a little bigger little wait a minute Im not sure anybody check is bigger than yours so 9 935 to go on the Contest 20 seconds shot clock reset to 20 seconds after Louisville gets possession with the arrow I know one thing if youre John shy and youre Pat Kelce you got to appreciate what those kids on both teams did going after the ball like that thats just respect for your uniform respect for your teammates and how much it means to you thats special it really is and Dicky B you mention in the n transport portal era one thing that remains constant is great coaches can get their players to play the game the right way regardless of the money regardless of anything else and these two teams have absolutely been great examples of that all season look at the move by heurn weave it his way inside but he cant finish it I agree with you Cory no doubt about it the time is H of the world they put it and they get their players to play proor got the shot the a draws the foul OB we have watched the Blue Devils a lot this is the most aggressive Ive seen Tyrese Proctor 18 points 6 of 12 from three but even the last play attacking Chucky heurn off the bounce Tyrese Proctor is the only member in the rotation for the Blue Devils that has the ACC tournament Championship he is the leader of this group from an experienced our play brought to you by Centos when you think about all the experience hes had over the years I mean its incredible hes such an experienced player urn picked up his third foul too on that play yeah hes right now ched to be a second round draft choice he and also Evans and no Evans is actually chared now in the first round and Smith no James is also a second round I would love to see tyres Proctor come back and Lead another Blue Devil team I believe hes better than a second round Prospect if thats what going to be this year he can change his fortune kle got a really good look around and out he doesnt miss many of those d by n Ive become a big CLE fan I love how hard he plays Edwards gives that off priori back outside hes Beyond a three now inside it trying to get play James and thats an offensive and thats an easy call Roger As right on top of it you see the right arm of treor go across the face of cion James an easy one Roger airs right on point tell you one thing and Ive been away from the the game a little bit the last couple years my battles with cancer but the one thing thats constantly coming back Roger s is always as efficient you have him on the game hes going to give you an honest day work the absolute best of the best and the Roger SS the official is going to go over for a hostile act to see if this should be upgraded to anything but I agree with you Dicky V he is absolutely the best of the best when it comes to the officials at the college basketball level these three you know I didnt know something I learned today oh yeah no question watch the contact absolutely I did not know the Cory pointed out to me David Robinson who I labeled the Admiral was so good at the Naval Academy a beautiful guy his son is an assistant coach played here and hes an assistant right he absolutely is Justin Robinson who is in charge of the big guys who has done a tremendous job all season long with k modat with Malik Brown with Patrick gumba getting these guys available theres the Admiral whos my teammate Dicky B I was actually drafted to the San Antonio SP Ru on the force confirmed offensive what a great guy we honored him at my gallon he was such a big hit David up this raise millions of dollars just there there he is right there I did not realize Dicky that that nickname was your idea the Admiral I give a lot of nicknames what Michelangelo Dean Smith let me say this Im so honored to call me the other day that Im going to the end of the Dean Smith award by the basketball writers of America that really is special congratulations man yeah Im going to go there in April up in St Louis oh beautiful I believe we could name more trophies that you dont have ble the follow malat again Ill tell you what a tremendous suff effort right there by du malawat here is going to be special four years playing basketball you cant teach his Mobility his size well Duke trying to win the ACC tournament as they won the regular season of the ACC but trying to do this for the most part without the best player in the country Cooper flag who only played about 15 minutes theres the rejection by the big guy malawat again who is having another night but how about malawat just getting in a stance doing the job defensively guarding Terence Edwards no ones been able to do that all night however the big fella sliding his feet denying the opportunity and leading the Blue Devils to 11point lead time for tonights experts in work brought to you by principal and the expert has been tyres CER 6 threes for him which is a career high throughout his three years at with the Blue Devils and he has been the answer for Duke here in the second half going into the halftime locker room down four it has been tyes Proctor seon James the veterans that have brought the Blue Devils back and they are experts at work so he has 18 Duke had been shooting it miserably from threepoint land even though they won two games here in the tournament but not tonight lets go to Angel coach Sher told me pregame right now Tyrese Proctor is due Interruption on the offensive end he said he wanted to make sure that he was easing his way into it but he said hes found other ways to impact this game he led in plus minus one game was one of four players to lead in double figures and also has been able to defend but in this game Ive seen him throughout this ball game looking at him dapping him up having conversation with him on the sideline you said it earlier he is locked in and Angel coach sh also talked to you about his guards defensively talk about the job that theyve done on Chucky heurn so far in this game I think at the end of the day when you look at Tyrese proor what we said earlier is hes learned how to lead his way it may not be the most boisterous thing but he has led people and Coach sh said he believes he has one of the best back courts with them in the nation Ill send it back to you OB that burn with a foul as he knocked Proctor to the deck and thats going to be four on bur and former Duke great my guy I love him to death Jay will earlier today said that Louisville had the best back for it in the country do you think AR you can make an argument for that I I think they have a great back court with Chucky hat burn and terce Edwards but do you think that seon James and tyres Proctor had a chance to hear that it looks like they did it looks like they did because those two guys in the second half of this game have carried the Blue Devils we talk about Khan kiple and how great hes been but when you look at what has happened in the second half with the Blue Devils going in down five it has been those two veteran guards in the back court that has carried the Blue Devils here in the second half jwell really was trying to motivate him maybe Inspire him that could be the case in the lane got the shot at the wants that shot to count by the way he was isnt just a dookie Jay will was as special as he gets that shot will count it was goal tending absolutely the right call and a foul as well so itll be Hadley to the line Dicky who do you like to win the whole thing the NCAA Championship who are you leaning on right now oh wow youre going to put me on the spot on the spot on the spot well Im going to tell you this man let me tell you this I go to my dbdi my vital ball Dome index I dont need all these other indexes and all that I just need that ball Dome baby that one right there right there the beauty I need that beauty my ball Dome tells me when you got a team that ranks is the only team in America only team by Ken pommeroy offensively and defensively in the top four in the nation you combine it by having the greatest player in the country today by a coach who just handles the players so beautifully I know theyre going to yell hes dooky V well you know what I can even spell it d k and that to me is unbelievable I should be in the spelling big but Ill tell you one thing theres no doubt I feel Duke is going to win it all Cory no ball dome for you but whos the number one team in the country of you whos going to win the whole thing the number one team in the country right now to me is a d Blue Devils wi healthy heres the concern Im not sure that Malik Brown makes it back in the NCAA tournament this the second time he is dislocated that left shoulder Cooper flag going into the NCAA tournament will not be 100 healthy I believe the team that wins NCA tournament is the healthiest team down the stretch between Duke Auburn Tennessee Florida and the University of Houston those five are my to Win It by the way they did wave off the B you got five choice you got five Champions I got one you got five well you got on the limb see heres the thing nobody nobody comes to you and says Dicky B you were wrong everybody loves you they got all going to come back at me and soon as I missed yeah you may go for five 10point game urn trying to bring the bill closer well short hes had a very tough shooting night yeah I think he should penetrate boy he is trying to penetrate and maybe create with his ability to pass the Applause Music rock piple drives it scores it hes one of the best drivers in college basketball Cory Edwards Jr Airborne very difficult angle malawat cradling a rebound how about Mala going after the block shot doesnt get it but comes back in to gather the rebound finishing the POS possession for the blue doubl defens and 10 rebounds for him I see him getting better and better with each game I see him getting more confidence believeing in himself and thats a major major plus Absol minutes to go Gull using the screen shot clock down to five Gillis open and cant cash in bot only played 10 minutes in the first matchup between these two teams December the e8th look at how hes grown as a player not only from a production standpoint but the ability to stay on the floor the answer from Terence Edwards Hes been the guy for the cards all evening long and Pat Kelce will not let up in any way shape or form expect they run from the Cars before we go Music Terence Edwards by the way with 27 malow watch attacking that glass com malawat going for the block shot but when he doesnt get it he doesnt give up on the play doesnt take himself out of the action right back in for the defensive rebound to clean up that opportunity for the Blue Devils and malawat with eight points 10 rebounds two blocks to this point working on another double double hes a rim protector and I think you got to be a defensive team that really plays tough defense to win Im going to give you my five five best defensive teams that are always going to be being games number one you got to think about dke you got to think about Houston Kelvin Samson Who belongs in the Hall of Fame Tennessee with the win today over certainly an Auburn team thats explosive and what about I I think about certainly St Johns Rick patino and Michigan State with Tom Isel despite losing today to our good Wisconsin team by the way Madison Square Garden New York New York baby Frank Sala sings that beautiful and a bon stood there with the big trophy Mr patino I voted for him Coach of the Year what hes done with SS inbounded for gunba so malow watch to the Bench gungas been having a really good tournament and that continu thats his game Dicky V we were at the city of Palms last year Watching Cooper flag they ended up beating Paul the 6 in the championship game but Paul the six did not have Patrick gumba he would have been a Difference Maker in that game had he been available Edward hot as heck hes getting better and better as well players too strong that time coach Robinson must be doing a great job with all those big guys he is doing a great job Dicky B what have you always said about freshman at this point of the Season theyre no longer freshman right right theyre Soph Wars theyre juniors and the one thing you hope and pray he wont stay and dont go to the highest bidder because Im tell you thats what its become a college its amazing GBA draws the foul and the 611 freshman off to the line you know Cory its more better free agency in college than there is in the NBA you agree in the NBA they have contracts Vicky V I know I contracts in college somethings got to slow this down a little bit I mean its out of control out of control in terms of you know transfer Port oh its a lot of chaos out there really Scott sport by the way but you know if youre going to be successful you got to buy into it she does a great job out there Rachel Baker tremendous right next to Cooper Flags mom yeah Kelly and thats one of the things that John Shire talked to us about earlier in the year you see Kelly FL up cheering they cheer for each others kids shes not here for Cooper shes here for Duke and again and her son isnt even playing but shes still cheering just as loudly for the rest of the players on the floor wanting a championship for the Blue Devils I think this is an A if I was giving GRS out you got to give Duke an A here tonight theyre beating a team that really is outstanding but Dicky that shows that the Duke Bo devils are more than Cooper flag they are an absolute great team in our opinion the best team in the country with Cooper flag but without Cooper flag they are still pretty good good enough to be 4 minutes and 5 seconds away from being ACC tournament champions champ week on ESPN the ACC Tournament champion to be crowned its presented by T Ro price invest with confidence and think about tournament MVPs the great Johnny Dawkins in 1986 for the Duke Blue Devils Christian lner he took home that trophy in 1992 the head coach John shy 2009 ACC tournament Most Valuable Player wow talk about some great great players you mention right there Johnny Dawkin that brings back memories 19 1986 Louisville Louisville and Duke for the national title I believe it was in Dallas and a guy been the name of never nervous perver Ellison dominated but on that team also was our own Jay billis he was a m i Adam as my all like blue collar guy Scott takes a bump and makes it hell be going to line hes not blue color anymore that was a ptb a broadcasting Prime Time performer but he was on that great that was the first great team of Coach K and from that moment on it was lights out is what Coach K did I will say that I love John Wooden I love John Wooden I received the John Wooden award and Ill tell you this unbelievable I will tell you Coach K is the greatest coach Ive ever seen in college B and thats why I think what John Shire has been able to do following in those footsteps with this program is incredible it is incredible because most guys that follow a legend after a year or two are gone and this guy is setting his own unbelievable numbers GIS the long one rebound tipped and controlled by the Cardinals this game far from over right now the Cardinals trying to find a way to get inside that painted area Duke doing a great job shutting it off but this is one of the guys that really hasnt been able to get going Waterman who knocked down a three earlier but injuring that hip had to go out early in the game hasnt had the same type of effect that weve seen from him in the first two games in the Music Applause tournament shot clock to six kiple catches fires rebound comes out high for heurn Edwards wants to push it cant connect he hasnt Miss many tonight you know what I love about Malo Mala watch makes sure he dont gets rebounds in his area he goes laterally he goes laterally left and right and Duke Brown loves what they see here tonight Duke taking their time up 6857 seon James hes an excellent floor leader boy SE gra Gillis with a three right in front of the horn and did not get it off in time that is a shot clock violation 56 left Dicky V at this point now and still enough time to before the cars to be able to come back but if youre voting for a tournament MVP we know if Louisville wins were going with Terence Edward however if its the Blue Devils whos your guy well my gu is now do we look for the game or were looking for the whole tournament we got to go tournament yeah if you go tournament its going to be up its going to be up I can tell you right now I honestly believe that K malat will get some Vats I believe he has been special you talking about a young man who has not only done the job offensively but defended the rim and I Im agree that kiple most likely will be the winner but I would expect for malawat to get some votes for tournament MVP he has been spectacular in all three games probably the most consistent player for the blue Dev 10 rebounds tonight he deserves I tell you some votes because he 14 and nine for two games bottom line is though you got to think about the 28 that kipo had when he needed him against Geor Tech came back with 17 against Carolina I I I would go withle proor reaching in for a foul took of the game I would go with certainly just uh proor Proctors third personal there thats great pointed by kiple with the 28 in the first game the game they lost Cooper flag he only played a little less than a half and has not been able to play again in the tournament theyve needed a leader tonight that guy has really been proctored but in that game also kiple didnt just score 28 he also had eight assists in one turnover thats right and I agree oh Harley I believe he will be the AC tournament MVP but when you think about this really was a team effort from the Blue Devil absolutely when you consider what malawat did what Patrick gunga did did coming off the bench you think about seon James and Tyrese Proctor especially in the second half of this game and a timeout Duke was in danger of not getting it across mid Court in time 105 left in the championship game L Blue Devils trying to win both the regular season and the tournament titles for the first time since 2006 taking on one of the really hot teams in all the country and the Louisville Cardinals and weve got a minute five remaining Dave OBrien alongside Dicky V and Cory Alexander and Angel gray and your gal is coming up yeah it really is and one of the honores is former Duke Superstar Grant Hill whos going to be the commencement speaker at the graduation this year where my twin grandsons play tennis on a team thats top 10 in the country at Duke and hes going graduate and Im going to be there for graduation see as to H delivered that speech Ill also see him delivered it at my Galla I tell we raised 989 million thus far and we hope to go over a 100 million Mike stran who Daughter by the way is that dude his daughter at Southern Cal had brain surgery now hoping shes coming into Galla she love it with her dad and also Dan early unbelievable it its something Im so proud of probably of all of these that of my life is raising money for kids battling cancer because after what I went through and what Im still going through with scams and blood work and all no kid should go through now Im 85 years old those kids come on give me a break I still got energy though you do yeah youre amazing new 10 seconds for the Blue Devils after calling the timeout smart call by John Shire calling the timeout with 1 second remaining before there was a 10second violation to get the Blue Devils or time to get the basketball into the front Court James Scott has foued out for the Cardinals the big sophomore out of fville North Carolina this is only the beginning for B Kelce and Louisville the future is going to be so bright there hes is the winner hes got that unbelievable way about him that convinces players the follow suit to be part of the team unreal a Louisville 100 seasons of basketball over 100 wins eight final fours three national championships 25 NBA first round picks but they disappeared off the scene for a couple of years they are back theres no question and you know what both these teams since December are 47 and two 47 and two thats amazing at burn now with 14 but hes had a rough night 52 seconds to go Duke try to inbound up by 10 in for Proctor and Proctor takes a slap and he is headed to the other end to shoot a key in this game has been the really outstanding job defensively the guards have done to neutralize Chucky heurn they have not allowed him to penetrate create innovate and beat Chucky heern whos been terrific all year in the ACC and Chucky heurn also only has one steal in this game the accs defensive player the year really been neutralized and part of what he does is take the basketball away and get the Cardinals out in transition but this game eily similar to the first game between these two where the Cs were able to take a lead in the halftime but the Blue Devils turned it on in the second half in game one it was Cooper flag and Malik Brown who carried them in this one theyve gotten solid contributions from a number of different guys as tyres Proctor makes the first free throw of the game hes one of five from the free throw line OB even though hes knocked down six threepoint field goals final 40 seconds here the championship game I also want to thank both you guys the way youve accepted me coming here and joining you its been a great thrill for me I I get emotional I probably be emotional you know tomorrow this weekend when its my last game this year and Im praying hope I can be back next year year and maybe even better and hope and pray my doctor really helps me with my voice I think you sounded terrific tonight thank you I appreciate it I its a work I I have to listen to my doctor right now he told me voice rest voice wrest right after this uh game for a week and I just uh you know I I I want to thank all the fans too and all the

positive always and have faith and believe and if youre out theres a person that knows somebody with Kansas send them a text message send them a a a a phone call or make a phone call the bottom line

family left and I broke up crying like crazy and a nurse came in and she cheered me up and then I went to my phone and on my phone were messages from all over the country from Rick barns Tom ISO calip Perry coaches hey who sent you a a message in the first half tonight was that LeBron James mom its what its selling it there thats Miss Gloria was that Gloria legitimate number shot wont go down for Edwards although hes had a big night in a great tournament the dicky be let me tell you before we get off air wed love to have you back and if I can speak for my guy Dave OBrien we think you belong right here with us yes and so absolutely we would love to have you back please go have a great summer rehab and getting better and lets do it again next year I appreciate that for really 71 62 Duke with 137 to go putting to finishing touches on a championship here in Charlotte I think one thing as you look at back kelse its going to get better and better at Louisville but John Shys got to be very proud of the effort hes witnessed here with the Carolina game Georgia Tech game and tonight playing without Cooper playing without Malik Brown I mean were talking about not an average player were talking about the most versatile and dominant player in the country in pooper my favorite Blue Devil checking in right now this is my guy hes coming in for Khan kiple Spencer Hubbert the smallest guy with the biggest number about to check in the game and thats the sign that the game is over that its in the books for do he a big hug from kipo of 55 wow hes got memories for his kids 20 years from now I played in that championship team man I was a final part of it I practice every day goodle with 18 by the way Edwards with an airball there not indicative of the game he has had but kiple comes up big again 28 in their first game then 17 now 18 tonight and its the first time since leading in half right they got beat in the second half to beat up with 5 minutes to go so Duke Green Supreme in the ACC regular season and tournament champions for the first time since 2006 as that handshake lied yesterday player shoves a guy I say a handshake should before the game before the game both these teams showing tremendous respect for each other they battled hard on the floor however
