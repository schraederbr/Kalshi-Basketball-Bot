18 points a game Hes out for the season for the Huskies And were off to the races A light crowd here for Syracuse standards given that these students are on winter holiday break And that is an offensive foul to cheering start things off in a turnover by the Orange Illegal screen number So Nor Eastern nearly lost their entire starting lineup from last year to the transfer portal Well keep an eye on Xander Allerie the red shirt freshman who was averaging 97 rebounds a game but only played five minutes in the win against Central Connecticut the other day So hell hes in the starting lineup looking for a bounce back after suffering an injury in that game Offensive rebound for the Huskies Ryan Williams getting his first start of his season turnover AJ my fault You get an offensive rebound Its you know neither of these teams have been great on the glass this year Nor Eastern you know not this offensive rebounding power but you got an open three and those are the threes Nor Easterns going to have to hit today You want to pull this up said youve got to hit open stand still threes Both these teams negative in the rebounding margin average this season JJ Stling Nate Kings the sharp shooter Theres the freshman Sadique White in the starting lineup And there is JJ Stling the senior from nearby Baldwinville New York Syracuse likes to apply apply pressure Theyll pick up full court if they need to In terms of size advantage and mismatch positionally in this game theyve got a few of them as Allerie misses the bunny and Syracuse switching one through five you know in part because theres a lot of like parts for Nor Eastern out there I dont think Syracuse feels like they can get burned and its a much better way of taking away that threepoint line Its just switching everything You saw on the other end Xander Allerie the move he made you know red shirted last year at Miami you know sat out the entire year their leading rebounder leading shot blocker leads him in free throw attempts just had a really good season thus far extra pass to Nate Kings a deep wing three offensive rebound Zadique White and a battle with Allerie down low a couple of blocks by Xander and the outlet to Ryan Williams the lefty layin for the sophomore That cant happen in terms of your defensive balance Im not sure what Nate George was doing allowing Williams to get behind him and a really nice pitch ahead by Allerie First start of the season for Williams averaging just five minutes per game and one point per game So with that bucket already doubling up his season average I think Bill Cohen looking for defense you know this team theyre going to move the ball be real patient offensively Its defense where I think hes still searching with their lineups Young team eight underassman on the roster including five true freshman and Xander Allerie whos a red shirt freshman knocks down the triple You know thats where he and Yuri Fritz are pick and pop bigs You know theyll set a lot of screens and pop off of that Allerie that makes him three of 13 on the year So hasnt shot it well but he was a great threepoint shooter in high school As a team Nor Eastern shoots just 31 from three cheering 10 on the shot clock for Nathan George A three cheering in response by JJ Stling He can run hot and cold You know we saw the start that he has had You know he had against HRA 12 points in the first six minutes only three points in the remaining 34 Was great in the second half against Tennessee They just need more consistency from him Stings had 10 or more points in eight straight games this year for the Orange Air ball on a step back goes out of bounds Syracuse coming off a win against Mercyhurst the other day You know its really been balanced scoring on the offensive end You mentioned kind of hot and cold Thats seemingly how everybodys been on Syracuse offensively but theyve had in their last two games five players in each of those games with 10 or more points Its a hard game when you cant make threes and you cant make free throws You know theres a lot of teams that cant shoot but when they get downhill and get fouled theyre making foul shots Its just been the margin for error for Syracuse overall has been really small this year And thats where that defense has to be able to increase that margin for them Were on the shot clock Offensive rebound and a foul Yuri Fritz has a couple of offensive rebounds here in the early going And Nor Eastern said Hey I saw our counterpart part of the CIA Guy right there William Kyle whos been spectacular on both ends for them Their most productive and best player The problem is you know they have a very small margin for error They are as bad a free throw cheering shooting team the worst in the country And its hurt them in games I mean they they missed 17 free throws against Houston They lost that game by four in overtime Would have been a massive win for this program They dont rebound consistently There have been games where theyve turned it over 19 turnovers against Iowa State And so how do you make up for that margin for error especially on the offensive end is its got to start with their ball pressure and their ability to make teams play on their terms with their defense Step back baseline jumper for JJ Stanley Hes feeling it here early Five points his second field goal of the game Well coach Autry talked to us about it before the game This this idea of this level five intensity He talked about ball pressure You know something that he talked about is we got to be able to withstand the dips and and play with intensity as much as he possibly can because of that small margin for error as continue Northeastern gets some more offensive rebounds An undized Huskies team just out hustling Syracuse to the basketball as Williams hits the teardrop Thats a microcosm of what Im talking about Like this game cannot start Were in the first six minutes of this game and this outsized outleted Northeastern team is out working Syracuse Fresh bases on the floor Sorry Chris Coming in for Syracuse including Ken Anthony dad Carmelo courtside to watch his son play today Heres Melo Some words of encouragement advice for Cayenne whos been averaging 11 points off the bench freshman Tyler Betsy also coming into the game as well as Ibrahim Suare Heres Anthony Long two is good You know I Ill be interested to see as this year moves forward if he doesnt end up in the starting lineup You have got to have him on the floor Like he plays with supreme confidence massive swagger and hes really a talented scorer Ranked number 36 on the ESPN SC Next 100 Thats a long twopointer in the corner for Xander Orie who despite only playing five minutes in the teams previous game against Central Connecticut doesnt look rusty at all Kings backing his way in on the baseline Its going to stay on this side of the floor A foul against the Huskies Huskies Second team foul on Northeastern So baseline inbound for Anthony Under 14 minutes to play here in half number one Show a zone And this you know zone in the second half from Hopstrod Syracuse Straightaway three JJ Starling too much Youd love to see you get inside that zone They show zone for the first time You love to see to get the ball in the middle of that zone Good double clutch by Yuri Fritz Well that baseline drive has been good for Nor Eastern to start this game Baseline drive and then you draw the help and that big playing on the opposite block has been open Good shot fake by Fritz Point lead for Nor Eastern nearly seven minutes into this game applause and cheering One of the things too Chris with this Syracuse team is just you know when they get down they have some pretty blaring deficiencies on the offensive end So mounting any type of big comeback you know they really got to put forth a lot of effort and hope somebody catches fire on the offensive side of things or start it with your defense I mean again I think if if you are thinking that this team or anybody not just you Eric thats okay You can save me Youre the right guy If youre thinking that this is going to be a 40 threepoint shooter youre youre crazy And the free throw shooting is only going to get so much better If this team doesnt embrace effortbased things it starts with their defense Its going to be a long year It It just is 308th in the country in threepoint shooting percentage 281st in scoring offense and 361st in free throw shooting Anthony a reachin foul And and look there there are guys on this roster who have shot better I mean you know Nate Kings shot 44 from three last year Hes only at 29 You know JJ Starling you know what does he continue to do Again theyre playing without Donnie Freeman There are things that will make this look better but in terms of winning games consistently this team can be very good defensively and has shown it They just got to embrace it Houston sitting in that zone 10 on the shot clock for the Orange Kings Swarm Extra pass in the corner Two to shoot Starling for three The outlet up ahead Abru with the twohand slam cheering Largest lead of the game 50 from the floor in the half and a fivepoint lead here on the road Syracuse scoreless the last two minutes and change right now All the pressure is coming from Nor Eastern JB Frankle gets in the passing lane You know one of the things too Chris is you have an underdog team like Nor Eastern coming into a place where their school has been playing against Syracuse a long time This is the 10th meeting The Orange is 9 and0 but you get a little bit of confidence early on in a game like this as George cheering one up and one I dont know if he really thought that one had a chance of going in or not but hell take two and go to the line looking for another Hey take it out This is a guy who you know a lot a lot has been talked about his production being down Led the ACC in assists last year I I think a lot of it with him is settling in You know hes not this jet of a guard Nate George Like he hes he has a hard time at times creating separation but I think one of the things Red Autry is trying to trying to impress upon him is to be more aggressive you know and tough shot as you mentioned Eric there But this is a guy I think his numbers will continue to go up as he gets more comfortable But hes got to be willing to make an impact with his defense And I think thats again what Red Autry is trying to to preach to him put up those numbers last year while at Georgia Tech You see the offensive numbers for Nor Eastern They made their last four but throw it away there as Xavier Brew threw it into traffic J Starling lobbing it too high for Sadique White Jr the freshman from Charlotte North Carolina Another stud freshman off the bench for Red Autry Contact at the rim as Mike Loch name was looking for a foul Instead itll be out of bounds Nor Eastern basketball This is where again a lot of spot up shooters for Nor Eastern Nate George has got to stay in front of the basketball like hes just kind of reaching behind and you allow a team of spot up shooters to drive your paint Syracuse seems to have come out of that timeout with a little bit more focus on the defensive end Francis in the corner Now its Syracuse who looks to move in transition Nathan George stops on a dime Great pivot inside and a foul as William Kyle was going up with it Nice job by George getting in the paint creating offense And this is the challenge with William Kyle Hes been so good in the paint and at the rim but every team is going to do that When William Kyle catches it in front of the rim because of how poorly he is shooting it from the foul line they are going to have a hacky rule 49 free throw shooter on the season for the player who came over from UCLA Was with the Bruins for a year Prior to that was with South Dakota State for a couple years Went to the NCAA tournament with that team and his defensive numbers He is second in the nation in blocks per game third in total blocks and unusual for him but he makes both of his free throws And that has been the only weak point to to your point the only weak part of his game has been the foul line Outside of that he has been outstanding for Syracuse Hes the Jim Furick of free throw shooters with that awkward looking shot but both of them go down The head fake Ty Francis is his feet just slipped He really had a good head fake Had his man beat Well and you see the emphasis of the shot fake because they know William Kyle is coming over The the former high jumper Kyle almost leapt through the ceiling on that one If you even get get to the paint if you even look at the rim Kyle is coming over to block your shot cheering 44 in vertical and a 7 foot three wingspan is William Kyle Belleview Nebraska Another hand check foul Its happened a couple times with Ken Anthony when he goes to drive into the lane 16 foul on Nor Eastern So the next one will put Syracuse in the bonus The Orange just two team fouls The personal on Ryan Williams lob Kyle jumps over for the double team Now the triple team and cheering still beats it Nice job coming down with it Possession is 910en of the law And now Kyle the steal Orange on the move And its a little too cute with the pass It was behind the inside hip of Sadique White Turnover out of bounds cheering Heres Miles Newton We didnt know if Miles was going to play Number 10 for Nor Eastern Hes missed the last two games Coach Cohen told us earlier today he was really only going to play in an emergency situation And here he is down two Under 10 minutes to go in the first half and hes thrust into the basketball game Back and forth with the turnovers And were looking ahead at our final womens basketball double header of 2025 on the ACC network Comes on Monday the 29th as Hannah Hidalgo and number 20 Notre Dame host Pit in Southbend Thats at 6 Eastern Then India Navar leads number 18 North Carolinas balanced attack against BC Both of those games available on the ESPN app Lob to Kyle Easy to do with the 44 in vertical show with Nate George and hell go to the free throw line Well and and Nor Eastern is really shrinking the floor So its going to be hard to go oneonone cuz Nor Easterns done a nice job keeping the ball in front and then hes got a ton of help because again Nor Eastern wants Syracuse to prove they can they can make a three that they can beat them over the top nice job you know with the shot fake and getting himself to the foul line George a native of Toronto off a 124 assist game against Mercyhurst but he did have six turnovers in that game Coach Autum telling us you know part of its just still you know hes new to the team Hes learning these guys Hes a pass first point guard and its just time that he needs to gel and figure out where everybodys going to be on the court I think youre looking for more consistency from your older players your seniors and juniors your JJ Stars your Nate Georgees like Sadique White and Kayen Anthony Theyre going to go up and down But youve got to know who your juniors and seniors are every time you come out to play a game N0 run for the Cuse NEWTON cheering ANGLING INSIDE TOUGH screaming SHOT FROM Miles Newton off the glass and in Really tough right into the body of Suare And how about the job Nor Eastern has done getting into the paint and attacking the rim off of the dribble 10 points in the paint for Nor Eastern Just Syracuse four Anthony changes cheering that switched hands midair Finished with the right Hes a really crafty finisher Wonder where he learned that from You watching you going up Heres Tyler Betsy in the corner Knocks down the triple His first bucket of the game cheering Thats what he does He runs right to that corner Well 68 225 but hes a catch and shoot threepoint shooter Spot minutes last year at Cincinnati He was a really good high high school player in the state of Connecticut As one of the highest recruits West Miller ever got at the University of Cincinnati didnt play too much Number 62 on the ESPN SC Next 100 Nice look opposite here by George And this is what Betsy does He he is a run to the corner and wait for the ball so you can shoot threes Its a 142 run for Syracuse Theyre on top by seven under eight minutes to go Lockman missed everything And Chris the timeout Red Audrey took with 12 and 12 minutes to go has really changed the intensity for Syracuse The Orange saying happy holidays with a 2316 lead on a 142 run Yeah theyve they have forced turnovers Theyve done a better job on the defensive glass Syracuse still trailing by two in the rebounding margin Just tell the focus and intensity on the defensive end really changed after that timeout Anthony will go back to the free throw line He has drawn contact every time he has driven into the lane today Well hes going to stay aggressive And again he hes really talented offensively There are things you know his feel that some of these other guys you just dont see it And look hes got a you know I think part of the reason hes not in the lineup right now is is or in the starting lineup that is is defensively you know hes got to commit on that end hes not quite there yet But on a team that at times can search for that guy and I love at the end of that Hopster game where he he certainly got fouled I love that he was the guy with the ball in his hands you know trying to make a play Its kind of the guy he is and you need that alpha Every offense needs that alpha And with Donnie Freeman not in the lineup he kind of is that guy when hes on the floor A small Christmas miracle for the worst free throw shooting team in the country Syracuse seven for seven from the strike today Yuri Fritz cut off puts it on the deck and a good move to get around Suare And hes lefthanded so he had to come back to that right hand after he went middle left Suare called for the offensive foul Well send it back to Nor Eastern after Fritz picked up his fifth point of the game That front line for Nor Eastern Yuri Fritz and Xander Allery have done a really nice job this year Yeah those legs get outside that shoulder width thats going to become a block and it has been a point of emphasis this year for officials Eric Lewis Jeffrey Clark Trey Stions your three referees today block pain dumps it off to Kelch and hell go to the free throw line These bigs are also really good passers You know just talking about about Fritz and Allerie Fritz at the top of the key there You know again its a team playing without it its best player Its leading scorer Bill Cohen had built this team around the presence of LA Pratt Just a really dynamic offensive player You lose him for the year And you kind of have to reinvent And so theyve had a lot of different starting lineups Theyve had some injury issues outside of Pratt that theyve had to deal with Cohen in his 20th season There you see Pratt in the boot Kelch missed both of his free throws Anthony spinning underneath Nice touch off the rim and in Its his footwork You know the patience the poise and the footwork when he gets into that paint playing off of two feet using the pivot Eight points for Ken Anthony lead all scorers Xavier Abru hesitation into the lane Turn around Teard drop Good Youd love to see Betsy expand his game a little bit You know wasnt the flashiest move in the paint but he gets himself there and is able to you know get a twopoint basket Xavier Abru just blows right by Ken Anthony Theres the defense you talked about maybe keeping him out of the starting lineup The ability of Nor Eastern again off of the dribble to get to the rim And now Syracuse really attacking the paint as Nathan George gets a bucket this time Syracuse 31 Eastern 11point advantage under five and a half minutes to play in the opening half Syracuse has made their last seven field cheering goals cheering Syracuse and their coach Red Autry not happy about that whistle late in the shot clock Nate Kings picks up his first personal as William Kyle and JJ Starling check back in as well as Sadique White Jr for the Huskies Jun I like Sadiqu Jr Chris freshman 12 or more points in four of his last five games Seems to be really maturing A nice scoring option off the bench for Syracuse A Bru just seems like hes trying to do too much right now Abru is taking it all by himself Not a whole lot of ball movement but Kelch fighting for it on the offensive glass Yuri Fritz and one Yeah I mean Im a Bruise penetration starts that like Im fine if you if youre able to get to the front of the rim you know its hard to finish against size and athleticism but another second opportunity for Nor Eastern And theres the cerebral game of Fritz When you have two bigs like Fritz and Allerie with how cerebral and skilled both of those guys are makes this offense look a lot better Seven offensive rebounds for Nor Eastern And now six second chance points after that free throw move by Yuri Fritz Cuts the lead down to eight White lost it Syracuse really making it a point to get paint touches that White just lost it off of his fingertips Back to Fritz with the lefthanded finish Sharing the ball guys moving off ball movement Its kind of where Nor Eastern has lived this year Ritz has 10 points now Nor Eastern 10 points off Syracuse turnovers Fritz one of those guys last year a role player transferred in last year from Kenishhious was a role player for Bill Cohen last season at Nor Eastern has had to you know has jumped up that scouting report You know he and Allerie John Beline used to call them joystickers guys at the top of the paint your bigs who are able to create offense one and those two guys get closer to the basket and theyre both lefty You know theres just something about playing a lefthanded player Its a little bit different especially if theyre bigs Theres Allerie on the bench there Yuri Fritz from the Netherlands represents one of seven countries on this internationally or oriented Northeastern roster Syracuse 33n 3325 after a pair of free throws for JJ Stling And now Syracuse nine for nine from free throw line today Again the worst statistically free throw shooting team in the country It looked like it so far Five on the shot clock Aw King got a hand on it Kings got a hand on it rather A shot clock violation Syracuse has made their last seven from the floor And theyre also getting it done at the free throw line And theyre on top 3325 at Syracuse And really cool to see them interacting with those kids Rothman Chris Pollah here with you 330 to go in half number one The JMA wireless dome Starland had his shot blocked by Allerie Second chance opportunity Pops out And another timeout that Bill Cohens come out in a zone And Syracuse twice does a nice job getting to the middle of that zone Just cant finish George could not believe that it popped out Ally the fade away Arling inside Sadique White cheering and offensive foul before the shot Theyre going to say use the off hand to hook the defender He did and he got caught too too far under the basket Now at some point you got to stop running and the pass wasnt great either Kind of led him to the baseline but theres that hook Good call by the ref Second foul on Sadique White Jr as Pike Loch Nate muscles it up He and a Bru Its Its really been Lochnane and Abru who have just attacked the rim off the dribble And Nor Eastern who has really been mantoman all year This is more zone than I think they played the entire year in this first half George floater over that zone defense It counts and hell get a chance for one more And theyre getting quality shots Syracuse against that zone I mean theyre just getting right into the middle off of the dribble Nice job here by George A little float game here on the holidays with the roll Syracuse We talked about it Free throws Ellie average making 12 and a half per game this year They are nine for nine here today Get ready for the broadcaster Jinx Chris No How about that For once See shouldnt we get credit If we dont get the If we talk about free throws and they make it we should get credit If were going to get credit for the broadcaster jinx of them missing the free throw I think we should get credit when they make it Yeah I think the broadcaster jinx is an egodriven thing To think for playbyplays laughter to think that they have an impact on a made free throw or not is typical typical narcissism That is just you know that really hurts That really hurts Turnover Sadique White picks it up Under two minutes to go Dribble for William Kyle and hes tied up on Lock Nate But the free throw shooting thing is for real I mean we weve got our ourselves a headline with how well theyve shot it in this first half You know again they have lost games at the foul line You go back to that Hopster game They missed seven free throws and they lost that game by one Houston game they missed 17 free throws They lose by four in overtime I mean thats just two games right there Its Look you win and lose games at the foul line And its its been a real crutch And and the thing is for a coach you know theres not much you can do Theyre certainly spending the time Weve seen them at practice I mean theyre putting the time in Its hard to believe that as William Kyle and I know he came to the game late its hard to believe coaches have allowed him to continue to shoot free throws with that form Well hes three for four today after splitting the pair there Syracuse 11 for 12 and a 10point advantage A Bru for three Offensive rebound again as Owie was fighting for it and he tapped it to Yuri Fritz Fritz working baseline and William Kyle just not allowing him any room to to move The lob Kyle the third from the heavens losing every inch to that 40 44 inch vertical 6 run for Syracuse as theyve made nine of their last 11 from the floor Lochman had to go high over Tyler Betsys outstretched arm Midrange jumper Good Syracuse looks a little confused coming out of the timeout with that baseline out of bounds Fullourt pressure by Nor Eastern Well Bill Cohen out of timeouts changing up the defensive looks each time Syracuse cannot hold for the final shot necessarily but they can get it close Heres George driving and hell go to the free throw line Hes done a nice job Nate George in this first half being aggressive putting the ball on the floor attacking the basket One of the things right Autry told you and I before the game you know just try to get Nate hes a table setter You know hes really an unselfish point guard Wants to get distribute get the ball to other guys but you can use his ability to put the ball in the basket Came over from Georgia Tech See his numbers from last year 12 points six and a half assists per game Points per game down this year but still producing the assists Williams Just under 7 seconds to go in the half after the free throw from George 11 points for George in this first half Go along with a trio of assist Press break for Nor Eastern 3 seconds to go in the half Lock name midrange Its good Mike Loch name Great half for him and it cuts the Northeastern deficit down to 10 Rebounds getting second chance opportunities but havent necessarily converted as much as Im sure as coach Cohen would like No they have nine offensive rebounds to your point which you know cannot happen if youre Syracuse And Syracuse has to defensively do a much better job of guarding the basketball You have to guard your matchup and keep the ball out of the paint This should not be a Nor Eastern team that should be able to get into your paint off of the bounce Oh stripped away as Allerie was trying to go baseline You talked about that timeout that coaching took 12 and a half minutes left to go in the half Since then Syracuse 3217 run and a lot of that thanks to their increased defensive intensity They kings the triple drive and the ability to make free throws You made that point I dont think we can underline that enough You know they they were it was a 10point game at the half They were plus 11 at the foul line That was the difference Good defensive energy in the first couple possessions here for Syracuse out of the break Audrey telling us he wants his team playing at a level five but they give up another offensive rebound as a tip in for Xander Allerie That is the 10th offensive rebound for Nor Eastern Just inside position Nice job by Allerie being alert to the shot and just being there for the tip right in front of the basket Seven points for Allery Rob Sadique White had to fight over a double team to get it Too strong Knocked out of bounds It will stay with Syracuse Syracuse seven and four on the season as Nate Kings who transfer over from Oregon State misses and his teammate Nathan George there on the offensive glass Own defense from Nor Eastern Kings will try again The southpaw misses short Kings now 0 for three from deep I got your sink Will fouled as he goes up and hits the deck hard Sadique White Jr called for the personal foul Again really good ball movement Nice job pursuing the basket without the ball moving without it by Allerie you know red shirted last year at Miami and it you know spent the year really getting bigger and tougher and more physical I think practicing every day against that level of athlete was really good for him Had a great high school career cheering His dad a former first round NBA pick out of Duke There his dad Mark played with our colleague Jay Bilis for cheering being drafted in the 1986 NBA draft So their sister Mark is Xanders sister I should say Bella cheering a good basketball player of her own right played at Princeton and was drafted fifth overall in 2020 to the Dallas Wings of the WNBA Mark a great player obviously in his time at Duke should probably have his number retired He was that good in his four years at Duke Career cheering cut short due to injury in his professional time Similar to his daughter Bella who ended up retiring in 2023 Xander playing hard carrying on the Howie basketball legacy JJ Stling has nine points now to increase the Syracuse lead back up to 10 Five on the shot clock Inside to Fritz Blocked William Kyle III sends it out of bounds Two on the shot clock Kyles been uncanny at this Averaging over three blocks a game His ability to block shots and alter shots has been a difference maker in this second half of their defense Shot clock violation Thats the first block for Kyle today But his last four games Chris hes averaging five blocks Its uncanny It Its one of the things I did not expect out of him I mean I know UCLA was deep last year up front I dont know what Mick Cronin was looking at I I dont understand how William Kyle only played nine minutes a game there as he gets the offensive rebound here Great finish for William Kyle And thats where their defense like you can feel comfortable pressuring the basketball because if you do get beat you know on that second level youve got William Kyle behind you and his ability to block shots Three in the ACC offensive rebound for game Offensive rebound off the lock name Miss three Now its Allerie in the corner He hits What a job by Allerie I mean hes the guy who tipped that out to keep the possession alive And then he fills the corner opposite Nice baseline skip What a job by these two bigs Fritz and Allerie for Nor Eastern 11 second chance points now for Nor Eastern as Syracuse looking for some second chance points of their own after JJ Stling got his own miss Sadique White Jr out there with his three fouls lowering the shoulder Kings the offensive rebound and its going to stay on this side of the floor with a foul on the loose ball against William Kermorti Heres just an effort play This is his last play by Xander Allerie Watch him come from the opposite side Tips it out Keeps it alive and then he fills the corner and is ready to shoot Great skip there Baseline skip by Loch Nane and Allerie buries him And Sadique White Jr is lucky he didnt get called for his fourth foul He had a fistful of Xander Alleries jersey on that rebound Pass interference in football thats for sure Betsy up top Side steps the defense now inside Might have gotten tipped by Allerie Back to Betsy Spinning looking for help Instead hell go to the free throw line Number seven Yuri his first again I think Tyler Betts hes going to be guarded as a as a catch and shoot guy and so hes going to have the opportunity to put it on the floor Pivoted three times realized he wasnt guarded and then decided to attack the rim Player of the year in high school out of the state of Connecticut had offers from Alabama Duke Yukon among others and decided to go to the University of Cincinnati Highly touted recruit for West Miller and the Bearcats just really didnt get much action last year and decided to make the transfer to Red Autry Syracuse Orange team Williams nearly colliding with his cheering teammate Lockman avoids the friendly fire and hell go to the line to try to finish off a threepoint play and a really nice job attacking the pressure youre able to beat it and then on the back end of it just attacking the rim and like you said you almost had a collateral damage little friendly fire combined today offense seven offensive rebounds I should say 22 and 10 overall and they have dominated this front line of Syracuse and Nor Eastern a team that only averages nine offensive rebounds a game on the year they have 13 offensive rebounds today Syracuse 11 of their own on the offensive glass as Ryan Williams hits the free throw Just his third start of his career Seven points Nate George cant finish Knocked around Betsy got it Tyler Betsy touch Youve got to grab that You cant tip to Oh and Syracuse just lazy getting back on the defensive transition And Yuri Fritz taking advantage Thats happened a few times tonight Nate Kings missed his last four from threepoint range Hits that one to put Syracuse up by 10 Hes the one guy even with how poorly he has shot it in the game and on the year Youve got to find him 44 threepoint shooter last year at Oregon State Met rudely by the front line of Syracuse Now some transition opportunity for Syracuse Nate Kings five points in a row And he did it in some big time games as well When Oregon State knocked off a top 20 team in Gonzaga last year he had 20 points cheering How about the shot clock Abru tough shot Tried to go up and under the rim Kyle calling for it as he posts up Howie draws the contact with 1404 to play in regulation Hakaya Nice job You know oneonone coverage Able to crab dribble crab dribble get himself deep And thats where teams are going to lay on that foul He gets it that deep theyre going to make him earn it from the line Great story written in in Syracusecom earlier this year about William Kyle and they mentioned his high jumping prowess He participated in a high jumping or track meet at 10 years a really good job and a one of the coaches came up to his dad and said oh you going dads going to nationals like what are you talking about and he goes your son is like top 20 in the country in what he just did and theyre like oh okay so they looked into it they ended up going to nationals he did pretty darn well continued his track career in high school before during the co years switching over to basketball The job hes done from the foul line today making Northeastern pay five for six for a guy who shoots 49 on the season cheering Now itll be Alleries turn at the free throw line Nor Easterns done a nice job adapting without LA Pratt you know their leading scorer best player dynamic with the ball in his hands Theyve had to reinvent and its been a lot of offball movement And when you have these two bigs Allerie there at the foul line and Yuri Fritz who have such a good field are such cerebral players and you can move them all over the floor I mean were watching them today during their shoot around I said to Bill Co I said You got these bigs moving all over the place Theres LA Pratt right there Both these teams without their leading scorers Pratt for the entire season Donnie Freeman for Syracuse Hell be returning At least they expect him to return in the Clemson game on New Years Eve Anthony wants a high post screen He gets it Suare a late whistle as Kai and Anthony will go to the free throw line Foul number one Xavier Xavier Abru Theres Donnie Freeman 17 points per game Has not played since November the third And its not just the 17 a game he gets for himself Its the attention he draws that gets stuff for others You know we call that gravity You hear that word a lot now in the in the game of basketball offensively players who have gravity to them They force the defense They attract defensive attention Thats what Donnie Freeman does Offensive rebound after the missed free throw by Anthony Trying to force a pick and roll Instead finds the cutter on the baseline Nate Kings missed it Got his own rebound Puts it up and in Nice cut along the baseline kind of bailing out Cayenne Anthony Syracuse has made four of the last five Its a 101 run Theyre up by 15 Williams pull up in the paint How about Ryan Williams First start of the season just the third of his career and hes got nine points Without William Kyle at the basket too in the game you just dont have the rim protection Like thats not what Suare does And so when Kyles out of the game Nor Eastern gets the ball to that point in the paint and they have just been able to finish 28 points in the paint for Nor Eastern Thats the one thing you know were used to Syracuse having some interior depth They just dont have that this year It is a steep drop off after William Kyle You know Suare gives him minutes Only a registered sophomore but its not with the same impact Rebound free throw rolls off the rim Tyler Betsy on the offensive rebound Syracuse fighting for it Five on the perimeter for the Orange Well let Anthony go to work Gets straight away Syracuse is three for 11 from threepoint range Its not their strong suit to begin with Yuri Fritz we have seen that move that little hip hesitation into the lefthanded figure roll Nathan George off the glass and in 14 points for him to match Yuri Fritz whos got 14 on the other end JB Frankle for three One and done possession for Nor Eastern Anthony had it stripped cheering Anthony drawing a lot of whistles in this game which has made him more and more confident going into the lane at the pace he wants Bill Cohen cant believe that whistle came in late Syracuse on top 62 48 freshman season at his the place that Melo built if you will for this modern generation Carmelo Anthony has his name on the practice court down the road here from the JMA wireless dome So we wish coach Murphy best of luck and maybe hell be joining Mr Carmelo in the Naymith Basketball Hall of Fame next year Three on the shot clock out of the break Here is Ken Anthony Go Chris Matah here with you Central New York 14point advantage for the Orange Hey thats your Ryan Williams out there with four fouls That threepointer lipped out Betsy threw it away as Miles Newton just read that pass like a cornerback and intercepted it for the layup Its that margin for error we were talking about earlier You know you get a stop your defense does its job and you just have a careless giveaway and you give up two points Eight turnovers for Syracuse George drew a lot of contact wanted a whistle instead Nice kiss off the glass And Luca Seroa Shaller pushed from behind 142J Starling checking back in for Syracuse Its the foul on Suare his third Nor Eastern 16 fouls Syracuse four Nearing the midway point of the second half Fritz had his man beat again on the baseline This time just came up short Flying high in the air William Kyle fighting for his own offensive rebound and he was fouled going after the loose ball Its good offense by C there Kyles does a nice job playing in that pocket in on that short roll Really good pocket pass This is one of those with his ability to elevate one dribble into that body of Ryan Williams and then just pogo stick it to the rim Little soft on the take given his athleticism And another made free throw for William Kyle Extend the lead out to 15 Syracuse coming off the win against Mercy Hurst They get a couple more wins in the nonconference before the ACC conference play starts the game against Clemson on New Years Eve following that up with a road game against Georgia Tech to start the new year Ty Francis puts the threepoint glasses on in the corner triple Has not been a Nor Eastern team that shot well from three this year And it was interesting Bill Cohen saying were probably going to have to make double figure threes today which they have not done Just two for 12 from three Looking for another one though Back to back Ryan Williams making the most of the first start of his season Yeah sorry Eric Yeah this team the fighting Nor Eastern man they are not going away cheering And theyve gone deep I mean theyve got a lot of guys Northeastern that they have thrown at the wall And each guy comes in to make their impact Good pitch ahead Williams hes wet Second half down by nine It was interesting talking to coach Cohen today just about the play to the mid majors They get ransacked I mean these leagues CA Big South I mean all the these leagues get ransacked by the portal each year Dang A rude a rude interruption from William Kyle No he could interrupt all he wants You know Nor Easterns come out of timeouts in in zone a lot here today and that was the first time Syracuse prepared for it Williams floater and one Career day for Ryan Williams Oh in the starting lineup and he has made the most of his chance today And again with no William Kyle at the basket He was out guarding on the perimeter Nor Eastern has found a way to finish at the rim 14 points for a guy who was averaging five minutes per game one point per cheering game and hadnt started a game all year They get 15 Thats an eightpoint game cheering Eastern has made their last three from the floor How will Syracuse respond They go back to Kyle The lob was just off the mark He couldnt get it It would have been a goalending had he had touched it above the rim Good idea Just poor execution Fritz driving hard drawing the contact This front line of Nor Eastern Dur Fritz and Xander Allerie have had their way with Syracuses front line And if you allow Fritz to get left especially from the top of the key he is much stronger playing with his left hand cheering Fritz 14 points six of 11 shooting Its been Nor Eastern thats left a few on the table at the free throw line today Seven for 12 now 14 points for Frics and a sevenpoint advantage for Syracuse This is where where do you go if youre Syracuse Thats where not having a Donnie Freeman They just dont have that out Ken Anthony there on the offensive glass came up limping a little bit as he heads to the sideline Timeout 751 to play here in We could put it on the offense They dont have a guy a goto guy They dont have consistency there The fact of the matter is this is about effort Like Nor Eastern youre going to have to put them away And and I think theyve theyve kept some plays alive with the offensive glass They closed this differential to seven with a couple threes in transition Theres just not that you know and nobody really pulling this Syracuse team together outside of Red Auty No player pulling this team together you know to sort of exert that killer instinct Its just you know youre allowing a team to hang around here on your home floor Anthony gets his 10th point of the night at the free throw line Make it 11 Shes 20 for 26 the free throw line Oh turnover there intended for Tai Francis as Seroa Shaller threw it away Yeah I think its one of the reasons that Seroa Shaller has not played a ton today A guy whos been in their rotation heavy This is not a highrisk type of a team You know thats a play that will certainly get Syracuse You dont want to make at this point in the game Anthony looks up at the shot clock Five to shoot Driving baseline Ryan Anthony has got 13 And hes the one guy who will put it on his shoulders I mean there is a swagger to Kayen Anthony that says I got this kicked out of bounds Backto back turnovers on Nor Eastern applause and a 30 second timeout taken by the Huskies Its been a pretty choppy second half with all the whistles and timeouts Syracuse you know thats that fluidity on the offense not really there but getting some big plays down the last couple minutes from Kai and Anthony Yeah I mean again hes hes going to do his thing and its one of those guys where look Syracuse the AD here at Syracuse has been has made it very clear we are used to playing in the postseason tournament We want to be playing meaningful basketball in March I think we know what that means And so you know if youre red archery youre going to go with the guys the older guys guys that you think can be more consistent The fact of the matter is sometimes you got to go in the direction of talent And Kayen Anthony is only going to get better And when youre struggling offensively thats a dude who believes he can get it done Four players in double figures for Syracuse including Anthony Nathan George one of them 16 and another whistle on Miles Newton called for the foul 19th foul on the Huskies George to the free throw line Four second half points for George His strategy was to put Syracuse at the line as much as possible It has kind of backfired They are now 21 for 27 Its crazy with the number of games that Syracuse has lost at the foul line this year They will if they end up winning this game they will have done it because of the foul Eastern wants to push Go inside to Fritz Kick out Williams for three Transition for the Orange Kings steps on the dime for the assistant George go lock main for three He drills it What a catch by Xander Allerie in traffic Had two guys on him Great poise to find the open lock man Mike Lock name nine points His first made threepointer as Nor Eastern five of 16 from deep Anthony again drawing the contact This will be his ninth and tenth free throws upcoming Hes just really crafty you know like hes he has put his head down gotten into the paint today and hes got a knack for getting fouled Seven Here we go Look at that 58 on the season as a team for Syracuse is ranked 361st in the country and now 22 of 29 here in this one So thatll thatll boost the season percentage It sure will It only had one way to go Offensive rebound Betsy got a fingertip on it and Cayenne finishes with the left Great footwork 1777 Eastern 63 pushed in the back by Tyler Betsy Its one of the things you know Syracuse obviously such a good defensive team but you see what happens when they get out the flow on the offensive end and those tickytack fouls when youre too aggressive defensively just kind of slows that momentum down and prevents you from getting out and scoring easy buckets Yes sir Prince misses the front end of the one and one 17 foul on Syracuse Kyle puts it on the deck Flying inside Lost the handle going up and Nate Kings popped it out of bounds It looked good I dont think it had any shot I dont care how high you jump I dont think that had any shot But it he was going to make it loud Williams thought about it hesitated found the spot he wanted and Ryan Williams 18 points his second triple of the game Some guys are just better in the starting lineup That has been the case for Ryan Williams today Three starts in his career as a sophomore his first this year with five minutes to play Five to shoot for Tyler Betsy Trying to draw a foul Thats a really nice move cheering Spinning the essentially the wrong direction of where his shots going to come up and still gets the bucket Allerie spot up in the corner Backto back threes for Nor Eastern He had only made two threes coming into this game I think thats his third 16 points for Allery Nor Eastern has made their last three from the floor but Syracuse has made four of their last five over there Oh tipped tipped by a Husky and well take a timeout 357 to go Double figure lead for the Cuse here at home You see the game summary Its the third straight game Chris where Syracuse has had five players with 10 or more points as Tyler Betsy got his 10th point just before the timeout Well you see the differential in free throws That thats the difference in the game right there But Nor Eastern only had one three in the first half They have six in this second half So theyve shot it better and its whats kept this game you know kind of within striking distance for them Kyle saves the turnover there tracking down that poor inbound pass cheering William Kyle to the free throw line Big two for Nor Eastern those two bigs Allerie and Fritz at 31 and 13 And heres Fritz trying to funny funny bone You ever get the funny bone tingle Thats the funny bone Thats actually the scientific medical term for it No nobody wants that This is what we were saying about about Fritz and Allerie I mean look at those numbers they have done against Syracuses front line And by the way seven of those 13 rebounds are on the offensive glass Oh Shaller drew the contact as caught underneath JJ replacing Syracuse trying to press but Nor Eastern has had no trouble breaking it and they are attacking on the back end of it Ryan Anthony takes a seat on the bench for Syracuse JJ Starling back out there And thats true Georgeip White and Suare all with three fouls for Syracuse Only one of those three thats on the floor is Nathan George Take Grind take George trapped in the corner Kyle flying in Dumps it off to Kings Five to shoot Turnover Lochnne up ahead to Williams The layin Sixpoint game with 310 to go How about the defense on the other end Yuri Fritz They put two on the ball Hes hard hedging out of the screen staying with the ball and then he gets back into the play to get that steal 20 points for Ryan Williams Again theyre just not going to go away And you know Syracuse kind of is hoping they will but Kyle gets that drive because of Nor Eastern extending on the ball screen Fritz gets back into the play gets the steal and Nor Easterns out and running 19 assists on 28 made field goals for Nor Eastern Syracuse hanging on Sixpoint advantage was as many as 15 at the 10minute mark of this music second half Syracuse will take their timeout Got one remaining Three minutes to go Nor Eastern content with putting William Kyle on the free throw line Yeah I dont need I dont Again you play the percentages Hes actually shot it well from the line today but you dont have to do it that far out That that was just too aggressive Hes not a threat out there as Yuri Fritz picks up his fourth foul cheering So both Fritz and Williams with four fouls both on the floor for Nor Eastern Shower misses Loose ball picked up by Nor Eastern Lock main blocked by Kyle applause Kings has to regroup cheering Hell go to shoot a pair with 237 to go Thats the difference Kyle makes in the middle of their defense With him not on the floor cheering Nor Easterns been able to score from that spot all night But when hes there forget it And now Ryan Williams is fouled out So the leading scoreer 20 points per game Excuse me not per game but in this game 20 points Ryan Williams fouls out Best game of his career Two shots for Xavier of Peru comes in Now you got to be careful because you got your leading scorer now out of the game for Nor Eastern And your second leading scoreer with four fouls in Yuri Fritz Howie for three Kings lost it off of his knee You have a challenge Its hard to tell from here Yeah hes going to challenge it I mean I it its hard to tell from here You and I didnt have a great angle but it did not look like from where were sitting that that went off of Nor Eastern Another look Oh yeah Maybe it hits that left arm Yeah And he got follow Yuri Fritz screaming for contact He absolutely got fouled And what a turnaround You challenge and then you get two points in the other end and we have a fivepoint game 91 run for Nor Eastern Seven on the shot clock for Syracuse cheering Jason George baseline and he got bailed out with 16 on the shot clock Not smart obviously I mean not only with the four fouls but if youre Yuri Fritz youre 69 Youve got about 6 in Fouled out So now the two leading scorers on the night for Nor Eastern have fouled out of the game Yeah thats what I was saying I mean with four fouls youve got to be more cautious But even so youve got 6 in Just keep your feet and be tall Checking in for the Huskies will be number Tai Francis You see Williams and Fritz combined for 37 points Theyve fouled out George at the free throw line to shoot the two free throws Even considering the free throw lows for Syracuse this season George is the one guy you really dont want to foul 81 on the year Williams in front side of the bench Shaller quickly down for the layin A quick basket is exactly what you needed if youre Nor Eastern cheering Double team on George again Not the guy you want to foul And they do with 119 to play And theyre trying to get the ball out of his hands I mean theyve got two guys on George trying to get him to give it up And a nice job keeping possession and then attacking Nathan theyre trying to put two on him out there by half court And if if you dont cut off that angle hes 10 of 11 from the free throw line here tonight them both Sevenpoint leader went down the court last time for a layup Spins it out to Sander Allerie excuse me Offensive rebound Allerie and a whistle cheering Neither team has been able to play their defense without fouling This is just an absolute train to the foul line on both sides A really smart cut by Allerie after he missed that three Hes got two shots cheering applause cheering Costly missed free throw there His dad Mark in attendance cheering Nor Eastern will use a timeout Northeast So a sixpoint game and Bill Cohen Surprisingly George will be the inbounder Come on Ryan Anthony back out there George good press break by the Orange And I dont think Lochnane was intending to foul there I agree They had him pinned up against that sideline A non ball hanger They I think Nor Eastern had him where they wanted but only a 50 free throw shooter So like we said you could throw a dart at a at a poor free throw shooter Betsy one for two tonight You know Syracuse comes out of this game with a win That has been a real silver lining is that the foul line for the first time all year has saved them It has won them this game Shot 41 free throws now Hes not been pretty 28 of them have gone through Back to you in the clutch Eastern 78 shower Theres no chance Larry went up and got it Missed the layup and a foul Oh my cheering home bro Allery just went up over the top Air ball and Allerie just says Give me that like hes snatching a like hes Debo snatching a chain and not quite sure where the foul was No the whistles have gotten exercise in this game on both ends of cheering Anthony will check in 46 seconds to go 45 combined fouls in this game between the two TEAMS and nearly a turnover Betsy fights out of the trap and Anthony fouled with 38 seconds to play time running out on Nor Easterns upset bid but its been a heck of an effort See the fouls coming into play down the stretch The two leading scorers in the game have already fouled out for Nor Eastern 8sec difference between the game clock and the shot clock Good defense by Syracuse Will So a defensive turnover will send these fans heading to the exits And so Syracuse looks like they will escape Not an easy nonconference homecourt victory but a victory nonetheless Well and give Nor Eastern a lot of credit You know there was there were some points in this game some breaking points where you thought Syracuse may kind of run away and Northeastern would not let that happen Credit to Bill Cohen This team a lot of fight CA is a good conference that you know Hoffshire has already beaten Pit and Syracuse You see what Nor Eastern can do Frankle just trying to draw a foul Banks in the three Called a foul with 17 seconds to go And thats Loch Nanes fifth foul So the third player to be disqualified the foul limit Tyler Betsy at the free throw line Syracuse finishes up nonconference with a game against Stonehill And then well play Clemson at home start ACC play Nor Eastern on the road at three straight games after this one Rhode Island Elon and North Carolina ent Franco for three No And theyll dribble out the clock cheering Syracuse a 9183 winner here at home A lot of whistles a lot of fouls Its usually not a recipe for success for Syracuse given their free throw shooting team on the season but getting it done at the line today 20 34 for
