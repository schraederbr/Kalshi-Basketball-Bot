ual she averaged 16 points a game for them last year still trying to find that right combination of hornets that can get the job done here this season coming off their best point total against a fall last weekend but still looking for that first win as we are underway from the Donald El Tucker Civic Center and right away a big threepointer knocked down by Sarah Vetti tan Latson draws all the attention in the paint and has the nice kick out to buetti Hornets coming right back looking for a shot from Whitney done from Beyond The Arc but jetti dials it up again two knock down threes just like that for number four its way to get things started for Florida State B jetti shooting just 28 but a confident threepoint shooter nonetheless knocks down two big ones to get the nll started 28 from three you you are right thatll definitely boost that average up a little bit it starts like that so 6 nothing for Florida State heres another three this run from Alexis Tucker and the hot streak right out of the gates comes a bit cold there but Florida State not shy of getting out to an early lead here against the Hornets team thats really trying to get off to a good start heres a shot Off the Mark by Ryan Tillis and one thing this Florida State team is trying to do theyve said uh for the last two seasons since head coach Brook wof took over theyre trying to get out and play with Pace In Space they want to get layups and they want to get threes and there you see the layups werent available kick outs for three were available and also able to knock down two of those three to get off to the 60 start you just saw head coach Brook wof second full season as seals head coach in as an interim head coach during the co year for former head coach Sue semal deflection it looked like there inside the paint as KK timson comes away with the ball and Florida State will work Back Up Tempo heres Tanaya Ladson and she gets a nice contested layup the 2023 ACC rookie of the year gets her first points of the game hor still looking for their first points Foria Harris whos coming off a 32point performance against toal best of her career took that shot and a travel violation against taaya Sanders another turnover and thats one of the big issues right now with Alabama state is their turnovers they are giving the ball up way too many times in fact theyre giving up about 27 turnovers a game and thats something were going to keep an eye on here today in Florida State one of the best in the country at taking care of the basketball nolles only averaging about 11 turnovers a game that leads the ACC in fewest turnovers have to be exact stay very disciplined good defense however by Cordia Harris to deny timson a bucket thatll be the matchup that we are going to keep our eyes on here Harris once again from down town but just not a lot of accuracy right now from Alabama State the jetti slicing and dicing into the paint as timson gets around the hands of Harris 10 nothing Applause seals SS have done a nice job defensively of forcing some out of rhythm shots for the Hornets forcing Cordia Harris away from the basket making her shoot threes instead of those in the paint looks shes used to getting Hornets working the ball around timson with eyes in the back of her head literally had her back turned to the ball off the pass from Dunn and that goes out of bounds 6 seconds left on the shot clock for the Hornets B jetti again draws all that defensive attention everybody knows she wants to get to the rim tipson left there Aon three ball from the Hornets Here Comes omaria Gordon she gets fouled by Dunn and shell go to the line wheny Dunn another player that had a career rear high in the last game for the Hornets against the Paul she scored 23 points in that game shes averaging about seven or so per game commits the foul there gets the arm of omaria Gordon that Harrison done combined for 55 points in that game against the Paul ended up only scoring 69 but again that was their highest point total of the Season Unfortunately they just havent been able to keep Pace with whats going on Def defensively a lot of games where theyve given up 90 plus points in fact six of their of their nine games have resulted in their opponents getting Beyond 90 and I expect to see the Hornets mix some things up defensively right now though its just about transition defense Florida state has been able to get out and run in transition there we see KK timson with the big block on the defensive end for Florida State big open Lane for Sanders to go through and timson shows you how its done even with being guarded hard its the layup and 14 nothing Florida State already that was T lapson that time taking taking it the length of the floor right at the rim and then has to finish with some body contact Music rage looking like Dasher and Dancer really cutting it up for Florida state does t Aton were in the holiday season so you got to you know whatever you can do instead of slicer and dicer you know slasher dancer you name it give me the reinder names I love that you were in the holiday spirit here of course its Florida States holiday hoops event tonight feels like its cold enough to snow outside here in Tallahasse yeah it was just north of freezing temperatures this morning but no icy conditions in Florida State not icy right now they are red hot to start this game not inside the Tucker Center here Flor status jumped out to the big lead here so far started with Sarah Vetti two knockdown threes right out of the gate which spin by carther but still unable to hit a shot Hornets unable to really get inside much against the seals theyre really locking down the paint timson gets the pass and is fouled by Harris lefthanded attempt Cordia Harris there doing everything she can at 61 to try to keep KK timson from scoring thats a tough task for the 61 senior from Mobile Alabama but you mentioned shes been fantastic for the Hornets so far this season shes the reigning swack player of the week she had those 32 points nine rebounds as well in their game at the Paul last weekend shes averaging about six and half rebounds a game having a great start to this season heres Cordia Harris you mentioned one rebound shy that second double double of the season the goto player for this Hornets team leads the team in field goal percentage points per game rebounds and blocks so if you want boards and you want scoring thats the player theyre going to rely upon but theyre just trying to find answers as the double dribble charged to jamah cars and the ball will go right back to the seals K just looked a little unsure of where she was going to go with the ball that time think she was looking to try to pass started to pick it up but then realized she didnt have anywhere to go and tried to get it back on the ground officials ruled that that was a double dribble 17 nothing Florida State as we just passed the 4minute mark in this game the jetti looking for a third three not on the mark this time Hornet speeding things up Summer Hicks nice shot on the floater so summer hick Hicks whos averaging under a half a point a game gets two the first two for Alabama State a freshman coming in making an impact right away T lson making an impact on the other end for Florida State cant get the bucket to fall but shell go back to the free throw line for two more attempts that hicks is only played entering tonight 18 minutes in five games played thats really encour ing side if youre afraid of Freeman Jackson to see some of those other players step in and step up yeah shes going to need some other players to step up unfortunately as thats going to be two fouls now on her leader Cordia Harris have to believe Harris is probably going to have to step out of this game for a little bit to avoid picking up foul number three Watson gets the two so now 192 Florida State and for Harris its its going to be like that all night but she might be getting a long break with already the two fouls here just a little close to 5 minutes into this game tarez The Freshman from Murphys Boro Tennessee going to check in couple of freshman going to have to play some big minutes for the Hornets here in the post Nicks keeping that ball in bounds however turnover again petti on the mark and back in the scoring column with another basket its eight quick points here just 5 minutes get into the game for Sarah Music Applause Music betet zaris now in for Alabama State against timson Ladson charged with the foul pushing foul lson trying to get over the top of that screen just jumped out into the path of Whitney Dunn and gets whistled for her first personal so Alabama state gets that positive shes super related still be here in Montgomery and means Ive done a lot of things right and shes certainly trying to figure out whats right here get things on the right track with Alabama state but nevertheless Marissa just a great career and found has found a real good home with the Hornets in Alabama yeah shes done a tremendous job there taking the Hornets to three NCAA tournaments uh wnit birth as well three swack regular season titles just an outstanding job and a welld deserved honor for her timson with two makes a 232 and its a big Basketball family shes a part of her husband Lewis Jackson was the former head coach for the mens basketball team at Al Alabama State and actually a little slight connection here with Florida State as her daughter Bianca Jackson played at Florida State also over at South Carolina fans will remember her from her time here had a great career here as a sem got some pretty good coaching from a couple Legends legendary head coaches Bianca did but of course her moms been excellent with Alabama state in a very competitive swag conference as solangel arage gets a free throw for the Hornets looking to double up and with with those fouls by Cordia Harris fra Freeman Jackson has had to go with a very young group out there shes got three freshmen on the floor right now oh what a pass by Ladson down low right to timson onew combination between Ladson and KK timson continues to reign supreme theres not too many better onew combinations in this league or around the country than those two dynamic duo that a lot of ACC teams got a firsthand glimpse of last year and still a season and maybe more together down the road another three this time from acreage Off the Mark and another attempt by Whitney Dunn hits the front of that Rim Ladson driving again gets fouled draws contact against acrid back to shooting will go to the Music Applause Music line Hornets going to go a little deeper in their bench here now as they bring in a couple of other freshman and Hall 65 freshman from Atlanta checks in believe thats Christian Jackson the sophomore as well checking in for the Hornets Jackson leading the team in three point percentage they need all the help they can get to try and get back in this game Alissa really its part of this situation where for Coach Freeman Jackson trying to find a solid group of core players here that can be on the floor for a majority of the time right now shes trying to find a solid five and some players Off the Bench that could provide a spark and not many too many of those right now the horns had a brutal schedule lets just uh put that out there we havent talked about that but played basically all power five teams have only had one home game so they are battle tested big three from April hooks its another freshman in hooks they can get some freshman going a little bit New Blood new energy can come off the bench and can really provide a good moment and a couple of a little bit of momentum as they get closer to their conference play they still have to go on the road against Miami next as their final nonconference game they will certainly be prepared for that swack schedule with the KN conference schedule that they have played AA Hall a little too hard off the glass with that shot good couple of good stops this is exactly what coach Freeman Jackson wanted a couple of consecutive stops for Alabama State they have to capitalize on it bring the ball around and now slowing the pace staying composed good pass inside as Paul able to put this one in Alabama State getting a little good juju going their way now back within 20 and again it is about consistency for this Hornet team how many plays can you string together can you get stops in back to back and back possessions you know can you get a couple of scores in a row car vas off the marks new Turnage tried to get it but it was knocked Away by Sanders so another stop for the Hornets you mentioned that how many road games they played 12 of their first 13 games this season are going to be on the road turnit excellent reach preventing that ball from going into the paint and here comes Ladson again and she gets fouled by tarus and back to Snoop turnit there on the defensive end those long arms Snoop turnit has been a Difference Maker for Florida State this season averaging about two points a game but shes the second leading rebounder on this team with almost six rebounds a game and defensively you see there what she can do Deni in the line for the shoting two yeah she entered tonight with 64 rebounds only 37 behind KK timson but still nonetheless pretty darn good average lson hits the first stop a stretch of no no points for the nolles but still no field goals for Florida State in the last 2 minutes and 37 seconds so Alabama State doing a decent job so far of keeping the mes off the floor at least from scoring more buckets and establishing more possession and momentum and Florida State still out in front by a good margin well be right back after these Music messages the home depa committed to filling the trades Gap seols mascot simmer on for basketball games in the holiday spirit cheering on the nolles 2928 Florida state with about a minute left here in this first Music Applause quarter ruthers taking a shot from outside had a couple hands in her face offensive rebound by Sanders in the corner however she might have stepped out of bounds itll go the other way thats a tough break for Alabama State as Sanders had made the hustle play Tracked Down the loose ball rebound and then just stepped on the sideline Applause Music there trying to get to 30 points before this first quarter ends Maria Gordons been pretty silent but gets score a big bucket driving away with the contact we go to the line for an additional shot Florida States previous high for the first quarter was 34 points in the first quarter against Tennessee on Pace here Gordon can knock down the N1 opportunity good burst you see the burst of energy these Florida State guards have and they have a collection of them that can really get into the paint fast Gordon misses the free throw but collected quickly by white give an extra possession to the Florida State team turnover a rare one by Gordon and now Alabama state has a chance for the last shot quick Hands by Jackson just swatted that ball away a good catch by Hall but gets Music fouled just under 10 remaining here in the first quarter and shell get a chance at some free throws yeah Gordon does not turn the ball over a lot Melissa she has the best assist to turnover ratio on the Florida State roster yeah last time out against Drexel Gordon had seven assists just one turnover leads this team assist entering tonight with Music Applause 47 in fact only came into the game with 13 turnovers on the season so rare you see number three Miss handle the ball vas not uncommon she will knock down a big time three and does so at the buzzer one of the best threepoint Shooters in the game adding to that sem old lead well in the 2022 U7 World Championships and then also in the 23 23 FBA European championships as Gordon knocks down another bucket for the another P shooter for another pure shooter indeed as the noes just continue to roll right along here on their home court but back to Carla dieas she is going to be somebody that simal are going to have to count on this season throughout ACC play to knock down perimeter jump shots absolutely elad if shes uncontested and still capable even with hands in her face according to head coach Brook wof why they got her and she has such a quick release on that shot doesnt need much space to get it off and you saw there on that shot before the before the quarter came to an end how she kind of worked to her left just to get to her spot a little bit so it wasnt exactly the most balanced shot taken but as pure as it gets with that stroke youre right once ACC play comes around and youre in the grind need to gut out a couple games youre definitely going to need some reliable threepointers and threepoint Shooters as saw a block from Alexis Tucker SOA white there long for the r Gordon in the corner for three rattles out very close to dropping it will be a rebound and possession going to the Hornets FL State still shooting it well from Beyond The Arc though 43 threepoint field goal percentage in the nolles as a team shooting 65 from the floor getting good shots good looks at the basket and knocking them down still this Al estate team not able to stop the bleeding for the most part wanting to get a close game this year let alone a w still looking for that first win and none of their games have been really that Applause close mention 12 of their first 13 games on the road a lot of those against some power five teams even when they get to conference play theyre going to start their first two team first two games on the road block by Vias slightly that ball is gobbled up thats another Scrappy play by Christian Jackson shes been aggressive on the defensive end for these hornets and all honesty is really there most effective and efficient shooter once she gets in the game and has those attempts shes only had 20 attempts in nine games in terms of shooting the ball but shes 50 from the floor so shes made the most of her opportunities and you can see the scrappiness and the will to get the ball and fight for her team Tucker from top of the key swish 30 point lead for the seals now Alexis Tucker one of the most accurate threepoint Shooters on the Florida State team shoots it at nearly 33 from Beyond the threepoint line for the nolles this season one of the newcomers for Florida State a grad transfer from UC Santa Barbara finding her role with Florida State possession will remain with the 7al 12 seconds on the shot clock nice job by Sarah petti there to draw the defense to her and then the little fill behind for Alexis Tucker shes not just a threepoint shooter Brook wof said she can certainly shoot from outside but can drive and inside for some close range shots and really wanted her to be in be brought in and be an impact score and she certainly has provided that its taken her a little while to find that role when you have stars like Ladson and Simpson as the shot clock violation occurs for Alabama State Tuckers really finding her own here and at the right time for the seals before conference play yeah Tucker averaging about 8 points points per game so far this season but had a big game to help Florida State knock off the Leng ranked lady vs earlier this season hes a key factor in that game down the stretch real statement win for Florida State early in the year just a second game zaka white working hard off a couple of Miss shots and gets the put back bucket will also go to the line SK white one of the best rebounders in all Junior College last season comes up with a big one there for Florida State just gets herself in good position finishes through the Music contact white earning some valuable minutes for Florida Music State mostly through the work that she does on the glass offensively and defensively and coach woff said shes been their most effective rebounder particular a great scorer in the paint a little bit under sized at just 61 but she plays a lot bigger than that Trevor again last season she averaged yeah 18 points a game 13 rebounds at Jones college solid transfer player Ladson turnaround jumper Too Short Alabama State looking to pick up the pace done just a little bit offt Target underneath the basket I thought Tucker was going to pull the trigger on that one Bon found Tucker in the corner little mishandled by Alexis Tucker and Alabama State able to work the ball out and keep the ball 421 noes firmly in control long way to go in this one the Hornets are going to need a lot of stops here especially in this second quarter to at least trim that lead and that margin as much as they can cars outside to Sanders back to the top to Dunn shell take a three Nails it good stroke step back away from boner like that step back three from Whitney done said about 30 on the season from behind the arc and look at him Maya boner oh cant finish it but Nifty move from boner the transfer from Cal really smooth operation right there but not able to get it down shot up by Sanders who was all alone sand nice little floater as Alabama State getting a little bit of a tiny run going but itll be a media timeout here on the floor Florida State still well in control 4216 as Alabama state looks to work and get state for season Ladson leading the way just shy of 19 but Gordon timson and betet all providing impacts here Melissa early here for Florida State yeah when you look down the stat sheet its those same players who are leading the way so far tonight lson already in double figures with 11 KK timson with eight Sarah B jetti with eight Amari Gordon with six so some balanced scoring for Florida State business as usual for the seals as Alabama state will gain possession here about halfway through the second quarter Trevor to Gro Lissa Bruner with the call glad youre with us here in Tallahasse Florida as another Miss pass by the Hornets go right back to Florida State its good leadership though by cord haris she knew that her teammate needed to make the extra pass to get a better angle she she communicated that to her hey make it easier on us lets turn it this way Avery Treadwell getting some action collects her own rebound draws the foul on the shot so the freshman of Knoxville Tennessee will head to the line talk about imposing the will for Florida State heres a player Melissa who obviously is just in her first Collegiate year but boy she was an absolute machine down on the high school level yeah averaged a double double on the high school level and Avery Treadwell getting some valuable minutes here again as the seols prepare for ACC play coming up right after the holiday break Treadwell may be a player whos called on to step in and play some big minutes in the event that KK timson gets in some foul trouble or they have multiple post players uh that are needed at one time saw some action actually against the number two ranked UCLA Bruins and boy do they have some Talent as usual held her own actually Avery Treadwell did a great job having to defend the six7 Lauren bets literally a California Redwood out there she was a force inside for the Bruins and this time redwell charged with with the foul as FIA Harris EST reestablishing herself in this game shell go to the line certainly a lesson if you go up against Bates and UCLA you better at least double her and be ready to work on your halfcourt defense and Florida State to their credit even getting down early in that game Melissa really fought and kept pace even after finding or after trailing heavily by a large margin they kept the pace the rest of the way we talked about how challenging the schedule is for the Alabama State Hornets first tattis played a challenging nonconference schedule as well when you talk about going on the road and playing the likes of UCLA and Stanford playing Florida on the road you got the Arkansas game at home Tennessee here I mean those were some big time competition that should have helped prepare Florida state for a grueling ACC schedule coming up certainly think about some of those teams in the ACC NC State really comes to mind and what West Moore has created with the wol pack over in New numerous amount of years SS though wanting to get to the top of those standings once again bouncing threepointer by Snoop Turnage and we talked about the defensive prowess the rebounding effort of Snoop Turnage but you can see there she can knock down the three as well 56 for Florida State Beyond The Arc matching overall from the floor and once again the lead is back over 30 shot clock winding down here Alabama State got to get a look Turnage in the way of Harris shell collect the rebound Latson quickly looking for her teammate down at the lower levels and Snoop Turnage again we talk about the ones two combination of tison and Latson Latson and Turnage have a history together on the a level in high school same spot same result on the floor for Snoop Turnage six points now for her on back to back threes Turnage averaging less than 25 from theond The Arc and just like betet first two three attempts go in and Turnage again another Reb another rebound and good defensive effort the jetti hard drive with the shoulder but shell keep possession with the ball Subs come in for both teams take another look here at the threes from Turnage T Latson again drawing all the attention in the paint somebody wanting to try to stop the AllAmerican lson creating scoring opportunities for a teammates Duke Turnage the beneficiary of that pass seals already with 50 points make it 52 with ladsons do theyre on Pace to go over a 100 right now they keep this up up Florida States previous halftime high was 58 in a win over Charleston Southern in their opener on Pace to break Music that tied a quarter high in the first quarter with their 34 points good bucket by aage freshman aage now with Five Points the lead the way three from Ladson erases that positive moment for the Hornets Ladson already with 16 Watson almost at her season average of 18 a game here in the first half just so difficult for the Hornets to try and keep this pace and now Ladson showing the effort on the defensive end pokes this one away and shell get another easy two it is a runway for Florida State 5718 that is a 152 run now for the nolles over the last three minutes made their last five buckets to Music boot shot from outside Hornets trying to stay with the seals but seminal ship is getting smaller and smaller in that spy Music glass drifting away are the nolles running away fou on Florida State substitutions come on in Latson will get a break Hornets with the ball 115 left off the back of Maria Gordon that was a little Nifty from daa Sanders to gain possession a little opening underneath the basket of a cheeky play right there highly intelligent with Gordon back to the ball good ball movement here from the Hornets but still not able to finish the job at the net Gordon nice little cut Shuffle but beet is wide open from Beyond three and she knocks it down 60 points for the seals most points scored in a half this year Jenny making it rain from long range today three of four from Beyond The Arc for Mai 11 points for her she is the second semin hole in figures you mentioned it Melissa 58 against Charleston Southern and that is shattered for Florida State about 30 seconds left see if they maybe tack on another couple or maybe three Alabama State trying to just get to 20 right now heres hooks working hard against Vias timson went up but got dragged by Tillis with some contact and Florida State have an opportunity at the last shot half and no free throws yet as thats just the third team foul for the Hornets it will give the nolles one more possession here to end the quarter thats really one of the few positives right now for Alabama state is the low amount of fouls at the buer minimum but it has been domination to the UMP degree for Florida State less than 10 game clock winding down Vias wanted another buzzer beater type three a little too short on that attempt and Alabama state will have two 27 seconds to make something Applause happen and theyll just honestly let the let the clock run out try and get some positive vibes and talk it over in the locker room listen this was just as clean big deficit as Florida State inbounds and is ready to rock and roll and our snowman is also in the basketball Spirit ready rock and roll saying happy holidays and so we and so is Alexis Tucker he gets a nice little floater there in the paint to get things going for Florida State we really appreciate everybody tuning in and watching this one hope your holidays are going swimmingly certainly is for the seminal tonight an effort by Whitney Dunn but not enough to drop gets double team does Latson but finds Gordon Mor state has numbers finds the pass inside now inside out to Tucker and she knocks it down buries it what an unselfish play from KK timson again probably could have taken it up and scored after the Nifty pass from omaria Gordon instead recognized the Tucker wide open and she could kick it out for the open three yeah they had the numbers in their favor and you had a wide open Tucker why not take a shot theres Harris Harris a nice move shooting it up high over the outstretch arms of gladson first points of the game for Harris Ladson does not get a friendly bounce off the rim or off the glass its becoming pretty evident here Melissa that going forward for the Hornets its going to be Cordia Harriss team and she will be the tone Setter once they enter their conference play still have Miami left in terms of nonconference on the road down in Coral Gables but she has certainly been the bright spot here one of the bright spot players that has stepped up back to Tucker for another three and just like in the first half from Vetti tuer out of the gates of a half and she knocks down two threes Alexis Tucker now jumping into double figures as well with 11 joining bet jetti and lson already in those double figures and then Sarah petti doing what she does best draw those offensive fouls wak havoc on the defensive end and theyre going to say it was TAA Sanders a little bit too much contact this one charged to the other number four thats Taya Sanders with the offensive foul as Tucker see what shes done across her career Texas Tech you see Santa Barbara and she just continues to pour things on right now she has found a heatwave here 10 points to start this quarter for Alexis Tucker all 10 of the Florida State points coming from Tucker averages just eight points per game on the season Tillis not even close to reaching the rim Tucker could have taken that one again insid instead gives it off to Gordon ladsons wide open for a three this one misses but timson there nice over the back shoulder pass but Ladson cant finish still showing the effort with her own offensive rebound awkward shot and finally the Hornets control good Innovation by timson however Florida State cant finish the job but now up by 50 points deep three from Whitney dun close but no cigar and Florida State will jog it up the court Gordon good pick set by Simpson blocked by Harris nice defensive play there by cord Asia Harris leads this team in blocks entering the night so Harris doing what she can on both ends of the floor got the two fouls early in this game so she hasnt been able to make the impact that shed liked to but you can see the talent from number 20 no question about it see if they call that after the shot by Tucker or if thats going to be on the shot and if it is theyre going to give three shots to Tucker they going to say it was after the shot on the close out Tucker was knocked to the ground so it will just be a team foul onone it is her third you saw the slab there 14 of 17 by Harris on the road in Chicago against depal we talked about dun there she just collected the foul she had the her best career best 23 points she had that was a return home for Whitney Dunn whos originally from Chicago in fact went to Loyola University of Chicago a big block by timson no chance for Ashley Applause gray K tison coming over in help side swats that away from Ashley gray gray comes from a basketball family as well sister Alicia plays with the WNBA Atlanta Dream played at both North and South Carolina as a Collegiate star won a national championship at South Carolina if Im not mistaken yeah gray trying to get some reps and trying to get some offensive continuity but no chance against timson so baby gray got to rise up fast and got to work hard if you want to get it around timson hard pass from Tucker trying to get it to Gordon it bounces off the Florida state guard good spin by Sanders charges through the paint and that gets a lot of claps from the visitors bench good effort shown by Sanders nice play from Sanders leads this team in minutes played it started all nine games leads the team in assists as well does a nice job Distributing the ball nobody yeah nobody has a positive assistant turnover ratio but she has it and an easy what would have been an easy two for Tucker doesnt have the delicacy on that touch but Sanders has the best assist to turnover ratio entering tonight 2527 so shes the best facilitator on the team to boot The Jetty hard challenge against Ashley gray shell get the call in her favor lets take a look at Sanders working her way good move faking out Tucker and Tucker thought she was going to Dish it to the corner there was a teammate open in the corner good recognition by Sanders to realize she had a driving lane herself and just kept it laid it in first free throw down for petti and you can see you know this is obviously is not the outcome right now Alabama State wants but coach Freeman Jackson wants her players to understand this is still a process you know going through this nonconference schedule they knew it was going to be T demanding and bring and brutal was the word she mentioned when we talked to her on the phone but you know doesnt want their confidence to get buried because they understand its going to be a competitive conference play with the swag good pass by Harris but a rejection by Gordon yeah you look at this conference schedule you know and you have to go on the road and play at Alabama Memphis SMU Oklahoma Auburn depal its going to be a tough road Mar yeah Gordon making it a tough road here at the tuck today with a big block and helps side J coming out she literally came out of absolute nowhere to make that block and that was it looked like a freeway wide open for Sanders right to the basket but Gordon jumping out of the forest and swatting that ball away Florida state is a team now with five blocks already in this game when the littlest player on the floor is getting blocks you know things are going well for the nolles and up by 50 points the deficit just continues to get larger the jetti draws contact again Alabama State not able to stay away from fouls not in foul trouble per se yet but just too many stoppages and too many trips to the line for the nolles but once again Seals having their way with the Hornets and the last time these two teams play was back in 2015 in March in the NCAA tournament first round where Florida State came away with the big win but Florida State yeah on their way to an elite eight the first in school history that season a historic year for Florida state was going to say was a 30th win of the season for the semal at the time and Ru a big year nonetheless for for the women of Florida State here to get to that Elite eight p as two knockdown free throws for Florida State expands that big lead so Hornets trying to find something coming out of Tallahassee that they can cling on to and take with them foul Harris Drew contact it looked like on Gordon kicking foul thats an unfortunate foul on Harris is just got her feet tangled up both players going after the ball chasing it down Gordons feet got tangled up with Harris is there was I dont think there was any ill intent there to try to trip but uh he just got kind of tangled up but officials saw it thats what shes arguing with yeah head referee Angelica suffring but it will be a third personal foul for Harris another free throw goes down for Florida State teammate Whitney Dunn already on the bench with those four personal fouls done the second leading scorer on this team just one of eight for from the floor to today with three points those four fouls Gordon another two free throws Florida state is only missed one tonight 20 of 21 from the line for Florida State pretty impressive numbers no that sometimes gets undervalued especially in tight ball games when youre in your conference those free throws are so vitally important doesnt matter who youre playing the free throw Lines the same right so thats going to leave uh it doesnt for anybody still at the same spot thats right same dimensions same same height have to have a good follow through and shot and Florida States doing a good job with that but still to enter have have that entering conference play is a good sign for Florida State especially when youre traveling on the road youll need those 10 seconds on the shot clock for Alabama State got to be able to get to the free throw line and then make them d double trouble Arthurs driving hard shot clock winding down taken by Sanders but not enough force or height to put that ball in Gordon working way back long range from Amaya Bonner but no dice for the sophomore guard yeah Bonner actually the only player for Florida state that has not scored yet today she averages about 77 points a game entered with the best threepoint percentage for Florida Music State Hornets slowing things down working the ball around shot from carther collected by summer Hicks who had the first points for the Hornets tonight after the seminal got out to a Music commanding double digit lead Hicks kicks it out cars again still cant get it between the rim a Gua white with the take down excellent effort indeed Gord right back the other way beautiful floater with traffic in her Music face Aria Gordon now into double figures 10 points for her after that last made bucket thats an 80 run for Florida State over the last 3 minutes fre to Freeman Jackson will take a timeout willll also take a timeout fre but shes been big contributor all over the floor Melissa yeah seretti the senior on this team leading the way getting it done both ends of the Floor coming up with big defensive plays knocking down threes knocking down layups making assists jeny with the complete floor game tonight 15 points five rebounds two assists you see the gradual growth in points per game over her career now firmly in double digits as mentioned the 15 points tonight highly efficient from both two and threepoint range just another offensive threat that Florida States consist conly seeing here in whats shaping up to be a really dangerous team s jetti wants to make the most of her last season here in Tallahassee red shirt senior good three from Beyond The Arc ACD The Freshman Applause guard a little positivity for Alabama State as they dont want this lead to get any out more out of hand thats eight points now for acerage its got to be a new high for her only average is just over a point per game hasnt had much time turnover here from Christian Jackson tried to find Hall but too many seminal in her way Watson right back down the other way and draws foul draws the contact shell go to the line hooks called for the foul number three that was Jackson again with another solid defensive play for the Hornets I loved her intensity shes been able to come up with a couple of steals here tonight done some good things defensively making it hard on the sem oil Applause guards closing in on 80 points are the S hes Ladson knocking down the first highly efficient free throw shooter does not get that one to go however and unfortunately tayia Hamilton just put the ball back into her own basket off of the rebound oh my goodness an own basket dont see that very often those are just the mistakes and just the mental lapses that coach Freeman Jackson just doesnt want to have happen but its just a focus and a mentality right now that Alabama State just has not consistently Music shown for the thing to see and Im waiting on our stat monitor is who gets those points for Florida State if its the last seal to touch it its t aladon yeah shot fre help no building her stats not at all lets see if Alabama say can get those points back as Hall will go to the line knocks down the first one should probably know that rule and I dont well have to get some clarification on that one just actions before thoughts not paying off for the Hornets in that instance as Hall knocks down both so needs to try and erase something really quickly and refocus reshuffle as coach Freeman Jackson continues to look on and trying to guide her lady Hornets through this game just a little bit under a minute 30 left in the third quarter theyve yet to allow 100 points in a Music game just have not been able to score and get the offensive production this season that they want long range shot from Jackson misses get an offensive rebound but Jackson underneath the rim cannot control the ball the other way it goes for the players in white gladson over to boner Jackson getting right in the grill of boner almost forced to steal vus sweet stroke from Beyond but Snoop Turnage showing the length of the arm to gather the rebound puts it right back for two Turnage with her best effort so far this season now 87 rebounds in just 12 minutes of action for the sophomore from Atlanta two big threes in this game already so Turnage with a nice KN corner number three Jackson not Music enough just another frustrating evening for Alabama State F going to go on Music tarez SK white with another big rebound for the noes she got five rebounds tonight so white to the line seals really good free throw shooting team yeah white on the season 75 from the Line This is the first one there nearly 90 tonight gets that one to bounce in now at 88 on the evening are the seminal Im sure the fact that the NS have gotten there 25 times will make head coach Brook wof happy compared to 50 for Alabama State the crowd coming into play against Hall they manipulated what they thought the shot clock or the game clock was Ladson tries to go up and Hall you know what says Im going to come right back with a block denying Ladson more points so she shakes off the attempted shot like this because you want to play against the best then challenge yourself and and you can see there from that schedule thats exactly whats going to happen for these Florida State seminal get a nice break with the Christmas holiday theyll come right back to work on the 29th as we start this fourth quarter Miss shot for Alabama state has a little bit more of the depth comes through for Florida state timson with the bucket shell get into double figures but you see Lucia Navaro getting some playing time just getting her fifth game of the year one of two players on the Florida State roster from Spain there another missed opportunity for anajah Hall timson denied underneath good effort by April hooks challenging timson so look this Alabama State team is going to continue to work hard and give the effort its just not coming together right now against one of the most dominant offensive teams in the country this is a tall task for the Hornets tonight against one of the nations highest scoring offenses in the Florida state seals hard Scramble for the ball as petti for that shoulder drive against Cordia Harris going down onto the hardwood and itll go The Hornets way Jett is really one of the strong shoulder drives of probably anybody in the country Melissa when she gets on a roll and goes downhill it is really hard to stop her you better be ready to hold your ground fast that compact body is incredibly strong shes worked through injuries filing healthy really for the first time in her career really prioritized rehab and hes really done a nice job perfecting that body is making it strong as you said always a force on the defensive end one of the top Defenders on the perimeter in the ACC nicknamed OMG for a reason small But Mighty from former head coach Su Samra the legend certainly living up to those monitors Harris receives the inbound again timson just staying strong not getting out of place timson showing ability to handle the ball there too crosses over but she might bring it the whole way Naro in the corner decided better to give it up than take the shot but that drive nice bounce pass to timson but mishandles it they call that on shot that send KK timson to the line I think go against Harris were going to say she was not in the act of shooting so look like timson had all of the ball potentially for that to be the case so Harris avoids a personal foul but it will remain with Florida State 8627 Tucker Miss handles it steel for Jackson Thats Jackson again on the floor being aggressive on the defensive end but still no not a lot of finishing ability for the Hornets thats probably one of the next phases for Freeman Jackson Squad is to finish at The Rim lot of chances tonight put back bucket for timson this has been her quarter right now gson nearing that double double 12 points eight rebounds for the Junior from Edison Music Georgia pass Sanders Hall and that a steal from KK timson on the defensive end swatting it away ball stands at 65 but timons the one working hard and gets another bucket for her efforts timson at 62 has been winning that battle despite the highight advantage for Hall just the talent is oozing from KK tempson Paul theres a good feed from ACD that time tison was a little greedy went for the steal didnt get it Jackson working hard here on the inbounds so Jackson already has four steals love her defensive energy yeah a lot of effort for Jackson is couple swats Alabama state will remain with the seals as Subs come in there was a fourway tie in terms of who was leading the team in steals for Alabama State coming into this game but its Christian Jacksons stat now with the performance shes putting out there on the defensive end so again still a lot of work to be done for this Hornets team Melissa but you can see some things that you can still build off of you see the offensive production from Cordia Harris you see the defensive capability from the likes of Christian Jackson Maya boner with another really good look there look like it was going down rims out but Avery Treadwell The Freshman there to pick up the offensive board go back to the free throw line very nice rainbow Ark and stroke for that first free throw wasnt expecting the ball to get back that quickly for him though but does not get phased by it officials ready to go just keep this rolling no no time to waste at the free throw line I think the Hornets want this one to go too they want to just like you know they want to still put in a good effort here and finish strong but they certainly have not like the way this one has ended up 92 29 in favor of the seminal heres Jackson driving away from the basket and draws a foul on Treadwell thats a Treadwell or boner I think theyre they are going to give that to Treadwell Bonner thought it was on her by her reaction but was Treadwell with the Music body thats one thing that the Freshman has acknowledged that she wants to work on is she gets called for a lot of fouls so has to learn to defend without fouling and use that size to her advantage thats something thats hard for freshman post players sometimes to figure out exactly how physical can I be at this level only her eighth game of the season coming off the bench trenell certainly a physical Force really hardnosed competitor and sometimes you have to learn how to dial that back a little bit and play more finesse or at least more surgical rather than just a little bit more Brute Force full court press how about Harris sticking to her chest and hands like SpiderMan gets the ball and get a put back bucket so all of a sudden elama state with a full court press action ball will remain with the seals but this is an encouraging sign not giving up and how about the sticky hands of Harris and the effort and the wherewithall to get to the bucket nice trap coming magetti had nowhere to go I think she was actually trying to throw it off of the body of Harris the second basket for Harris this evening Tucker excellent job working underneath the arms of Tavaris thats one way to beat the Press just take it the length of the floor and score layups on the other end done he not had the followup game she would have liked coming off to Paul but again another bucket in for Cordia Harris the jetti good handle but not a good finish hes lost the handle Maybe it looked like right at the end and didnt quite get it all the way to the rim good defense Again by the Hornets done with another Drive gives it off to Harris and Harris is heating up six points here in a matter of perhaps less than a minute is so fast Med game well in hand for Florida State but Alabama State still showing the matches by shirt my jersey and thatll be the end of the night for Cordia Harris unfortunately fifth personal foul right there for number 20 and what has been her fth frustrating evening just got on a bit of a roll with six points quickly here in the fourth quarter as you can see not what she wanted to see and have happen to her going to finish the night with eight points four rebounds only was able to play in 19 minutes again the reigning whack player of the week yeah really got into foul trouble early with two quick fouls in the first quarter had to depart slowly get her way back into the game but that will be it for number 20 CIA Harris as zja Hall takes over knock down three from viegas from Deep Alabama State switches to that two3 zone that we thought that we would see car Vias going to try to shoot him right out of that zone Florida state has just cooked it all night Music long as the seals are approaching triple digits on the night still with 439 left hall pass over to tovaris working hard but too strong over Turnage as you see the depth for Florida State here as theyre trying to get to those triple digits boner out to Turnage who has a couple threes tonight and theres number 100 on the stat sheet and the point total for the summon Turnage three for three from Beyond The Ark 11 points now for Snoop Turnage seven rebounds she might be on her way to a double Music double bucket Jackson for Jackson Alabama State trying to work hard and maybe get to 50 if they can turn up the heat boner does not capitalize on the three as depth for the nolles trying to get some good party reps foul drawn Alabama state will go back to the line and Florida State trying to get the ball into the paint get those paint points but when the defense collapses they are dangerous from the threepoint line Snoop Turnage making the Hornets pay Florida State so far on the night 48 from threepoint range 12 of 25 for the nolles from the bonus sphere and its not exactly the identity that Brook woff exactly puts out there too much but its certainly effective when you can have several Sharpshooters from Beyond The Arc to bail you out of trouble when necessary they have not had any trouble tonight dont get me wrong but certainly it helps when you have multiple weapons that can shoot from long range youve got four players that have all connected on multiple threes when you look at it Snoop Turnage is connected on three Sarah B jetti three for four how about B adding at least one boner joining the club you got Theos thats two of five Tucker three of five I mean getting threes from a variety of players just makes Florida State even that much harder to guard that was Bonners first three of the evening and that is getting that is a long list of Threes here in the stands for the seminal but but the fans are keeping track of it just count him with us four 5 6 7 8 9 10 even double digits there thats 13 threes that is not an Unlucky 13 either Gloria keeping it uh real over there marking him down taking notes keeping track for all of the sual fans here to see and witness Hall once again too strong and over the basket swatted Away by Tre will to deny Thea Sanders of a putback opportunity itll go back to the Hornets 54 Junior Sanders in there battling on the offensive class getting her team an extra possession only s all not to score tonight was Lucia Navaro not on the floor right now she had a little bit of action earlier on and Gordon gets fouled by Hall looks like she may have got Swip in the face shes a bit shaken up and trying to walk that off and T Ladson will come in for Gordon little it shaken up on that contact not exactly sure where she got swiped but certainly agitated her ball back in is Ladson comes back into the game woff wants at least one of their starters on the floor at all times Vias well if she keeps shooting like that shell be in the starting lineup someday St back move for three from Cara Vias nine points now for the Freshman from Malaga Spain alltime scoring record for Florida state is 114 points about 220 left in this game they are getting oh so close to that Mark as a three for Alabama State goes down foul against Jackson before Ladson is in the act of shooting Alabama stage 12 she will go to the Music line lson now could he Clips the 20 point mark reach the 20 point mark here with these free throws theres 20 for Ladson 107 for the seols now just seven seven points away from the record make it sixa Ladson already owns 52o games this season make it six now with the 21o performance here tonight there only 13o performance thus far when she went off on the Rival Florida Gator with 35 in Gainesville had seven such games last season but it is a much more is much more than just t lson on this seminal team a lot of weapons at Brook wops disposal shot from Hamilton again cant connect with the rim Ladson right back the other way Turnage shell Drive kick out to Ladson pull up three little too short State team rebounding cars and Hamilton there to Music collect Applause Hornets a shot Off the Mark by Music Dunn fre to Freeman Jackson still looking on been hard to watch for her Hornets but knows that if taken the right way they will certainly build off of this as much as they can try to get stronger as they are closing in on conference play like we said only one more nonconference a challenge out of the Miami Hurricanes and Coral Gables for this calendar year is over less than a minute to go another ball shot missed acreage with it but here comes Ladson easy layup underneath now its 110 points only four away from the record but I dont know if theres going to be enough time for the seals to tie that record heres Music dun shot from Beyond is Hamilton for long two Hil Florida State how aggressive do they want to be if at all I think that will be it I think told Deni Ladson no I think its a mercy at this point and thats a welcome sign for Alabama state but an absolutely dominating performance for the seal to round out and finish conference Play Seal at their ninth win of the season a final of 110 45
