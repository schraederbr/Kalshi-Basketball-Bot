22 59 this is just the 10th meeting all time between these two great programs just the second time it has happened here in Durham Duke won back in 1990 in the only previous meeting and Arizona with a quick two Ballo on the slam Umar Balo has really improved his running of the floor in the last two years last year he combined with the julus tubelis this year hes the focal point inside Tyrese Proctor at the point one freshman in the starting line of for Duke thats him with the ball Jared McCain to a wide openen Mark Mitchell who missed the Dartmouth game with an ankle injury but back in there to start this game tonight and Arizona gets the ball down the floor so quickly transition defense is going to be vital hella Larson with a strong drive and a terrific start for the Wildcats Arizona came out throwing Haymakers in this game and they expected to and pel Larson I believe is Arizonas best player scored 15 in their season opener Jeremy roach the kick filipowski wide open misses the three duke is the smaller team the glass and the paint are going to decide this game and a foul on Balo is he and Philipi not surprisingly getting physical down in the paint balos a rim Runner he goes from one end to the other right under the rim to start out of possession John shy second year as the head coach here at his Alma M of course outstanding years becoming the the first coach ever to both win to win an ACC tournament Championship as both a player and a head coach and when undefeated at home last year in his first year as Dukes head coach hes not suffered a loss yet in this building as head coach Mitchell on the drive this time knocked Away by Kesha Johnson McCain gets it back and Mitchell lays it in well what a pass by Jared McCain more contact attacked inside they play on and back come the Blue Devils in transition the pullup three a little bit strong for Tyrese Proctor and a call going against Philip howski thats the kind of foul that filipowski has to avoid couldnt get the rebound he grabbed and you dont want to get give that up what a fantastic pass through traffic just threading a needle for the Freshman Jared McCain 63 from Sacramento part of the second ranked class in the the country Jared McCain the only starter we will see we likely will see all three others including KB Foster a freshman from Harrisburg North Carolina who had a really nice debut against Dartmouth McCains got his hands full guarding Larson kylin Boswell just 18 years of age reclassified last year played as a 17yearold but now hes got the keys to the car here in his second year yeah he does not look like an 18yearold he is strong Compact and he really got his defender on his hip but he did shoot a two Duke was able to get him off the threepoint line hes an excellent threepoint shooter K CA has moved on hes a mountaineer right now so Boswell and here its the starting point guard spot filipowski for three filipowski can roll off that pick and roll or he can pop and pel Larson had to pick him up just couldnt get enough pressure on him for the shot first touch I believe there for Caleb love and he didnt have it Long heot Johnson the transfer from San Diego State a little bit strong on the jump hook well he was going against Jeremy roach off a switch and roach made him shoot over the top stayed in front of him and then roach shooting over the top but he missed the three and look at Johnson getting down the court gets back his own Miss and has it rejected by Mark Mitchell Mark Mitchell is a Difference Maker did not play in the opening game against Dartmouth did not play in the NCAA tournament game against Tennessee but the lefthander is an outstanding Defender timed that beautifully even with contact to block that shot by the San Diego State transfer kead Johnson first sub of the game as zumar Balo has gone to the bench and 72 freshman mius crevis from Lithuania has checked in number 14 in blue for the Wildcats as Caleb love turns it over its too much dribbling for love along the Baseline there was nothing there hes played in this building three times hes played well in this building also had the great game against Duke in the final four a couple of years ago but boy The Crazies were waiting for him tonight werent they McCain and it rattles out rebound Johnson boy it wont show up in the Box Score but kead Johnson did a terrific job of Health defense there on that that little Drive Larsson a Miss back comes Duke roach cant turn the corner filipowski scrambles after it now Mitchell good matchup with Johnson and a foul called on Kad Johnson third year down in Tucson for Tommy Lloyd after a 20 run is Mark fuse lead assistant up in Spokan and an alltime record 61 wins Jay in his first two years as the head coach well both Tommy Lloyd and John shy are the two brightest young coaches in the country both are excellent recruiters tacticians and I was at practice for both teams yesterday and I think Arizona does as good a job as anybody of taking a scouting report and communicating it to the team so they can act upon on it positively in the game one of the first things one of the first phone calls John shy got after he got the job was from Tommy Lloyd saying hey you want to play us and they turned it into a home and Home Series Duke will be in Tucson at the mcale center November 21st of next year two of the great Arenas in college basketball Cameron and mcale and love seeing matchups like this love into crous knocked Away by McCain touch pass by McCain knocked Away by Boswell boy they are all over the place what a great catch by crous but couldnt hang on to it deep three by Boswell and into the hands of roach and thats what Dukes going to have to do against Arizona gang rebound Larson kept it alive and now lson commits the foul knocking roach down our first timeout of the game and we got a good one bruan tied at six early more things change the more they remain the same and that coincides with the story of Caleb love and his return to this historic building where the name has changed on his jersey however his will to win against his particular team Remains the Same he said that I have a different sense of Freedom with this team but he said heroics is not what Im looking for but going back to the final four we saw the heroics 28 points a dagger three and Id be remiss if I didnt mention he also had 22 points in the spoiler game against Duke right here to give Coach K his last lost year so I know that for Caleb love he said its about the team but mostly weve seen the heroics from him in the past angel thank you great to have you with us Mark Mitchell gives Duke the lead so Caleb love with a couple of big big games against Duke in Mike shashys last year as the head coach of the Blue Devils Arizona going with a smaller lineup P Larsson at the four and Mitchells everywhere right now Jay you talked about it What A Difference Maker he can be oo and a block is called on pel Larsson thats going to be two on lson right Larsson the primary Defender just trying to maintain legal guarding position and stay in front but looked like Mitchell just got past him a bit to draw that foul but Larson is such a a versatile player hes having to come out with that second foul plays both ends of the floor outstanding passer terrific shooter was the Pack 12 six man of the year two years ago could have won it last year but he started seven games and it kind of took him out of it poor planning on his part so so hes gone to the bench maybe for a long time Jaden Bradley a transfer from Alabama is into the game and also a very talented freshman KJ Lewis number five for Arizona from El Paso Texas and we mentioned coach Kay and for just the second time Jay since he retired he is here watching again game at Cameron he came to the Notre Dame game last year Mike Brays last trip as Notre Dame coach to Cameron and Proctor in and out and out of bounds to the Applause cats Arizona with this small lineup it is not unusual for Tommy Lloyd to go small they had a one of the bigger lineups in the country last year with the julus tubelis numar balow but that was probably 50 of their minutes this is Lewis spent a couple of years in grade school in Tucson grew up an Arizona fan but spent his high school years in Texas now Bradley gets his man in the air misses the shot crevis and it goes down to tie the game crous has such great hands hes going to be a really good player makes tough catches very skilled can score with either hand around the basket and really for the the key for Duke in guarding Arizona is make Arizona take tough contested nonpaint twos Grievous laying off of young whos not going to shoot the three he looking for somebody to pass to Arizona has a defense where they lay off non shooting big guys and crous will just clog the lane What a fine there from Proctor to young but through his hands out of bounds still Duke ball with just two on the shot clock and with crous in the middle of the lane thats why filipowski coming in for young right now theyre going to have to guard filipowski and thatll open up the lane with crous in the middle it takes away cutting and driving lanes for Duke now with filipowski out there he can stretch that defense of cras has to go out and get him roach had to get the shot off hit the side of the backboard and thats a shot clock violation now take a look at crous right in the middle of the lane hes guarding Ryan young and hes up by the three point line well you cant cut and get anything in the lane just really smart theyve done that ever since Tommy Lloyds been at Arizona its really effective defensive strategy against non shooting big guys Bradley turns the corner off the glass and good Arizona by two Bradley transferred from Alabama McDonalds allamerican and he can really drive the ball nice find filipowski to Proctor prevous down for the rebound what a good Outlet pass to get out and run little stutter step by Bradley and then he dribbled it out of bounds fifth turnover already committed by the Wildcats Bradleys not a great shooter yet but he can get by people and get to the rim and that was a difficult to but he made it but he can get all the way to the rim and get fouled great match up at the point Boswell Proctor two young guys who both reclassified last year Boswells only 18 Proctors 19 floater by roach will go and thatll tie the game but youve got two of the most talented young point guards in the country in these two in this game well Proctors an NBA prospect that is a projected first round pick and Boswell has really improved he had a great end to last season good pass Balo cant get it to go Jeremy roach very dangerous in the midrange what a great pass beautiful bounce pass into filipowski boy how good of a day was it for Duke fans when Kyle filipowski said Im coming back and healthier this year right double hip surgery in the off season the Layin will go for Lewis and he got knocked down as well it is tied at 12 you ask we deliver Jay bis 94 ft with Tommy Lloyd coming back what an honor that disturbs me a little bit well it disturbs a lot of people yeah what was your first car my first car was in 1978 mint green Fiat Bravo nice how about yours still runs great you tell me huh yeah it runs great uh 1984 butterscotch Brown Ford Mustang hatchback butterscotch Brown Scotch putting brown baby again playing off young and thats Umar Balo in the middle thats even bigger to clog that lane pass deflected and its Arizona ball a quiet start for Caleb love hes attempted just one shot so far but hes got to get something off a ball reversal good look for Johnson in the corner and hell bury it but hes going to be a big factor Kad Johnson for this team he is from Oakland California and did a great job for Brian Dutcher at San Diego State but he can he can guard one through five and a lot of guys say they can guard that but he can really do it now hes guarding Caleb Foster a one McCain back to foster two freshmen in the game at the same time in the back court for the Blue Devils and a very SC rambly possession here for Duke and its going to be a shot clock violation if Arizona can get a piece of the paint turn the corner as KJ Lewis does right here filipowski goes in trying to protect that paint and just an easy kick out to a standstill shooter Kad Johnson in the corner but what a defensive possession for Arizona they forced Duke to to dribble and not pass and they dribbled out the shot clock and their staff has the feeling this could be and when you think Arizona you think pace and running the floor and offense but theyve got a chance to be a pretty good defensive team this year dont they I think theyre going to be very good they are much deeper and theyre athletic Johnson again not this time and filipowski down with another Applause Rebound with this lineup they can switch everything on the perimeter McCain who is a terrific shooter knocks down a midrange jumper to bring Duke back within one hes so compact with the way he plays always down in a stance just impacts winning McDonalds AllAmerican and the Gatorade Player of the Year in California last year love turns the corner into Johnson and did they get McCain and I think mcain got called for the foul well theres the biggest Arizona Wildcat basketball f fan I know that is Terry Francona threetime manager of the year hes headed to Cooperstown as well as soon as he figures out how to get there theyre going to let him in as as soon as they can Ive been on driving trips with him its an adventure but he absolutely loves Arizona he lives down in Tucson he goes to every game that he can has never seen a game here at Cameron but he found his way here to Durham to see his beloved Wildcats play tonight oh Caleb love is known for the threepoint shots he puts up but when he decides hes going to drive it gave it a little shot fake to Tyrese Proctor he is very dangerous in the lane hes such a good free throw shooter he should strive to get fouled six seven times a game how do you think he has changed or it benefits him or however you want to phrase it you know getting a change to Scenery three years in Chapel Hill now playing for Arizona well I mean I I think this system fits him very well hes just a really good player and and you know I dont know what happened last year in Chapel Hill why the hatar hills didnt play better but I know at his best Caleb love is a truly outstanding player originally transferred to Michigan but Michigan would not accept all of his credit so he had to open it up again and went down to Arizona and hes going to be more off the ball Boswell the primary point guard love probably wont handle the ball as much as he did as a tarheel McCain it wont go Arizona ball as we go down to Angel gray go guys going back to what you were mentioning about Caleb love and what this is how this is different for him at Arizona he just briefly mentioned to me Im playing more free he had a smile on his face when he said that as well not having to be the hero but Tommy Lloyd on him he said hes pretty toughminded built for the attention they can go and play good basketball and in a good game without him playing out of his mind he said weve given given him the gift of coming in and getting settled and I feel like hes done that angel thank you and one of the odds that his second game in an Arizona uniform would be back here in ACC country well Im sure his phone has been blowing up ever since he got back in the state of North Carolina Duke ball after the official stalked it over Ron gruver Doug serans Andrian oconnell the officiating crew here tonight Philip palowski being guarded by ballow he needs to put him in some ball screen Applause situations Applause out of bounds still Duke ball and the Freshman McCain is going to inbound it Jaylen Blakes is in the game for Duke he played extremely well in their opening game win against Dartmouth scored the ball defends three steals in limited minutes both of these teams Jay it feels like have a chance to be pretty deep and you know if the coaches use all of that depth sometimes you pair it down the rotation as the season goes along but they both both got a lot of options yeah especially depending on Personnel theyre playing against absolutely out of bounds to Arizona but right now Arizonas having to make decisions because Tommy Lloyd has to protect pel Larson hes got those two fouls the question is when do you bring him back do you wait till the second half hes a veteran player love a little discard there to free himself up for a shot but couldnt knock it down was good physical defense forcing love to take a really difficult two Mitchells been assertive in this game too strong on that one and Lewis the rebound Bo Keesha Johnson is such a good Defender What A Catch and a foul is called it should send crevis to the free throw line great bounce pass great catch by the big fella in traffic 756 to go in the first half Arizona by three hes got seven points three rebounds on the pick and pop knocks down a three and then the pick and roll rolling into the baskets is a beautiful pocket pass from Jeremy roach and then the tough two over Umar balow but this is his second foul here both of filipowski fouls could have easily been avoided one was a defensive rebound just a grab and then that in transition but John shy leaving filipowski in the game a lot of coaches will take a a really good player out as Tommy Lloyd did with pel Larson when he got his second and tried to save him for the second half but John Shire going to trust Kyle filipowski not to pick up his third before the half meanwhile Arizona now with a fourpoint lead crous makes the first one of two freshman from Lithuania on this Arizona roster the other one polyus morus a 68 forward we have not seen him yet but uh hes going to be a part of their rotation this year thats for sure I think when Arizona gets the ball back theyve got to go right at filipowski prous with a rejection and Arizona in transition led by love who has it taken away now its Dukes turn to run McCain yes Bo then got a foul on Lewis just laying into filipowski what a turnaround because a Tyrese Proctors Applause hands Arizona had a break Proctor takes it away from love and then McCain taking it the other way just running to the threepoint line could have dumped it off to filipowski then Lewis just laid right into filipowski and now Kyle filipowski going to go to the free throw line try to make this a fivepoint Play What a turnaround yeah its the seventh foul on Arizona so now Duke is into the bonus the second foul on Applause Lewis lets go down to Angel D you mentioned how Kyle filipowski had the surgery on both of his hips to shave them down to allow him to be more flexible and bendy but associate head coach Jay Lucas said I nicknamed the sophomore twoip flip in the off season which he says has helped tremendously as as far as his concept coming into this ball game but I talked to Kyle before the game he said the journey to get back to this point was long and arduous he told me there was about a twomonth stretch where he couldnt move without assistance off of the couch so he consistently working on his mindset said he couldnt do it without the staff and team more explosive more confident in his ability to be explosive and he was pretty good last year playing with a couple of bad hips Johnson no and cras giv Arizona some good minutes gets back the loose ball now hes looking for help and throws it out of bounds off of Christian Reeves and Angel gra point now Kyle filipowski able to play painfree I think he said after the game against Dartmouth it was the first time that he could remember that he wasnt thinking about being in pain when he was playing kind of crazy cuz he was pretty good last year playing in pain love looking to get going misses the runner and Caleb love just one for four two points so far even though this Duke team is small in the back court playing a three guard lineup they can put pressure on the ball theyre making it difficult on Arizona right now love from the Baseline and Arizona back on top was coming off that little staggered screen when Caleb love gets its feet said he is a really good shooter its when he tries to get his own that sometimes he takes some off balance ones cuz he can make contested shots Proctor from the elbow nicely done and its tied again and that was against a really good Defender impella Larson so Larsson back in playing with a couple of fouls what a fake Ras got Reaves in the air twice but couldnt convert and hes really good with that left hand around the basket Tommy Lloyd says hes better with the left than the right and hes righthanded back out to Proctor eight assists one turnover in the season opener against Dartmouth had a terrific freshman season especially in the back half of it the second half up top and its slammed home by Reeds the 7 to1 sophomore from Charlotte really good minutes by Christian Reeves who played spare in ly last year but will be a much bigger part of the team this year love again prevous another rebound puts it home and hes fouled how about that rebound and putback how quick he was getting back Applause up now coming up Tuesday what a night here on ESPN the State Farm Champions classic Duke in Michigan State in the first game Kentucky in Kansas in the night cap and then to bring it all together the college football playoff top 25 ranking show boy Reese looks good doesnt he he always looks good was that a rhetorical question it was kind of well ree just texted me and said dont I look good how much fun is the Champions classic we see Duke again against Michigan State uh the Spartans with an early loss would bounce back with a win there one and one and then Kentucky in Kansas just one of the great nights on the college basketball calendar with kead Johnson had an initial putback opportunity but then Boswell almost tip dunked that in got fouled look at this play by creas that that is just a great play Not only to position himself and push Reeves onto the basket and get the rebound but to go back up that quickly get fouled and make it look at the rebounding difference on offensive glass 10 to zero and thats where the size of Dukes guards can be an issue Duke is going to have to gang a rebound even though they beat Dartmouth handily they barely outrebounded them so this is obviously going to be an early season talking point for these Blue Devils well the keys the keys in this game are protect the paint and win the battle of the glass youre talking about for both teams or for two specific both te both teams Proctor for three long rebound to Roach McCain for three and Boswell down with it for Arizona Arizonas guards get down there and rebound they get their noses dirty and help out Larson yes in Arizona leads by four just a smart drive by lson he knew that young was going to have to be on the high side against balow and balow just shielded him off and it was an easy path to the Applause basket young steps in kicks it out nice shot fake floater by Proctor wow will go and one what a great shot fake and drive ballow comes over from the weak side just a beautiful shot fake little floater got hit by ballow after he let it go thats a big time play by Tyrese Proctor and number two on ballow and he is coming Applause out so look at how small Arizona is right now the biggest guys theyve got on the court are Johnson and lson that means Larsons going to have to go to the four and hell be guarding Applause Mitchell Arizonas going to have to combat their size Advantage with this lineup with pressure Boswell aggressively into the paint and Banks it home well how about the way he turned the corner and got into the paint and the body balance on that shot thats an 18yearold yeah Im loving this point guard match up Proctor and Boswell two terrific players what are they going to do when they grow up young trying to muscle his way in but he walked well that just shows what a great defender the Kad Johnson is you know stayed between Young and the basket didnt go for any fakes and wound up getting a turnover out of just solid defense by Kad Johnson Boswell for three way too strong and its out of bounds in Duke ball 186 to Commerce early yeah Commerce they absolutely could not guard the basketball or guard the three they got it going a little bit right there Antonio Reeves coming back knocking down that big three theyve settled into the game but it has not been pretty for the wild cats thats not Kansas theyre playing no doubt Commerce joined D1 just two years ago well take you through all the Friday night college basketball coming up at the half Dan back to you coach thank you very much well see Kentucky as you mentioned against Kansas Tuesday out of the Champions theyre dealing with some injuries right now Jay they are uh short on some bigs right now now so theyre going to have a bit of a different look to them but they when they decide they want to guard especially their guards boy Kentucky can be special on the defensive end before this seasons over was that deflected it was not its Duke ball just a miscommunication Jaden Bradley cut when pel Larson thought he was going to Applause stay roach defended by Lewis into the paint the pullup still loose what a play Boswell kept it alive Lewis into Jaden Bradley and hes got to kick it out and Boswell will bury the three Welly Jaden Bradley drew a crowd and was able to kick it out to a wide openen Boswell but how about Boswell getting on the floor for that loose ball Boswell nine points three rebounds a couple of assists and a steal already in this one not giving up any second shots young got his own missed again young usually so efficient around the basket and youre right theyre just not biting on any of the moves or The Fakes Johnson inside and Arizonas up to a sixpoint lead timeout Blue Devils Arizona just putting their head down and getting to the rim to draw the defense just running up and down getting easy layups as you talked about there theyre digging in there tonight they this has been a gritty performance by the Wildcats well Jaden Bradley draws a crowd three duke Defenders around him he just kicks it back out to kylin Boswell wide open step in three and a beautiful drive along the Baseline by Lewis just drops it off to Kad Johnson and John shy has to call a timeout remember Jaden Bradley when he played at Alabama just as a freshman was second on that team and assists they got a lot of weapons thats for sure Arizona picked to win the Pack 12 Duke picked to win the ACC first time in 10 years these two programs have met and again theyll meet again in Tucson next Applause year roor wants a screen from filipowski keeps the dribble Applause alive the three over crevis is short and Johnson down with another rebound thats a tough shot step back almost as an afterthought over the outstretched arm of crous whos 72 I like when they say you know hes a legit 72 as if being 71 isnt yeah that hes a legit 72 and hes all of that LE Baseline off to crevis boy and he had a chippy that would have made it an eightpoint game he just didnt go up right away it just hesitated a bit but Duke is giving up the paint a little bit too easily Grievous got turned around lost track of filipowski who makes him pay anytime filipowski is in any sort of ball screen situation you know he can pop that makes it difficult and he can roll and crous just got a little bit twisted up the ball went past his ear and then he winds up putting filipowski on the line for a threepoint play possibility number two on crous the reaction you hear is Caleb love coming back in the game for Applause Arizona and its filipowski whos already got 11 points in this game at the line and hes earned every one of them this has been a physical first half Applause prevous draws the double team finds Johnson what a cut Duke didnt rotate down they went with the double they call it fire and go to double the post you dont want to let it out ballside but you certainly dont want to let that little drop off pass in the lane be executed boy what a great pickup Kad Johnson is after getting all the way to the national championship game with San Diego State a year ago Proctor nowhere to go good help by cras and then he still was able to recover to filipowski he is talented Mitchell love got all of that and its another shot clock violation on the Blue Devils well Arizona is just busting their tails on the defensive end great block by Caleb love and the shot clock goes to Applause zero six turnovers committed by Duke and three of them have been shot clock violations and right now 30 second timeout here in the final minute of the first half BN produced by film 45 and directed by awardwinning Joey jacobe the documentary is an intimate and compelling look into WNBA Superstar Parkers journey through basketball and life in her own words you wont want to miss it and I wont miss it but but did she take your autobiography title there you wouldnt you wouldnt Laughter Unapologetic right now Arizona going even smaller Pella Larson back in bodies flying Proctor down Larson down 4 second difference between the game clock and the shot clock so they can take it all the way down and still have time for a tip in love for three in and out Larson left it short and a foul going against Arizona looks like they got Johnson yep number two on Keesha Johnson hes got a surprised look on his face just short Im not sure whether Larsson was passing it to that just looked like rebounding to Applause me its still going to give Arizona if Dukes able to Christian Reeves even able to knock this down Arizonas got a chance to get it down court and get all the way to the rim with 49 what can Reeves bring to the Blue Devils this year well hes got size he can protect the rim and he can be a lob threat know good length and he hes given really good minutes in this Applause game one of two theyve got four seconds love gets it off and hits it he banked it home at the buzzer and gives Arizona points to zero for Duke and then the 103 run at the end of the half just the second game of the season for each team and love seeing these kinds of matchups early on in the season filipowski surrounded forces it up and in boy a strong move against a double team by Philip hsky and he wanted a foul bow brought that arm down but wasnt called just an excellent strong play by Kyle filipowski he had 25 against Dartmouth hes got 13 so far here tonight when Jared McCain get getting down to defensive rebound its going to have to be a fivan job for Duke on the defensive glass shot faked by roach and knocked away cleanly back comes Arizona love Baseline into the chest of filipowski for a charge our first chance to talk about the new uh rule or the way they are interpreting the block charge call this year yeah it used to be you had that you had to be set before the offensive player left the floor now you have to be set before his plant foot his last foot is planted on the floor much tougher to take a charge right it is much tougher but it looked like filipowski was there you like the change in the rule I think its fantastic absolutely lets go down to Angel gray yeah I was able to catch up with Coach shy and I asked him about the adjustments he said theres adjustments to be made on both both ends to the of the floor offensively first he said I dont like how were playing ISO ball we need to play together they do have the six assist on 13 made field goals but of course he mentioned theyre out dominating us on the glass we have to rebound it has to be important it has to be a priority both trips down the floor they got an interior touch guys angel thank you do you consider rebounding in general to be a strength that well see from Arizona this year and in general will it be something that John shy and Company really have to be focused on this year yes youre here at Cameron Larson hampered by foul trouble in the first half knocked out of bounds still Arizona ball that was a kick ball so it goes to 20 and itll be Boswell to windbound got to watch Caleb love coming off a stagger here B trying to back down filipowski and he does boy that was just strength from Umar Balo he just backed him in and nobody came with the double team they decided to let filipowski go oneonone in the post and he just got backed down Ballo started off at Gonzaga of course really came into his own last year filipowski with the answer for three at the other end hes got 16 now the double team the deflection Balo will finish the assist to Boswell what a play by kylin Boswell that ball was about to go the other way and he shot in front got the ball and then dropped it off the ballow great play by Boswell will not turn 19 till after this season is over bodies are flying in this thing filipowski got knocked down its five on four and Larson takes advantage with a three pel Larson is an outstanding basketball player yeah he plays every facet of this game well 65 senior from Sweden transferred to Arizona from Utah McCain open rattles out Bo McCain is a goodlooking player filipowski takes it away just not a good pass by Caleb love nothing there filipowski all the way and lays it in with a left hand tough for Umar balow to guard him in space Johnson with a tough catch banging with McCain and McCain takes it away Proctor back to McCain is this any fun this is the way basketballs supposed to be a turnover Larson and Balo cant connect and its back to Applause Duke McCain with a great job just staying in front of the bigger and stronger keyot Johnson gives it up early gets it back and finishes turning defense into offense and the question now how is Arizona going to respond after getting punched here McCain again and Balo deflected it and caral it Larsson into Balo to Strong good challenge up top but what a catch off that pass by lson Mitchell and out of bounds off his leg 4 minutes and 9 seconds into the second half the pace of anything has picked up Arizona still in front Lorraines granddaughter Ava who has committed to play tennis here at Duke just like her big brothers Jake and Connor do congratulations to the whole family to Sherry and their parents who were both athletes at Notre Dame Dicky V is about as proud a grandpa as there is and Jake and Conor going to have their little sister alongside here at Duke playing tennis starting next year that is awesome fourpoint lead Arizona Lewis no out of bounds and it belongs to Duke even on that Drive Lewis having to finish with the left hand essentially going away from the basket over Mitchell well hes a good looking basketball Applause player love on Proctor right now a rare moment where Boswell is not in the game for the Wildcats Duke trying to run more things out of the middle of the floor good play by Jeremy roach just go right into cras to pick up that foul but you run things in the middle of the floor its a little more difficult on a basket cut to give help and Jared McCains taking advantage of it it opens some things up number three on mius crevis who has given Tommy Lloyd some very good minutes tonight just his second Collegiate game and he comes up with a steal oh good feat by crous to get in front and knock that pass away not a great pass by Mitchell but great defense by cras you know you see a guy his size a freshman and maybe theres an assumption is he is he a project is he raw hes none of that Grievous is a player and what a beautiful cut by KJ Lewis back to six and that is a block lson coming over and maybe last year thats a charge this year thats a block three on lson this terrific Hands by cras to take that away and then Bradley does a good job of playing off of two feet and a great weak side cut to the basket to make himself available by KJ Lewis Larson by the way has gone to the bench again number three he has really been Limited in his minutes tonight Arizona doing a nice job of switching on that out of bounds good ball movement and roach left wide open at the top of the key Caleb love went for the steel didnt get it the reversal led to a wideopen three roach really coming into his own as a scorer last year what a finish by kha Johnson right in the chest of filipowski well just pick and roll on the open side and a beautiful pass but What A Catch and finish by kot Johnson 67 dunking over a Applause sevenfooter now the sevenfooter knocks down down to three hes got 21 boy thats a lot to ask for cras to have to guard the dribble and then recover out to a threepoint shooter in filipowski Love no Proctor fouled by Applause Lewis pal filipowski sets that little screen just pops back and cras has to guard Jeremy Rose Co to try to take away that drive and then recover out to filipowski but keyot Johnson the transfer from San Diego State he had 14 points in the championship game against Yukon last year boy that is a big time finish over Kyle filipowski what a game we got here in Durham twopoint lead for the Wildcats Proctor using the screen deflected Johnson got a piece of it and Boswells got it boy Johnsons his impact is both ends of the floor Applause kickball and we got a shoelace issue for kylin Boswell tying up his shoe for a moment as is now for the first time tonight Shan Stewart a freshman from windamir Florida another part of this highly thought of recruiting class ranked number 19 on the ESPN 100 into the game for the first time and Stewart is a spectacular athlete a standing vertical of 36 in Breaking Zion Williamsons Duke record of 352 and he gets up even higher when hes moving Boswell takes a bump and its down to Stewart hes got the rebound but Duke doing a better job in this second half of defensive rebounding roach aim yes it is TI roach is so good in the midrange love dribbles it off his foot and its Duke ball over the year years it has seemed like Jeremy roach when Duke needs a basket he can get into the lane and make something happen excellent body control hes just got a an outstanding pullup Applause game Jeremy roach went over a th career points in this game and I dont know whos going to get credit for that I think Stewart either way Duke hasard first lead since it was 5 23 and a foul on the floor look like they got Music filipowski keot Johnson at inside position here and it looked like he knocked it in well maybe Stewart got it from behind him but thats the athleticism of Sean Stewart Mitchell on Boswell got two on the ball they cant take advantage Bradley cut off on the Baseline finds Balo left it a little short Mitchell the rebound Mitchell took a shot but still he made balow take a tough two roach the kick good fake Proctor still going and has it taken away what Hands by Bradley and the finish at the other end to Tire well I thought Bradley might give that up to Boswell but he made the smarter play by just going right into the chest of the defender and getting that lefthanded finish that was a big time play by Jaden Bradley Caleb Foster in the game for Duke its like a heavyweight fight yeah Balo and an offensive foul ballow had the opportunity to just shoot over the top but just ran Stewart over but what a great steal here by Jaden Bradley looking to anybody watching this game were sure youre enjoying it as much as we are it is a good one just as we had hoped its tied at 54 nine ties seven lead changes Dan scholman Jay bil is Angel gray with you here at Cameron Indoor Stadium and there is a long way to go in this one and foul issues could be a deciding factor in this filipowski has three Kad Johnson has three pel Larsson Umar balow yeah Duke in better shape relatively speaking than Arizona that pass deflected off the backboard Johnson has it and Arizona looking to run if they can Arizonas pressure is excellent good pass Larson the Bobble and the kick to Bradley and LS time Larsson has an excellent shot fake six to shoot Boswell with filipowski on him the step back three how about this guy well he shot the ball toward the end of last season so well and hes continued it into this season theres a lot of dribbling on that possession but when you have a player like kylin Boswell that can make an individual play at the end of a clock thats a luxury filipowski having to work hard good defense by Kesha Johnson yeah he forced that one but Johnson made him take it now Balo remember Philip Houses got three and now itll be Steward called for the foul Duke wanted to come with the double but bow made a quick move and the double couldnt get there bow with the little pick and roll they had a switch just a little step back by Boswell thats a big time play can I throw some numbers at you Im not going to listen but do whatever you want 12 points six rebounds four assists two steals a block no turnovers for kylin Boswell thats a good line wow that is a good stat line and hes not Applause done roll for B how about the Improvement of Umar balow when he was at Gonzaga youre wondering how long is his development going to take you he transfers to Arizona Tommy Lloyd got who knew him he recruited him to Gonzaga and got him in much better condition and I know playing with the julus telis I mean if you play with that guy youre going to learn how to run yeah and now hes running the floor hes playing extended minutes he was the MVP of the Maui Invitational last year just spectacular development yeah he really went from playing sparingly in his first year to a rotation guy in his second year to a star in his third year cant finish this one and its Duke ball well you bring that ball down Arizona doesnt look to just pressure you theyre trying to take it from you here are the statistical improvements for Umar balow over the last 3 years he basically doubled everything up from 20122 to the 2023 season Mitchell for three and nobody on the glass for Duke Balor did a nice job of recovering late how about the pass Boswell to Balo and one the question is who did they call it on was it on filipowski or met they gave it to Applause Mitchell Villanova back healthy and Villanova is a top 20 team Kyle Neptune has a good squad coming back missed free throw Balo looking for the threepoint play Arizona by six Duke ball and right now keyot Johnson guarding filipowski when hes out setting those screens but they got a switch now filipowski being guarded by Boswell into the chest of ballow it wont go but its tipped up and in by Mitchell and when ballow had to come over from the weak side that opened up the offensive glass Johnson with a reverse Duke ball boy the length of Mitchell inside makes it really difficult to finish over him that was a big difference last year when Duke played Tennessee in the second round of the tournament Mitchell was injured didnt play and Duke got knocked out in the second round last year Arizona got knocked out in the first round by Princeton as Proctor buries one from the corner and all of a sudden its a onepoint game Dukes ball movement in the second half has gotten much better theyre getting a piece of the paint and then playing out of it and Arizonas had a tougher time getting into the paint theyve gotten some post touches here comes the double great help by roach to take it away boy it looked open but roach closed that door in a hurry and once again the Blue Devils come down the court looking for the lead and Duke using both sides of the floor Mitchell swatted Away by ballow gets it back and lson down with it for the Wildcats and Larson can get it and and go he can rip and run on his own and Tommy Lloyd wants a timeout 744 to go heated battle here with Cameron Arizona by one as meanwhile here onepoint game Arizona on top Duke has made a couple of runs Arizonas weathered the storm Duke keeps coming back it has been everything we had hoped it would be and in the second half Dukes done a better job Protec ing its paint and theyve done a much better job on their defensive glass not giving up as many Second Chance opportunities to Arizona love guarded by filipowski after a switch turned it over roach almost lost it almost lost it into the back court but Duke retains possession it looked like Caleb love was just trying to draw contact from filipowski felt like he had an advantage Jay love now three for nine seven points hes got six turnovers in this game another good rebound by Pella Larson they swing it to Boswell 10 to shoot Arizonas got to get more weak side cuts theres the high low with the pressure it takes it away so lson launches a three and buries it he is a player he defends he rebounds good passer and you leave him open hes going to knock a shot down P Larson is going to play in the NBA I agree fourpoint lead Wildcats filipowski the hand off to McCain little Runner tipped out by Young still loose and out of bounds Duke ball well kylin Boswell really goes after loose balls if its long or its loose hes going to get it Hot Potato Hot Potato right both teams just Applause scrapping right now appella Larson having to guard Kyle filipowski and filipowski needs to take him down into the post roach onepoint game just a miscommunication between Lewis and lson Lewis picked up filipowski and Larsson felt like hey man I got him and he was late recovering to Jeremy Roach prevous to love bouns pass Lewis got it back and a whistle and a foul on the floor against Ryan Music young Jeremy roach set a little upscreen to get Kyle filipowski in the post and Larson felt like he had him but Lewis called switch and lson was late getting out there and he gave a an earful to Lewis right afterwards saying I had him man stick with your guy roach now with a dozen as you can see eight of them in the second half Arizona ball after the foul on young neither team love into the paint bounce pass inside creis comes up with a rebound needs some help and he turned it over on a travel just switched his pivot feet but what a catch by crous inside and thats the kind of play that Caleb love needs to make get into the paint draw multiple Defenders crous just couldnt get it up off the glass just bobbl a little bit and watch he change this pivot foot here because of the pressure and the officials right on it to make the call that is the 17th turnover committed by Arizona Duke has turned it over 12 times crous to the bench bow back in HHA Johnson has returned as well and Duke is convered off those turnovers theyve got A plus six Advantage 18 to 12 in points off turnovers Proctor roach Baseline reverse Balo got it boy what a great hesitation move by Jeremy roach but ballow just erased it Larson ballow lays it in Arizona by three and Dan that was set up by pel larssons shot fake just gave a shot fake got into the lane able to dump it off the ballow on the cut beautiful play by pel Larsson a couple of extra passes too by other Wildcats who could have taken a shot Johnson with an impressive block on Philip hsky and if Johnson didnt get it balow was going to Bow coming and blocking that was a great hesitation move and then on the other end great shot fake to get into the lane draws filipowski up and then ballow finishes off the cut with the left hand just really good basketball by Arizona 428 to go here in Durham Arizona by three out and at least at the moment Boswell not on the court well you wouldnt be surprised if there were some cramping issues with as hard as these players are playing and kylin Boswell has been outstanding in this game hes got 12 points eight rebounds hes the leading rebounder in the game and five assists with only one turnover Proctor gets it into filipowski howd that pass get through and that is a strong Rebound in traffic by Johnson Bo he went after it with two hands he contested the shot and still turned around to get up for that rebound Kad Johnsons having a terrific game Larsson Balo guarded by Young jump hook short young doing a nice job of just making him shoot over roach the kick Proctor the three boy you cant ask for a much better look than that itll stay with Duke now Dukes ball movement has been much better in the second half than the first I think Angel gray was saying that you know a little too much ISO ball in the first half John Shire told her but this second half theyve moved the ball much more effectively Proctor inbounding it right in front of Mike Shashi who is here in person watching the game tonight filipowski up and in and its a onepoint Game Boy strong Drive didnt look like either lson or balow wanted to pick up a foul there Larson such a good decision maker the missed three though by Jaden Bradley hes the guy getting Boswells minutes right now with a Boswell on the bench with some sort of a leg injury it appears maybe a cramping situation as we mentioned young back out to filipowski they got lots of time probably a good decision by filipowski could have gone over lson but just reset it Proctor filipowski got knocked down by Larson Here Comes Arizona Bradley coast to coast and he draws the foul it just took a little bump by Proctor to pick up that foul just couldnt finish it boy Arizona gets a rebound and they are gone you know filipowski was on the deck that put Duke a man down but this team can run High ell getting ready to check back in so thats great news for the Wildcats probably for Bradley whos the free throw shooter missed it and it is for Bradley Boswell still at the scorers table were you the kind of player that when there was somebody at the scores table you intentionally missed your second one so you can stay in no I accidentally missed all the time missed them both boy so they dont get any points and they dont get Boswell back into the game Applause Proctor up top Johnson guarding filipowski and he can guard him on the perimeter and inside McCain and its knocked out by love so it is still Duke ball with 4 seconds on the shot clock Caleb love doing a nice job with help defense and he went after the ball it went off him but he was disruptive on that drive Boswell back Applause in tough pass not a lot of room down there and Arizona switching all these screens because of the lineup they have in and a 30 second timeout taken by John Shire with now 33 on the shot clock what a week 11 ACC Network football lineup we have for you tomorrow it starts at noon Eastern with a BC hosting Virginia Tech then Pittsburgh and Syracuse at Yankee Stadium at 330 Eastern and then we cap the day with Duke and Carolina 800 Eastern all three games also available on the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere both Duke and North Carolina B bound Mike Elco has done a great job with this Duke football team theyre so Music athletic kylin Boswell with the headband right in the middle of that huddle and he has been outstanding all game long seemed like hes gotten every loose ball he has been the leading rebounder in this game for both teams with eight and he has knocked down some timely shots really run the team well the step back after the switch against filipowski that is a excellent statline for the sophomore 30 minutes in this game and 30 hard minutes gritty minutes played by kylin Boswell tonight roach yes right off the inbounds a threepointer nowhere to go for Larson it stays with Arizona Bo and Dan not surprisingly Jeremy roach when a big shot is to be taken hes the one that takes it coming right off Ryan young Boswell trailing him there was Zero hesitation off the catch John shy asked the officials were under two minutes he asked them to look to see who it might have gone out of bounds off it but the officials dont have to Grant it if theyre certain if they feel certain about who knocked it out of so it stays with Arizona and it stays with Arizona again well theyre going to look this one theyre going to look at balow was behind Ryan Music young but it looked like balow was the one that took a swipe at it that doesnt mean it didnt go off of Ryan young but thats one of those bang bang plays that the referees can take a look at so balow knocks it and it looked like his middle finger was the last one that touched it those slow it down that much wow so the call the ruling is Arizona ball now watch both of their left hands they both had it boy thats as close as a guess yeah I dont think you can overturn that yeah thats tough well if you slow it down even more the first angle it looked like Bows finger but I you know I agree with you that its so close but unless they really slow it down you know thats just a brutal film type of deal and it remains with the Wildcats boy what a big shot Jeremy roach just hit started slowly tonight hes up to 15 right now filipowski leads all scores with 23 three and double figures for Arizona Larsson Baseline bounce pass inside Johnson to tie it Proctor just not able to rotate down to to take that pass away but a smart pass by pel Larson 10 ties and nine lead changes in this game but what a great match up between Johnson and filipowski filipowski just bowling his way in but he missed the shot it is Duke ball and theyre going to look at it again wow Larsson reacted like wait a minute I didnt touch it last and thats probably why Brian oconnell going just to make Music Applause sure Larson might have a case Arizona might have a case on this one it hit lson but did it hit young after lson there but then young knocks it out of larssons hand I think dont you the question is when when young hit it does it go through through larssons fingertips and thats how close these plays become and they only look at them the last couple minutes of Regulation and overtime see the see the fingertips did it touch that last thats how minute a detail they have to look at so its clear that that young action knocked it out but did it graze his fingertips there so he knocks it out with his right hand thats Youngs right hand so thats the that knocks it out boom there but does it looks like it grazes his fingertip right there is being Larson his being Larsson see his see his left hand there yeah yeah so he knocks it and did it touch did it not and again sometimes the deciding factor is the original call right and it was called Duke on the floor itll stay Duke Music 11 on the shot clock a minute 19 on the game clock in a tie game good switch by lson on roach roach driving pullup filipowski the rebound got it what a game hes having 25 for the second game in a row to begin the season boy after after all the rebounding difficulties in the first half an offensive rebound puts Duke up by two good defense by filipowski to slow down ballow love inside to Johnson yes and a chance to give them the lead at the line Bo what a play by Caleb love just gets a piece of the paint dumps it down to Johnson and Johnson finishes a tough shot thats not easy to be able to get that in without using the backboard at that angle and not only did he get the bucket he got the foul as well he plays bigger than 67 doesnt he hes been fantastic in this game just fantastic Arizona by Applause one right now for Arizona this is about getting a big stop on the road the ball in the hands of filipowski on the perimeter now roach got the switch now love guarding filipowski Down Low Bow edging over to help Proctor cradles it traveled with it and that was because of balow ballow was playing that drop coverage where hes just in the middle of the lane had to come out a little bit but then when Proctor brought it back in the lane balow was back in there so Bows playing off of of young and just right in the middle of the lane Proctor drove in and Bows presence caused the turnover and the right call timeout Tommy Lloyd Arizona with the ball in a onepoint lead with 28 seconds to go this is one of the great things about this sport that two teams this good can play this kind of a game early in the season somebodys got to lose it but it doesnt wreck your season to play in this kind of game and really right now for Arizona its about being strong with the ball and stepping to the line and hitting free throws and for Duke they dont have to just come out and foul I think they come out and play and use a little bit of time but they go after the ball without fear of fouling because youre sending Arizona to the line for a one andone if you foul mhm but go for the steal you know try to get a trap if they get the ball inside double but you dont have to be worried about fouling but Tommy Lloyds going to want to put his best handling lineup and his best free throw shooting lineup on the floor right now and going small yeah tell I I would imagine hed take out Umar balow here yeah yeah you can see balow was standing behind some of the other players hes not sitting on the chairs so he is behind the the coach right now so youre right he is coming out of the game at least for the moment you go with your most experienced handling lineup and free throw shooting lineup Arizona has struggled some at the line tonight just six of 12 but its really about who gets fouled and right now they have lson love Boswell Bradley and Johnson on the floor now Bradley missed a couple missed those two after he got fouled on that Breakaway Duke undefeated at home last year beat Dartmouth here a few days ago so John undefeated as a head coach here at Cameron Indoor Stadium but that is in Jeopardy right now with his coach looking on I wonder if Coach K is looking at the timeouts going geez I where did all this entertainment come from during timeouts when did they start doing this Boswell to inbound the trap on love Larson back to Boswell they get it over love comes to get it and he got fouled by Mitchell so Caleb love is going to the line and love is an excellent free throw Music shooter shot 77 from the line last season one and one for love in a building he has been several times before when he played 8 miles down the road free throw blockouts are big here also a tip Applause Music Applause out if love makes this and its a threepoint game Duke does do not have to have a three just get it to the rim and if the defense collapses you can kick it out for a three fine but you just want to get a quick score made them both looks like John shy looked like he wanted a timeout but now theyll play roach with a crossover Mitchell into the paint lays it in and again its a one point game but down to 54 seconds remaining well they need to look at the clock a little bit of extra time went off after the the timeout after the ball went through so I think theres going to be more time than 54 I think its going to be over six now the clock supposed to stop after the ball clears the net and it clears the net at 64 65 see it kept going is a review of the time piece Doug Surman along with Ron grber and Brian oconnell the officials in this game Surman talking to Chris Carwell about the clock situation and they have put it to 65 that was good by you price is right there you were just under that was just yeah exactly under without going over thank you Bob Barker so now whats your strategy if youre Duke again go for a quick steal or but then you got to foul right away you got foul right away here you you go for the steel quick trap but you got to foul and put him on the line because even even if Arizona makes both youre still going to have you know 5 Seconds to get it down court and try to tie it Applause up and Jaden Bradley can run the B Baseline here so ballow out of the game again with Arizona having the ball four guards and Johnson in there right Applause now Duke wants to make Arizona catch it going back toward the Music Baseline and now it looks like bow has to go back into the game well he could just go deep or or set a screen and go deep so theyve disallowed this substitution bow in Bradley out Boswell to inbound Larson and he is fouled with barely any time coming off the Applause clock each coach has a timeout left lson last year an 832 free throw shooter and what a luxury when you can put this kind of lineup on the floor that can knock free throws down at the end of the game so let me ask you the question if he makes both and if John Shire does not call a timeout do you want to see Arizona foul before Duke can get a threepoint shot I think you foul once you get across half court yes first things first and I think Arizona if this shot goes in Arizona still wants to press up and dont dont let Duke get a run up made them both threepoint game timeout boy how about Caleb love and then Pella Larson stepping the line and making those pressure free throws Music in a very difficult environment well how how about this game like Arizona comes to playing Cameron next year male thatll be just two of the great Arenas and great fan bases in basketball this is great for the sport the more of this that we can see teams of this caliber playing early in the season the better it is and I look Dan I think the players love it like I I think every Arizona player wants to say I played in Cameron and every d du player said hey we went out to male we played an Allen Fieldhouse we played at Assembly Hall these are bucketless games for players yeah and neutral sight games have their place obviously in this sport but youre right this is special I mean th this is the earliest that Duke fans have ever put up tents right theyre tenting in November November yep pay 80000 a year in tuition your kid sleeping in a tent in November Applause Boswell Lewis lson Bradley and Johnson for Arizona so the question is will they foul or will they just play it straight if they do foul you dont want to foul until you get right around or past half court you know try do your best to make Duke catching it going toward the ball and dont allow any Advan pass pass Mitchell inbounding Nobody on the ball into roach and they foul little early I think they could have waited longer yeah extending the game actually yeah but around 5 seconds is okay but its still you know Dukes first Dukes got to hit the free throws but they fouled a good free throw shooter but for balow and Johnson and then and then both Lewis and Larson have to have to pinch in Arizona is out of timeouts Duke got one Duke has one left and Dan I if there is a miss here filipowski and young in those second slots they can tip if they can tip the ball back yeah you can steal a three Applause here makes the front end boy balow and filipowski getting all kinds of Tangled Up in the lane two guys who do not shy away from physical basketball Boswell out of the game again limping again and again maybe its a cramp and Bradley who just came into the game needs to be alert if the balls tipped back if theres any kind of miss here theres still plenty of time yeah I think roach wants to make this onepoint game Bradley confirming that he can run the Baseline into love and theyll tie him up right away down to 46 and love will head to the line again and thats the 10th team foul on Duke so its two shots now for Applause love but Caleb love has had some big moments in this building and some big moments against Duke wearing a Carolina uniform and you have to think hes enjoying stepping to the line for this kind of pressure situation he handled it very well the first time knocking them both Applause down Duke has one timeout John sh is already talking to one of the officials it looked like about using that timeout if theres a make here him again hes got ice water in his veins those are Big Time free throws he made four pel Larson made two thats how you win big games on the road yet its still a onep possession game with 46 to Music go Welly you talk about coaches too as terrific as they are Tommy Lloyds in his third year as a head coach John Shys in his second year as a head coach its not just the players who are experiencing you know a lot of intensity and incredible moments as they play in these games its these coaches too well in this game win or lose for either team is going to be of great benefit I mean this is a final exam taken in November and that you dont let Duke get up a three right so if they fouled last time it stands the reason theyll foul again this time right it does but you can you can wait a little bit longer than fouling right away I mean obviously you know youre going to foul under 4 seconds but make him dribble once or twice Boswell not in the game for Arizona as they come out of the Huddle for Duke it is Young filipowski McCain roach and Proctor McCain The Freshman but again A Gifted Music shooter kead Johnson back playing kind of center field in case theres a long pass which there has to be lson tipped it love has it Lewis slams it and Arizona wins it theyre theyre sending the teams back to the bench Im not sure
