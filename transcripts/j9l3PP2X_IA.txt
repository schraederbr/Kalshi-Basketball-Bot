after a 1 six start and the Warriors already 20 in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference they played two League games of course Stanford the last time out they won over in Berkeley against Cal the ACC opener 8981 in the zone defense that will see miramac play All Night the kick out to oziah sers and off one foot the floater rattles and goes and Stanford with a game first point well keep your eyes on Stanford and there is attack you know theyre not going to be satisfied just to Jack threepoint shots theyve been there done that and its cost them they go right inside and see if they can get something inside in the interior and thats the goal of this zone for marac is okay you look at it a conventional two three from the top but then once you initiate your offense they change and they try to take away the three and force you to do things you dont want to do they do they match up out of it um and and there you see again Clark thought he got fouled in the play but youre right the defense is designed to keep you on the perimeter and not waste two on the ball theres always going to be one guy thats called Hit and recover at the wing the wing hits there bounces back inside and now the guards responsibility is to to hit up and and guard take basketball always one on the ball someone described their Zone as the Syracuse two3 Zone on Red Bull I like that shot clock at five oiah cers over to Jaylen Blakes and a tough Challenge three by Blakes and its five nothing cardal he might have got fouled in that too there was a lot of contact uh but you know Jaylen Blakes you know you want a guy at the end of the shot clock that can great he can create the transfer from duke picks up where he left off over at hos Pavilion against cow when he had 20 against the Golden Bears making a couple of threes and spread to the floor miramac and it rattles in a three from Brian U well that time maxing Reno gave a little bit too much help inside with camman and could get back out to the corner I dont think they may have to change that scheme but uh you know Marc can do that they can knock down shots if you give them some some openings heum new just his fifth threepointer of the year marac has a team just 30 on their threes and the offensive numbers are not pretty but thats what they do and they also control the tempo make it difficult for you to get in runs heres a three on the way and its too strong but the long rebound run down by by Devin Savage for maram just their sixth year as a division one Foe and there is Bud Clark in the lane to tie the game at five well theyre not a stranger though to success Roxy so when youre successful it always makes transitions into the next upper level better and easier Ryan agarwall thought about it Jaylen Blakes launches and a three for Blakes well hes not hesitating right if you watch Jaylen Blakes early in the year you know hed hesitate on that shot he already has a little bit of a hitch but you dont want a hesitation and a hitch and hes knocking those shots down now Sean Trumper way off on the three and Stanford controls Kyle Smith and the Cardinal off to an 82 start the best record for Stanford to start a season since 2019 2020 when they began the here 15 and two Aiden camon moves in the drop off Maxim Reno with his first points of the night now nice Post toost delivery there camon with a good drive and obviously finding Renault if you can find Reno thats a pretty good Target hes not hard to find considering hes 71 no but he makes himself available too a lot of guys dont hes presents himself he gets to the seams on the you know against the defense and thats important shot clock at 10 Bud Clark rattles in a three yeah cant go underneath the screen against Clark If you do he will do just what he did hell bury you he averages just under 20 points per game five assists a game so everything for miramac runs through bud Clark but jayen Blakes off to a good start for the Cardinal after a 10day layoff Stanford back at it up two he e e e e well the Stanford win back on December 7th over at Cal the Cardinal with 13 block shots five back by Maximo in that game but 13 blocks for Stanford defensively yeah that was a great defensive effort I mean Cals a tough team to guard Roxy theyre explosive offensively Cal went in there and and sfer went in there and I think held their own in more menum and the blocks helped get you going in trans transition and its its tough because K has some guys that can finish Stanford put up 89 points shot 53 with those 13 blocks made 11 of 23 from three as marac had a clean look from three as Brian tumu missing from deep in Stanford controls and the Cardinal a little bit shorthanded in this game tonight couple of key guards out for Kyle Smith as a foul the roll counted Aiden camon and one for the Cardinal yeah how about Ma seem right now returning the favor finding his co uh his partner in crime down there and just went post to post short corner to dive thats a dive post dive we call it thats a great look from camon to know where to be against the zone camon now five for 10 from the line this year could not convert on the n one as the foul for marac was called on arandes plowz the Junior from Lithuania the transfer from Northern Illinois spread the floor and launching a three too strong for Matt Beck and Stanford limits one shot and out Stanford playing without Benny geler tonight he is battling an illness Stanford hoping theyll have on Saturday when the Cardinal will take on Oregon down in San Jose and a travel on Maxim Reno and a turnover by Stanford and also out tonight for the Cardinal is Darren Saron yeah you know thats a big loss if youre youre playing against the team Roxy as marac playing a Zone because those are two guys that can really knock down shots giler uh shooting pretty close to 40 from three 94 from the line and you got you got San thats also a really big time threepoint shooter so youre playing without two your best Shooters both on the bench and San dealing with a leg injury hes dayto day as well as a lot too high for Brian tumu and a turnover committed by marac but Stanford theres a look at the two guards giler on the left Saron on the right Stanford is five for five from the floor to start the game Chisum akara moving in and thats the first Miss from the field for Stanford Here Comes Bud Clark from Marram DS into the key has his shot blocked by Jaylen Blakes first block for Stanford in this one oiah sers there Matt quickley gets out on Shooters and the foul on the drive Matt Beck with the body thats the first on the senior from vien Virginia the transfer from Southern New Hampshire University you can see Stanfords got some size theyre theyre utilizing it inside hard to go over the top of two sevenfooters now they got and AR whos also pretty long and lengthy its tough when youre trying to go against those guys and you put uh okar in there and those are three pretty good guys along the front line in the zone for Marram theyre going to stay in this all night and you know what to expect when you play a Marram the good ball fake and Maxim Reno rattles out and the rebound Maxim Renault gets it again and theres the touch from the 71 Maxim Renault yeah hes got money thats a money shot for him he goes over his shoulder and I dont care right hand left hand hes really lethal with that he gets Second Chance opportunities thats going to be in trouble from merac Ls lead for the Cardinal and theres a bump on Blakes the first foul against Jaylen Blakes and the first whistled against a well watch right now you can see you know he misses the first but he gets a second chance opportunity and he just so so good going over his shoulder either one left or right first appearance tonight for the Cardinal for Evan Stinson The Freshman from cheny Washington Sean Trumper spinning down low wild shot off balance and I promise therell be no political references tonight Trum Im just pointing that out early I hope not cuz I clearly were the first people to ever think of Music doing pull up by by Jaylen Blakes whos feeling it Blakes already with eight and the Cardinal have doubled up Marram well its been really I think a great attack by Stanford theyre playing against the Zone thats pretty unusual they havent faced this kind of Zone all year and theyre doing a nice job six nothing Run for the Cardinal Bud Clark missing the pullup and Jaylen Blakes a defensive rebound and from deep osiah sers and a timeout for marac at Stamford on a 9 nothing run theyre up 11 and theyre eight for 10 from the floor well you want to beat a Zone Roxy beat the Zone in transition thats just what Stanford did they beat the Zone before setup and how about oai sers with a big three I thought he said you got 30 seconds no 30 second floater oh how the hell I know what a floater is yeah come on Roxy e e e e red hot start for the Cardinal Stanford eight of 10 from the field he all three threes Jaylen Blakes with eight points four rebounds hes two for two outside the arc and the Cardinal on a 9 nothing run Stanford leading Marram now 198 well I was going to were going to break r we talked about it in Stanford not hesitating to getting a shot up before the Zone gets set up excellent strategy by the Cardinals this will be an interesting point of the game as Jaylen Blakes is out as the floater high off the window and in for Malik edme with the pink shoes to go along with that pretty move and a 1910 lead for Stanford I like the press back to Zone thats actually good strategy try to shorten the clock dont let Stanford get a lot of good look hooks but its an interesting time because Jaylen Blakes is on the bench and Stanford does not have a point guard out there on the floor and Blakes really the only point guard available tonight for Kyle Smith but Ryan agall says I can be your point guard well but it was sellers that initiated and I thought oiah sers you know can do that hes shown his ability to distribute as well as score hes a very unselfish player Blakes really the only point guard for Stanford tonight with Darren Saron and Benny geler not available you could see Sam an Batson Jr at some point in that role as down the lane and a foul that will get David Murray to the line for Marram and rock this is a scrappy team from marac you can see theyre not afraid to attack theyre smaller but theyre not afraid to get into the paint just kind of attack you a little bit theyre theyre pesky and theyre aggressive two shots for David Murray the senior from Jackson Heights New York and it spins out for Murrays now five for eight from the line this year as Murray a transfer from division 3 Connecticut College where he was a stand out of the D3 level and now coming up to play for miramac and Joe Gallow an interesting usage of the portal where he lost his top player from the year ago to the portal but then he raided D2 and D3 to get some talent to replenish the roster yeah and Roxy a lot of coaches around the country are doing that there are some awfully good players in division 2 and division three that got overlooked that can definitely help programs at division one level and his top player from last year Jordan durak transferred to ruter and durak last year was the Northeast conference player and defensive player of the year is chismar inside for the Cardinal Joe Galla wanted a charge against so far didnt get it and a foul will get David Murray to the line again for maram and the Cardinal foul is called on Talis Tay the freshman first yeah good call good play on I I think the officials had it did a good job on that particular possession but you know every possession down you see Stanford putting the ball in the high post Roxy one more for David Murray but Marram its their first year in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference the MAAC not to be confused with the Mac thats right this is the maak right that you got to exaggerate that accentuate the second thats right but no theyre there this is interesting an attack in the Press thatll send Talis Tay to the line for Stanford well in Roxy in this day you can see the replay here that I like Stanford going to the Rack in transition thats what you have to do against a team thats pressing if all you do as youre content to get the ball across the 10second line against a pressing team theyll press you every second of the game you got to be aggressive one more for Tay 611 freshman from near Sacramento in Roseville as Tay who originally committed a Kyle Smith to go to Washington State then when Kyle took the Stanford job two Ray followed him to the farm and he goes one for two from the line yeah good looking freshman really has a bright future ahead of him but the last couple years Marram was in the NEC and they made the transition from division 2 to division one and they had that fouryear probation period where you were ineligible for the NCA tournament this is the second year they are eligible to go after that 4year waiting period and they won backto back NEC titles Malik Edmond the kick out did they beat the shot clock no tide door is set too late and thatll go as a turnover for Marram and a Stanford ball with the Cardinal of 13 and an impressive start considering Stanford took a 10day break for finals they had to try to craft some schedule to be able to practice and sometimes they had to do it in small groups couldnt practice the whole team at times during finals week and so to come back out and off to a hot start CU you never know what to expect and you went through it as a coach as Jaylen Blake spots up for three and drains another third three for Blakes he has 11 I think Jaylen Blakes likes finals Roxy I mean hes knocking him down hes the one yeah he doesnt seem to mind but Roxy look you know we we were Cal and and if youre a cal in Stanford theres finals then theres finals its a little bit different look and so you got to really youre putting your your nose in the books and youre going to be up for many hours how anxious were you when you came back after an extended break like Kyle Smith is doing now when youre off for a week 10 days and you cant really practice full and trying to get the team to to focus after finals well heres jayen Blakes focusing by the way but you know you you you just want to get there you you know youre not going to get your whole team we didnt have very many team practices we had assistant coaches working out players and we might have some get togethers and some shootarounds and maybe walkthroughs but you you know your your finals going all day and youre very uh you know very pressed to get your team together on a consistent basis Stanford foul was on Ryan agarwall Stanford has come out focused tonight nice pass Bud Clark fing door set in the lane and the rebound bounces into the Stanford bench and it belongs to the Cardinal well Adam Clarks a problem I mean hes just you dont contain him with one youre going to have to put a second Defender and when you do hes pretty good at finding guys so if marac can start knocking some of these shots down they can give Stanford some problem but you know theyve been on the road a while too and theyre in the Bay area for a couple of games theyll play at St Marys on Thursday that pops out for osiah sers and Maxim Reno tries to tip it Hitt loose ball track down here comes Bud Clark racing up the floor and a double dribble yeah he he picked his dribble up and he knows it uh he hes looking to make a pass um hes in transition boy hes just hes there it is I mean just you know it happens when youre when youre the balls in your hands a lot guys that handle the ball Roxy are going to have more turnovers but I can assure you hell get more assists on the year than turnovers hes a heck of a basketball player last year maram tied for first in the NC they went 21 12 last year with the NC regular season Champs in 2023 as well is Ryan agarwall launches a three in the rebound Devin Savage comes away with it for Music Applause maram and the quick burst and a foul before the shot as Bud Clark skipping into the key oh he did this just a really watch the Jabs Roxy this is just textbook you know he Jabs to get you to move back and then as you come back and recover off the jab he attacks you again thats really textbook uh Triple Threat uh play second on Ryan agarwall and for Stanford their fifth team fell here with 819 left in the first half St would like to keep this lead Roxxy theyve let some leads up this years which have cost them but they got a nice comfortable lead theyd like to keep it going and a three Miss by Devin Savage Here Comes Stanford Applause again and a kick and theyll put the shot clock back at 20 for the Cardinal with 802 left in the half but so Marram after that one and six start played a pretty tough schedule when you look at they lost games at PCU Princeton whos the favorite in the ivy league at ruter they went to Butler and took on F Mas team at UTSA but theyve won four in a row beat Troy on the road kishis on the road at Niagara and then also a victory against Boston University yeah and I think its the schedule Roxy that enabled them to do that playing those tough teams they they were able to you know get a tough couple challenge games in there and now they they toughened up well Clark had it slip out of his hands and he looked at his hands like hands dont fail me now they just did Ryan agarwall penetrates and Maxim Reno has it stripped still tend to shoot Anthony Batson Jr The Freshman of the game finds osas sers for three OAS sers Roxy we said this earlier an unselfish player but if you give him the opportunity to score hell take it he can put the ball in the basket he can fill it up 3112 Stanford on a 7even nothing run now they are six for eight from three and overall shooting 67 from the floor and Marram on the other end just 25 shooting it is all Stanford so far tonight Applause Maxim Reno spots up in the corner and the rebound pulled down by Brian tomu and driving to the bucket but Clark delay it how about thats SL of hand Roxy he gets knocked holds the ball in his hands dips it and then sticks it back off the glass with his left hes a awfully tricky player in transition he has seven of maramax 14 Ryan agarwall again from Deep in and out and the rebound knocked around and its grab by Bud Clark from miramac and this you look at the numbers in miramac one of their problems is theyre a horrible rebounding team and a foul on a three will send Matt back to the line for miramac and thats the third on Ryan agarwall oah sers and Stanford filling it up from long range and big on Marram e e e e well watch Jaylen blaks Roxy I mean hes really putting the ball in the basket hes a 25 threepoint shooter on the year but hes really knocking shots down you can see his release hes really elevating hes getting the hand up under the ball pushing it up in the air hes not you know hes not shooting it across his body hes really improved I think his technique hes been on fire since the Cal game had a big shooting game there and his big win over Cal roadwi uh and you see tonight three out of three from the threepoint line four for five from the floor hes hes really stepping up his offensive uh performance Matt Beck at the line shooting three and during the timeout they corrected a foul so Ryan agarwall now with two fouls and Talis Tay also with two for Stanford Beck an 85 foul shooter in his seventh season of college basketball he played two years at Mount St Marys but played just a total of nine games then last four years at Southern New Hampshire University a division 2 school where his first team all Northeast 10 conference and then Beck transferring to maram back for his last year of college competition well thats something thats a story you see more and more of that by the way in Collegiate basketball guys getting in a sixth year and a steal for Marram Sean Trumper took it away 14point lead for Stanford the lead has been as large as 19 an aent pass from Beck it goes out of B is Devin Savage cant track it down and a turnover by marac thats their Sixth and a team that turns it over fewer than 10 times game no thats uncharacteristic you know um just really an unforced turnover too unfortunate for uh March and thats where these two teams are similar as Stamford also takes really good care of the ball as osiah sers in the corner of three but Stamford right now 19th in the country in fewest turnovers a game well theyre theyre uh really efficient and thats important you dont want to play giveaway Music basketball on the drive its Beck and relocating for three and rattles in for dein Savage well that was pretty good defense by Stanford nonetheless merch found a seam and found a way to score first points for Savage a transfer from James Madison Savage in his third year at Marram after playing his freshman year at James Madison and Maxim Reno will get to the line a foul committed by Marram and its on Devin Savage well thats a good sign for Stanford watch aara get in the paint hes had some problems earlier in this year but now hes Distributing in there and finding guys hes so good at getting uh by his Defender and attacking the basket sometimes you got to drop off and Reno 69 from the line and coming into tonight Max Reno eighth in the country in scoring fifth in rebounding averaging over 22 points per game and more than 11 rebounds a game his stats are impressive but it really is his versatility for me Roxy as an NBA potential player he can do some things a lot of big guys cant do hes very versatile he also leads the country with eight double doubles as its stripped and a Steeler comes chisam Makar up the floor and he Glides in and aara in transition lays it in thats an unfortunate run now for for for Marram to give up this run to Stanford left open and a three is drained from the corner by arandis plantus now Stanford opening up with their biggest lead big basket from AAC and a travel in Stanford to turnover fifth on the Cardinal 356 left in the half Stanfords made Seven threes theyre up 14 e e e e Joe Gallow and miramac coming out west to take on the Cardinal tonight and some of particulars on the Marram Warriors we talked about the transition from division 2 to division one their second full season as a fullfledged member where they are NCAA tournament eligible miramac and one of my favorite little nuggets about miramac as a three rattled in by Matt Beck a onetime student at miramac Carl usty the Hall of Famer wow now he didnt play baseball for miramac but he did it took some classes at marac working toward his degree sh clock inside 10 osiah cers spots up left open in the corner of the Miss Sean Trumper the rebound for Marram and a corner three thats short from arandis plowz and inside three minutes to go in the half Stanford with a double ditched lead despite the six nothing run by the Warriors and a reach in and the foul committed by miramac it is team fou number five yes you can see this watch the entry pass you have to go underneath the defense Tom Davis style uh going underneath the defense with the hands of a Zone uh usually up in the air you got come underneath and then the seam of the Zone High post really a tough cover for all zones rany tomb new called for the foul and the nice lob over the top but aara cant finish off the raino feed but then Jaylen Blakes takes it right back highway robbery rocks you cant put a ball in his in his uh eyes and what a what a great move by sellers to finish here and you know Stanford was threatening here by marac to get uh you know decrease their lead into single digits now they pushed it back up right before the half 13 for o zah sers the lead is 13 bu Clark weaves his way Applause in five to shoot Malik edme to deep three and Stanford all over the glass and a foul going for the rebound and its on miramac and the second on armandas plowz very good box out position by the Cardinal you can see theyre its tough to get a second look against a cardinal when theyre playing big inside Music thas and its last tou by Stanford the Cardinal a turnover thats the first time Roxy they didnt really enter the ball inside the Zone they didnt penetrate it they was content to play on the perimeter zones like when you do that that was something theyre working on consistently at shooter out today is the ball movement and getting it in and out because Marram again they invite that pass in but then they fan out they get in passing lanes and they are in areas where you dont necessarily expect them no and thats a good point I think that the the key on the zone is once You penetrated the zone now you got to get to some spots you got to get in the vision of the your teammate that caught the ball You Cant Hide on them you got to get deeper lower on the floor which is Corners wings or even at The Rim I think the biggest thing is just to go post to post High post low post start there if they pinch down now you got wide open shots at the wing jmak par the foul is sha Trumper the native of Ashford England makes the first free throw one more coming for Trumper division two stand out at Franklin Pierce before transferring to Marram and he hits both free throws leading rebounder on this Warrior team down 19 maram is trimmed it to 11 they would love to have it single digits at halfen yeah that would be a psychological lift if they could get it there akara in the key and hes out of bounds and it goes to marac he had a another good look but just couldnt cash in well yeah I think theyre pressing a little bit Roxy the balls going into the high post once it goes in there theyre pinching down so youve got to Fan it from there you got to go high post back maybe uh to the wing I mean theres openings in there because theres going to be a guy playing underneath you your guards are digging from the sides so youve got two three guys around you somebodys open Quick Dart to the basket but blowing the layup was Malik edme and Stanford with the rebound well its pretty easy to blow a layup when you got raino kind of hiding out at 71 at The Rim so Cardinal now can play they can go two for one if they want and again that high low and they block the shot of Talis Tay as David Murray with the rejection for stord number 33 Music evson just when you think youve got that layup they come over and collapse on yeah the wings are really cheating up for Marram nice job on the Baseline but David Murray blocks the shot of Evan Stinson shot clock winding down on the Cardinal and Stinson launches and the rebound grabbed by Shan Trumper for Marram a chance to get it to single digits and they can play for the last shot of the half and you mentioned that Roxy that what a psychological lift that will be for marac just to get it under double digits and and if they can psychologically thats a big lift going in the locker room at halftime 5 Seconds Bud Clark tough fadea away on the Baseline for Clark take this to halftime and it is a single digit game the Stanford lead is nine it was 19 yeah shot her drive back far and were trying to cheat the offensive rebound off his screen in a three and the stroke from Matt Beck and Marram has cut it all the way down to six but how about that play coming out of the locker room Roxy that was a designed play to get one of their top shooters a look and that was not an easy shot but he drained it Beck 73 field goal attempts this season 66 are threes thats what he does hes basically a spot up threepoint shooter and now one and done and here comes marrat thats a big you know you you want to not match baskets you want to get some stops here but thats easier said than done against this team look at the drive I mean I dont know how you defend uh Bud Clark and you know what I think Kyle Smiths saying the same thing CU he just burned the timeout to discuss it fourpoint game miramac right back in it on the farm e e e e e well quick five nothing spurt and marac has cut it to four here early in the second half yeah bud Clarks had a lot to do with that I said he was a problem in the first half hes a problem in the second half and Kyle Smith had to burn a timeout to devise a way to not stop him slow him down the 510 they list him at which is generous the sophomore from Philly was the NEC rookie of the year last year and he is the Catalyst for everything from miramac as Ryan Ager wall in and out on the three and the rebound and falling out of bounds with the basketball was Brian eunu and itll stay at this end in a Stanford ball well thats a break for Stanford because right there you know that that was going to be a lets go the other way and chance to cut it to one possession Music Applause Music game and the deflection the hands in there from Shan Trumper yeah very active hands the zone you know youve got 10 hands in the passing Lane you got to know that shot fake ball fake try to move the hands in the direction different for where you want the basketball to Applause go heres Bud Clark on the go Sean Trumper and he throws it away and a steal here comes osiah cers for Stanford he darts all the way to the basket you Roxy thats what you have to do sometimes you get a turnover dont just be satisfied to collect a a loose ball go other direction most of the times defensive or offensive teams are not theyre not in position to defend in transition loose ball and Jaylen Blakes knocks it away headmans for sers now theres good turnovers and bad turnovers Roxy those are two bad turnovers because theyve LED direct score to direct scores for Stanford and some momentum for the Cardinal again as they push the lead out to eight bu Clark penetrates Shan Trumper gets the roll I think youre first field goal of theight and I think youre going to see the ball in Clarks hands a little bit more uh youre going to trust him to make those every time down if Im Joe Gall yeah hes not taking a chance and going to play giveaway with Stanford because thats gotten them right back in the game Stanford with that lead and theres a foul inside before Maxim Reno is able to gather and go up well heres look at the pass I mean it didnt stick in Blakes hand thats a great look its like a down and out or I mean a goal bline a goal poost run and you know sers is pretty good in transition hes really a player that is explosive second fou and Brian Eun new Maxim Reno trying to find the soft spot in the zone Ryan agarwall keeps it alive on the offensive end knocked out of bounds by Shawn trumer 12 on the timer for Stanford yeah very pesky Zone by marac theyre really getting after you theyre getting deflections theyre making it tough for Stanford this is what they do all the time they play the zone and they do it well hitting and recovering at the wing long three Jaylen Blake from way outside well hes looking up in the air like wheres this been all here but hes done that the last couple games he has been on fire hes given his team big shots and increase this lead with the threepoint dagger 14 for Blakes and the jumper Bud Clark for Marram and he wanted a little an one action didnt get it but he was asking the officials and at times hes a reluctant shooter and miramac trying to get him to shoot the ball a little bit more Blakes on the pullup and there is Bud Clark pushing it for Marram Devin Savage transition three and the rebound grabbed by Ryan agarwall for the Cardinal yeah okay with that shot youre going to try to beat Sanford in transition not a bad move just didnt pull pull the trigger didnt uh didnt give it a good fou go through Max R begging for the ball on the Block hes got a mismatch down on the Block and Shan Trumper claims the Miss Here Comes marac way behind the line Matt back three I dont think theres any defense for that Roxy youre at the hash mark what used to be the old hash mark the Tara Vander Mark now he he shot it from the from her logo hes tied his season high with 12 lobo with the top for maxim Reno and he is fouled will get to the line but couldnt get the chippy to go now jayen Blakes lining it up knocking down threes he can deliver big time shot but not to be outdone back for three we got a tight one e e e e e Roxy we talked about the hash mark I was wrong that was not at the hash mark that was behind the hash mark at Tara vanderville Ville look at that shot I mean thats just a a big Time threepoint shot no hesitation and his teammate knew it cuz he dropped off the dime and said Let It Go so if youre Stanford youve got to talk about getting out to the shooters and and March has a couple guys it can nail it from Deep one more for maxim Reno has just six points tonight Renos two for six from the floor now two for three from the line well and he started the game with a couple of good looks uh when his hes active Roxy and hes in the game Stanford is a different team and I think you can watch for maxim to get more involved and and kind of take over at points hes got to get aggressive for the Cardinal now stford playing a little bit of zone of their own looks like Bud Clark maybe he was too open that time yeah no theres nobody within 10t of him just didnt knock it down yeah theres that hit and recover at the wing shot clock inside 10 Ryan agarwall Jaylen Blakes tough fadeaway shot thatll be a shot clock violation Stanford a turnover and again the Zone from maraming posing problems for Stanford yeah outstanding possession by maram they really hit on recovered at the wing they dont want their wings to hit and stick as we say out on the wing they want them back inside to help on rebounding and help challenge uh Stanford size and then the guards are then taking over so good communication good good uh one on the ball coverage quickness of Bud Clark and Maxim Renault rips it down for the Cardinal has tough sledding in there with all the trees but heres that zone again theyre just trying to keep Stanford on the perimeter and challenge up Chisum akara powering his way up and a foul well again two shots for akar yeah the high post entry rocks they gone back to that you start with entries you put the ball on the floor they have a high low as you can see with Reno and they also have to cover okara whos a load in there hes strong he you know in the ivy league he got to the free throw line for Harvard that was something he did very well second foul on David Murray oara 65 from the line five Off the Bench now for Chisum akar and one more shot cmings come off the bench now the last five games for Kyle Smith as akara started the previous four came off the bench the first two games this season 26 starts over his two years at Harvard for oara and he hits both free throws and the Stanford lead is now seven Stanford now looking to try to talk communicate play little zone of their own little bit of a two three match Music up I like it Murray missing down low in the rebound Maxim Reno his ninth yeah good possession for Stanford the change up I thought was effective butar or rather Bud Clark I should say for aramac as akar way off on that shot but hes just so quick and get to wherever he wants on the floor with the ball yeah thats the one thing though that that I think MX going to do is allow him to shoot that ball and the runner it falls off for Malik edby but kept Alive by the warriors on the drive on the Baseline and the roll for armandas plowz yeah Kyle Smith just really not happy with that sequence the turnover and then the the give up of the of the Applause basket and a foul and its on bud Clark for the whack across the wrist of Evan Stinson the second foul on bud Clark now you can see it there Force the errant pass Applause deflected and its off of Barac and it stays with Stanford a good break for Stanford that was hopefully uh a deflection but you know I think Kyle Smith wants the ball to go in and out a little quicker you dont want to hold in the low post it gets in it gets out you got to make people move against the zone and when Stanford was doing that they were very effective on the Baseline oiah sellers Glides in and thats been The X Factor hes been The X Factor for Stanford he moves so well without the ball hes tough to the rim knocks down threes hes really good at at finding the seams and and moving to to get to create some uh passing angles and passing options leads all scorers with 19 bug Clark over the 71 maxim Reno yeah thats just uh really tough basketball getting your own shot against a 7 foot one player like Maxim REO a lot of players cannot do that Renault gets the fly by and Chism mokar will get to the line and I think Kyle Smith pretty happy that oara got grabbed that offensive rebound that was that was a pass he was looking forar theyll talk about it at the break Rox e e e e e well bud Clark in the middle of everything for meramac and hes the reason theyre in this game hes an outstanding Player rock do we talk about players and their ability to create their own shot he can do that he gets you on your heels and if youre and if youre sitting back on your heels hell pull up fade away and score it uh you know interestingly on the other side now from Clark youve got osah sers whos really carrying this Stanford team with 19 and Blakes with 14 uh maxing Reno kind of quiet with six offensively but hes got nine rebounds and hes done a heck of a job affecting some defensive challenges for Stanford as March only shooting 36 for the floor for the game H par now two for three from the line bug Clark on the bench right now for marac just picked up his third foul yeah he wont be there long Roxy I know uh its a TV timeout or no TV timeout hes too good a player to sit there and uh you know hell hell get a little bit of a rest but I dont think hell be there long heres Stanford playing that two three zone now theyre matching up and creating the turnover second time in a row Evan Stinson a transition misses the layup and the rebound pulled down tied Dorset from marrat Malik edme and he draws the foul will get to the line well Roxy that thats a good possession for marac but you know not a great possession for Stanford they didnt get back in transition you theyve got to hustle back and they were really just didnt get back with numbers and marac taking advantage of that trying to cut this to another two possession game second foul on Jaylen Blakes Malik edme an interesting story as edme the native of Deer Park New York played his first two years for marac freshman year he was a member of the NEC all rookie team then transferred played a year at Albany came back to miramac Red shirted last year and its playing this year for Joe Gallow proves theres no place like home sometimes you know grass isnt always greener heres that zone that Reno and okara trying to screen off those guards those pesky guards at the top see if they can get him a drag screen and see if they can get rid of him dump them off somewhere and the foul Devin Savage violating the cylinder of Chisum akara and its the second on Devin Savage he violated more than the cylinder Rox I think he got a piece of his chin his his mouth and his ears I mean thats a pretty good physical pop right there and know I was just being kind yeah alar is bringing that attention to the officials by the way theres you know there is a rule about making contact in the head area so maybe not a bad point to bring up to the officials Maxim Renault left open in the corner and Renault drains a three he so told his student section dont forget about me I can still fill it from three I know I havent been a little quiet tonight but hes done that all year long Roxy hes been a real threat from there 40 on his thre yeah its a great percentage for a sevenfooter period end the story Stanford 9 for 17 outside the arc and now the defensive play raino blocks for shot jayen Blakes pushes Chism aara Powers it up and in timeout maram and Stanford has pushed the lead back to double digits a great great sequence for Stanford first the Rena 3 then the block and then AAR do doing what he does attacking I mean just great basketball but watch the play not a great pass for Maxine but he picks it up off his shoe tops and drains it I mean just just nothing but net thats what he does letting the fans know hey Im back thats me I can do this but how about okara too he just gets into the paint and he goes right up hes too strong youre not going to stop him with one and he just finishes thats a good sign for Stanford so if youre marac Roxy you got to go back now and you cant turn it over uh you know you cant go over the top of R know to get those scores so youre going to have to try to find some some scores and you know what guess whos back in the game thats the immediate solving of a problem you get your best player and maybe the guy thats been the toughest guy to guard on the floor tonight uh and Bud Clark you get him back on the floor Stanford goes on a little mini run and Joe Gallow puts Bud Clark back in the game for marac yeah well hes playing 36 37 minutes a game hes he only needs a couple minutes but they cant play without him hes too good here he is and he gets the soft roll hes not supposed to get the bounce at Stanford is he I mean thats he hes playing the rims too hes what isnt he doing today 17 for Clark yeah hes so steady heres that zone but you see Stanfords trying to screen it a little bit I I like that theyre bringing their bigs out there and trying to create a little space uh and pick those guards off the pesky guards Ryan agarwall Maxim Reno fouled on a putb well thats what Maxim Renos done Roxy when hes been active he doesnt you know hes maybe not scoring but he gets to the rim and you just cant keep him off hes so aggressive when he does that hes effective and I know Stanford would love to see him do more of it but cal Smith again on the sideline just really hoping this team can just put a run together havent been able to sustain it but give Marram credit theyve done a good job of fighting back every time Stanford takes a lead one more for maxim Renault first foul on Shan Trumper and Renault another double double now 10 points 11 rebounds and for maxim Marino thats nine double doubles in Stanfords 11 games yeah thats thats getting it done well if youre obviously Stanford you know how do you stop or slow down Bud Clark and and the answer is you you probably cant stop him you maybe you cant slow him down but you can get the ball out of his hands you can get big guys on him two on the ball do something to disrupt him dont let him beat you oneonone hes too Music good and a push thats on oiah sers his second foul thats a clever cut there you the ball handler had picked up his dribble its a no no but his teammate helped him out by basket cutting thats a a really effective way to beat pressure just the second team foul on Stanford in the second half well they can play aggressive now Sean Trumper and he bowls over Ryan agarwall and a foul is called on well I dont think Kyle Smiths going to like that call Roxy cuz a there was some contact on the charge and B there was a little bit of uh stumbling maybe even a travel so Kyle Smiths uh not happy about that or he he stepped on his foot I dont know if you can call that a foul but so it wasnt the block no on agar Walls third foul it was when he was down he kicked his leg out and made contact with Trumper thats what the foul was yeah good eyes Rox maybe we need a fourth official now she handled it yeah right there the the foot yeah Im not sure I agree that he kicked it out and you and I can agree to disagree Im not saying I I agree with the call Im just saying thats why the foul was called yeah yeah and Im not sure that was the case but um and then none nonetheless Mar with a break to get the free throws on what could have been an empty possession so were actually look again this is just uh you know pretty much a three possession game uh M keeping it close but I also point out I didnt say I disagreed with the call either I like that Im playing the neutral party here well Trumper was involved yes Stanford with a turnover and thats hard to do I Ill leave it at that by the way you didnt know there were trumpers in eng England did you you do now I do now well if youre Stanford you you need to stop and you you have it starts with Clark how do you disrupt him how do you keep him from hurting you and breaking your defense down hes really clever a step back bud Clark again well he he likes the contact Roxy and again oneonone I dont know that you can do a lot and you you can put a bigger guy on him but what he does he steps back creates space thats what great players do and the quickness Maxim Reno the pump fake Applause Ryan agarwall steps out for three well hes hit some big baskets for Stanford but thats a huge Basket in this game as marry Mach just breathing down Stanfords neck 10 for 19 the Cardinal on their threes tonight well theyre playing against the Zone youre going to have to hit some rock so youre not going to get all layups in second shots its last Touch by Stanford out on the floor ninepoint lead and Stanford threepointers have been there tonight yeah and arga wal is saying I dont forget about me I can do this I can knock that shot down thats in my wheelhouse e e e e e well bud Clark doing everything for marac and hes the reason theyre in this game yeah he is Roxy and again you know hes 510 at best but his ability to stop on a dime and just you know go straight up he takes contacts and he can also Fade Away against bigger players but hes hes got a handle that you dont see very often in college basketball tremendous tremendous ball handler ninepoint Stanford lead Clark the lob and the Finish Brian eon new and he can do that too how about setting up setting the table for his teammate my goodness first action tonight for Jaylen Thompson the sophomore in the game for the Cardinal against Stanford a little bit shorthanded no Benny geler and no Darren San tonight both their day today and the Cardinal hope and theyll have both available on Saturday their matchup down in San Jose against Oregon Roxy watch again and Clark the offhand lob I mean thats his offand and he puts it up thats a dime for a dunk I mean what a tremendous effort Ryan agarwall three third three for agarwall well how good is Kyle Smith feel about that young man and the contributions hes made when the game has gotten tight hes hit some huge shots for Stanford 11 Stanford threes tonight back to a double digit lead inside seven minutes left open tied door set missing a three and oiah cers the rebound for the Cardinal nice pass Jaylen Blakes and Maxim Reno gets the roll but he did double duty there he sets the screen sheds a Defender for Blakes and then he rolls and hes the recipient of the of the of the pass and could have been a threepoint play great effort by Maxim Reno to get himself involved in the offense but Clark weaving his way to the basket and finishes over Maxim REO thank you very much no problem no fear no problem Stanford still has to score Roxy they cant relax here its still a you know a double digit lead but one basket could change that in a hurry six 20 point point game this year for Bud Clark and Jaylen Thompson the back tap oiah sers finds Ryan agar wall a great look by osiah sers hes done some great things today tonight Roxy sers has just made some huge plays for his team Matt Beck missing the three and Maxim Reno pulls it down inside 5 and 12 minutes and a 12point lead for the Cardinal they LED by as many as 19 in the first half and a foul as Jaylen Thompson got knocked down well I like Reno in the high post for a couple reasons number one he can shoot it from there so you have to guard a number two hes so big tall he can find people hes a very good passer look at the pocket pass its an excellent pass inside to Thompson great look by beon Reno AAC foul on TI Dorset Jaylen Thompson is one and one Tri to the line hes two for two from the line this year the one and one for the Cardinals they in the bonus the eighth marac team foul and the rebound grabbed by Brian itunu again Stanford still looking for that stop theyd like to pull away here but they better do something with Mr Clark Music Music good recovery defensively from Stanford as he tombed to the basket the scoop and on the offensive glass Bud Clark and one Roxy how does that happen youre the smallest player on the floor and you find a way to anticipate a missed shot he goes up among the Giants out leaps everybody scores it and gets a foul first trip to the line for Clark hes 89 this year and a chance for marac to cut into single digits yeah it might be my only criticism of Clark Roxy he shoots at 90 in the line but he doesnt get there so you know uh but hes so good at creating space theres just not a lot of contact there and he Nails the free throw 24 for Clark and whats amazing about his 24 points its on 16 shots from the floor four fouls by the way on Ryan agerwal now and its poked away and Clark came away with Applause Music it Devin Savage missing a three in the rebound theres osiah sers for Stanford Yeah March didnt quite look settle on that possession they they had numbers Roxy but they were in a hurry and didnt space properly now Stanford with a Chance again to pull away into double digits but the zone is you know been pesky continuing to be pesky R knows looking for lobs Ro hed like to get a hed like to get one over the top hes open on the Block Jaylen Blakes denied and hes out of bounds it belongs to miramac has coming over defensively Brian tumu who leads Marram in blocks this year adds to his total Stanford by n 4 minutes remaining in Maple on the Flor the score9 e e e e four minutes to go Stanford trying to end Marxs fourgame winning streak and the Cardinal looking for their third straight win and Stanford leading at 6960 Stanford trying to run their record to 9 and2 if they can finish off the Warriors here tonight and then the Cardinal down at the sap Center in San Jose on Saturday hook up with a former conference foe Oregon Dan almans ducks on Saturday a Shar tank a huge game but I can tell you this they better not look past this Warrior team that game will come when it comes but theyve got their hands full with the Warriors here what this teams just won four games rockxy and they played one of the better schedules uh you know so youve got to respect this team and you got to guard them and you also better respect Mr Clark with the ball here he is a a Phenom with the basketball here is Clark 24 points three assists tonight off a high screen and a deep three Matt Beck too long but the offensive Rebound miramac with it theres Bud Clark inside get to the cup man he might have got fouled too Roxy Stanford fortunate no foul call but you know theyve got to get back now they they got to try to put some pressure on marac to get a score and then get some stops chis aakar left it short and Ryan agarwall cant control it here comes butt Clark out of the pack Devin Savage missing a three and Maxim Reno rebound number 13 that would have cut it to five thats a big break for Stanford give Stanford Credit they at least hustled back in transition and snatched up and secured the rebound and an offensive foulon Blakes out top third on Jaylen Blakes well you can see it thats the push off and the contact Kyle Smith not debating that call uh again Stanford has to continue to play Roxy they they need to stop two and a half to go 240 theres time on the clock for this miramac Music Applause team step back bud Clark and oiah cers flies through the lane for the rebound for the Cardinal thats a good challenge by Stanford thats the one thing you can do youve got size Advantage but challenge up not out chisam Makara spins off Maxim Reno pulls it out of the crowd and a fresh 20 for the cardal yeah huge offensive rebound by Reno Ryan agarwall missing from the corner last Touch by marrat well bud Clark wants him to review this one uh you know hes feisty he said lets get a review and they can review it were inside the final two minutes I I know what he call by Bud Clark I mean you know you got the luxury of doing this Roxy doesnt hurt so Greg Nixon they will take a look at the monitor Greg working with Chris Mero and Jenna Reno are three officials tonight assigned by the call on the floor the Stanford basketball its under review thank you Greg yeah I like I like this Roxy fans sometimes dont because you say it stops the flow of the game but you dont want to give a team of ball when its not their ball you want to get the call right these calls are crucial and I I like that youre able to do this so Stanford uh hoping that the call will stick again theyre ruling on the floor with Stanford ball ball it was last Touch by miramac and it did appear right there to last touch Sean Trumper of miramac number 40 in blue yeah again the Roxy for our viewers its got to be overt turnable meaning its got to be obvious it cant be close its got to be something thats thats really uh strong in terms of having to overturn a call that stand thats been made to be definitive its definitive yeah and I dont think thats as you just said definitive so well see if the officials think like we think I dont see this getting changed and right there you see the hand of Trumper yep and thats who it appeared to go off of last which would mean a Stanford ball in the Baseline and 20 on the shot clock should the call either stand or get Applause confirmed now theyre on this longer than you than I thought I thought this would be a kind of quicker one but you know in all fairness to their credit they want to get it right so three officials theres always a tie that can be broken to see it one way one they want to see it one way see then the third one has to break the tie uh they dont have caucus here we got to you know this is not on the master board officials in the NBA you know you you you got Master you got this all over the country but here it is and theyre stand for ball yeah yeah theyre calling white ball stand I think Fs pointed the wrong direction cuz maramax said wait a minut you point it this way and again 20 on the shot clock for the Cardinal they swarm agarwall and Kyle Smith calls timeout before they can get the trap on Rox thats a good timeout because there was going to be a trap and so you called before the turnover potential turnover thats smart Co coaches now can call their own timeout so very uh opportune timeout like that smth to talk about this and try to keep it out of the corners timeout leads Kyle Smith with one maram has two a 30 and a full possession arrow favors Stanford and the team fouls eight on maram five on the cardland personal foul problems nobody with more than three from marac while for Stanford Ryan agarwall playing with four well your Stanford here Roxy theres just one order of business get the ball in bounds do not turn it over keep it out of the corners and try to get up a good shot percentage shot and if you dont hit it get back on defense you still have a lead youre up seven youre in good shape but dont turn it over dont give anything that would fuel the fire for Applause Music marman oiah sers spots up had a clean look but Clark the rebound and the diminutive point guard races up up the floor Clark off balance that time and Stamford finally got to him yeah well they there was a lot of numbers youre right Roxy they got back with a lot of numbers there were four Stanford Cardinals surrounding Clark on that last Applause possession Chism oara and it spins out after a beautiful feed from Maxim Reno Devin Savage had a good look at a three Chism Mo par the rebound approaching a minute to go Stanford in no hurry no despite the Cardinal missing their last six shots from the floor theyre going to try to exhaust some time here if they can Ryan agarwall cut to the basket Maxim Reno fouled on a put back and with 472 seconds remaining Reno will shoot two I like the action here you can see the cut Stanford doing a really good job of now spacing and then cutting out to the line third on Brian tumu and Maxim Mareno who is four for six from the line tonight 13 points 16 rebounds for rno yeah we say this might be an off night you know how many players go for 13 14 and in in those rebounds on on an off night on a good night let alone an off night so R know makes his you know Max makes his presence known in every game he plays one for two for Reno Bud Clark and he goes inside and one bud Clark again well hes telling everybody at home dont go away dont turn this game off because it aint over and look at this move Roxy how high does he Sky to go over the top of the Big Fellas of St for Big Time move Ryan agarwall fouls out at 374 Clark who is tied a season high of 28 he had 28 against UTSA earlier this year and his career best at 30 last year against St Francis yeah you can see how he just gives teams fits the way he can score it and thats a rare Miss from Clark and now Marxs going to have to foul and they do now thats what they have to do is again two possession game you dont let time go off the clock if it has to be a parade to the free throw line its so be it but you have to make Stanford convert their free throws and maybe only convert one and change a two for one or a three for two second foul and Matt Beck and Jaylen Blakes the double bonus shooting two 78 foul shooter Blakes 15 for Jaylen Blakes tonight along with seven rebounds five assists and he hits both free throws yeah nothings been easy for Stanford tonight Rock they played well but the problem is Marx played well and a foul and that will put miramac into the bonus so one and one thats the last thing Kyle Smith wanted to see now he you know he was upset because in the timeouts that you go over this these are game situ you say look youre up by six or eight whats rule number one dont foul and and and hes upset that his team did one more for Bud Clark now a season High 29 yeah you know you say well maybe a double team Clark get it out of his hands but hes so good hes pretty hard to Correll Roxy so theres a timeout by miramac theyre going to talk about that theyve cut this lead again and theyre going to hope that they can get just a couple more opportunities with maybe some Stanford misses or a turnover but its got to be quick cuz you dont have a lot of time left career high tying 30 now for Bud Clark and Stanford with a sixpoint lead you know 246 remaining each side is one timeout yeah at this point sometimes Rox you got to play the foul game and you got to know from scouting um you got to you got to know from scouting who your who your uh free throw guys are and so you know if if you if you got some people that maybe are are down on the free throw chart uh percentage wise you might have to give give up an early foul and put those guys at the line so lets see if thats part of the strategy that Joe Gallow inflores here and this is where the absence of Benny geler or Darren Saron really hurts you theyre good foul Shooters and an extra ball handler on the floor yeah no good point you forgot that they were down here long pass ahead for maxim Reno and they foul him with 173 remaining third on Matt Beck really smart play by the way from maxing he thought about making the pass to a cutting teammate Stinson underneath he just went to his Stinson and said look didnt wasnt sure and so if youre not sure keep the ball in your hands and shoot some free throws dont turn it over dont think that somebodys open know theyre open or hold on to it now its a three possession game as Reno hits the first one more six for nine from the line tonight and now 16 points for maxim Reno Bud Clark the scoop the roll a career best 32 timeout miramac yeah you know what whats your answer because he takes it right to the heart of you and you dont want to foul him stop the clock but he hes able to get his shot off just an incredible performance Roxy weve had a chance to see many guards come in here and play uh very few have put on the performance that bud Clark has put on and Stanford knows theyve been in a dog fight so Adam Bud Clark 32 points tonight I mean he shows you the ball he Scoops it uh and he whirls it and they just gets it off hes got tremendous touch off the glass but Stanfords you know done a pretty good job they they played inspiring basketball even though with a 10day layoff theyve shot the ball extremely well most teams dont come out of a 10day layoff Roxy shooting the ball the way Stanford did so thats a good sign it means they were at least in the gym getting shots up 84 remaining in a Stanford ball and a sixpoint lead and again next up for Stanford Saturday down in San Jose against Oregon part of a double header where Cal will play San Diego State in the other game at the Shark Tank well marac will stay here in the Bay Area and theyll slide over to Moraga to play St Marys Thursday night this two game Bay Area road trip for the marac Warriors they have not shied away from playing a schedule I give Joe Gallo credit people say why do you play such a tough schedule you want to toughen your guys up you get into League Play Roxy these games will come back and benefit you believe me Joe Gallow knows what hes doing hes been a winner to every stop and hes uh hes he knows how to build championship teams Jaylen Blakes will toss it in he can run the Baseline after the made basket and raino just holding and its out of bounds off marac and it stays with Stanford 39 remaining well the the the the outcome of the game going to be pretty much uh without question I think Stanford just without a turnover and now marac will not foul thatll do it three straight wins the Cardinal now nine and two but they got all they could handle tonight from marac despite a CB best 32 from Bud Clark
