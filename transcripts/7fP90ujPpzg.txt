for Tony Bennetts Virginia Cavaliers Kihei Clark has been there and done that Rhys Beekman Armon Franklin Gardner and vanderplas has been really good in this his grad season the transfer from Ohio University and thats been the big change here for vanderplas in the starting lineup they found this lineup when Armando Baker was hurt in the North Carolina game Virginia went small Tony Bennett liked what he sees with this starting lineup surprise the one Applause offense four and six in League Play but back to back doubledigit wins the most recent wins a win coming against Louisville on Wednesday and automatically Virginia coming with the big double team across and they get the turnover wow 20 seconds of offense and not a shot on goal you know what happens Eric when you when youre having a good streak the Scotty report catches up either Quentin post a month ago that wouldnt have happened but now he gets respect and he turns it over so Virginia their first crack at it Reese Speakman brings it over the timeline commanderbloss back to Beekman Applause hes been waiting first shot of our ball game Kihei Clark puts it up thats a guy you want to gamble with him early through Boston College make him make some shots I mean hes not into the hives hes a low percentage shooter Applause Zachary post so he can fire it up from up there well and thats why Vander blouse is a good matchup for him outside he can defend him on the three and thats the second turnover for post in this game Boston College has had the ball for about 45 seconds worth of offense and they havent attempted a shot yet theres Earl Grant short list of one of the best dressed coaches in the entire country is Earl Grant and I like the coating pie all right I like the suit actually I was marveling at his socks earlier today shot is missed from distance and now lets see if Boston College can get a shot its a bottom of the third inning and its still zero zero played it 90 seconds Boston College has yet to shoot theres their first shot and its up and good score of the goal Makai has to Langford well hes been honored Tara lately uh 20 and a half points his last two games good solid Drive good take inside no shot blocker out there for Virginia foreign Music keys to the game 12 for Boston College especially in Virginias offense they want to try to guard and they must guard that weak side with all the motion in uh for Virginia theyve been sharing the ball Eric they assist on 67 percent of their made field goals which is unreal somewhere at John Friday beaming yes sir down in Miami and Armon Franklin his first bucket and hes been really steady for this team hes uh double figures and eight straight also rebounding pretty well heres post oh he traveled again shuffled the shoes too much of a hurry thats now three turnovers on BC you know the the threes that hes been making were catch and shoot threes not putting it on the floor got himself in trouble with the dribble my coach has always got a little tense when I started to put the ball in the floor here kind of ambitious for a sevenfooter yes sir 20 feet away from the cups tied it two two and a half minutes into our game skip pass Clark three balls made him pay now a better place has a smaller cover on him so they they doubled off of Clark to try to take a chance with that jump shot he makes him pay lets see if that double team changes again posts big part of the offense they dump it down to the big man and hes fouled Franklin got it Applause heres the lookout and this is one of the other things Tony Bennett likes with vanderplas in there hes an excellent passer good find thats just knowing where your teammates are going to be spotting up on the wheat side so post Elite at the freethrow line hes only missed once so far this season hes 22 out of 23 weve gone on and on about his offense and weve uh weve talked about a threepoint shooting but youre right he has been Stellar here clearly doesnt have enough attempts to qualify missed a large chunk of the beginning part of the season but he has been Sensational Now 23 for 24 at the line first substitution of the game coming in for Virginia Isaac McNeely he can really shoot Eric hes got a great stroke hes really as a freshman as earned playing time for Tony Bennett West Virginia is McNeely 41 shoot from behind the arc 30 for 72 this is McNeely Applause shoot along too but a great pump fake that time youve got to come out under control and close out almost got another travel call on him but instead hes gonna have free throws we get to Marvel at this free throw stroke for two more attempts now normally if it gets Virginia and somebody off the dribble somebody would be there in the lane area and I think vanderplast was expecting that and just McNeely just kind of the wave right there he needs to come over and get his body in front man I love this free throw Im a big fan of a good free throw and that is a great free throw Music just is now 25 for 26 on a season at the line yeah especially from uh you know a guy whos going to be touching the ball a lot in your offense they really use him either scoring inside or working off of him Francisco capro has just checked in first time weve seen the red Church Senior from Argentina and hes a guy this is because of post that hes in there he wouldnt be in normally in this game this early Tony Bennett wanted to get some size and toughness in there Clark got clobbered and hell go to the free throw line thats the second foul on Ashton Lankford and Earl Clark Earl Grant has the decision to make and the decisions already been made Mason Matson has gone to the scores table and hell more than likely to come in for Ashton Lankford and Eric behind post hes been their leading scorer lately so thats a thats a big foul situation for BC to contend with Applause when I was home I even liked noise I dont like I didnt like quiet when I was there this isnt golf I love to talk Music oh my goodness it gets quiet in here so it is a 96 lead for Virginia Matson did indeed come in for Ashton Langford Applause Curry oh thats nice but you know he may be more comfortable playing against copper that time he had set the high screen rolled in low and got great position hes got six of eight for Boston College Gardner the turnaround pretty move Applause theyve really done a nice job of finding some mismatches inside and Gardner they they need him Eric to score and get back hes been under double figures four of his last six two more Boston College has not missed a shot from the field theyve only taken three but theyre three for three four and a half minutes into our game Applause Clark missed onehanded rebound post uh and you know its and thats a good sign for him post started the game very dodgy he goes turnovers to travel Id say hes settled in though he has shot the ball four six times four free throws two shots in the field hes made them all come on oh my goodness Clinton post everything he throws up goes through and were with a bigger cover he can go out and stretch a little bit take the shot big run Big Time range looking like some old school Ralph Sampson back here in Charlottesville Applause and were tied at 13 Reese Beekman in the bucket Taylor Swift special right now with our score an offensive game is broken out here Eric against two very good defensive teams in over the posts oh my goodness Quinton post have it afternoon big man he has not missed so far Tony Bennett just shaking his head looking his assistant sir all right whats the next move here 14 of the 16 for BC Eagles of the threepoint lead wheres post Madsen thats the first Miss for Boston College and why is anybody other than Quentin post taking a jump shot right now who would have thought the Boston College would roll into Charlottesville and not miss a shot for the first six minutes and 20 seconds Applause you know momentum is a real thing and this team has not felt as good about itself all year long last two wins and the NBA couldnt post to get a heat check right now hes allowed to shoot wherever he wants and the steal poked Away by Gardner one man to beat and he beats him thats what you have to be careful with that Virginia is so good and playing the lanes getting a handout and Franklin a nice job and they go all the way to the we may go all the way into half without a break here post oh his first Miss and that was halfway down so theres his heat check he does have 14 points already folks havent made it to our first commercial break McNeely blocked by the equipment theyre trying to be aggressive inside to get some fouls on post but hes been clean so far Applause a league Bay steps inside the line and swishes the night team Twitter so offense not a problem right now for BC and they look extremely comfortable which is very unusual in this building for an opponent here theyre playing the way that uh their head coach Earl Grant dresses impeccably Applause Cavaliers down three Applause well Off the Mark by Beekman but it stays with Virginia cashing in his Gardener PC fell asleep on the long rebound that time the perimeter guys have to hang in there weve been a long time without a break weve gone under the 12minute mark and still havent had a chance for a blow all right now we could all get a cool drink of water how about the play of Quentin post for Boston College uh hes just been exceptional we talked about him being in Heights and uh getting in and off the dribble and also being able to step down and knock down the three what an afternoon Virginia by a point 11 38 remaining in our first half here in Virginia they use words like the deer which is the bottom part wasnt a deer for the Boston College Eagles would be January 17th at UNC when they didnt make a three thats the last time they lost look what theyve done recently Mike oh I was at that game Eric and uh you know it just wasnt part of their Arsenal then but you know with post getting better he was actually hes been the one whos been setting the tone from behind the arc for this team six of ten in the last two games thats not counting his start today all right so Boston College they break the Huddle and Quentin post is not in the game and thats what the Eagles are missing out on he is uh only missed one shot he made all four of his free throws and hes dealing with a mask on his face which has got to be a little bit uh uncerting yeah well he played with it last year uh so theres a familiarity its a custommade mask hes used to it got hurt in the Louisville game L Ellis with an inadvertent elbow uh doesnt seem to have affected his vision so far with another timeout coming quickly Eric its a good time to buy him some minutes on the bench in the first half Mason Matson his first triple so buying some time right now with post on the bench BC leads by four changes for both sides into the game Ryans done hes got the ball on the wing Clark cranes in the game to run the point Jason McNeely Caden Shedrick in as well McNeely good strong drive for the freshman shooter and thats a good you know good alternative to that its going to set up his jump shot by being able to drive changes for Boston College Chaz Kelly is the game TJ Bickerstaff as well as Devin McLaughlin this is bickers death dribbled it off his foot still a ton of time on that shot clock Madson made a bomb a moment ago McLaughlin did extra pass bigger step tonight wonderful team defense by Virginia well and its a shot clock violation and its a good thing they let him play on because Virginia got possession didnt take that away from him and were tied at 21 Blackjack here in Charlottesville another another freshman out there Dunn has been playing great these last few games nobody put a body on him he had a free run thats it now Vickers that pass knocks out of bounds by Clark and weve got a Timeout on the floor it is hot it is heavy here in Charlottesville look out for Ryan in that its a done deal hide at 21 pretty rich tradition of winning that Tony Bennett has added to sure has the only year that Ralph Sampson was not the national player of the year was the year that you were playing against him here in the ACC he kept him down just a little bit well right now theyre theyre probably thinking the Clinton posters the national Player of the Year of the way he started out and he still out of this game the only guy whos been able to defend him is Earl brands is getting off the bench and hell come back in McNeely gets it over to Beekman in the corner this is Franklin thats a three ball Armon Franklin you know beekmans a great playmaker in his own right hes got some size he can see over people and they they know theyve got a shooter spotting up in the weak side corner hes been relatively quiet here early in our game its in his Music room that is the fourth team foul on Virginia neither side anywhere close to the bonus Ill tell you what Eric its been a while since Tony Bennett has been comfortable with a couple of freshmen out on the floor but uh hes getting some great production out of McNeely and Ryan Dunn Applause back into the game Applause screen from Pope Zachary had to save it does shot clock down to three post what do you got not in time shot clock violation and the thing I love about this crowd Eric they count down when the shot clock is on the opponents back to let them know they have an appreciation for a defensive stand foreign normally you want the ball in the hands of a playmaker with the shot running down I thought post was going to be able to get something up both the Langford Brothers come back in Demar Langford and Makai Ashton Lankford back into the game Victor staff stays in with Zachary in post Virginia running without Clark on the floor moving the ball around that perimeter Beekman is the guy who makes the plays with Clark out done to Franklin shot clock down to five McNeely a grenade Applause not in time shot block violation McNeely had to pass that up theres two seconds left good luck this is what we thought wed see here these two teams very physical very defensive minded weve got two shot clock violations back to back nothing worse in the world of basketballs when your teammate passes you the ball with one second remaining on the shot clock thanks yeah thanks for nothing heres post its its been a short body of work but uh so far Shedrick has had the best success The Freshman has come in and energized This Crowd Langford missed the layup but gets it back for during this trying to leave it for Bickerstaff Ashton Langford delayed just a smidge stays with BC Applause on the Block this is John Langford tough chance and it goes to Mark Langford earned every bit of that well you know the Langford brothers are tall theyve got some size and BC will run them into the post great Fade Away jump shot Music Applause deflected stolen away by bickers Death and the pass stolen back by Dunn missed opportunity for BC it takes freshman a while to get used to this defensive system that Tony Bennett runs but that was a great job but done he got turned around quickly Eric saw the pass on the break Franklin Applause Boston College down three you see the Swagger that BC is playing with right now a ton of confidence Applause Scottys had this afternoon hes at least hoping for a foul get to the freethrow line where hes automatic Music first man down on the floor its Boston College Vickers down blocked from behind by Dunn that was clean what good athlete is Brian done Ryans done both ends of the floor doing it David Thompson impersonation hes a Skywalker Giants in the uh in the history of this league Ralph Sampson we actually ate at his restaurant last night here in town I drove past it and he came over we visited for a while first time Id seen him in a while hes doing very well what a kick from Harrisonburg Virginia and great food too my meal was five okay see very Scrappy they keep the basketball if youre if youre Tony Bennett too many offensive rebounds and second chances for BC pulse points 15 and 16 remember he got off to that great start and this is an official timeout some concern about tomorrow he was down on the floor hes hobbling off right now and hes gonna have to leave the ball game Mason Metz replaces him langfords a big part of the toughness that Earl Grant likes his team to play with hopefully hes okay all right for Virginia Kihei Clark is back into the ball game hes got the ball bringing over the timeline weve been starting lineup back on the floor now bumping against the league Bay no whistle we play on score the goal and that was his first basket too thats a big breakthrough for him he needs to get involved in the offense maybe that gets him in some sort of rhythm yeah that reached big fire mentioned that a couple of times use these Super Salad both ends of the floor but hes not exactly who will not hunt his shot really nice post defense by vanderplas that time Zachary does average 10 points per game see him go off in years past usually shoots a good ball but hell do other things there I mean he did not score big in the North Carolina game but was very important part of what they were doing but he is a very capable threepoint shooter its looking at his Lane he does have four assists he got 15 minutes into our game he does other things post I will say this even when he misses it looks like its going in all right Ben vanderplas did a nice job at least he got a hand up and thats where Virginias trademark on defense High hands you have to bother the shot Zachary almost had a steal Beekman almost steals turn into baskets for this Virginia team whos uh very fortunate they missed one possession game DC down three a league Bay well these days been quiet as well I like him hes got some good size stays with the Cavaliers Franklin and weve got a foul called against Boston College hell be shooting three big mistake defensively Fresh Market presets to discover the best this is what uh Tony Bennetts Club has done they lead the ACC in scoring defense whats new they win by a nice margin and then usually shooting really good three pointers close to 40 percent as a team well in his and his team in uh you know the assist they dont make mistakes they dont turn the ball over an incredible assist the turnover ratio and and then the last time that this team and that gentleman when they won their National Championship it was his best scoring team and they were also this is the best threepoint shooting team hes had since that group so everyone always says defense wins championships youre not coming thats not the clown Tony Bennett all of his his defense is there all the time its when theyve been able to score them but when they score in the 70s they are very very tough to beat El Arman Franklin is from Indianapolis Indiana and theres a general rule if you played high school ball in Indiana you better hit your free throws and he does he hits all three and its the largest lead of the game for Virginia theyre up by six Jazz Kelly the third back in he gets it to Zachary and look how far Virginia makes you start your offense youre 25 feet away from the cup there are very few easy catches in the offense and this and now Virginia amped up their pressure a little bit Madson left alone thats a mistake cant catch in theyre gonna get looks I mean theyre committed to double teaming in on post so if he finds the open shooter theyve got to step up and knock shots down oh vanderbols rebited by the smallest man on the floor Gardner how about Kia Clark you talking about 510 gets the rebound dribbles into the paint and finds a shooter thats a winning type of play one of the great winners yes sir he is a winner oh my miscommunication another turnover Virginias on a 70 run how about Kihei Clark all of them just kidding by Kai Ashton Langford hes their second leading scorer too theyre actually surviving pretty well without him his brother Demar is back into the game a little bit of concern when he left a moment ago Mar Lankford back in uh first time were seeing CJ Pena Pena wears number 24 for Boston College I think the uh the foul trouble by Ashton Langford has given him some time here in the first half a chance for Zachary thats just his second field goal attempt hes scoreless no points here we talked about other things three rebounds four assists for him but uh they need him to get some points in the half step in Franklin rings the bell why is this arm on Franklin you know its funny you know hear his name alive ACC but hes playing at a high level you know none of Tony Banks players are ever going to be in the top 15 in scoring but Im on Franklin is Quest really well post and the worm has turned he was hitting everything early and hes been slow still has 16 points but the Lions chair coming in the first handful of minutes Applause takes it away its a couple of Big Blocks in this game and thats not the tallest guy on the floor but good timing Applause host exit pushes off to get the basketball we play on man they have really bottled him up CPI Security protecting the paint well I dont know that wed uh you know wed pick Mason Madsen for this coming into the game Eric but you know nice finish right there nice recovery Applause start down the other end but I got to say that this and the Virginia gets a turnover this this last stretch where Virginias made a run here they played Virginia Defense they werent doing that in the first eight minutes of the game that is the eighth turnover for Earl Grants BC Eagle just four for Virginia big difference Gardner Clark Applause foreign Applause Music Boston College played well right out of the gate but lately its been all Virginia Applause Cavaliers lead by 10 Applause Pena able to get through a Thicket of cavalier Defenders for his first field goal a bunch of white jerseys in there as well able to finish against that defense good coach good caught it with both feet in the paint difference between the game clock and the shot clock is about two seconds Tony Bennetts team usually pretty good thats figuring out how to end halves Im gonna go for another you know the clock continues to run too sober shot goes up and goes through Music oh just as I spoke fifth turnover yeah the Cavaliers leave some meat on the bone so Boston College understanding that this is a gift getting the ball back with 68 theyre going to draw up a Play Earl Grant trying to capitalize on the fact that Virginia who normally plays the ends of halves very well didnt that time committing the turnover and leaving a lot of time for BC to do something well and the thing too when we talked to BC about Ashton Langford with the three personal fouls hes gonna have to be very careful when he comes back in the second half not picking up that fourth early and they miss his scoring BCs got to find that second third guy in this game looking at the numbers for BC so far through our first half theyve got 27 points and well over half of those points have come from Quick post whos got 16 but 14 to those 16 came in the first eight minutes of the game well and if you see two that the threepoint shot has dried up for BC in this last stretch as well he post made a couple early but since that time they have not found Mark then matter of fact theyve only attempted eight in the half for those who like free throws we have not had a free throw Miss today nine for nine combined free throw line here comes Langford in a hurry oh a turnover Beekman fires It Up From Beyond half court and the shot cannot find purchase and thatll do it for our first half of play Tony Bennetts team took a couple of punches but they end the half on an uptick they lead by eight through the first 20 minutes when we come back the Toyota halftime report me Mason Madsen beginning the second half for Boston College so thats a different wrinkle thing is Eric theyve got to get some production out of Zachary and Elite Bay those guys combined for a couple of points in the first half and theyve got to support post they need second and third scoring in Evans thats Quinton post no one on Boston College had more than one field goal hard to win that way and a reach in foul were gonna have free throws for Reese Beekman theres Demar Lincoln see the ice on the knee minute you got ice youre done ice cools things down and you gotta stay hot loose ice manger done all right neither side Mr free throw in our first half and that Trend continues technique been normally pretty good at the line 82 percent Junior from Bechtel Rouge Louisiana from Red Stick Louisiana if you will and you know the thing is about Erica you know we talked about Clinton post and his scoring and but right now Virginia outscoring BC in the paint area so theyve got a five they got to the freethrow line off that last Drive theyve been working inside Applause great job of following in that time and thats what uh Earl Grant told us that post gives him that element I believe the defense collapses on him and that was a terrific find thank you Gardner faces up on post and hits it and we talked about it and then look at Clark just immediately going to defense Applause they caught Boston College napping and they cost him three points all that is is immediately turning to defense as soon as your possession is over with Clark did it got the pass makes a play and this is a big start for Virginia yeah well combined both sides jupited like JJ Redick at the freethrow line we have not had a missed free throw so far in our first 21 minutes Music Madison a league bang Ashton Langford oh howd that pass get through score the goal Quinton posts thats the one thing with Vander plow so he can take him inside they threw over cut the top a couple of times in that first half hes got great position hell vanderplas off Music Virginia Cavalier team has won five consecutive Boston College theyve won two straight both their wins have been by double digits about Mr Gardner Jaden Gardner the turnaround well we talked about his average six points in his last six they needed a breakout for him and maybe this is the game that does it for him Ashton Langford Madson largest lead of the day 13 for Virginia wonderful catch in traffic hands like vice grips and Gardner will go to the line Erica its really been a concerted effort by Virginia to attack the rim here early on theyre getting to the freethrow line theyre putting Boston College in foul trouble thats the one thing hes you know Gardner undersized a little in this league but uh very strong wide body Applause hanging by a thread Gardner just 60 as a free thrower but the first one crawls in Springfield streak is in doubt right now this is a very quietest crowd that Ive ever heard BC in trouble right now down 15 Ashton Langford muscles it through thats a big shot for him big three for him to step up not the scorer that his brother is with uh may have to you know get back into the swing of things and you know be careful with those three fouls the way rumors if they Applause a hurricane nothings easy for post ever since that beginning of the game Onslaught lazy pass picked off she just cant try that pass against the Cavaliers missed opportunity on the other end all right Ashley Langford a nice job defensively and he gets the foul out front Clark thousand talked about his foul trouble and him scoring get back into rhythm going to be a big part of the second half for BC chance Kelly is going to come in he replaces Madsen and hes getting some of the minutes tomorrow Langford would normally get with him being out Jayden Zachary and inbound the ball averages 106 points per game hes only attempted two shots today on cue theres his third shot in this first make he heard you there he was talking about it was quiet in here the PC well he needed that to get some rhythm in his own right PC needs to now they need a couple of stops on this and keep people out of the paint modest 50 runs for BC Clark does it by himself well they did a nice job they cut off the drive but Clark creates a little separation and gets a nice jump shot foreign Applause Applause ER his third dunk of the game Eric that was a half pass half shot he just wanted to get it up on the rim he knew he had rebounding help you give him half an assist for that button college has to call a timeout they thought they were doing good work but then this happens Jaden Gardner 5036 our score is your score Virginia hanging a half a hundred on BC they lead 5036 1523 remaining in our ball game Blue Cross and Blue Shield North Carolina presents the upper schedule for the seventh ranked Cavaliers well you look at this uh the score of this game Eric 14 points may not be a massive leave against some teams against this team it is a big lead a good this is an important fourminute stretch for Boston College right here DC brings in experience team James Bickerstaff wearing number one into the contest and a foul called on Virginias three Speakman weve got an official Timeout on the floor well be back in a moment entire college career so lets step on here what happened yeah I just changed Direction too quickly and fractured the sesamoid bones in my left foot in the so two games later they taped me up and I played the whole rest of my career but the fabulous fabulous atmosphere and you know when you guys guys like Jeff lamp and Lee raker and Ralph Sampson makes it a tough home court Ralph Sampson in the building this afternoon making the game extra special BC down 14 Clinton coach that was automatic back in the early part of our first half I think he needs to work hes only got two points so far in this half Eric I think he needs to get back into the paint tried to do some work there then Bill back out to the three Gardner and Beekman have combined for 13 of his 15 second half points for Virginia standard block got a smaller cover on the switch okay you know on the double team inside he had a clean look vickers dead how did Virginia lose track of him and normally they dont let people get behind them on uh breakouts like that thats as easy a basket as youre gonna get in this building first bucket for bickers Dad transfer from Drexel Music come on Clark missed with the left hand 12 point game oh post turn the wrong way looked like Ashton Lakes was trying to lead into the basket He Slipped the screen that time as a design play to have that happen he just got turned around you know would have been right in his hands Applause Franklin a step back DC playing without Demar links were suffering a right knee contusion in the first half these are 10 amazing things had a couple of empty possessions for Virginia so its an opportunity for Boston College to carve into that lead Applause Bickerstaff bully ball he was tied up alternate possession arrow keeps it with Boston College really nice defense funneling him to the Baseline and runs out a room really really solid foreign ers Gonna Leave the game to a Heroes welcome hes been Sensational here in our second half but how about you you take him out and Ryan Dunn comes in who was a highlight reel in the first half a couple of dumps score the goal with a foul Makai Ashton Lankford and that was a miscommunication on that inbounds play Thats Another breakdown that you normally dont see with Virginia and uh it looked like he a Clark was talking to him hes talking to McNeely on that play yeah hes got to know that he got to defend that pass into the middle that was too easy we have not seen a missed free throw in our ball game that is now 1515 combined and an official timeout and you know and turn all this Kihei Clark is still teaching McNeely about that last defensive play Luther Delaney was pointing guys that this is where you need to stop McNeely would have been in Middle School When Kia Clark started playing here at Virginia all right I think VA Clark is dean of students now hes been here that long Devin McLaughlin has come in for Boston College he wears number 21 post is out of the game and a foul called on TJ bickers dad 14 foul and thats the impressive thing about Virginia theyve really on their defense they dont foul theyre very physical they dont have a lot of fouls called on them good catch by vanderblock supposed to turn over and now it is a turnover Eric you know sometimes the possession is destined to be a turnover that looked like one in the developing Applause theres like right from here just kind of a miscommunication in Clark was going into the middle tried to save it at least at least for Virginia its a dead ball turnover you can get back and set your defense up Chaz Kelly starts the offense and passes knocked away we play on night kickball and theres your turnover Dunn takes it away from McLaughlin McNeely I want the Frenchman not giving up on that play they did a nice job stopping done but he came racing up the middle Applause fast break point for Virginia theyve won that battle this afternoon you got the sense especially on offense that Virginia has gotten BC sped up in the half court foul inside so well have free throws coming for it McLaughlin theres a welcome uh you see good anticipation that time dont know about the blocks and then getting out in the open floor making a steal but two freshmen connecting on that play free throw streak on the line right now combined 16 for 16 this afternoon going to leave along with Vander block Shedrick comes back in for Virginia Applause not a bad stretch right now for BC it was the game was in a little bit of a Tipping Point a 14point lead weve cut it back down to nine nice job winning this block of time 12 minutes to play the first of two meetings Daniel make a return trip up to BC later on this season and they dont know Earl Grant was pointing that the sideline would breached he helped the officials with that call and he is happy right now Boston College make it a comeback outside facing up shooting the jump shot he really has found a nice Rhythm Eric uh double figure score 167 of 10 for the game six rebounds and also a nice job on the other end of the floor as well Applause 21 minutes of court time for Gardner averages 10 points already in 16 this afternoon Music most though hes been destroyed for Boston College he came right out of the shoot with his hair on fire 14 points in the first six minutes of our first half but Virginia has figured him out only four points since propose and they gave him a lot of different looks later on in that first half they went with some size they went back to vanderplas hes done a better job in this half weve only had the one live in and you got Shedrick in the game now so theyre going to put some more size for him when he comes back in the game Music BC basketball ninepoint game Applause Langford to Kelly lost it on the way up vickerstaff saves saves the BC Applause Ashton Langford hit the underside of the rim there are not a lot of scorers out on the floor for BC right now to put a lot of pressure on Ashton Langford how committed you call it on Devin McLaughlin has a famous tie to the ACC uncle is Chester with locked in AllAmerican defensive tackle and Clemson back in the day uhoh a breach defensively allows Franklin to get to the rim weve seen a breach on an underneath out of bounds for BC and now weve seen one on the other and Virginia getting yeah much too easy back screen up top no weak side help of course team dunks for Virginia couple in the first half by Ryan Dunn Applause Kelly offensive rebound Ashton Langston cant get the follow biggerstaff he cant hit it either missed opportunity oh a twopoint blank shots and uh I mean thats what quicker staff does he climbs all over the offensive glass just couldnt get it to drop Cedric Franklin see I you know you cant double off him I mean I know theres a big guy inside but youre going to take you got to take your chances with somebody and I would rather do it with Cedric than letting him have a clean look lead back up to 14 three eagles waiting at the scores table next whistle theyll come in shot clock down to two and a turnover heres a look you see everybody wants that that one on the floor and hes got he doesnt have to be guarded by three guys especially after he picked up his dribble stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer that is coming up theyve got 9 55 remaining Clinton post back into the game along with Jaden Zachary and CJ Pena foreign Music theyve got great ball handlers out there done he showed me something wow just a freshman came in every is going to change in the years to come and you know what Eric his his stuff is loud too I mean his his points in first half were incredible Applause keeps it with the eagles post well I tell you well Virginia you know solid defense but theyre flirting with it a little bit with the offensive rebounds BC just hasnt converted right now Applause Beekman Franklin getting shot from that spot a moment ago gets his own Miss paying you close out but he didnt block him out Beekman with the left hand pretty move and the lead is now 18 for the home team and uh hes their third double figure score so Virginias got nice balance in the scoring column BC still at just 43 points their offense has stalled nothing easy Ashton Langford tough reverse layup and that kind of Drive is awfully difficult against this defense he made that play out of nothing weve got a timeout 804 remaining in our ball game BC do they have another run in them we shall see Music but he tracked her turning point and what Virginia has done here in the second half to get the offensive gear yeah it really started that the easy inbound play by Armon and Franklin and uh just so smooth so disciplined nice pump fake knock down the three puts it on the floor just as well and Beekman finishing with his left hand Applause Tony Bennett looking for career win number 400 and one got that 400th win couple of days ago a win would get him to 332 wins as head coach at Virginia now in his 14th year here at Charlottesville Virginia with the basketball and the lead under eight minutes to play done Chris Franklin McNeely wonderful play on the offensive end for Virginia there it is we talked about the defending the weak side for Boston College they got stuck in rotation on the pass into the post lead is now 19 for the Cavaliers trying to get to 82 in conference a leak Bay Zachary Applause post thats a travel its the fourth time hes traveled oh my goodness no theyre going to call it was a foul before the shot on Shedrick okay and uh he gets really bailed out here heres the look and this this youngster right now you know the thing about Virginia the third oldest team in the country this year as far as experience but theyre two freshmen have been terrific great Point yeah youre right Don and McNeely future bright Boston College is going to make a change Pena Leaves Madison replaces him Ill tell you what the brazilians got another one waiting in the Williams Leon Bond Richard is what I saw him practice yesterday hes going to be awfully good Ashton Langford got thrown to the floor Shedrick called for the foul thats number two on Shedrick Applause foreign thats the sixth team foul in Virginia so one more and BC will be in the bonus you may need this BC needs this game to slow down they need to get into that bonus and get to the freethrow line thats had left it short for Virginia unless theyve got a an easy boost early theyre going to be very methodical running their offense they havent really looked at the basketball halfway through the shot clock Franklin knows Cedric yes fifth dunk for Virginia you know its good to see him out there his minutes have dried up since theyve gone small but uh staying with it being active he gives them a different element obviously out there but he gives him a shot blocker and points on the offensive glass oh thats a mistake by Shedrick his third foul and now bonus for BC this again that was a shot knowing theres a guy right in front of the room in case you miss if it goes in good if not I got the follow dunk thats the seventh foul in the officials take note well have a one and one Music so now the perfect afternoon weve had at the free throw line is in doubt a one and one both sides are combined 1717 the freethrow line and hey now a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you gotta have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo Mike jaminsky our free throws ever contagious for both teams and one two seat in a great ball the other team as well I think I think good offense makes or just as contagious whether its threes or things youre rolling for you certainly free throws but you know what theres a couple theres a weakness with Virginia theyre not a great free throw shooting team theyre good and that rebounding are two areas that really that they need to shore up somewhat that went off the foot of Beekman its a turnover Virginia as a team 10 for 10 at the freethrow line Boston College has a team nine for nine at the freethrow line Applause I think just for fun Im gonna look to see who had a better freethrow stroke in the NBA you or uh Tony Bennett you guys played together for a while in Charlotte with the Hornets and that may be fun with numbers well be back with that in a little bit folks Mike jaminski the seven footer okay Bennett the little guard whos a better free thrower steal by Madsen and oh you cant pick it up and start dribbling again John Gaffney has done a whole bunch of college games over the years and he has done the Mets and son doesnt work that way yeah the margin Pereira really thin right now and you get a turnover like that you have to convert it to points if youve got an easy offensive rebound youve got to get those and uh PC trying to talk about theyre going to push the pressure after this Virginia team is a very good ball handling team Franklin McNeely Clark Gardner and done playing together for the Cavaliers seventh ranked team in the country look Clark going down in the low block Sarah midranger Im making the play Applause Ashton Langford Applause thats a tough chance with the left hand Clark forced him to do something he didnt want to Applause great catch by Doug I dont know how he even caught that unbelievable gets I hit the backboard the net and he still caught it somehow Applause McNally I tell you what he has got a sweet stroke Eric and youre talking about his free throw shooting hes six of 22 coming into this game from the twopoint line oh I dont know why hes even shooting inside Applause post bodies flying what do we got okay so we can keep our free throw streak going with one of the best free throwers in the country post will go to the line heres the yeah he never really got squared up on that time was kind of turned laterally and uh you know post has shown the ability he can take the ball off the dribble all right theres no way that our free throw streak ends now with Coast at the line were a combined 19 for 19 post has only missed once on the year and its like butter post is five for five today that means he is now 27 for 28 at the line you know if were in my days in the NBA if somebody broke the streak they could find oh how do you hit the rim thats a seven foot human being hes pure Applause final 4 15 Music mcdealys best story as of late long two and hurry up he ought to put him that guy can play some offense well you know what thats the best of all worlds if youre defending him make him take a long two instead of a three but uh White his thinking score Applause time running out on BC largest deficit Zachary hes had a tough day offensively came in averaging 10 and a half points per game you mean probably not going to get there Music Applause Music Franklin and the offense in full throat for Virginia post great catch score the goal hes back at it you know terrific I mean game in general you come in here score 22 points but its been a quiet second half for him interior five Gardner get out most takes it from him and it goes off of The League base foot weve got a Timeout on the floor how about the Freshman McNeely stroking it hes got a full bag of offensive moves and most men uh in conference and overall they have to go and play against that zone of Syracuse and then back to the state of Virginia Tech starting to be healthy theyre going to be better down the stretch Music Boston College came into this game on a hot streak back to back wins both win by double digits and Virginias going deep into the bench yeah and well you know what this this team they scored 76 points they get up into this range they are virtually unbeatable Clarks still in the Ball Game shot take run down by Boston College posts still in there thats a seven foot human being making that move thats impressive oh whats a Tommy heinsman kind of running hook good reference going way back Holy Cross Chase Coleman has checked into the game for Virginia and now timeout as both sides are going to go deep into their bench entertainment lets take a look here for Boston College coming into the ball game for the first time we have got uh Andrew Kenny he wears number 23 into the game Quinn Pemberton he wears number 30 and number two Armani Mighty into the game Mighty number two from Toronto Ontario Applause Kane Murray Murray right there number 10 Shedrick mentioned before that last time out we were talking about free throw shooting and how important it is to win at the uh any level of basketball we talked about the importance for Tony Bennett over the years his team makes free throws Tony Bennett could not hold a candle when it came to you Mike Kaminsky in making free throws and looked at the numbers you played close to a thousand NBA games 842 is what you shot as a professional at the free throw line three points Anna you know I had to take him any way I could get them and uh for most of the teams I played with I shot technicals too so now Tony Bennett not bad but nowhere close to GMan territory 732 I bet if you ask his team with the importance that he stresses on free throws I bet if you went to anyone in the team and said what do you think your coach shot at three through line theyd probably say 95 no 732 we played with a pretty good shooter around right in Charlotte too Mr Curry your normal partner in the Hornets games Dell Curry can make a free throw yes he could he could make a three as well Boston College LED for a chunk of our first half because they got that great offensive start Quentin post uh scores 14 of the first 16 points for BC but then the typical defense that Virginia plays ramped it up a bit and it has been all Virginia here in the second half you know Ive talked about the rebounding but uh you know a big advantage in this game Eric Second Chance points 154 for the Cavaliers also 14 points off turnover so those are the areas that they usually win during the course of the game especially the points off turnovers Andrew Kenny from Seattle Washington I like the routine hes got to make a lot of free throws you got yourself a good routine well hopefully the injury to Jamara Langford wont keep him out for an extended period of time usually it was a big part of missing in that second half especially in the defensive end game on Tuesday back at home against Clemson for Boston College back to Boston today in plenty of time we love noon games love the early start I didnt like him so much as a player all right it took me a little while to get going two oclock was about a good early start for me this Virginia team was a little sluggish in the first couple minutes of this game but a completely different story since then gonna get some burn right here hey bataya is a junior from Bethlehem Pennsylvania hey thats fitting weve talked about Billy Packer passing away on Tuesday Billy Packer from Bethlehem Pennsylvania so many wonderful stories uh his head coach McKinney and making fun of the fact that he is from Bethlehem Pennsylvania and now a guy from Bethlehem Pennsylvania comes into an ACC game thats really cool hey bataya thank you for being Bethlehem and thank you for coming into the game and you know and I said it and you know Billy would not like the fact that were talking as much as we are about him hes like all right yeah great Im gone you know I had a good run just you know the humility that he had it was always about the sport it was never about him during a broadcast Coleman Applause IA comes down with a rebound I say get it to a tie Music this is the tire our final shot of the game wasnt meant to be so congratulations to the Virginia Cavaliers theyre going to prove to 163 on the season theyre going to go to 82 in conference play the seventh ranked Virginia Cavaliers do it again a couple of days to enjoy their next tip will be in central New York taking on the Syracuse Orange on Monday well just a you know both ends of the floor are really solid dude this team scoring 76
