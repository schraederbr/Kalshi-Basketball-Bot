rebounded in a major way from the disappointment of last year where they went from preseason number one to out of the tournament Pittsburgh won both meetings a year ago and the Panthers have taken five of the last six and pit wins the tit Ted Valentine Lee Cel BR o Connell are officials as the Panthers control to the home whites heres guo Diaz Graham making another start into the Pittsburgh lineup for his fourth start of the year and Armondo Bott draped all over H Lake Hinson now the Panthers leading score third leading score in the ACC will kick it to Diaz Grant who misses a three and the rebound to Harrison Ingram the Stanford transfer for North Carolina strong defensive stand for the tario early when you got play against North Carolina youve got to be used to their transition they run after makes and misses that time GMO up with a challenge at The Rim block shot on corack right of the jumpers good for M Le you see the starting five for pent Le and Austin two impact transfers for the the Panthers a pit team 9 and four which has dropped its first two ACC games and they are desperate for Marquee win Carolina starting five you saw a moment ago this is Cormac Ryan the grb transfer for M Dame on the floor with Ingram Bott The Freshman Elliott Cano and RJ Davis and the heels have two empty trips to start well Ryan shooting 29 from three and you can see early what Jeff Cap was willing to give on the defensive end he does not want Davis o bot getting those looks there Le it around Bon the left hand score and ishmail Le it the Rhode Island transfer with the first two pit buckets and leg it off to a great start he gives Jeff capable that experience in the back court to go alongside the super freshman we talked about in car so North Carolina team leading the ACC and scoring 863 points per game and here is Davis their leading scorer an open floater around it out and no offensive rebounds so far for Carolina as leged controls for the Panthers this is a start that Jeff Caper was looking for of course when youre at home youre going to have the energy behind you is carrying from lines up a three unable to knock it down but its been good offense thus far for the Panthers Davis the leading score in the ACC at 216 a game veteran Leed draws the defensive assignment on him early now its Carrington the freshman at 65 it is a very long pit team one of the tallest teams in college basketball and one of the best defensive teams in the ACC you have to mention second in scoring defense Ingram on open for two there and Diaz Graham could not keep it in but look North Carolina an 86 Point per game team under Hubert Davis who has really put this team in a good position offensively they scored 105 in their last game against Charleston Southern though they played a tough schedu as you mentioned this is going to be one of their tougher assignments in terms of defensive opponents this year absolutely and you think about having to deal with these North Carolina Tar Heels for the Panthers Jeff cable talked about transition defense thats the most important thing when youre playing against North Carolina by the way cuber Davis has yet to beat Jeff table in a coaching match up in their young careers thus far 0 and three against Jeff cable pit has been the thorn in the side of the tar Hills as of late on the Miss from Ryan Carolina is 0 for six Ingram guards the accs third leading scorer and Ingram stuffs his shot out of bounds with 11 to shoot there is the AFF mentioned Jeff cable who is a game under 500 to pit 84 and 85 but last year Panthers first winning season since 2016 at 24 and2 they have the metrics they have the numbers the look of an NCAA tournament team early but they do not have a signature win yet tonight would certainly qualify Carrington three to shoot left it long didnt hit the rim and thatll be a shot clock violation and when you think about North Carolina very rarely would you find a game where they have been over 3 minutes and havent scored over six from the field to start this game for Hubert davis team whos coming in with a tremendous amount of momentum as you mentioned a 45point victory over Charleston Southern their last time out so largest margin of victory in Hubert Daviss three years Ingram clanks a three Carringtons got the rebound its seven consecutive Carolina misses and Blake Henson with a push off there against kadot will be dinged for The Games first foul but give Kad a lot of credit for trying to fight around a much taller Henson and you see Hensen extending that left forearm catching kadoo in the mouth but its the battle and the fight from K that allows him to get that turnover K The Freshman who classified up a year after some Personnel losses in the off season that was last Touch by Bott thats the first Carolina turnover and were now closing in on nearly four minutes without a Carolina point but frto Rico frto Rico coming into the game had a huge game and the tremendous impact against North Carolina in the win for the Panthers here last year Jeff capable looking to get the production back from him F Rico just had the ball 33 in white for pit big man Off the Bench had seven blocks in those two wins against the heels last year hell take it now and hell throw it away Hinson recovers with five to shoot hes got the smaller Davis on him he elevates and he cannot finish Bott with a Carolina Applause rebound right now Ingram and Ryan have taken six of uncs first seven shots Bott has not taken a shot Davis just won this is RJ Davis determined to get his shot but Austin with a highflying rejection and the pit defense with three blocks in the opening segment of the game Zack Austin making his presence felt on the defensive end going way above to block the shot and where they first media timeout North Carolina still scoreless came out of it in a pretty good position they put up 100 on Tennessee one of the best defensive teams in the country the big win over Oklahoma they were the first team to beat OU and theyre 9 and three and they certainly look fory like a much more connected team then last year as Blake Henson misses the three well right now they look like a team thats playing their first true Road game of the season and this is the first time in 70 yes 70 years that North Carolina has started its Road schedule in January so you think about that if this is the first true Road game for Elliot kadu D Withers Louisville Transfer misses a three North Carolina has started missing its first nine shots pit has not scored in about 3 and A2 minutes either Carrington will end that going high off the glass and the first person outside of ish leet to score in this game leet had both buckets already for Pittsburgh now Carrington getting involved in that heres Ingram the Stanford transfer scored in double figures in every game 55 against 55 Austin bodies in well Ingram is 0 for four the heels are 0 for 10 legged out of all kinds of traffic fed Austin extra pass Carrington for Hinson in and out for three and a little too unselfish that time by bub he gave up a good look to get one to Henson who gets two for a dollar unable to knock that one down but Blake Henson the third leading score in the ACC give me 15if score in the accs gotten a number of good looks here early hes Ed for Ford from three hson as Davis throws it away feder Rico with active hands on the run out legged passes up at three try to close Davis Carrington is all alone Carrington misses a three my goodness pit is 0 for seven from Deep Im sure Jeff cable would be concerned at wouldnt be concerned at all about being over seven as long as hes able to win by six which he is right now if this game ended at 60 Jeff cable would be just fine we have quite a story to tell our absolutely Davis will pull up three he got it of course it would be RJ Davis about 6 minutes and 20 seconds into the game to get North Carolinas first points would you ever imagine that North Carolinas first basket would cut the lead in half fto Rico up top couldnt grab the L Ryan is there pick it up for UNC we didnt score in about 6 and 12 minutes and now could tie with a three instead Davis will go in and Bott is there his first shot attempt comes wor so many of his do on the offensive glass and thats where he is so dangerous attacking the glass leads the ACC in rebounding although pit is a better offensive rebounding team than North Carolina better rebounding team in general in North Carolina which you rarely hear hon again F times a charm well one thing for certain Blake Hensons not going to stop he understands his role on this team hes the veteran he told us today hes the old guy learning from these young guys and they need him to be a leader Davis a pull up pop for two and RJ Davis has a couple of buckets speaking of being a leader how about the response from RJ Davis its been Davis and Bott with all seven of the North Carolina points now as they start to find the Rhythm on the offensive end Carolina scored on three straight possessions after an over for 10 start Le driving around bacock botts able to contest and knock it out of bounds with 12 to shoot so the scoring has picked up now that RJ Davis has gotten in the mix oneonone Jeff T cable talked about earlier youre going to have to guard your yard when playing against RJ Davis and on these two possessions hes won the battle getting to the rim unable to finish it but Blake Henson responds with the big three now one of five from Beyond The Arc but that one extends the lead substitutions for both teams right now jayen low The Freshman who handled the ball very well iss in for pit Theo Diaz Graham and his brother Jorge Diaz Graham the twins out of the Canary Islands are both in and you found out interesting stat about the twins today guo is the older of the twins hes an inch taller and just slightly older and theres a goal T Jaylen Washington coming off of a career high 17 points a career high seven rebound effort against Charleston Southern into the game now and he actually touched that basketball after it hit the glass on the way down as he gives Bott a break Huber Davis starting to trust his bench a little more some of the younger guys starting to get involved in the action Washington set tribl and paint loic R for Carolina which will go nine or 10 Deep basket for Jaylen low makes it 11 to7 pit Davis splitting two Davis got the ball back got hit did not get fouled Ted Valentine says clean block here the fourth Pittsburgh block of the game Diaz gr with a three and thats the advantage you have when you have the twins on the floor not one but two big men that can shoot the basketball extending the defense of North Carolina and putting the post players in tough position to get out and defend the threepoint line Washington a good find Withers hesit takes elevates and scores the goal you can see the preparation that North Carolinas put in against the double team of the Panthers whenever one of their post players catches the basketball Washington knew exactly where to look the first assist of the game nearly 9 Minutes in for the Tar Heels Diaz Graham for the same spot not the same result sophomore set Trimble will bring it up for UNC moic finds a cutting Davis lot of really good ball handlers for Hubert Davis in year three between Trimble kdo and Davis its Trimble who cuts misses deep low emerges with a rebound but you can see how great a rebounding a defensive rebounding team the Panthers are their leading rebounder is leet at 61 per game its a gang rebounding group everyone is involved with crashing glass leading rebounder at just 63 listed at 63 listed at 63 thats a generous 63 William Jeffers getting some Run For the First Time backing down tremble with some strength and shooting with some strength but he got it back press 20 for pit Jorge Diaz gra down the lane ran right into Washington got it back couldnt finish short three bites at the Apple and now Diaz Graham is able to tie up Washington The Possession arrowed to North Carolina but pit fighting the highest scoring team in the ACC 86 two points per game the six highest scoring team at 805 points per game Carolina and pit respectively tonight doesnt appear as if itll get up into the 80s well thats because of how great defensively the Panthers are when you think about this Pittsburgh Panthers team theyre fourth nationally and threepoint field goal percentage only allowing their opponents 253 from three and 397 overall we already talked about their second to Virginia and scoring defense so this is one of the better defensive teams youll see in the ACC in to this point this game has gone in favor of the Panthers because theyve controlled the pace and the way its going to be played obviously the height makes Pittsburgh so tough defensively what besides the raw height and length is good for them well they get after defensively on the on the perimeter with leet with Carrington with their guards they do the job trying to keep other PS out of the paint but when they do get in the paint theyve got shot blockers as well and there hasnt been a paint touched in the first 20 seconds of this possession there wont be Washington a three and an out rebound on the leg it pitch leading rebounder on the season picks up his third of the game Washington can make that shot two of three last time out however I believe that the Panthers will give him those in comparison to Davis leg it bumped and fouled by woic first foul of the game 1036 in against North Carolina following our game its Judah minson Syracuse against Kyle filipowski and 14th rank Duke an ACC double header here on ESPN at 9 Eastern 8 centr Central pit team that just lost to Syracuse in the JMA Wireless Dome on Saturday you think Syracuse has a shot in that game I do believe Syracuse has a shot in that game when youve got judment in your back court youre always going to have a chance and the way that do hoper played the accs player of the week I believe Syracuse absolutely has a chance on the road Syracuses three leading scores were off its bench Saturday I dont know if that ever happened in the Jim baheim era theres Trimble weaving in with a left hand nice finish by the sophomore from Wisconsin Seth Trimble Seth Trimble also coming off career highs in points and rebounds he and Jaylen Washington both did that respectively the last time out SE trle playing with a tremendous amount of confidence here now in his second year as a Tar Hill Diaz Graham from Diaz Graham little brother cant convert on the third youve been waiting to say that huh whats that cant convert on the no I want everybody to make I had to tell you what you said then forget it no I dont know what youre talking about we didnt get it confirmed by how many minutes though he is the little brother you know no we didnt but we did confirm well save that for the next pick okay well do that se tro attacking the paint is able to go against GMO Diaz gram and able to finish that with the left hand crafty by Seth trible who I had to have a conversation with earlier today you were a part of that I watched Seth in practice a few weeks ago staying under the basket go up vertically dunk the ball backwards and then he has the nerve to get out on a fast break and lay it up I had to let him know how disappointed I was in his efforts he told me he was going to make up for it tonight so Ill be looking forward to that so if theres any fast break with Seth Trimble get out of your seat and wait for something special to happen cuz he did promise it to you I was he did he did Harrison Ingram 62 free throw shooter hits him both for his first points and just like that we have a onepoint game after all the struggles offensively for North Carolina to start this game they find themselves within one and now they go to the pressure that Jeff capable worked so much on with his team earlier recognizing that this is the way that North Carolina gets back in the games they go with the four court pressure won them a game against Florida State to open ACC AC it was the focal point of a 22 run to come back and beat the seol in that game jayen low match out with bot briefly bot back out against Diaz Grant who brecks another three and pit has been ice cold from Deep Diaz Graham hesitated on that three almost as whether he was wondering whether he should take it or not when you shoot the ball as well as he does you have to take him Ingram misses a three very good shooter from out there North Carol line is still yet to lead as we approach the 7 and 12 minute Mark here in the first half saw this match up earlier in the first half hence he got an offensive foul this time K trying to fight the battle does a great job Applause again ellot Kido at 6110 holding up against the 68 230 Hinson that will send us to the under eight with Blake Hinson unable to see through the headband well I believe Blake left it down for a reason he was talking to Tedd Blake Hinson has uh de blindfolded himself after this was the end of the play the call was a kick against Elliot Kad out of bounds or a kickball reset the shot clock to 20 and Blake Hinson thought that there should be a foul somewhere in there but when youre going to switch defensively as North Carolina is doing you got to have guards that can stand up to a bigger guy trying to post them up Blake hiton for the second time has tried to post Elliot Kad Kad has won both those battles to this point pit is overs last seven from the field pit his overs last eight from the field but its leading rebounder Isel legett at 6 fo three listed height gets in for an offensive Rebound with the Panthers are second in the ACC averaging up with 13 offensive rebounds per game and leit gives them another opportunity on the offensive end they lead the ACC in rebound margin pit plus 92 havent scored in 4 minutes 26 seconds but they still lead by one in this defensive slug fist Leed driving around Bott no Bott with a nice job to alter that shot from behind in North Carolina looking for its first lead once more and a foul on feder Rico feder Rico before Bott could take the shot its the third foul against pit North Carolina with only one in the game but with Frederico freder Rico on the floor most likely Jeff capable will allow him to play Bott manto man one one they will not double team when hes on the floor as corack Rons able to knock down the two in the corner the first lead of the game for UNC took nearly or took over 13 minutes its an 80 North Carolina run and a gr transfer Cormac Ryan scores his first bucket as Bott cleans up that shot from feder Rico Trimble on the run out spinning high off the glass and feder Rico boxes Bott tips the ball a leg it for pin Carrington lot of contact and Carrington tripped and fouled mono bot does a great job not only playing center field on the screen and row but recovering and blocking the attempt of frto Rico at The Rim Bott a undervalued shot blocker there a great job defending the rim for North Carolina but showing off his defensive prowess with his ability to guard pick a roll as well and now consecutive fouls against UNC after they had just one ones on Ingram heres first you know one thing we T talked with both coaches about today was the physicality that was going to be necessary for their team to be successful in this game Jeff cable made it clear that everything they did needed to be handled with physicality and Hubert Davis told his team how physical fit was going to be and they had to be able to match it big hson taking it from the threepoint line into the pain a wild shot and Bott once again a defensive stopper as that Balls just thrown away by Kad on the bounce but it did get a pit hand it looks like on the way down so UNC to inbound tomorrow night another big ACC game a 16th ranked Clemson visits Miami at 8 Eastern 7 Central on ESPN hurricanes are 102 the Tigers one of the big surprise teams in the ACC 11 And1 one with some great wins including one here at pit right now the clemon tigers are the best team in the ACC ahead of North Carolina going ahead of North Carolina going into an environment where Miami has played the last two games without Nigel pack and wga popper also injured on Friday in their game as PJ Hall goes in maybe a little ahead of RJ Davis as ACC play of the year right now as feder Rico gets a bucket against B in the pain its not going to be hard to find out by the way who is better because this Saturday Carolina goes to Clemson as part of three straight Tough Road games for UNC theres a nice finish by kadoo and UNCC is back on top after feder Rico snap the 5 minute 42 second scoring drought for Pittsburgh and love kadoo attacking being more than just a playmaker of make sure teams have to be honest with guarding him when hes got the ball in his hand too trying to defend the three here as Carringtons Off the Mark Ingram soaring in for the rebound Ingram who can do it all takes the ball down the floor finds Bott for the jam speaking of doing it all Ingram with the rebound and making a play as well but thats North Carolina basketball not waiting for the defense to get set up pushing it in transition trying to get an easy look in the shot clto Rico this time bot will be dinged for his first foul Harrison Ingram off the rebound is able to push and make a play drawing two defenders in the easy dime to Bott who gets the flush and just like that North Carolina with a threepoint lead after struggling so mightily early to start this game puts Armando Bott at 1991 career points seventh all time at Carolina and nine away from hitting the 2000 point mark for here weing a couple watches on this one weve got RJ Davis who is now tied Hubert Davis I believe for career threepointers at the University of North Carolina hes at 197 so he is tied as hit coach for nine by the way if you also in a round number Zack Austin of pit is seven away from a th career so some possible Milestones tonight Carrington pitch shooting it at two for 14 from three just 5 for 15 from Two and look at kadoo on the floor diving but he is hit for the foul by Brian oconnell to Hubert Daviss dismay but I understand the call Brian oconnell right on top of it as you see Kad Dives at the legs of Carrington hes going after the basketball but he does take out Carringtons leg so I can completely understand that call Yuber Davis doesnt want to hear it at this point probably also doesnt want to hear it CU its two fouls in 12 seconds Kad whos been the tar Hills most active Defender so far has to take a seat Hinson hes got RJ Davis on him Hinson in the lane Davis hits the deck Henson hits the bucket and interesting to see if there will be any type type of flop call after that as Davis tried to sell a call going to the basket Carrington trying to High Point the rebound Bott throws it off his nape and that is out of bounds itll be Carolina ball at a 34 coach its been a battle in the low post thus far throughout this game and when you think about trying to get the basketball inside thats the way you do it you go up top to Seth Trimble who would promised me he was going to have a highlight for me today and Seth has delivered RJ Davis with the assist North Carolina with a lead of three which ties its largest of the game theyve only LED for about 3 minutes did not score for the first 6 20 of the game as Diaz Graham answers from low Al B to Aly yeah anything you can do I can do better great job by the Panthers responding and not getting rattled by the Highlight from trouble Davis with five bot four for North Carolina theres the true Road game of the year the post being established however the Trap is coming whenever b gets it especially without feder Rico on the floor and a great job defensively by Carrington blocking the three of Davis that was off Diaz Graham but the officials may need to reset the shot clock here as this is the first down great execution on the alleyoop as you find Seth Trimble the elite athlete Above the Rim and on the other side its low to Diaz Graham up top back to back Ali oops for both these teams and the shot clock which have gone to 30 is back to six there was no change of possession there for M Ryan to inbound for North Carolina Trimble Davis Ingram Bon on the floor its RJ Davis now its Trimble two to shoot Trimble a deep one Barrys H at the horn what a spark Off the Bench for Seth triple with a sevenpoint first he absolutely has been there we talked about the confidence that hes playing with coming off of a career high and with Kad picking up that second foul Hubert Davis is very comfortable going to tremble and allowing him to pick up those minutes its got four starters in low on the floor that pass is forced into Hinson and a turnover for the tar Hills thats the fourth pit turnover of the game Davis had brief daylight hell take it through to strong rebound is tipped that to Carrington three on two for pit Carrington got it great job by Carrington avoiding the contact as Trimble got back and got set but in todays game you have to be set so early to be able to take a charge carington had more than enough time to be a jumper around him want to feed Bott hon did a good job to deny that Ingram will take it into H back out for Ry to three its a brick and its an offensive rebound one dribble for Bott and fouled on the way up Armando Bott will shoot just the third and fourth UNC free throws Carlton kton avoiding the contact to be able to get the bucket on one end but at the end of the shot clock that tremble recognizes it and steps up knocks down a huge three and just shows off hes got Carolina blue ice in his veins the depth last year it was really nonexistent at times for UNC and a player like trimbles a a big reason why this team has a higher ceiling 10 minutes a game last year is a 18 Point per game scorer this year hes at 58 points per game hes given them 16 1 12 minutes Hubert Davis thinks he could be among the best defensive players in the country too and now you add an improved shot and improved scoring ability yeah hes made that sophomore leap and thats one of the things that you want to see in throughout your program especially when you can keep guys and theyre not transferring you want to see them take that next next jump so they can get more minutes and help your program win games two free throws for Bott and look at this Carrington was entangled with Trimble said Trimble will be called for the foul its UNC 7th a one and one for bub car and right now just some conversation between both teams as Carrington and Trimble get mixed up and we talked about this game was going to be physical you know coming in the reason why the Panthers have won five of their last six matchups versus tar Hills but that goes back expanding the end of Roy Williams coaching career into the beginning of Hubert Davidsons coaching career is because the Panthers are physical and again North Carolina often times they want to play a finesse game and this and Jeff capable is just not going to allow that to happen a good free throw shooter you see the numbers as a team for pit are not good yeah that was the cause of the demise at Syracuse the reason why they crumbled in the second half 6 of 15 in the second half from the free throw line up there Rico will replace G mod Diaz Graham I love the way the officials handled that scenario no technical foul even though there was conversations they kept everything under control cooler has prevailed and you go back to playing basketball no one has to go sit down by getting a technical foul or whatever but Jeff paper also got Blake Henson out of the game to make sure that he didnt get in any more of an issue in the scenario Big C goes right at PTO rgo and that shot putut shot is a little short 80 second in the first half which has been mostly led by pit Panthers Trail by two at home low off the glass leans into tight Jaylen Lo is provided great minutes for the Panthers off the bench at that point guard position moving carington off the ball and hes playing well beyond his experience level as a freshman leg get on Davis who gets a bit cot screen bumped by leot hes on the floor with no foul leot goes over the top and UNCC has the arrow in the tie up with 13 to shoot pit continues to make RJ Daviss life awfully uncomfortable and its by Design Jeff we watched the shoot around today Jeff cable said it plain and clear this is the way were going to guard him were going to make sure that we give him a tremendous amount of attention for someone else to have to beat us but were not going to allow RJ Davis to get clean looks throughout this game Davis getting a word from Ted Valentine who again would not like to give anybody a technical fact in this game he has operated with a little bit of leniency so far fto Rico swats it into the hands of his head Applause Applause coach and the Oakland Zoo Rises on the night where you wouldnt think based on the volume that the students are on winter break Trimble five to shoot it Trimble after the stumble round it out got his own Miss Trimble back up with it lefted short and then a foul thats the fifth on pit is it on the floor or is it in the air and it looks like two shots coming for Seth Trimble its hard to put into words the impact that Trimble has had in this game for North Carolina already seven points and opportunity to put more on the board become their leading score in this game thus far at the free throw line with 418 remaining and you remember it was tremble who got to the basket early with the left hand layup against Diaz Graham to kind of set the tone of Ill be the guy that touches the paint for us if no one else can get in the in the paint Ill get in there feder Ricos second foul takes him out of the game Bott will get a breather as well so he doesnt pick up a second in the final 418 team High eight for Seth Trimble who had a career high 12 a few days ago against Charleston Southern and he is just three points away from matching that career highight and North Carolina once again goes to that pressure its more of a token pressure right now just to pick up 94 ft and setting up the Trap that will be part of what they do later heaz Graham into the young Washington who hits the deck and D Graham spins and stuffs it in off the glass thats a great job by Diaz Graham keeping his balance even though there was a Defender underneath North Carolina takes the use it or lose it timeout well be back in 30 seconds after this game tying spinorama from guo Diaz Music Graham so how was your day Liz Music just a normal day for us proplan sport

Carolina has missed its last five for the field pit has made its last five the last bucket for guo Diaz Graham who has seven points right now to lead the Panthers North Carolina is stayed in at the free throw line six of six perfect six of six on the free throw line for the tar Hills two of two for the Panthers and thats been the reason why this game is tied after both teams struggle to start offensively wont say this really been much of a rhythm offensively buted has had quite a rhythm with Hubert Davis by the way spent a lot of time with him the last few minutes the Panthers will switch it up defensively go to a Zone here on this last possession Carolina led by tremble with nine right now its kadoo running the point back in the game with those two fouls for the last possession and Kad is fouled by low pit had a foul to give jayen L picks up his first now the Panthers will go back to their traditional manto Music man after getting a look at what it was the tar Hills wanted to do Davis back for Kad three to shoot backs to Davis a three at the horn and he buries it RJ Davis struggled through a mightily tough first 20 minutes but he puts car the Panthers a you want to look to try to get him as many opportunities as you can but youve also got to try to find a way to establish one of the accs leading scores and Blake Hinson trying to get him some easy looks here in this second half Hinson is two for n one for six from three hes got five points the 19 a half Point per game scorer who is third in the league in points per game we try to get hints in a look here over Ingram he misses a three and Harrison Ingram Wes two points in the half pulls out his seventh rebound sets up barj Davis who kicks off the second the way he commence the first but thats the thing long rebounds lead to run outs if North Carolina gets that rebound theyre looking to go in transition and RJ Davis is not going to wait for the defense to get set six points his last two possessions after five points for about 19 minutes and 57 seconds Hinson again hes got Kad on and that shot is tipped and a foul is called against kdo got him on the arm ingr once again pushing it in transition he has the ability to rebound and run RJ Davis knows that so he finds the spot where his teamm make can find him and knocks down the three ball its the third foul against gdo and Hubert Davis at the moment is not called for a substitute Lake Hinson just a 66 free throw shooter he was four for seven in the loss to Syracuse on Saturday but he is an elite scorer and in fact had a North Carolina football offer out of high school talk to Blake about that before the game he said basically everybody but Alabama and Oregon recruited him to play football including UNC which said you can walk on to the basketball team if you want but we really want you for football its about junior year in high school where Blake decided to go Full Tilt basketball one of the reasons he told us and I know you he told agree with this he told you he you dont have to wear a helmet when youre playing basketall it yes yes he told you this I wasnt involved in that conversation I was got involved right around that point I think K with a hard finish for two and could beat three and kadoo down right now took a hard hit after the shot Diaz Diaz Graham falling on Kad but good to see him up Applause one on two feet as kadoo gets out in transition is fouled by Carrington however as Diaz Graham comes across to try to block the shot he goes down on Cado when hes down and kadoo trying to tighten up that left shoe normally that means something going on with the ankle maybe a slight turn but going to tough it out and stay on the floor and not complete the threepoint playing you know the only reason why there have been Mis free throws in this second half is because you said no ones missed a free throw yet yeah but did I say that on the air I think I said it off the air it doesnt matter you said it to me Caron hits a jumper Ive said a lot of things to you I the you cataloged every other one Im normally not listening to the things you say to me just the things you can think me for thats thrown away by kadoo but the mistake there kadoo has to throw that into the air there too many defenders in the midst as we see Bob Carrington getting to the the spot snaking the screen and then using that 65 frame to elevate over the smaller K and I keep calling the bug thats little bug big bug is in the stands watching his dad Caron carring senior T was a Baltimore a legend Senor off the Austin Miss heres RJ Davis Tar Heels by five in a game they LED just a few minutes in the first half Ingram trying the contact Ingrams Miss is cleaned up by Cormac Ryan just his second made basket and two more Second Chance points for UNC and this is uncharacteristic for the Panthers theyve been great with their def defensive rebounding percentage all season long but North Carolinas a different challenge as is Carlton Carrington is a different challenge as Kad picks up his fourth foul as we see there Big Bub my guy Carlton Carrington senior checking out as he would call his shy out here getting to work knocking down the midrange jumper with the foul gets the bucket Jason cable right there to help him up and keep him away from any conversation as we see Bob Carrington who was the originally started team melow aou back in the day is the originat so thats a significant play not only the three Point play for a little above but you see kadu grimacing on the bench his fourth foul at the 1751 Mark and Carolina calls on Trimble once more as the heels find Bott for an easy deuce and you would like to see North Carolina do more of that run some of their offense through Bott give him a couple opportunities on the post cuz you see the difference that it makes for Amando Bott on the defensive end when hes involved offensively look at what he does defensively a great job getting his hands in on the basketball comes up with the steal and the presence of mind to call the timeout with Carolina of six as super 16 and uh were hoping to hear Dicky Vs voice again there but hes doing much better you in fact saw him pretty I got a chance to see my guy hung out with him for a little bit sat down and talked to him got a chance to meet his daughter soninlaw granddaughter everyone at the city of Palms the 50th anniversary of the city of Palms classic B shot is followed up by Ingram who couldnt finish thats out of bounds it will go to Pittsburgh Harrison Ingram who is 0 for seven from the field now over a had a point blank put back just unable to get it to go but it has not affected everything else for him hes done all the other things his team has needed him to do just unable to to get the ball to go through the hoop here eight rebounds two assists two blocks for the Stanford transfer Ingram the lead is six for Carolina and low cuts it to four with a sweet stroke I tell you what low is a goodlooking freshman this young man can play the game when he comes into the game he pushes Carrington to the scoring guard position and he runs the show 15 assists only two turnovers in his last five games two assists no turnovers tonight Davis Crossing leged theres a step back separation thats all he needs RJ Davis with 13 RJ Davis is going to win most of the matchups he goes against oneonone you have to have help around to be able to defend him or hes going to get the look he wants L match up with Ryan wild shot there big cot the last to touch it 14 to shoot the pit but this much room RJ Davis is often going to win this battle you see the ability to go to the step back one of the best in the college game of shooting off the bounce but low using the screen and roll gets to the midrange to pull up and thats one of the areas where Pittsburgh wants to attack North Carolina they want to make sure that they put RJ Davis in action to force him to be a Defender L again pumped and fouled Ryan and Trimble were both in there the foul will go against sent Trimble North Carolina matching its largest lead of six here in Music Pittsburgh Ed Helman Syracuse and you look at the numbers for Judah minz 192 super gain 38 assist but the 22 steals that lead the ACC he was close to the top of the list a season ago but now playing manto man showing off his defensive prow Syracuse Duke and we still have to get used to Adrien arrey versus John shy Syracuse versus Duke after the retirement of two of The Games Legends the last couple of years like shvy Jim beheim your partner Jim beheim a couple of times this year Co beheim and I will be here in this building a week from today when Duke comes in to the Oakland Zoo to take on these Panthers Davis nearly had the dribble terminated against legance able to keep upright T to shoot RJs got 13 hes had it cooking in the second half and his missed air is followed by Ingram whos now 0 for nine from the field but give frto Rico frto Rico a lot of credit on that one blocking that shot off of offensive rebound good energy Off the Bench for feder Rico low step in and scores low stays so poised under control even in the paint amongst the trees hes still calm cool and collected and gets a bucket on that possession four for five The Freshman Off the Bench the lead back down to four Davis feeds Ingram inside B cut hesitates missed it Ingram fighting again another offensive rebound for Carolina Ryan will drive it somehow finds Davis who gets tripped by leot with five to shoot Applause Jaylen low attacking the rim the Up and Under against a very good defender in tremble gets tremble in the air steps through and has the soft touch to be able to finish it off with the little midi in the paint and now Jeff cable going to take out both of his starting guards in Carrington as well as Leed and allow low to run the show with a much bigger lineup on the floor like Carrington might taking a shot to the eye he is on the bench Diaz Graham thats Jorge and Zack Austin are back on the floor for pit J with lineup for pit it is Turbo siiz yeah outside of low its 67 and up hon miss a three theres a foul away from the shot and its against Cormac Ryan and you mentioned what happened with Carrington as he gets involved catches an elbow inadvertently from Armando Bott on the way up gives the thumbs up over to the bench not receiving attention so maybe just a plan break in the action its a pit team that I know its early but does not have a win outside of quadrant three and four right now all nine of their victories their best win Maybe on the road against a 5 and8 West Virginia team a major opportunity tonight against St Frank North Carolina Diaz Grahams fumble into the hands of Ryan runs the break into Hinson who goes straight up knocked out of bounds Withers came in there looked like he was the last to touch it he was indeed but I love the conversation between Lee Cel and Ted Valentine both the officials getting involved Cassel had a better look on it as Henson does a great job staying vertical and the two officials coming together and determining that is Panthers basketball now North Carolina has missed eight of his last nine field goals as the Panthers have settle in defensively blow throws it away looking for feder Rico Bott slaps it to Davis and a whistle away from the action Ted Valentine will call and off the ball Music foulon thats against Blake Hinson his third foul and Blake hinsons going to take a seat with three fouls at 1345 and a half but you see the turnover numbers North Carolina only had five last time out averaging 102 turnovers per game but the Panthers with seven just a little better at only 101 a game but 15 turnovers against Syracuse did them in and they leading that battle here today Carringtons return for pit that ball is off the shoe of jayen Withers and right on Q right as you talk about it I was wondering Carolina turns it over hey please dont tell h no you dont want to get any coaches mad at you this I see what you did there Carrington off a screen thats short for three pit is two for 17 now from Deep they havent hit one in a half double team comes for Davis fto Rico knocks it out of bounds with 19 to shoot its a small thing but if youre Bott on that possession you dont want to bring the screen all the way over to the sideline because as you bring that additional Defender it makes it easy to trap RJ Davis against that sideline almost as though he has three Defenders guarding him at that point thats where you want big out to screen Davis bodied up by Carrington still it in with the right hand and RJ Davis has 15 weve been through this before Kevin thats not a floater thats a shot you saw the flick of the wrist have we been through that before we have been through this before lets not let it happen again we havent been through it this year though Austin from low another Miss three for pit two for 18 now botts got the rebound how many of these threes are shots that pit should be taking well pit averages 10 almost 10 made threepoint field goals a game so therefore theyre a good threepoint shooting team they should be taking these threes but the reality behind it is they should be making these threes when you look at the numbers the 98 on the season Jeff capable is used to seeing his team come in and make threes theyre the leader in the ACC of threepoint field goals made for game so they should be taking them but theyre expected to make many more of them than they have tonight only two so as Washington gets fou in the shot so despite the number you look up your je cap two for youre still encouraging your team to take those shots cuz a lot of them have been open L you absolutely have to encourage your team to take those shots and you want them to shoot the basketball with confidence talk with Jeff cable about the free throw shooting woes prior to the game and I asked him do you mention it to your guys he said no absolutely not and I didnt think that he would because once you start talking about it it gets into that confidence theres night a former North Carolina star guard Caleb love whos had a great year for 10th ranked Arizona his wild cats will host Colorado which is a hot team six straight wins Buffs are 11 and two thats a good Pack 12 game 930 Eastern on ESPN and the ESPN app we mentioned RJ Davis coming into the game needing one threepointer two to pass Hubert Davis well now hes one away from tying and two away from passing Caleb love who had 200 threepoint field goals in his three seasons with the tar Hills there are the numbers for love whos up his game with Arizona this season that is fi to say so far that is a transfer that has worked out well for both love and Davis who both are anchoring top 10 teams I believe it has for both those guys and often times its just about a change of scenery its nothing against Caleb love it was a opportunity for him to move on and really get more of a command of the offense with the ball in his hands and Arizona its worked out for him and its worked out for North Carolina as well with RJ Davis stepping up and really being their you guy on the perimeter low for three offensive rebound leing Washington spikes it from behind and heres Trimble on the run out Trimble with that great first half is fouled on his way to the basket Carolina is piling up Pittsburgh fouls here and Seth Trimble will shoot a pair and Seth Trimble once again and when you play against North Carolina Jeff cable mentioned it earlier is simply about getting the job done in transition defensively Jaylen Washington coming in with the shot block from from the rear and then you think about Trumble getting the ball in his hands hes not thinking anything other than find his way to the rim and tribles into double figures after a ninepoint first half its the largest lead for UNC at nine jge Diaz gramar places low for pit Ingram takes over for Ryan for UNC Seth Trimble his brother JP tooto is a heel broke his high school scoring record goes one for two and Withers with a tip out to Ingram another offensive rebound for the tar Hills they have been dominant on the offens of glass almost looking like the North Carolina of old even though Pittsburgh is the better rebounding team thus far this season Carrington Skies to get that one off the Davis Miss 14 offensive rebounds for UNC carington bottoms from Deep a three Ill tell you what when Pitt needed him most the one of the 10 youngest players in the NCAA basketball and steps up and knocks down a three ball and great defense by Diaz Graham leg it drives it thats off the foot of Withers itll be pit ball Caron starting to lead the way for pit hes got eight of his 14 in his second half and little Bub playing big here on his home floor although pit was only two of 19 from three for his team to get a win here in their first true Row game of the season last player to lead North Carolina in points in eight straight games Tyler hansbro unsurprisingly back in the 07 eight season hes also the last Tar Heel to score 20 points in eight straight games RJ Davis 16 points per game last year hes up near 22 right now leading the ACC eighth in the country as North Carolina plays its first game of the New Year Lake Hinson back on the floor with three fouls for pit just two for 11 for the Panthers leading score on the season its been this young man Carlton Carrington Who air males at three despite a game high 14 and Jeff cable not phazed doesnt put his head down just continues to coach his guys up and one of the reasons for that Jeff cable actually came in as a shooting guard and played a lot of point guard as a freshman his freshman year Duke the fulltime point guard that year would be won Hall of Famer Grant Hill but Jeff capable came in and replaced Bobby Hurley in the starting lineup in the 9394 season as Ryan has space at the foul line extended and Cormac Ryan the Notre Dame transfer up to six points some transfers that have infused this team with scoring and Leadership and experience Diaz Grahams three is missed and his brother Borge goes on the back Jeff Gable thinks thats not what I wanted seven fouls against pits so UNC will be in the bonus the rest of the way as Jeff will talk it over with Ted Valentine but Jeff is talking to Ted about the fact that whats going on on one in the floor and then what being called on the other end of the floor as a coach the only thing you ever ask for is consistency and thats the one thing that Jeff capable is looking for on this one is to make sure that he gets called on the other end of the floor is going to be called against his guys Jaylen Washington at the line and Washington misses the front end and thats an easy call on the other end of the floor first foul on Washington UNC 6 it was right around this point the game Saturday when pit had an 11point lead slip away at Syracuse theyre going to need to do the reverse of that come back from down deep in search of their first J win Henson went right into Davis tried to draw contact there was no foul and its an airball for Blake Hinson whos two for 12 but Hinson on that possession created the contact he created the contact on that one RJ Davis was in good legal guarding position it was Henson that created that contact I love that no call and allowing the guys to play on Ingram dump off bacon waiting finding Ryan Ryan will get rid of it to Washington Carolina with seven to shoot Midway through the second half Ingram takes a bump might a walk with it Washington is stuffed shot clock hasnt reset and Hinson emerges from The Fray heres Diaz grah to big Applause brother and Jorge Diaz Graham at 611 able to make a play catching it on the run and most times you dont throw it to a big guy in that position but you can see his skill the slightly younger and slightly shorter the twins sets up his brother as Davis turns it over for Applause UNC its almost a no no no you dont give it to the big guy running that fast but Diaz Graham is able to control it more importantly deliver a strike on the bounce pass to the older brother who finishes off with the twoand slam his twin brothers who are at IMG Academy out of the Canary Islands in Spain guo has made the bigger impact this year but theyve given pit a major lift at times in their two years on campus Carrington sets up Jorge way too strong guos got the offensive rebound could not stick it in and theres a foul before that shot r o Connell waves off the basket as set Trimble gets called for the foul before the shot its a one andone for pin trembles third UNCC seven but you see Jorge Diaz Graham in the corner unable to knock down to three but big brother there to clean up the mess was unable to finish on the first one but you see as that left arm wraps around GMA Diaz Graham thats when the foul is called and so there for there is no field goal attempt on that one hes going to have to earn it at the free throw line where hes able to knock down the first one J low back in the game leg it gets a breather Withers will take over for tremble for UNC guo Diaz Graham 11 points per game in his last five hes a 10 now and his shot is Tracked Down by low sets up hon in and out and a foul against pit the other way an authoritative thrust down the court from Ted Valentine and Blake Henson still just cannot find the stroke from three and he got a great look off of a offensive rebound low does a great job locating his teammate saving the basketball from going out of bounds and Henson got a great look hes had a number of really good looks throughout this game just hasnt been able to get it to go only one of nine from Beyond a threepoint Applause AR they count a 78 foul shooter for one andone and he cruly drains it thats been a difference for North Carolina this season its the reason why they lead the ACC in free throw shooting is because Armando Bott has upped his game at the line 765 for the tar Hills and third nashley in free throws made per game over 20 free throws made each and every timeout botts up to 10 points in the game hes three away from 2000 career in the lead balloons back to seven heres guo heot tightens him up and its Henson again Henson still hunting his shot and still missing his shot and there is another foul and its against North Carolinas Jaylen Withers thats because po has Graham attacking the offensive board and we talked about this Panthers team thats one of the ways that theyve been successful on the offensive end is when they miss shots they go after them over 13 offensive rebounds per game and that one gets him an opportunity to be able to get to the free thr line Hinson after his latest Miss three takes a see one for 10 from three leg it replaces him that shot was forced though that was a I got to get myself going it wasnt necessarily the best shots quter team Mor misses a one and one gmos on the deck ball is loose up against the pit sideline Brian o connells over there and he will give it to North Carolina front ends of one and ones really hurt Pit they missed three front ends of one and ones there were 11 for 24 in the loss at Syracuse Saturday and just five for n at the free throw line tonight and when you think about what has happened with the Panthers in this second half you go back to the not the last three but the previous one by Henson got a great look they just havent been able to knock down shots that they normally make especially at the free throw line Bott posting up here comes the double of Diazs Graham back for Ryan Bott he can shoot it from there he doesnt typically do it now Ryan trying to go over the back of car hell be hit with a foul so now its basically a foul of possession Fest here and Carl Carringtons going to get a one and one but you have to go to the free throw line and take care of business there its only a sevenpoint game right now lob has an opportunity to make this a fivepoint game if he can take care of his business at the line but as you mentioned back to back one front ends of one and ones that have cost the Panthers points at the free throw line third foul on Ryan and car well get the front end here theres his dad theres bub big bub bub senior hes just bub yeah thats just bub Lil Bub is at the free throw line when youre the originator you dont need any extra B no well have to call him Big Bub that was a singer back in the day you dont know anything about big yes love Big Bub yeah play on spotifly all the time little bubs five for five at the line the lead is back down to five with 8 minutes to go pittsbur has not LED in the second half the Panthers who swept the tar Hills last year hoping for some more late game magic against Carolinas blue Ingram finds a cutter its Withers he is stuffed and fouled by Diaz Graham and the Oakland Zoo is just about ready to lose its top was this a foul you be the judge a nice find from from Ingram to Withers cutting across the Baseline and yes thats a foul its contact its a foul leads the ACC at three and 1 half threepointers made per game one for 10 from three today and its been a season of Major streakiness he had a five game stretch where he went 26 of 41 from three thats 63 the last three games this is two for 21 there is a degree to which though if youre pit you have to live with that right because hes your guy he is your shot maker and sometimes hes just not going to be his night he absolutely is your guy hes your shot maker and even when its not his night he still has to shoot it and so therefore Jeff capable giving him a breather right now but were going to see Blake Henson back in this game with you know a little under eight minutes remaining hes still going to have to have an impact on this game it just cant be all about his shooting he cant rely on trying to get himself going its about trying to get the team a win pitch one for its last eight Carrington leads away with 16 Theo Diaz Graham with 10 rest of the team just 20 combined and heres Carrington who draws yet another foul that puts the Panthers in the double bonus the rest of the way with s and a half to go Cormac Ryan picks up his fourth and Carrington backing down gets away with a little bit of a chicken wing on that possession getting to the rim and now gets it a free throw line where hes been the guy for the Panthers at the line perfect for him thus far on Applause the any followup comment youd like to make to that no okay Im done thats it that normally doesnt happen to me I know thats normally you know a a a a Kevin Brown thing thats why I was silent I was so delighted they not happy that he missed it Im just delighted for you carington goes 1 for two hes 6 for seven today double figures 12 of the first 14 games of his college career pit which is three for 25 for three is still somehow only down six heres Ingram 0 for 10 of the game and dribbles away from a double team theyll get it again this time singled up with Carrington Ingram spinning into Diaz Graham its off the side of the backboard its Carolina ball with t to shoot having been last touched by Diaz Graham RJ Davis hasnt scored in a while for UNC Tar Hills have not hit a field goal in their last 3 minutes and 40 seconds theyve lived at the line in that spin maybe they can get Davis going here on the dribble into bacot Bott missed it Withers did not a highflying jam for the Louisville Transfer Jaylen Withers that was a great job by Withers Just hanging around in the air until the ball came off of the cylinder to be able to put it back in comparison to touching it as soon as he got Above the Rim one of five impact transfers for Carolina the first year Tar Hill from Louisville and Ingram will pick up his 14th rebound off the Carri to miss so despite the Dreadful shooting night Ingram has done everything else really well 12 rebounds three assists no turnovers couple of blocks this is Withers again and hes hit in the face no itll be an offensive foul against Withers Ted Valentine says he created the contact in the Diaz gram but he created a contact with the rim also on the last possession off of the bayot Miss youll see Withers come in and hold back for a second he wanted to go with the right hand but gave the basketball time to come off the rim so he dunks it with the left the presence of mind to know that he couldnt touch at first but still was able to finish it up so Trimble replaces him after Withers thirdd foul and Hinson returns for pit check back into the 620 Mark Bott blocks low Armond Bott with his third block and Carolinas seventh and this game has been played at Pittsburghs Pace however North Carolina has stood the test of the physical nature of this game and right now hold a eightpoint lead with 6 minutes remaining Diaz Graham a shop fake Big C High out to guard him Diaz Graham swims inside couldnt finish hes slow to get back so Carolinas going a five on four here Ingram runs the floor and finally hits his first field goal after 11 consecutive misses lar Hill bench is fired up for Ingram and a pit timeout a 3 second one here at the peak with you C up Applause 10 up the slack with his rebounding with his passing and finally hes rewarded with a hoop but you remember Diaz Ram went down and you mentioned was slow getting back RJ Davis a great job recognizing Ingram running alone down the middle of the lane is able to get a bucket to go and of course a couple of chest bumps and congratulations from his teammates to be able to get his first field goal of the game its 10 and a half Point per game score both years at Stanford he was the Pack 12 freshman of the year though despite that relatively lowscoring number because he can do everything on a court pretty well Carolina has not Trail the second half and the Tar Heels who didnt score for the first 620 of the game lead by 10 Carrington a wild shot guarded straight up by Trimble and another outstanding defensive position for UNC and the clock has not reset the Carolina bench up alerting the officials the shot clock said 7 seconds before Carolina even got it across half court now it says two so thats not quite right either now it says 22 pick a number any Music number and were going to go with 22 see Huber going with the the Blazer the sports coat in the button up the rest of the app still wearing the pull over big fan of the Blazer little class to start 2024 hey Hinson yes his third M field goal Blake Hinson gets an easy bucket maybe that will ignite his game well in a smart decision by Carrington getting to the front of the rim however annoying that he didnt have an advantage waiting on Henson to be able to follow him up and get the easy layup Ingram backing down Caron Trimble with eight to shoot Davis at a quiet stretch of late knocked away out of a double team Diaz gram knocks it off of Trimble and its a North Carolina turnover their nin and that was a classic trap when you go into coffin corner two Defenders from the Panthers do a great job hands up staying vertical forcing the tough pass Diaz Graham gets out get a hand the passing Lane forcing the basketball off of Music trouble Diaz Graham fak the three again blows on the floor hes had a nice second half hell have a chance to pick up two more the foul RJ Davis is first Jay low only six for eight at the line this year his ninth free throw attempt of the season will go down Thursday its an ACC womens basketball double header on the ACC Network starts right here at the peak Panthers hosting 16th ranked Notre aame and Duke against number 17 Louisville PS going to have to contend with the accs leading score in that one Hannah hialgo at 25 a game those games both on acc Network and the ESPN app a doggo is a problem I watched her first game ever Where She Went for 30 against South Carolina in Paris must see TV lead back to six here Ingram has it open three and Ingram finds his shot his first threepointer of the game and it stretches the lead back to nine amazing what a layup will do for your confidence we saw it work for Ingram lets see if it works with Blake Henson on this end just the fifth made three by UNC Diaz Graham does not have what would have been the fourth made three for pit a long save out to bacot gets it back from triple and Bott stuffs it hes at 1999 career points now and North Carolina has quickly pushed the lead back to 11 they threatening to put this game on ice here with five quick points and they are all over the ball right now with 10 to shoot for low The Freshman steps back missed it rebound Bott and Ingram were there together nearly was a mess and then bigot throws it off in the studio Syracuse Duke is going to start on ESPN news coach Tyrese Proctor back after missing four weeks the other night four weeks but coming back scoring nine points four rebounds and it is absence Jared McCains been absolutely terrific averaging 20 points a game in that time period itll be on ESPN news in moments guyss a Duke team that was picked to win the ACC North Carolina picked a couple of spots behind them in the pre season poll and right now North Carolina trying to get to 2 and0 in the league they beat Florida State at home a couple of weeks ago back when you had that floating first ACC game but conference play is really well and truly underway now it is all ACC from here on out until the NCAA Tournament Davis is tied up North Carolina has the arrow with 20 to shoot RJ Davis hasnt scored Cory in the last 10 minutes and 7 seconds and yet Carolinas plus five in that span how have they done it theyve been able to get contributions from other guys Harrison Ingram scoring Five Points in that stretch getting the layup off of the Davis feet and then the confidence to knock down that three and Armond bot getting involved in the scoring as well and with seven to shoot Bott is bumped by feder Rico a foul away from the ball deep in the shot clock fed Ricos fourth and Bott will shoot two so Armando Bott to the free throw line on 1999 career points and there is the big round number Armando Bott becomes the seventh player at North Carolina to reach the 2000 point mark okay so now heres the question I know where youre going this no no you you dont you you think Im going to talk about the asteris and Im not Im not going to talk about that because thats my boy but RJ Davis moves up on the threepoint list who gets the game ball I knew that was going to be your question you knew that was going to be the question thats a good question no its like a gets that scores 70 Oscar sheway gets his first point so hes I dont know big right hes got 2000 yeah 2000 points amondo absolutely gets that game ball as long as they win for North Carolina which theyre in good shape right now up 13 with 221 remaining and a 7 nothing little spur here for UNC which is said its last four shots from the field Davis still their leading scorer with 15 isolated with low hell swing it out to Ingram for three thats way short Ingram says it was tipped but it doesnt matter now because Bott stepped on the line with it there are a couple of streaks in play right now that could come to a end we talked about RJ Davis with eight straight 20 plus point games he may not get there although early in the second half we thought he was on the way there and also Harrison Ingram has scored in double figures every game this season for North Carolina hes at seven and Ted Valentines got an offensive foul here against Jaylen low its another foul away from the ball by pit which has racked up a ton of fouls in the second half and Jeff Cables team hes going to drop it appears to 0 and three to start ACC play he said on Saturday I I thought that Syracuse played with such energy and a sense of urgency we didnt match it we were weak they play with urgency and intensity at times tonight but they just have not hit shots yeah thats really what it has been about for pit in this game three of 26 from Beyond the threepoint Arc Carri going hits their fourth and Jeff cable takes Pittsburghs third timeout but now four of 27 and when youre a team that leads the ACCC coming in with close to 10 threepoint field goals made per game its hard to win when youre four for 27 heres whats on the dock in for pit theyll go to Louisville Saturday back to back or two three games with Duke so chances for some big wins there I I know its January 2nd I know were still early to be talking about NCAA tournament stuff but I I bring that up just to say pit right now has a nonconference strength of schedule that was ranked 346 they nine wins are all against quad 3 and quad 4 theyre good team making it better but weve seen teams especially in this conference left out with with 20 23 wins because of top nonconference Rand the schedules before so pit again theres time left but they need to start getting some good win soon and this is a chance for what youd have to imagine would be a quad one win and it looks like theyre going to have to wait for that Duke game for the next opportunity the officials overlooking at the last shot by Bob Carrington to see if that was a three and his foot is behind the threepoint line so that will be a three and to go back to your C that you went into before I stopped listening when you said I know its January and its too early to start talking about the NCAA tournament I know its January but Cory youre a beautiful man its January second by the way its January 2nd yes but Im just saying with an i copper trade schedule is that low I Jeff cable doesnt care about that right now right he cares be North Carolina but pit was in NCAA tournament team a year ago and look it to State the obvious they got get some wins here soon they absolutely have to get wins and I believe that thats something that Jeff cable is very aware of but one things for certain you cant change the pass theres nothing he can do about the schedule that they played because they had a lot of teams on the schedule that were supposed to be good that just havent lived up to building you cant theres nothing as a coach you can do about that all you can do is coach the day try to win the day and that is what theyre trying to do here in this game against North Carolina down now 11 in tough sledding at head but its what theyll try to do Saturday and then next Tuesday is just go out and try to win each and every game that they can the chips will fall where they may you know once we get to Mar for M Bryan hits two North Carolina 17 for 20 at the line today pitch is 10 for 15 Carringtons got a season High 20 now and hes too deep on a three cor maack Ryan has a rebound with a minute to play up ahead to RJ Davis he will feed Bott and Bott will step into a dunk and by the way with that assist from RJ Davis he now falls into second for the game behind Bay count of points so his streak of eight straight games leading the Tar Heels in scoring may come to an end as hitson finally hits a three RJ Davis is not going to care one iota because Carolinas going to get out of here with a two and0 start to ACC play and to your point I can show you how little are J Davis cares RJ Davis who shoots 95 from the free throw line the alltime leading free throw percentage shooter at the University of North Carolina and corm Ryan who shoots 90 both of them are standing you know to get receive the inbounds pass Ryan is yelling here here here RJ Davis is standing there like give it to him I I dont care hes more concerned about the final score of this game making sure the guys in Carolina blue win this game more so than he is any streaks any numbers is simply about wins and losses forac Ryan at the free throw line four for four today hes a fourth Tar Heel in double figures North Carolina is going to come out on top in its first true Road game of the season you mentioned the number earlier it had been 70 years since it took this long in a season for Carolina to play its first true Road game since 1954 the last time UNC didnt play a true Road game until January and Hubert Davis said after the Charleston Southern game I think its overrated the baskets still the same it took a little while for them to find that basket tonight took them 6 minutes and 20 seconds to score but North Carolina gets out of Pittsburgh with a win and Hubert Davis finally vanquishes Jeff Capel after a pitch sweep last season its all Tar Heels today they do not Trail in the second half half they win by 13 at the Pak UNC is 20 the ACC
