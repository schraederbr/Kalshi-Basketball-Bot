at Louisville late in the season and he wins the tap from Huntley Hatfield and we are underway at Little John tonight here is Chase Hunter working in traffic follow away on James off the window and the Tigers are in front and thats a really good sign to get Chase Hunter off early hes another guy who has not shot the ball well in conference play the Louisville lineup features The Freshman k CB Glenn for just the second time this year with Clark Trey white Huntley Hatfield and the aforementioned Mike James seven to shoot and here is James now Clark will launch and it spins out shefin the rebound Lille really had a tough time getting the ball into the lane against the Virginia Cavaliers didnt have much success against the Tigers that time either here heres Hall free to the basket left it short made that one a lot tougher than it needed to be Wes yeah two nothing early Clemson Louisville second possession with the Illinois transfer sky Clark into the lane Huntley Hatfield had it bothered by Wiggins did he touch it he did says Ron Grover Paul cells Lee Cassell Ron Grover on the whistle here tonight you see that Louisville lineup you will also not see tonight the sixfoot freshman from Brooklyn New York Ty Johnson who uh injured an ankle at the end of shoot around today and is not able to go tonight Johnsons over there sitting in the middle of the Louisville bench five to shoot white now for Huntley Hatfield hes going to pull the trigger from Deep Hunley Hatfields not very good from Deep he they need to get him posted up mismatch inside heres Gerard Hunter again skip it back for Joey Gs three banged out of there Huntley Hatfield the rebound thats a nice job getting Gerard open for that shot loville missed their first three Clemson hit their first shot missed their last two and now the cards have tied it on Clarks bucket averaging 10 points in conference play skot Clark for from Los Angeles comes in their second leading score behind Mike James whos just under 14 a game heres Gerard catch and shoot three at the top that bounds away and shefin will be called for the foul trying to get the offensive rebound his first first on Clemson and Clemson they got Joe Gerard two pretty good shots the one was fairly deep but that last one was youd expect Gerard to make a high percentage of those shots Music Mike Randolph thanks very much we welcome those of you that have watched Boston College beat Syracuse tonight at KY Foreman Chestnut Hill with Dan boner West Durham were at Little John 22 game and the three ball by James no good Caleb Glenn The Freshman the rebound against RJ Godfrey who batted it away and Hall recovers it for the Clemson Tigers well no place for the meek on the inside W nope three minutes gone this first half heres Gerard double team follows him Hall sets for three and the Tigers have come up dry from behind the line here early Gerards missed a couple PJ Hall misses his first shot from back there and the Tigers Force the Louisville turnover heres Gerard ahead for Hunter got caught in the air Gerard a step in on the shot fake for two and hell get fouled Joseph Gerard III from Glenns Falls New York Dan in his 143rd straight starts on the board this is a really good play by Gerard hes missed a couple of Threes that little fake got him open and people dont talk about it but hes very good in the midrange and even when he can post up hes a pretty good shooter in there 23y old knocks down the free throw hes the second best free throw shooter in the ACC Brad Brownell Subs sheflin early now he Subs Gerard early I trying to get maybe more depth activated here early in the ball game Dan well shefflin picked up a foul and shein can be foul prone and jard just had a tough start tigers in front by three heres Huntley Hatfield with Hall defending hell take the long jumper it was an air ball godfried had it hit him and Bound Away over the end line and theres the Tigers alltime winning as coach Brad Brownell now 254 183 Clemson hes got 421 wins in a career that spans 22 seasons and 11 times hes won 20 or more well that N9 and0 start West was really impressive because of the schedule that they play sure was for to shoot Hatfield working Baseline and cant finish RJ Godfrey the rebound Chase Hunter moves Clemson into the four court against James heres hall for three front rim Miss tigers are drive from behind the line early PJ Hall shooting only 27 from three in conference play the Tigers now 0 for four from out there yep Clark skip for white hell fire for three missed everything wow backside rebound Godfrey heres Wiggins Hunter t ERS in transition tried to scoop it back through to Chase and turned it over thatll get us to a timeout well Clemson in front 52 looking for their fourth win in ACC play here tonight against Kenny Paynes Club bad starts its been bad spurts yeah and hes without his freshman tonight Tyler Johnson Twisted an ankled at the end of practice today the shoot around session so he is not available tonight so he had to go with a lineup tonight with Caleb Glenn starting for just the second time this year and that lineup has not changed as we come out of the timeout heres white on the drive hell draw the foul either Godfrey or Beetle who has come on the deck for Clemson and it is the red shirt sophomore Josh beetles first second on Clemson and Trey white to the line and Louisville really making an effort to get the ball down into the lane now hes not in the lane area but hes close down to the block there and Clemson just going for the ball fake oh here there is white knocking down the free throw his first point of the game Trey white has now started the last four games for Louisville Beetle out Joe Gerard comes back in I should note Louisville is 759 in conference play 738 through the regular season and Whites got him off to a two for two St West Louisville in the nonconference part of the schedule was able to get to the free throw L frequently they average 19 made free throws a game in conference play not quite so much they only average 13 made free throws a game so theyd like to get the ball in there if they can and Huntley Hatfield I think had an armful of PJ hall for his first foul underneath Clemson looked like they were on a conscientious effort here Dan to get the big fellow the ball well hes got an advantage in terms of his strength against Huntley Hatfield and you could say that was a hole that looked like something at the old Arthur Murray Studios reach some of you will get that others will not heres Gerard for Hall backing down this is he a COR for and PJ Hall walked with it against Emanuel aor for who has just checked in so the turnover for Clemson and a onepoint lead for the Tigers is their second he cor for missed 10 games with injury Wes and hes a little bit better size matchup in terms of his strength came back in played 10 minutes in the lost to Virginia on Saturday with the young man from Nigeria James and were going to get contact on Godfrey RJ Godfrey will draw his first sophomore third Clemson team foul and one thing were seeing here early West Louisville is making a conscientious effort to drive the ball into the lane yep cards have missed their last five shots from the floor to trail by a point remember Glenn hit the two free throws Clark hit a jump shot and early on theyre just one of nine I think Louisville feels like they have a quickness Advantage particularly in the back court Jack Clarks come on the floor for the Tigers his fourth game back after sitting through a an injury situation inside heres Glenn went straight back up and I think chy Wiggins is going to be called for the foul and indeed he will the sophomore at 611 first four on the Tigers but the first almost 5 and 12 minutes this is why Glenn is in the game he doesnt give you much shooting but hes got size hes got strength and that time the ball if that ball hits the rim Clemsons in pretty good shape for the rebound but it didnt it came straight off the board just the fourth free throw in 10 attempts this year for Caleb Glenn and Dylan Hunter into the ball game so now both the hunter Brothers Dylan and Chase on the floor with Joseph Gerard PJ Hall and Jack Music Clark second for Glenn good I think Brad Brownell is trying to match the quickness a little bit yep he talked about when you get into the bench you get a little more athleticism well see what happens here Louisville up one after the free throws Gerard hesitates on the dribble out for Clark entry for Hall hell turn on a COR for and draw the foul the sophomore at 69 his first third on the cards and PJ Hall to the free throw line where hes looking for his first point he needs 15 tonight by the way Dan to tie will Solomon for 15th all time in Clemson history well will Solomon was a guy who could put points on the board thats for sure oh buddy Halls missed all three free throws or fre goal attempts his first free throw is good well a couple of those field goal attempts with three point shots M but that time I mean he did a great job moving without the ball and the key to that whole play was the fact that Clemson could get him the ball when he was open lots of times big guys theyre not open inside for very long you got to get him the ball in an Optimum time and the Tigers did on that occasion so Hall I think is coming out and BOS Lia from Bergen op zoom in the southwest Netherlands Dan if you say did and thats where he is and hes on the floor wearing 33 for the Tigers the averages about 3 minutes a game in conference play James trying to beat Chase Hunter and itll be a bump and a foul before the shot and Chase Hunter joins the foul list hes got his first and five on the Tigers good news for brown L the bad news is five team fouls good news is nobody with more than one I hope your grandma said taller so Baseline entry pass for James but Louisvilles keeping the pressure on West by driving the ball yep cards Trail one despite one of 10 from the floor here early Trey white launches straight away and last touch Jack Clark says Lee Cassel itll stay with the Cardinals and weve seen that a couple of times early in the game Clemson just not able to claim the rebound and even though thatll be a team rebound for Louisville its still its their ball and so Clemsons got to play another 20 seconds yep Clark coming off the Glenn screen tiger sh Zone yep High post this is Glenn into the corner for white into traffic he goes pushed it up with a right hand Glenn the follow and scores Caleb Glenn Dan doing what hes been discussed about as a good rebounder and then hes able to follow it home and pushes Louisville in front now a Clemson timeout so the Tigers will take one here 1310 to go in this first half Louisville back in front 87 on acc Network Hunter both Hunters Chase and Dylan whos got the ball now with Jack Clark here is Clark inside he took some contact turned it over turnover by the Tigers heres James and he turned it right back over too hot to handle it both ends thatll bring Huntley Hatfield into the line up off of Kenny Paynes bench and for the first time we get to see the Detroit freshman Curtis Williams Jr whos averaging eight points in conference play laa is out PJ Hall has come back for the Tigers along with Ean sheflin as well and 131 zone now for Louisville here is Hunter and were going to get another foul on a core for and thats his second and again a really good job by PJ Hall getting position and Hunter finding him when hes open well some of you might be joining us from Atlanta Georgia Tech is upset North Carolina tonight 7473 in Midtown the beat goes on in this league boner heres Hall in close Score first field goal for PJ hall now with four tigers back in front of point this is a really good League West theres a lot of close games good team Georgia Tech has now beaten both Duke and North Carolina at home yep terrific feather in Damon stms cap isnt it I think theres been some surp Rising players Nathan George for example for Georgia Tech didnt even play in the first couple games yep jump hook answered Brandon Huntley Hatfields first basket thats where Huntley Hatfield is most effective theres Gerard will spot up too thats spun out for him but Clemsons getting good looks just cant knock him down boy Wes that is the truth Clark back inside look at Dylan Hunter reach in for the hell ball that will stay with Louisville and thatll bring us to a timeout tell you what competitive not very pretty at times onepoint lead for the cards what even is this dont touch my things stand because Georgia Tech is now 3 and seven they beat North Carolina Tar Hills first conference loss of the Year okay thats you see the bottom getting the top and then earlier Boston College big night Claude L Harris Jr they beat Syracuse all also at this hour that 5 four combination see that 5 four deal Miami NC State somebodys going to win tonight in Raleigh West its the time of the year when everything starts to shake out yep but if the league has been so competitive and were just to the Midway point this weekend will be the Midway point of the first half to the second half three ball badly missed a COR for playing with two fouls back in heres xan Payne that got blocked a COR for Scoops and scores Louisville doing a terrific job with Second Chance opportunities well that is now seven offensive rebounds for Louisville in fact they got two on that Series so eight offensive rebounds they have six second chance points Cardinals coming into the game they are dead last in rebound margin in ACC play and theres sheins first basket of the ball game Ian shefflin number one in the ACC in offensive rebounds and Conference play number six in defensive rebounds got a nice delivery of the ball for from Hall to pull Clemson to within one well Louisville playing a COR four and Huntley Hatfield at the same time trying to match sheflin and Hall but the offensive rebounds that has really been a problem for the Tigers they just cant protect the defensive boards theyve got two on that particular series and scored a basket as a result so you see sheflin come out of the ball game RJ godfried has worked his way back on Dylan Hunter and Chase Hunter both still out there with Gerard heres James foul line area one to shoot Glenn shot clock viation he didnt no nope sure didnt Kenny Payne pleading with his team third turnover by Louisville to pull the trigger this is a situation where it hurts him to not have Tyler Johnson they dont have a real point guard in the game right at the moment with Clark on the bench getting a breather heres hutter to Gerard tigers are without a three they average about 8 and a half a ball game PJ Hall with Huntley Hatfield defending turns over the left shoulder left it on the front rim knocked around the cards pull it away and thats a good job by Huntley Hatfield just stay between PJ Hall in the basket make him shoot over you left side James a three ball backside rebound and a whistle and a foul that on Godfrey if so itll be his second oh its on Hall I think on Hall PJ Hall its on PJ Hall yeah its his first its six now on Clemson and thats thats a story here early in this game the Clemson Tigers yep really having a tough time rebounding the ball there and this Louisville team thats as you mentioned West theyre not shooting it well no when you get eight and nine offensive rebounds in the first 10 minutes of the first half that keeps you in the game Louisville is plus 11 Dan on the rebound right now heres James on the drive thats another foul on Godfrey thatll be his second hes the first tiger with two at the 955 Mark and we seven now on Clemson we talked earlier about it Wes that Louisville has been extremely aggressive trying to get the ball to the basket and the Tigers theyre starting you say its the first time anybodys got two fouls but theyve got a lot of guys with one foul yep Mike James 82 at the line first one rims in dont forget next Wednesday next Wednesday not tomorrow night next Wednesday double header of ACC basketball Louisville in Syracuse in s Eastern and then Duke and Notre Dame come up after that from Cameron right here here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN tomorrow night two more games on the schedule noted Dame at Virginia Wake Forest at pit Gerard Tigers trailing three were tied now Joseph Gerard has just moved into third place by himself in career threepoint field goals in ACC history just that little fake West gave him a lot of time what did Kenny Payne tell his team today dont buy the shot fake easier said than done yep tied at 14 heres James into traffic turns flips it up wouldnt go Wiggins the rebound Hall got hit in the mouth heres Gerard front Court oh and hes going to be called for the carry by Paul SS Clemson a turnover but Joseph Gerard has got six here thats the fourth tiger turnover and Gerard struggling from three just gives the pump fake and he has all the time in the world thats like shooting in an empty gym heres Clark nine to play in the first half low scoring first half Trey white back for James attacks on the dribble and Hall the rebound pretty good defense by Chase Hunter there really good job moving his feet heres Hunter streaking off all the way to the basket and the Tigers in front louville was back West I think they were just surprised that Hunter took the ball all the way Clemson has been playing at a little bit slower Pace y kind of put it on him in transition a little bit 820 to play Scott Clark trying to find a crack in the wall here Dylan Hunter reaches in took it away hes going to flip it out here heres Gerard front Court hell spin into traffic leave it for Hall he gets strip going up white for Clark and Louisville cant buy a three at the other end heres Wiggins thats a great job by Wiggins blocking out on that shot felt like if Clemson scored there they were going to get some real momentum instead Louisville took away that opportunity with a strip of the ball well white just made a great recovery in a bad situation for Louisville Wiggins working inside turns right hand too strong on the jump shot again nice job forcing Wiggins into the jump shot into traffic off the window Trey white four for white the sophomore from Dallas who turned 21 a couple of days Music ago and were tied against in at 16 Hall to Gerard on the drive thats a tough thats tough position to put Gerard in it was a good pass but Gerard now hes going into the forest there down low heres Hall Huntley Hatfield had it rattle out Louisville is five of 22 from the floor and its a tie game yep Dylan Hunter back for Hall triple out front too strong heres white look at Hunley Hatfield and Hall wow thats an offensive foul thats two on Huntley Hatfield and that thats a big five on Louisville 629 to go okay Dan its worth mentioning that a year ago at the Yum Center Louisville the night they honored the 2013 National Championship team the card shot 51 from the floor they were 26 of 28 at the free throw line and they beat Clemson that night and it its a game that was held against Clemson the remainder of the year in many respects absolutely and a lot of people say thats the reason Clemson didnt make the NCA tournament that game yeah but here tonight Brad Ls team off an incredibly disappointing finish on Saturday at Duke has it out in front of them and to that point we talked about this with him today what they were last year is part of what this team is this year in many respects there too many guys that played in that game that are here tonight for him to not forget what that was like and were going to get a whistle and a foul and two shots coming a reach across on Josh Beetle I think and thats a core for is third so now Louisvilles got real issues because a core four has three Brandon Huntley Hatfield just went to the bench with two 9 seconds ago and weve talked about Louisville being really aggressive getting the ball to the basket I actually think Josh Beetle got himself up in the air with nowhere to go and that foul bailed him out but just what the doctor ordered for the Tigers Beetle 59 at the free throw line first one rattles out dont forget every Thursday we got womens basketball double header for you coming up two nights from now presented by Ally com wealth Clash at the castle Virginia Virginia Tech at six and then well send you to William Neil Reynolds Coliseum number 20 Carolina and NC State should be terrific wolf pack number five in the country Beetle buys one of two at the line Clemson back in front of point and so Louisville now is much smaller a lot smaller right sheflin by the way is guarding downal low nanovic whos coming to the Ball Game he wears jersey number 13 transfer from Miami theres James out of the corner sheflin a long rebound Lia stays on the floor replacing Hall heres Wiggins well theres not a real post player in the game right at the moment for Louisville Thon might want to see if they can get it inside Wiggins foul line for sheflin in traffic around Glenn with the right hand hes fouled Caleb Glenn first seven now on the cards one and one for Clemson with 540 to play sheflin only has taken one shot so far in the game and that of course does not count as a field goal attempt because of the foul but shefflin Wes hes one of the most improved players in the conference and hes a guy who just seems to know what his team needs and hes able to deliver it yep averaging 11 points and nearly 11 rebounds in conference play and here is an amazing transformation of a basketball player who sees the only ACC player averaging 9 and 1 12 points 9 and 1 half rebounds two assists you see the five double doubles three have come in conference play and hes an excellent free throw shooter you like to have him at the line yeah I I think he is he is what the term Player Development which sometimes gets overused in basketball he personifies Player Development some of that is your program but some of that is your self initiative as well absolutely Ian sheins a really good example of that heres javanovich inside he got caught James caught on deflection they whip it around with five heres Clark for Glenn working against sheflin got it blocked and they throw it up at the horn and another shot clock violation now with shefflin and Wiggins out there Dan Louisville is really fighting a pill on the glass but theyre still fighting West that was very interesting its a block shot but there theyre getting the offensive rebound yep six turnovers on the cards still just a threepoint game weve played nearly 15 minutes Lia handed to Gerard misg give there heres Clark with shefin trailing and sky Clark hammers it home with a right hand well you dont often see a handoff thats that bad yep and Clark almost got another one so the play by Clark is kind of energized pays team here and Chase Hunters going to check in for Gerard well this and they get the dribble hand off they get the steal and then Clark he is very active he can slash to the basket that was an easy one created by defense so Louisville theyre getting offensive rebounds theyre forcing turnover yep and its a onepoint game sheflin heres lighter hands to Hunter hell lob it back knocked out of there Li wasnt ready here are the cards chance to lead Clark again put it up wouldnt go tap follow no good from White Wiggins Hunter a triple got it seven for Chase Hunter just his 21st three of the year weson he comes into this game shooting literally 133 from threepoint range thats his fifth three in ACC play and thats got to make him feel pretty good fourpoint lead for Clemson three ball front rim missed by white Wiggins for Hunter thought about the three skip for Beetle hell take yanovich into traffic heres Wiggins along twoo five in a row by the Tigers sixpoint lead the biggest of the night for Clemson Kenny Payne wants a skull session at his bench well take a break as well the walk rft is expanding all worlds within the CLA leag Kenny Payne though has seen a variety of pieces here heres the chase hunter three and then Chanty Wiggins helped him out well Josh Beetle does a great job with the pass to Wiggins and he catches the ball ready to shoot and lets it go and then Kenny Payne he told us earlier he was worried about big Spurs he said that thats whats hurt his team all year and hes trying to cut off now the only way you can cut off a spurk is to score and Louisville theyre 0 for 10 from threepoint Rings they have no assist theyre shooting only 20 from the field theyre in this game though West because of their effort they have 11 offensive rebounds they for six turnovers they just cant get anything going on the offensive end and theyre playing without a big yvanovich is probably the tallest guy in there its 68 on the drive James against sheflin put it up with go Wiggins the rebound quick outlet for Beetle heres Hall hands to chase Music Hunter sheflin out front inside for PJ against James strong with the right hand and nothing there Brad Brownell puts his hands behind his head as at the other end Trey white scores and thats a basket that Louisville really needed really good entry pass by sheflin but PJ hall now one for seven heres sheflin another pass Hall a catch gunks at home stuffed home Halls got six another fabulous pass by Shey and again Wes we talked about the fact that all the big guys for Louisville are in foul trouble on the bench and so getting that high low going with Hall and sheflin is a really good idea and they executed it perfectly that time 13 to shoot for Curtis Williams freshman from Detroit out there now on the floor for Kenny Payne five to shoot white on the drive threw it up off the glass and it dropped in eight first half points for sophomore Trey white well white is a guy hes not really a threepoint shooter but hes the guy who can slash to the basket and score in the midrange heres sheflin Hall calling for it and a foul will be called on Caleb Glenn and thatll be his second eight on the Ville PJ Hall with a good catch there but thats an excellent pass and Glenn Glenn is only 66 its and its going to be hard for him to match up against PJ Hall and Mike Mike James doesnt want to be on any more posters either no its going to be a one and one for Hall thats where they should go hes got 4 in and 30 lbs on Glenn and the first one is good dont forget after the womens double header Thursday night Kelsey Riggs has got the former tiger shooting star Kelly gramlick Ivory L and of course Hall of Fame coach Muffet McGraw nothing but net ladies Edition 1000 Eastern on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app seven for Hall make it eight hes hitting 81 through the regular season 81 in conference play at the free throw line him back to a sixpoint lead thats been their largest of the first half theyve had it twice thrown away trying to go to James by Scott Clark well James was turning the corner to go to the basket thats now seven turnovers by Louisville but this this is a tough offensive lineup for Louisville theyre very small yep and I guarantee you this is probably a lineup thats been on the court very very rarely right k just trying to survive the last 90 seconds hes trying to get to the halftime theres Hunter Hall slipped couldnt get it to him tend to shoot Beetle heres shefflin entry for Hall oh my Heavens Hall did a great job getting position and catching that ball but you cant make a better pass than sheflin just did sheflin has delivered two beautiful passes to PJ Hall and both have been shoved in the basket under a minute yvanovich Williams a three and its no good hutter will catch it over the shoulder in front of the Clemson bench its an eightpoint lead for the Tigers and on the drive Hunter scores again Dan nine for Chase Hunter Chase Hunter being aggressive is really good news for the Clemson Tigers and its 10 now with 35 seconds to play Clemsons going to get it back regardless of what happens here for Louisville I think seven to shoot for Clark tried to throw it back turned over 13 seconds to play in the first half we get PJ hauled down inside and get that high low going again five to go heres Hunter works on Clark into the basket put it up draws the foul with 710 of a second left Glenn commits his third thats nine on Louisville and remember Glenn is playing as an inside guy hes an undersized inside guy but so now they got three of their inside guys with either two or three Music fouls so here is Chase Hunter for a pair first one good hes now got 10 he and Hall have kind of scrambled their way to 20 of Clemsons 33 and scramble is exactly what theyve had to do the Tigers doing a great job from the free throw line here down the stretch in the first half Louisville was getting to the line early it was Clemson late and thatll do it halftime at Little John boy what a run by Clemson eight nothing over the last 154 and a lot of it fueled by the big man from Spartanburg PJ I think the momentum and the foul trouble are directly related West plus the fact that Louisville has not made a threepoint Basket in this game so the tigers with a 12point lead here and here is Hunter and Huntley Hatfield remember has those two personal fouls Hunter out front heres Hall teeing up a three back rim Miss again hes now 0 for four four from out there yep and three for 10 in the ball game after the Miss there James on the drive and hell draw the foul West thats thats were seeing like a repeat of the first couple of minutes of the game Clemson missed a three and then Louisville pushed it down and drove the ball to the basket Louisville was six for six from the line in the first half but during that streak they werent a during that spurge surge by Clemson y Lille wasnt able to get to the line Mike James whos averaged 112 points in his last four is scoreless he had eight points on one of eight shooting against Virginia well he was 0 for six in the first half here yeah at 13 points a week ago against Duke and hes got his first point on the free throw there one of fourth the line is James and were 30 seconds in 11o lead for the Tigers heres Hunter back for shefin hell roll right to the basket and draw the basket and the foul and its on Glenn thats going to be his fourth I think Paul cells going to score the basket or not here I dont think they are Wes oh theyre going to wave the basket off well he got clipped West just as he caught the ball and started to the basket Brad Brown now not happy with that thats four on Glenn and here comes Emanuel aor for and hes got three y he sure does with 1926 to play Caleb Glenns fourth so the foul on the deck sheflin does not get credit for the basket Clemson gets 20 to shoot and Gerard left open out front well ball dont lie Dan W Joe Gerard is somebody if he can get his feet set weson you give him that much time and it wasnt a lot of time but he doesnt need a lot Clemson got the three they thought they were going to get anyway that ball got knocked away nice play by Hunter a core for goes to the ground here hes moving to try and deliver it to Huntley Hatfield and he does out front here is Clark thats on the front rim no good and Gerard kind of had it deflected to him it bounced off the forehead of O cor for right to Gerard heres Joe Hunter out front PJ Hall three more nope that bounds away sheflin tried to keep it alive Huntley Hatfield collects boy Halls getting Great Looks I mean theyre wide open look yep hes 0 for five from behind the line three of 11 tonight two of his three field goals are dunks heres James high arching Drive shefflin will keep it alive and pull away another rebound what a great block out and Huntley Hatfield has to be careful you dont want to get called being over the back Hunter hanging in the lane will draw the foul from Mike James red shirt sophomore from Orlando his first and that is two on Louisville Gerard is a guy thats got to move effectively without the ball to get that open three and that was a great screen by PJ Hall and you know thats what Gerard is doing you just cannot get hung up on that screen and again very easy to say very hard to do free throw by Hunter gives him a dozen of course Chase and Dylan are the sons of the late Bryce Hunter who was a terrific wide receiver at the University of Georgia back in the Eric zire era Bryce went on to play a couple of years in the NFL and their mom I believe was a pretty fine athlete as well and Chase knocks down a couple of free throws 16point difference here almost 2 minutes in second and were still in the middle of that big spurt that Kenny pay good point was afraid of yep this game was 18 to 18 West yeah it was its been chronicled in almost every Louisville game its 18 to 18 so were 21 to5 now thats it James into traffic Wiggins there look at the defense by the Tigers too much oneonone West y heres Wiggins Gerard left side for Hunter down low heres Hall rolling on a cor for put it up draws the foul a COR for now has four with 1731 to go that is number three of the half on the cards PJ Hall works so hard for position inside and when you can get him the ball and they dont bring help West if he gets a couple of dribbles and can get that close to the basket you really dont have much Choice except two fouling heres PJ Hall and now a technical foul on Kenny pain technical foul or a warning Paul sells ah its technical foul so a technical foul on Kenny Payne Joe Gerard will go to the line to shoot the technical foul shots thats two of those by the way and first one good and then well come back and pick up where we left off which is PJ Hall to line shooting to yep so here is Gerard hes two for two tonight three for three you know in Joseph Gerard IIIs career from Glenns Falls New York you cant help but think about one of the Premier Shooters in college basketball in the last 25 years being Jimmer for Deb right yes same Hometown right I mean just think about the guys in that town that must be able to light you up at the park hey were going to play these cats from Glenns fall BS today dont forget next Wednesday night not tomorrow night next Wednesday night ACC basketball on accn will be JMA Wireless Dome Louisville and Syracuse at 700 and then speaking of Joseph Gerard his Old Coach Jim baham Cory Alexander and I will be at Cameron Indoor Stadium for Notre Dame and Duke look forward to the trip there with Coach beheim sight of one of his more Infamous moments just kidding coach 4323 tigers by 20 after all of that my Heavens white Ls got to move the ball West they have no assist yet in this game which means a lot of oneonone Play heres white shot clock winding down little leaner off the glass and in first field goal of the half for Trey White comes with 3 minutes gone Dan really nice job to maintain your pivot foot good fake got Dylan Hunter out of the way 18point game heres Gerard taking Williams into a hall screen another entry pass heres PJ up strong couldnt finish shefflin grabs the rebound skips it out for Gerard from the Tiger Palm it spins out a COR for had it he lost it to Hall PJ will fire for three nope boy the fight is on from behind the line for PJ Hall tonight and sheflin will draw the foul contesting for the offensive rebound second on shefflin second on the Tigers its been really difficult for the Tigers to score and when theyve scored theyve been able to get inside and thats just a nice job maintaining his pivot foot chase Hunters in RJ Godfreys come in remember Godfrey really was saddled to two quick fouls in the first half he did not play very much so the sophomore from just north of Atlanta on the deck for the first time in the second half here for Coach Brown L white on the drive all the way through and hell get the an one Trey Whites got a dozen in the game the foul is going to be on Dylan Hunter itll be his first its the third on the Tigers terrific play here by the transfer from Southern C well weve talked about white hes a guy with an attacking Style on offense he can get to the line thats just a tremendous move but again Louisville West its basically oneonone driving the basketball yep successful the last couple of times but they still have a big deficit to overcome 13 for white its a 15point lead five in a row by the cards but one thing weve seen from Louisville all year long Wes they dig the themselves these big holes but they really work hard to battle back sure do heres Hunter all the way through hell skip it to beetle in the corner boy heck of a grab by Beetle on the back end DAV Sweeny sees that he might want to know if he going to goout inside Godfrey nice move for the score and again hes working against the guy whos got four personal fouls and does a really nice job taking advantage RJ Godfreys first basket heres James Hunley Hatfield trying to burrow down and Wiggins will be called for the foul thatll get us to a timeout tigers by 17 were in the second half at Little John tonight they had Alan Murphy Junior Bridgeman Wesley Cox on that team cards were really good they finished 21 s Clemson had van Greg number five and tree Rollins and Paul Rogers did that game on the radio for Louisville thats pretty good pretty good wonderful people as well Huntley Hatfield will be fouled by Wiggins thatll be the third on the sophomore from Grayson Georgia five on the Tigers and thatll put the Tennessee transfer Brandon Huntley Hadfield at the line where hes only got a single field goal tonight Dan its been really tough Wes he spent a lot of time on the bench in foul trouble yep and they were concerned about the Clemson size and the Clemson size even though lilles out rebounded when Clemson has used their muscle on the inside to score effectively in the interior 17 points lead Huntley Hatfield knocks the Free Throw Down Jack Clark back into the ball game first time weve seen him in the second half he replaces RJ Godfrey West in the start of the second half looks remarkably like the start of the first each team really struggling to put the ball in the basket yep 4529 beetle skip pass out front heres Wiggins inside Hall to work a COR for defending PJ scores with the right hand very little a COR 4 can do yep his next foul is his last foul yeah Louisville in it Zone that time in West we might point out lilles without any point guards at the moment yeah sky Clark got kneed in the hip theyre evaluating him he is off the Louisville bench at the juncture heres white trapped underneath 10 to shoot and we got traveling or 3 seconds travel says Ron gr pivot 10th turnover of the night for Louisville and another look at Hall at the Block PJ Hall has had no success at all from Beyond the threepoint line but hes done a great job carving himself some space in the on the carving out some space for himself on the inside yep Clarks on the walk back to the Louisville bench with Devonte Fraser their trainer heres Jack Clark out of the corner rimmed off white the rebound I dont know that skot Clark looks like hes going to come back in this game or not heres Trey white at the front long two good for white well hes the scorer tonight for the cards hes got 157 here in the second half for Trey white hes got all their baskets in the second half far sure does all of the field goals beetle in the corner Chase Hunter thought about it now willll pull the trigger and hit cord on a three for Hunter hes got five in the half now 16 in the game on his second three won he only had four threes in ACC play coming in so hes already got 50 of that number 19point lead been as big as 20 and the cards turn it over there 11th turnover on Louisville and this is just Chase Hunter hes in good position and theyre playing him to drive the ball which is a good idea because we said hes really struggled shooting the three in ACC play but he makes him pay for it there Hunter weaving around tried to go back to PJ Hall heres Wiggins a long three oh boy Chanty Wiggins 22nd three of the Year Dan he had been just two of his last eight Wes but when hes he has a funny looking shot but when you give him that much time he shoots a fairly good percentage largest lead of the night for the Tigers now at 22 Huntley Hatfield along two nope Hall tried to keep it alive Beetle runs out for it a lead for Clark what a pass Josh Beetle dont give him the full bag yet son my Heavens eight well well Scott Clark you see at the Louisville bench for Kenny Payne the sophomore transfer from Illinois came in averaging 10 points and three and a half assists till his night is over uh Devonte Frasier the trainer telling head coach Kenny Payne he cannot continue so now all of a sudden foul trouble Among The Bigs injuries on the back court well remember we told you earlier Tyler Johnson whos sitting right next to yeah Clark on the bench there he hasnt played at all he had an ankle injury in at the end of the shoot around this morning and hery Miller didnt even make the trip yeah hery Millers uh out seeking medical consultation for an injury and not with this team and Huntley hfield went to the deck BOS Lia and chy Wiggins went to the deck with him I think Wiggins got called for a foul that is correct and chy Wiggins who just knocked down the three he got his fourth his fourth foul I believe with 1243 to play by my count maybe not say third okay third I mismarked one Wes weve played more than 27 minutes in this game and Louisville does not have an assist yet yep again they got guys playing out of position and thats a thats the kind of stat you dont want to talk about no heres white James heres Williams firing and its a rim Miss on the backside Hunter had it and white knocked away Dono yovanovich has coming to the Ball Game for Louisville and heres Joseph Gerard thei for Chanty Wiggins so look at Clemson Now Lea Clark and then three guards here Gerard Beetle and Chase Hunter Dan a little pressure provided by the cards as well yeah Mike James hes going to have to play the point guard role both on offense and defense Hunter kicks for Clark Jack will be called for the carry lost his concentration as he came around the top he had too many options in front of well he was he was going to try to pass the ball Wes and thats why you jump stop and pass the ball with two hands but how many times have we seen two palming or caring violations in the same game not many thats weve had tonight both of them against Clemson yep of course there are those out there watching saying well they could call it every time a Balls thats true but its not quite like traveling which has been Laughter legalized know theres a thats the another term for the Euro Step here we go white on the drive inside Huntley Hatfield the flush and theres assist number one yep first of the night for Louisville cards Trail 22 with Under 12 to play in the ball game at Little John Wesson remember this game was tied at 18 yeah light up for Clark heres Gerard Joseph back for Jack Clark pretty good ball Movement by the Tigers it doesnt get stuck much here seven to shoot Gerard looking for help tried to fish it to Li oh skips to Beetle Lefty three too strong missed everything and Gerard will fire it away with the clock winding down and hit the rim that should I dont know that that ever hit the rim Wes I think that should have been a shot clock VI AC but it doesnt matter Louisville was got it yep Huntley Hatfield and he will throw it away thats going to go to Clemson on the turnover Huntley Hatfield was looking for somebody air meled Kenny pay not happy Trey whes their leading score he feeds Huntley Hatfield here were back after this well we started tonight here at Little John Coliseum talking about Clemson off a disappointing loss at Duke Dan but saying that they still had plenty in front of them you couldnt Linger on the loss because theres too many opportunities starting tonight with Louisville and heres their next five and its important to remember tonight is just their fourth ACC home game of 10 Dan well and they its obviously its easier to play at home and there but they theyve got a Virginia team that is getting better in North Carolina of course they lost their first game on the road today and so theyve got to go to North Carolina we saw Syracuse on the weekend and Syracuse even though they lost to Boston College they are a very competitive team and then Miami and NC stayed at home so that is a very interesting scheduled those are all winnable games for Clemson and theyve put themselves in great position as Mike young said theyre in position to be in position and now they got to go through with it true Gerard little give and go with hall now hell wrap it around to PJ turns on Huntley Hatfield it rattles Out Boy hes missed a couple of those tonight shots that he normally makes that little lefthanded shot just right on top of the rim frustrating night for PJ Hall from a scoring perspective here is white hell launch a three and thats no good look at Jack White keep it alive and whos going to be called for the white I think white white no Clark Clark Im sorry yep Jack Clark the foul thats going to be his first the sixth on Clemson and theyre going to look to see if theres a hook and hold yep so first trip to the monitor tonight for this crew of Lee Cassell Ron gr and Paul SS are you okay and what what theyre talking about is did Clark put his arm over top of xan Paynes arm and then pull down well show you a couple looks here what theyre examining Dan youll talk us through it all right down underneath the basket number five Clark and xan Payne I dont know it didnt look like he thats one hooked him theyre locked up there but the hook and hold t for it to be a hook and hold which is a flagrant file heres a better look at it yeah their arms are locked up there but if to to have that be a flagrant file you actually have to pull down and I dont know that he ever did hes got him but theres got to be a leverage used with it right yeah yep so while they look at that and here we go theres a hook and hold we see and and play on will be the story yeah so thats the definition and it can be a flagrant one or flagrant 2 but usually to get that call the guy has to pull down and that never happened yep they locked arms certainly but Clark never pulled down so here is xan Payne the coachs son first free throw attempts of the year for Payne whos averaging about seven minutes a game hes and the free throw no good white got the rebound put it back up and theres another foul and that continues to be a problem for the Tigers Wes I think thats on the hall its his second seven on Clemson or eight eight team fouls yep that is now 12 offensive rebounds for Louisville of course 11 of those came in the first half and here is Trey white at the line first free throw good he is perfect four for four at the line hes got 8 and 12 and 16 in the ball game he missed hes come back started the last four games including tonight had double figures now in four of his last five 16 tonight chance at 17 here and it rolls in for it listen nobody else for L has more than five that is correct heres a little backcourt pressure and a 20point Clemson lead Gerard with Williams out front here is Hall tigers have got the starters on the floor here Gerard thought about it now for Hall PJ the catch tried to save it he thought he got knocked out of bounds instead heres Huntley Hatfield triying to get to the basket he threw it up and draws the foul and thats on Chase Hunter itll be the third on Hunter its the ninth on Clemson just three team fouls on Louisville here in the second Music half Wes this is what youre talking about Hall has the ball inside and he feels like he got pushed I dont I just think he was off balance he he dropped the ball and got off balance trying to recover it and the free throw Hunley had feel good hes got six in the game now Chase Hunter out Dylan hunter Music in 19point game second one good and as you mentioned Wes with the foul situation Louisville has a chance to do some business on the free throw line yep cards tonight 13 of 16 at the Music line heres Gerard in for Hall hell turn and score and that puts PJ Hall 15th all time in Clemson history hes now got 16 in the ball game tonight hes five of 16 from the floor theres Trey white squeezing inside and scoring well Trey white 19 tonight now to lead Louisville and that was just White Moving without the basketball you know PJ Hall he hasnt had a good shooting night West but he just doesnt seem to get frustrated he just keeps going out there and he just keeps playing and Huntley Hatfield and Hall battled PJ touched at last young man from Spartanburg Dorman High School and again Wes he does a great job getting position inside close to the basket Gerard makes a very nice pass and weve seen him miss a couple of those tonight but that time he was good James slashing to the basket blocked by Hall and recovered by white Clemson couldnt gather heres Curtis Williams firing away Trey white cleans it up well white nows got 21 in the ball game well hes just been all around the basketball particularly in the second half yep hes one off his season High which is also his career high at 22 against New Mexico state in late November 16point lead heres Gerard on the drive and nothing there heres the outlet for white Dylan Hunter chasing and Trey white going to dunk it down and hes got a new career high 23 for Trey white and all of a sudden its a 14point game that was a great Outlet pass by Zan Payne but Wes this is what we talked about with Louisville they they will not quit they just keep coming at you well Trey White and the cards on a 122 run in the last three and a half hes been responsible for a good bit of it hes got a career high night going but Clemson is well the cards are riding a career high tonight from Trey white Dan and hes been as responsible for the 122 run the last three and a half as anybody else in a black Jersey tonight W absolutely but again its very similar to the first half what Louisville has done here they built this comeback on the strength of Trey wght on offense but offensive rebounding the cards have 16 offensive rebounds in this game Gerards chefin Wiggins Hall Chase Hunter for the tigers with the basketball heres Hall working against Caleb Glenn and one coming Caleb Glenn to quote the old Billy Lee the great Campbell coach Caleb Glenn is down there in a sword fight with a pocket knife well he is now fouled out of the game and hes just too small to handle PJ Hall who makes a really quick move to the Baseline yep so Caleb Glenn on the fourth team foul against Louisville is dismissed from the contest and thatll bring Emanuel aor four back onto the floor and that is the seventh time that PJ has been fouled tonight so a lot of the Louisville foul trouble has come about trying to guard PJ Hall yep you know lots of times when your big guys get in foul trouble they make silly fouls they set illegal screens they foul somebody reaching in at half court but we havent seen that tonight theyve gotten all their fouls trying to stop PJ Hall and Ian shefflin on the inside so Hall at the line hes got 16 or hes got 18 tonight and a chance for 19 here and the free throw good 19 on an evening West where he has shot the ball very poorly yep he had 28 at the Y Center last year hes six of 17 from the floor but hes seven of seven at the line and hes missed all six of his threepoint tries and Clemson back to sha Zone mhm seen this a little bit from them tonight I think its worked at TI its been an interesting uh wrinkle to what they do theres a fall away Williams boy Curtis Williams wired up that zone with his first basket of the game boy goodl looking 65 freshman from Detroit runner up for Mr basketball in the state of Michigan Curtis Williams whos averaging 8 and a half against the league that was only a seventh twopoint Basket in ACC Play heres sheflin a kick out Wiggins now Gerard tend to shoot for the Tigers eight to shoot with Hunter bounce pass for shefflin thats xan Payne defending there goes the chef kicks for Hunter with the shot clock winding down thats a Miss off the rim and Wiggins couldnt collect it a COR for does and here is White having a huge night all the way through and scores whoa what a move by Trey white 25 now for white in the ball game just nobody stopped him white 13point game again with under seven to play Louisville is the team that just conf founds you at times the ability to completely go dark Dan from a scoring perspective and then all of a sudden reel off what 146 I think thats the Run 16 to5 it is Gerard a step back three shefflin the offensive rebound and a held ball is going to be called and possession awarded to Louisville Brad Brown L and the partisan tiger fans not happy again another good play by Zan Payne shefflin gets this ball and hes trying to control it he brings it down because pay is right there pain ties him up he didnt grab him by the arm he grabbed the ball partisans may be upset with the quickness of that whistle so now with less than six and a half to play James fires that cuts it to 10 Wes this looks like the game that Louisville played against NC State yep where Louisville was way down you figure theyre out of the game and suddenly now theyre back in and having a chance to win now theyre not there yet but Clemson needs a basket yep sure do Gerard back for Wiggins threepointer away too strong rebound for Payne Wiggins is not a good threepoint shooter when he has to shoot it that quickly James who just knocked down the three a moment ago and leads them in conference scoring at 15 a game and they roll to the deck out of bounds was white so that will give it to Clemson with 540 to go Wes keep in mind weve mentioned this a couple times Louisville playing without any of their point guards yep Scott Clark out of the ball game Percy Miller not here Tyler Johnson unable to go after an ankle injury at the shoot around this morning and despite that theyve battled back into the game theyve actually that was a turnover there but theyve handled the ball fairly well here in the second half considering the the circumstances when you dont have your primary ball handlers tell you what Paul sells and one of the Louisville student managers and all hands are on the deck to get everything cleaned up heres Chase Hunter now working against Mike James Wiggins shefflin entry for Hall Huntley Hatfield playing with just the two fouls look at PJ Hall go to work 11 and a half 21 in the game for Hall hes got his 10th game of 20 or more this year its his fourth against the ACC and Huntley Hatfield his his goal was to try to stay between PJ Hall in the basket and he wasnt able to accomplish it that time Williams Baseline fallway two is good Curtis Williams now with a pair of field goals he has shown at times this year West Curtis Williams that is that he can put the ball in the basket Louisville hit their last six shots on the floor shefflin heres Wiggins Hall will be fouled by Huntley Hatfield third on Brandon five on the cards and we see action now both ends here Dan but PJ Hall he gets the ball in there and theres no help and thats a nice spin move to the Baseline and then this is just a very good you know the dribbles behind his back the step back the fall away and we said Williams he was one of he was the top rated player in the state of Michigan last year Gerard heres Hunter Chase on the drive thats a spot up and it bounds away Hall got knocked down thats on Huntley Hatfield or they lost it out of bounds oh I saw PJ Hall go to the deck but Louisville was out of bounds I guess on the the other side of the goal so of belong to Clon no foul just out of bounds yeah and the ball did hit the rim so the clock will reset at 20 yep Gerard trying to get it back to Hall Huntley Hatfield fronting him heres Gerard into traffic look at this with a right hand but Gerard I mean he does that pretty well he thats a shot hell normally make although theres rning against some taller guys that time with out to check James deanovic returns to James 10 to shoot for the cards all the way through and a foul on Hall will be his third 10 now on Clemson with 403 to go and James has had a rough night shooting the basketball West but playing against a taller guy hes able to get by him and create some contact with PJ Hall so James will go to the line Louisville is 13 of 16 at the strike Mike James has hit his last two quick reminder to you ACC womens basketball Thursday night presented by Alli well start at blackburg number 19 Virginia Tech meets Virginia at 6 and then off to Raleigh for State Carolina 800 Eastern on acc Network and streaming live for you on the ESPN James cuts it to eight 62 54 with 402 to go hunter front court at the Music right heres Hall at the top back for Wiggins Fall Away spins off PJ Hall tried to make the play heres Louisville now with a three on three white for William Williams rattled out a COR for fouled by shefflin Third on shefflin free throws when we come back for emanu well you see Louisville to within eight 6254 the last 9 minutes it belonged to the cards 237 run theyre six of their last seven from the floor Clemson just one of their last seven a lot of it has been the 17 second half points of sophomore transfer tra white whos got a career high tonight of 25 to go with 11 rebounds and we return to action and Emanuel aor for will be at the free throw line for two shots to try and cut it to six Dan well after he got the 17th offensive rebound of the game for Louisville they already have 12 Second Chance points in fact the second chance Point score is 12 to nothing in favor of Louisville so here here is a COR for who at the line three of four this year and knocks the first one down comfortably dont forget ACC PM weekday afternoon and this Friday its from Chapel Hill Mark Packer Taylor tanom will be there ahead of Duke Carolina with the show at 400 Eastern look at that second free throw missed white got the rebound and a foul was called and Trey Whites going to the line and the foul is on Hall its his fourth and Trey Whites going to the line in a sevenpoint game W theres a little mixup here Hall blocks out Hunley hfield who goes into shefin and they Hall and sheflin fall down and that opens the thing up for white 18 offensive rebounds yep so Trey white now and you see Clemsons foul trouble which is mirroring some of Louisvilles issues in a sevenpoint game free throw by white is good boy Trey white on a night when doesnt appear to be anybody else available at times to go go score things here is white just good good he was available boy no kidding hes had a career high 26 make it 27 as he knocks that one down and white is seven for seven at the line won weve been talking about the fact that with Hunley Hatfield in foul trouble PJ Hall could go right at him but now PJ Hall with four fouls hes got to be careful even on the offensive end you dont want to pick up an offensive foul yep sixpoint ball game Chase Hunter out here in the midcourt area now to Hall tigers by six entry for Hall working on Huntley Hatfield scores thats where you go when you need a basket and they needed one desperately 13 in the second half 23 in the ball game now for the senior from Spartanburg well now hes got to be careful on this end and west back to an eightpoint game inside 3 minutes Huntley Hatfield for yavan ofage missed it haul the rebound boy thats one if youre Louisville West you need to have that was Point Blank Range yep Donal low could not finish it heres Wiggins sheflin how do you not go to 24 in the white here Hunter will fire and hes fouled by James and James oh no its inside its going to be on yvanovich against Hall and its hit sixth on Louisville Music but all right its the seventh I beg your pardon on Louisville Dan so one and one for PJ Hall with 237 to play who has now been fouled nine times in this game well he and Judah men ought to have a contest at least the conversation yep one and one for Hall with told you a moment ago with 23 eightpoint game here at Little John left it on the front rim look who got the rebound the accs leading rebounder in conference play on the offensive glass Hall calling for it with 12 to shoot now this is where he can get in trouble if he tries to drive to the basket there he goes right hand turn got it he got in trouble and went right to the rim well that was really under control West you put the if you put your head down and just drive it you risk getting charge but that was a very smart undercontrol play hes got 25 now in the game heres Williams trying to drive shefin to the basket Hall going to collect the rebound throw the outlet to Hunter that was a great catch by Hunter sure was and that time Hunter tried to bounce it back to Gerard and an unforced error will cost Clemson there and that has Brad Brownell really upset PJ Hall just standing looking gives the fake in Huntley Hatfield Wes he Huntley Hatfield established position and stood there a little bit too early needed to keep moving his feet tigers by 10 under two to go on a Tuesday night at little JN youll love this so much space wait till you see the kitchen game at 6656 and here is why because the last free throw by Trey white Dan little on ctisle in the rule book you cant break the three point line right you cannot break the threepoint line until the ball hits the rim and obviously he was in while the ball was still in the air yep dont see that often either weve seen two double dribbles tonight right and that I dont know that Ive ever seen a lane violation where the guy broke the threepoint line ear at least not unless youre trying to miss the shot at the end of the game James foul on Huntley Hatfield left side side white shot fake Baseline wont go Payne had a shot at it Huntley Hatfield gets it back five to shoot James launches it wont go pay the rebound back up and a foul will be called on Clemson on who its on Hall and thats five so PJ Hall will foul out with 25 tonight with 128 to go won this is something this is a problem that this play Clemson all night their failure to secure a defensive rebound and nobodys anywhere near pain and he just does a great job turning in traffic PJ Hall you know you got four fouls you just have to step away from that one not give the official the opportunity to blow the whistle fourth time this year hes fouled out third in the league well Wes one of the problems that hes had in League Play has been hes hes had some foul trouble now I dont know really called foul drible he fouls out with 128 left he was able to play most of the game and score 25 points but that is a matter of concern for Clemson PJ Hall he just doesnt help him if hes falling out of the game xan Payne to the line he missed the front end of a one and one earlier in the ball game and this one is good and thats his first free throw of the year in terms of conversion hes got one field goal on the year and now one free throw theres a lane violation by Clemson not it is called Lee Cel got Chanty Wiggins yep so Zan pay will get another crack at to free throw but you can understand Wiggins being anxious Clemsons had a tough time getting defensive rebounds yep heres the second missed it Clark the rebound Jack Clarks a terrific offensive rebounder and inside score thats an over and back and a double dribble dri not over and back a double dribble so theres the double dribble thats the third time weve seen the double dribble or the carry tonight called thats 12 CL in turnovers with 78 seconds left in a npoint game Dan when does Louisville start looking at threes now theyve been winding clock and driving for scores and things like that here most of the night in this comeback while Clemsons been in their scoring drought well if youre going to look for threes I think you got to Williams and James have to be the guys taking the shot and their best offense has been white driving to the basket heres James thinking about it launches misses rebound Clark had it Jack will tuck it away and now get it to Dylan Hunter and Payne in the back court will commit the foul and that will put Clemson at the line down at the other end with 594 to go and the problem the problem with saying okay when do we go to the three is that Louisville is now 1 for 18 shooting threes tonight yep so here is Dylan Hunter to the line and he is just five of 10 at the stripe this year and offense now which was so hot has suddenly gone cold yep theyve missed their what no field goals in the last four minutes everythings been happening at the line a COR for comes back into the ball game and Dylan Hunter missed that shefflin almost got the rebound front court is white 52 seconds left cards trailing nine Huntley Hatfield winding to the basket against Clark over the top of sheflin aore for the rebound and the hand went through the net so the basket will score for Emanuel aor for thats his second field goal I think it was wiggin hand that went through the net well I think Wiggins had his hand in the net when the ball was on the rim and thats a goal end and right there yep he puts his hand up through the rim up through the net I think theyve gone to the monitor to confirm this right Dan well they called a go tend Wes but its not goal tending if you just hit the net the ball has to be on the rim when you hit the net got it so thats exactly what Paul SS tells us comes up through they what they rule is it come up through and he VI he caused the rim to vibrate and so with the ball in the cylinder that makes that a goal t so heres what were looking at they by he actually hits the rim Wes he actually hits the flange underneath and vibrates the rim so its a sevenpoint game with 41 seconds left Clemson has got they have put Wiggins shefflin Chase Hunter Joe Gerard and Jack Clark on the floor and Ian shefflin I think is going to take the ball out of bounds oh no Chanty Wiggins I beg your pardon come down and handle that well neither Wiggins nor Clark have missed a free throw in ACC play but they their numbers are very low five for five for the one two for two for the other so you might want to give one of them a chance into Hunter and heres the backourt press and yanovich commits the foul Donal second and that is nine now on Louisville so Chase Hunter to the line so were still shooting oneonone though oneonone Hunter has gone over a th in his career tonight Hunley Hatfield is back yvanovich to the cards bench and RJ Godfrey hes coming on the floor here for Joe Gerard thats a defensive maneuver Y sevenpoint game with Hunter at the line with 38 seconds left front end fell off the rim here is white now front Court looking for a ball screen fakes it step back out of the corner three away Good Louisville hits the three theres white having a career night and a timeout taken by Brad Brownell because its a fourpoint game with 286 left 21 in the second half now for Trey White and Louisville has hit a couple of Threes here in the second half one from Williams and that one a moment to go from White well white coming into the game Wes uh in conference play a low volume but high percentage threepoint shooter and hes hes he was 0 for four shooting threes before that one yep and Kenny Payne in his group talking Josh Jameson had to scout on the Clemson Tigers meanwhile it has been Trey White night 29 tonight for white 21 in the second half and Dan he is dang near singlehandedly kept Louisville in it well he certainly brought a back West 21 points and a half hes driven the ball to the basket hes made jump shots and we just saw him make a three hes got oldfashioned threepoint plays I mean that shot right there coming underneath the basket and then hes re rebounded the ball he had 10 rebounds in the second half and here he stepped back for a three that they desperately needed his first of the night Brad Brownell called that timeout cuz he had to get Joe Gerard back in the game if you let that ball be inbounded they foul Godfrey whos a poor free throw shooter so it is a twopossession game with 289 left white trying to become the first card to score 30 in a game since L Ellis did it a year ago February against Miami he had 33 against the kanes so got to get the ball in bounds thats the first thing Clark going to put it in play shefflin and Wiggins in the four Court Here Comes Gerard can and it is to Joe it got stolen by Williams he couldnt hang on to it wow that was close that is a TR Louisville almost came away with one there and just a tremendous play by Williams can get his hand on that ball so wait a second here theres some discussion about does he have 10 seconds well he doesnt so heres the def knocked the ball out of bounds you got to get it over by and theres the timeout well now what youve done Wes by calling that timeout you buy yourself another 10 there you go so Brad Brownell is going to call the timeout 262 left its a fourpoint game at 6662 lets go back to the play a moment ago and almost a terrific steal by Williams well the B the ball it was a very poor inbounds pass he threw it right past Gerard and Gerard is trying to stay out of the way so he doesnt get called for a foul and Williams is off balance and goes out of bounds but by calling that timeout you get yourself another 10 seconds so Clemson out of timeouts Louisville has one to go and a new 10 second count will await Brad Brown Ls team here well now Wes you got to get the ball in bounds and you dont have a timeout to do thats right to call and of course you cant move this is a spot throw in if youre going to make a mistake you want to make it at the other end of the floor dont absolutely so Clark will be def Ed by Zan Payne and Williams is still going to try to keep the ball away from Gerard remember PJ Halls fouled out of the ball game for Clemson and here comes Gerard to the ball theyll get it to Wiggins and theres the foul with 247 left by Trey white so Chanty Wiggins whos 80 but only has attempted 15 free throws this year will go to the line but it is now two shot stand two shot foul with 24 7 left and as we mentioned before hes five out of five shooting free throws in the ACC so a good percentage just a very low volume yep free throw by Wiggins is good makes it a fivepoint game cha Wiggins was six tonight stay tuned Justin Walker Luke Hancock standing by theyll Chronicle the night in the ACC for Kenny Paynes just taken his last time out with 247 left Dan NC state has beaten Miami tonight Wolfpack has gone to six and four they break that tie remember those were two five and four teams and the Wolfpack had lost three in a row Wes and thats a thats a big win Miami you know Miami is struggling a little bit in conference play yep 24 tonight from DJ horn leads the wolf pack we already told you that Justin and Luke Chronicle at halftime BC beat Syracuse at home 8075 Georgia Tech beat North Carolina 7473 in Atlanta tonight so the wolf pack winning by six points at 7468 well West that North Carolina Georgia Tech score is really a surprise not the I mean Georgia Tech theyve beaten they beat Duke down there they beat uh theyve beaten Clemson Clemson they beat Clemson and now Carolina and now Carolina but but theres a surprising thing about that is and Dongo Dongo didnt play he left the ball game missed the last 35 minutes tonight they leading score and leading rebounder and yet they win the game yeah Nathan George that young freshman guard terrific tonight for Damon stms team and here at Little John Brad brownells team trying to get on track and pick up their fourth win in the ACC before Virginia visits here on Saturday Wiggins confidently knocks down a couple of free throws to give him seven and now Clemson going to put some pressure on trying to force Louisville to burn some clock both teams out of timeouts now Sixpoint game heres Williams Gerard there Williams going to drop and feed pay lay up good quick inbounds and Gerard is fouled Louisville was going for the hell Ball but I believe pay was called for the foul it is the second on Alexander pay this is actually a pretty good job by Clemson you defend the three you dont really worry about the two at this point in the game and Gerard first first of all shefflin does a great job grabbing the ball and throwing it in quickly yep and Gerard does a great job being alert and catching that one so here is Joseph Gerard III and the free throw good West we talk about all the smart little things that Ian sheflin does and that was a perfect example right there grab the ball throw it in bounds before the defense can get set doesen tonight for Joseph and two more 13 10 seconds left sixpoint game you defend the three Trey white will launch from in front of the bench hit the rim heres Wiggins on the run out hell give it to Clark and thatll do it the old surviving advance in the ACC tonight Dan absolutely Clemson ran out to the big lead
