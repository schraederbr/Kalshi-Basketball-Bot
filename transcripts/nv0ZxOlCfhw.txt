Iowa State off to a good start in a Panther uniform this year 91 points per game for Indraitis And were underway from the beat The Bearcats win the tip And Jeremiah Quigley sets up the offense And right away 9 seconds in we get an offball foul called against Cameron Corin and the Panthers And Nick this is a matchup you and I were talking about before the game Youve got the leading scoreer for the Panthers in Corin going up against the leading scoreer for Bingmpington and Lily Two bigs that are going to be battling down low throughout the night Two bigs that are undersized fives but they can score it They can rebound it Theyre getting chippy early This is going to be a battle for pride And both coaches rely on these guys As you can see both in the top 25 in the country in minutes per game on the year So Lily whos coming off the missed game due to illness against Central Connecticut State is happy hes back in the lineup and the Bearcats are going to need him to go against the big physical body in Corin for the Panthers And now Quigley missires on a three once again battling down low And just like that Nick youve got one foul a piece on Corin and Lily down low And both teams are struggling with depth Both teams dealing with injuries and different situations on their teams where you know they cant fully practice the whole season Foul trouble is the last thing you want in the front court Leading scorer also the leading rebounder for each team Thats Lily for the Bearcats and Corin for Pit Demarco Miner setting up the half court offense here for the Panthers for the first time tonight Miner the transfer from Oregon State Nowitis with five to shoot Dumps it off to Corin muscles his way down low and finishes And that was an unselfish play by Andraitis there He had an open shot but you know why not create for somebody whos shooting over 50 from the field Thats what Pit needs to do Jam the ball down low to Corin and get some easy buckets to start the game So Panthers on the board first Another battle down on the inside Lily and Corin This time Lily kicks out to Peterson who spins his way through but Dunning comes in with the rejection That was a great move there getting to the basket Bingington likes to drive the ball to the basket keep easy buckets early but Dunning with great help defense and there another example of great help defense 511 Jeremiah quickly running into a lot of traffic on that drive Nothing doing for him now And incitus penetrates slithering through the lane and applause and cheering wondering if they might count the basket there for Andraitis He at least drew the foul Good use of the screen there The screen and roll If its not broke dont fix it Getting to the basket this time That doesnt look like a bullend to me Didnt touch the backboard first Two free throws Anditis Go ahead Yeah the Panthers getting Andraitis involved early Jeff Cable inserting Indraitis into the starting lineup for tonights game Not his first start on the year but coach Cable figuring out the best lineup combination for this pit team Certainly something you want to have figured out going into conference play Panthers have one more nonconference game against Penn State before they open up their ACC schedule against Miami Heres Dunning off the offensive rebound cant connect on the three Another second chance for the Panthers and cheering Dunning takes it in Count the basket A great drive from Dunning getting to the basket there But who other than Indraitis whos been involved in every single play so far offensively doing a great job getting that offensive rebound Oh good ball fake Good drive to the basket using the left Dunning Second start of the year for injuritis And how about Barry Dunning Jr Nick This is a guy that early in the season you and I were talking about the potential he clearly had He has shown his scoring ability throughout his college career Struggled to find his footing to start out his time at Pit but look what hes done over the last seven games He had done one of those players whos applause done it at the highest level in division one basketball He came here all conference last year He could score the basketball at a high rate He just needed to get his confidence to get his feet settled in It looks like hes settling in for this team right now Dunning had a really impressive season last year before transferring to Pit He was at South Alabama He had a 46point game in midFebruary last season Yeah Theres not a lot of guys in the country that can score 46 points Panthers with the early 6 nothing lead Miner defending the Bearcats point guard and Quigley Quigley drives and hits some penetration that causes the foul to go against looked like DeMarco Miner Miner caught there being a little overly aggressive Quicklys one of those guards He likes the contact Its rare for a small quick guard to like contact guy whos bigger than him but he he really drives on it He knows how to draw fouls Quigley lost it for a moment Ended up with Lily now Four to shoot Quigley drives Has it taken away Dunning in transition Get ready Thought he might go in for this one He lays it off the window instead He just Yeah Wanted the style points there with the finger roll Long as it ends with two points right back two points Donnie with five quick ones for the Panthers early Good hands there from Miner Oh that looked nice like Clyde Drexler there floating in the air for the finger roll layup Johnny Jr two nice layups so far tonight I think you could actually hear one of his teammates on that first shot saying all the way all the way Take it yourself Barry It was a threeonone Yep Excellent start for the Panthers and forcing Bingmpington into tough shots Another tough one there on the fadeaway but it does result in the Bearcats first made field goal of the night Bearcats really need to try to do a good job to keep this game close when theyre trailing at half their own and six on the season Let Corin get a nice another move there Corin winning the battle of the big so far Four points Hes two for two from the floor Lily has not attempted a field goal yet Panthers doing a good job preventing Bingmpington from getting it inside to their big man and leading scoreer Its a testament to Pitts ball pressure Theyre really pressuring the ball making everything difficult Benigny from the corner swirls out Dunning squares up for a three Wont go Rebound hauled in by Bengy 102 the Panther lead Nothing doing there Good defense on the shot attempt from Beverly Really like to see Lily get more touches Indraitis fires and hits and the foul Making an immediate impact Indraitis cant draw up a much better start if youre Jeff Cable The Panthers with a 132 lead Noitis with the triple in his second start A week ago he had those 34 against Hofra 30 coming in the second half of that game As you saw in the graphic the most by any power conference player this season off the bench 34 for Cummings in that one And of course he had the big game against Eastern Kentucky last season as well So Brandon Cummings in a bench role today and his Panthers already with a 142 lead a 60 run over the last minute playing some very good basketball to get started tonight screaming Talk about comfort level coming off the bench Its one of my old coaches in high school used to say its not about stole great dunk there Its its not whether you come off the bench Its are you does the coach trust you to put you in the game when it matters Are you playing You may play starter minutes You may come off the bench but you may end up playing starter minutes But great back door cut Wow Powerful dunk showing off his athleticism And it was Su Lampa who got caught on the back door Is that a freshman mistake right there Yeah definitely a freshman mistake Maybe just got a little lazy there Tried to feed it inside to Kieran Mullen Hes new into the game as well Ascot intercepted But Nick overall Jeff Cable going to be happy about the start tonight for Pit He was telling us earlier today about how there have been stretches throughout the season in some of their early games they did not get off to good starts Struggled to settle into a rhythm Hes going to be happy theyre up 10 early on Yeah And a lot of the bad starts are just sometimes guys focusing on their offense too much and not let me go in there and get a charge Let me dive on a loose ball let me get that big tough defensive rebound Kind of worried about the wrong things You know he talked a lot about playing the right way Playing the right way And thats what he meant You got to do the little things to win games Not all just about scoring And dont forget in terms of major contributors from last year its really just Cameron Corin and Brandon Cummings Papa out with injury And so a lot of new guys still trying to get familiar with each other And its coming along in nonconference play with that game against Miami to open the ACC slate coming up for the Panthers Turnover there Oneonone Benigny against Indraitis Contact no call And Mullen comes up with the rebound On a twoonone fast break and you take it up like that refs arent going to bail you out with a call But Nicky and Cummings nearly drew an one on the other end He will go to the line for two Thats a twoon one you got to get a bucket out of here But thats just walling up straight up straight down textbook defense from Injitus And I mean thats a lot of the things that coach Capable saw when he inserted him in into the starting lineup Thats what this team needed and hes hes provided that today Cummings at the line 88 free throw shooter on the season Omari Witherspoon will make his first appearance of the night and Cummings two for two from the strike Thats a score Sometimes best way to get your offense started is by getting to the free throw line and he can score with the best of them Bingington better keep him off the line because he can hang 30 on you real quick Going to set up the offense for Bingington And Demetrius Lily by the way still has not attempted a field goal for the Bearcats Lily on the year averaging 16 points and 10 rebounds that time Quickly was denied on the drive but he does draw the foul Thats just small small guard driving in amongst Giants Two 610 plus guys Oh through the foul trying to get some easy buckets for his team And it will go down as the second foul against Kieran Mullen as Lavel Sanders looks on His point guard makes the first of two at the line Now Nick those two fouls on Mullen notable Weve talked about some of the injuries that Pit has suffered Theres no Deshawn Jackson and theres no Papa Hes out with an injury as well So the Pit front court really limited to Cameron Corin and Kieran Mullen Of course Roman Cepa can step in and play the four as well but they want to keep those guys out of foul trouble But Kieran Mullen is going to stay in with the two personals And thats what plagued them against Villanova You know Corin in the first half got in foul trouble Uh I think they were up four 28 to 24 before a 100 run as Coror and got in foul trouble Benigny swiped it from injuritis Now Lily back out to Bengy and he connects on the three Great shot by Benigny He was in pregame He shot probably 200 of those exact jump shots in pregame He was warmed up ready for that shot And what a great story he has has battled injuries throughout his college career He was telling us before the game Nick how he has not gone a full season as Cummings hits the three but Indi has not gone a full season staying healthy from wire to wire Thats his goal for this year And Bingmpington needs him to because theyve battled injuries themselves And its unfortunate Hes such a great kid We talked him before the game Hes a basketball junkie I dont think Ive ever met somebody of his age who loved the game so much He wants to get into coaching How about he told us hes always been a Lakers fan but hes hated LeBron James so much that he couldnt cheer for them anymore You know youre either a LeBron guy or a Jordan guy You know its a theres no in between Nobody likes both Bingmpington dropping back into his own here in the half court And they force a turnover Bearcats with a little bit of momentum now after a slow start Down seven Peterson drives kicks Benigny again Baseline drive and kick to Lily who gets the floater for his first basket of the night Pit keeps turning the ball over Theyre going to let Bingington stay around and hang around or looming back Now its a two possession game Bearcats have made their last three Cut that margin to five Indraitis left open Cant hit Peterson corral and whistle blown music to Punched over for the Bearcats His team music down five 11 minutes to go in the first half appearance So hes got the program moving in the right direction without a doubt in his fifth year Talked to coach about some of his old pit battles in the mid 90s I dropped the name to him I was like Oh so you played against Vontigo Cummings Hes like Yes Yes He remembered those battles Uh he also said he scored 21 points on them too So of course he had to include that Yeah He knows he knows what it takes to have a good game against He was in such a good era of Big East basketball Montego Cummings Ray Allen Rip Hamilton Allan Iverson one of the golden eras I would love to chat with Lavel Sanders for more than the 15 minutes we got with him today Im sure this is a guy that has some great stories Definitely uh coaching in the Czech Republic I mean hes a hes a winner Hes a winner everywhere hes been Hes won came to Bingmpington and really you may not you may look at the record it may look unimpressive but he really has uh done a great job at Bingmpington and turned it around and has turned into a little bit of a of a basketball school in the America East Conference 2014 the Panther lead How about the fresh cut for Roman C Lepa today I dont know Maybe you have to go into the program and take off a couple inches of his height laughter It does make him look a little shorter without the fro Listed at 66 maybe down to 64 65 Now how about Barry Dunning Jr with the effort off the free throw from Sua He was crashing the boards and he ends up drawing the foul Good job When you give relentless effort crashing the glass good things happen Just another way of him getting to the line adding some points to the lead Thats why the coaches say even if the balls going in still follow the shot Never know what can happen Drive from Peterson Had it poked away by Corin and falls into the hands of Miner Horns doing a great job today with the screens communicating using his hands using his physicality really making it tough for them to use screens in their offense Cummings found his spot from the midrange and hits Cummings starting to heat up Shooting great from the field today shooting all good shots Can we see another 30point game you think Well Nick I was just going to ask you aside from the obvious highscoring games hes had off the bench what do you like just about that approach from Jeff Cable what it does for Cummings what it does for Pit providing that spark halfway into the first half Its really uh seeing a trend in your team If you have a player who been scoring well off the bench sometimes keep him off the bench Its not You dont have to keep him on the bench He can play starter minutes He can play at the end of the games when you need him When you need a bucket you can put him in the game But its just having the wherewithal of okay how do my players succeed Can I put him in positions to succeed And coach Cable was talking to us earlier today about the history of six man of the year winners in this conference as they get a nice play off the ball movement inside of Corin thought you had Nike Sabandi Ishleot both won the ACC 6 man of the year award and he said the best teams that hes had at pit have had that type of presence off the bench Yeah any team if you have great players great spark plugs coming off the bench you can provide that offense youre going to cheering be a good team in division one basketball Corin with some good defense on the inside against Lily And now Corin works it to Cummings Fires a three Drills a three He is feeling it Hes truly the human microwave Once again Brandon Cummings having some success off the bench When we asked Jeff Cable about the change to the starting lineup Nick he kept it very simple He said he had 34 points in a game he came off the bench Thats all you need to know Yeah hes really scoring already in double figures for the game today Looked like he might have been thinking about a logo shot there didnt he Yeah I was surprised he didnt do the heat check but I think thats growth of him as a player as well Just youll score more You take good shots the more you score quickly Nice shot in the paint Not scared to get in the paint amongst the Giants Floater over the top Should note Jackson Benigny by the way is back out on the floor He was the reason we had that under 12 media timeout Took a hit into the nose from Cameron Corin and able to get back out there after being treated and Barry Dunning Jr hits a three to put the Panthers up 10 Panther threepoint shooting really starting to heat up And got to try to get stops on the other end Jeremiah Quigley starting to catch some fire for Bingmpington And both teams have the hot hand Panthers have made their last four Bearcats have made three in a row Cua skip pass back to him in the corner Now Dunning with five on the timer Kicks out Miner swings it Cummings Great ball movement by the Panthers but the three is misfired by Brandon Cummings Theyre doing a great job attacking the zone They keep getting good shots like that It might be a long night for Bingmpington Heres Peterson defended by Cummings Lily working on Corin off the window and in So Demetrius Lily the leading scorer for the Bearcats is starting to settle in Hes got six points now Hes one of those guys he can really fill it up I mean hes averaging 16 points a game but talked to coach Sanders Coach Sanders said could be averaging 20 He could do more Could do more He gets off to better starts and better condition Yeah How about specifically he said with the rebounding This is a guy that leads the conference in rebounds per game but coach Sanders still said he could get more out of Demetrius Lily Panthers led by as many as 12 Its now down to six Jake Blackburn with the triple for music Bingmpington Jeff Cable disappointed in his teams defense but a response from Barry Dunning Jr have a competitive 515 to prepare you for those games that Bingmpington hasnt been able to have because of all these injuries told us today Jake Blackburn was dealing with back issues throughout the season He made his first appearance of the season Saturday against Central Connecticut State And that was big because it allows the Bearcats to get that five on five going in practice And Blackburn now heating up from downtown This is what they hope to get out of him that they didnt have through the first 10 games of the season when he was out with those back problems And now they get him back and he is expected to be a lethal threepoint shooter for them You can see cable look look of desperation and ups being upset that hes let Blackman hit a couple threes Thats thats what he does on the scouting report Im sure hes circle shooter Dont let him shoot Dont jump on his shot fake Meanwhile Cummings heating up himself 12 points off the bench And I think Jeff Cables pretty happy about that decision to bring him off the bench in this game tonight I think we found a successful formula for Cummings Thats really the job of a coach is you want to put players in positions where they can succeed and be their best So far that off the pinch roll has been Cummings Drive from Quigley along the baseline screaming all the way around to Blackburn but the shot clock expired Good defense by the Panthers on that possession Cummings leading all scorers with 12 He has it Dishes off to Andraitis Got a three Surprising that Bingmpington is staying in that zone with how well Pit is shooting it from perimeter and creating open shots Usually hell stay in the zone if its working And good to see the Panthers having a successful threepoint shooting night So drive here Bryson Wilson got tangled up with Cam Corin Yeah And he just lost his balance kind of was riding him Lost his balance with his teammate behind him Foul trouble again for Corin in the first half of the game Panthers have five fouls as a team The problem is that four of them belong to the bigs Two each for Mullen and Corin where they are already thin to begin with Mention the threepoint shooting success for the Panthers tonight Theyre 5 for 10 They have already matched the amount of threes they made against Villanovavva on Saturday They were 5 for 22 in that game Screen from Caleppa off the pop back to Cummings Drives kicks Miner hits a three So threepoint onslaught right now Pit is shooting the ball Some of the best shooting weve seen all season from Pit Theyre really hard to beat if theyre scoring just getting good shots like this Got to think about going manto man if youre Bingington Yeah Yeah you got to got to switch or maybe extending the zone out not packing it in like they have been Panthers on an 80 run Everybody contributing from downtown this time Demarco Minor Nick DeMarco Minor for three He was ready to shoot I know Cummings with double figure scoring wanted to score but being music unselfish minor major threepointer Hes in rhythm music taking good shots with a limited amount of dribbles getting to his spots He is unstoppable offensively using his shot face getting to the basket taking good shots Its when he gets more than four or five dribbles and taking fadeaways where he kind of gets in trouble But today hes on balance and in the perfect role coming off the bench already with 12 points and 12 is his average on the season Really impressive music start from Brandon Cummings and the Panthers have needed that spark off the bench They got up 12 but then Bingmpington went on a 70 run and cut down that lead Panthers have now gotten it back out to an 11point margin largely due to the play of Cummings off the bench Surprised to see Bingington staying in this zone but looks like out of this timeout theyre flying around a little bit more but Dunning Dunning shoots Its like its never a bad shot the way he elevates over the defenders over the contest He really has had one of the most impressive inseason transformations that Ive seen This is a guy that in the game at West Virginia Nick he only played two minutes He was a nonfactor for Pit through the first four games and has turned into the best scorer on the team as of late Yeah he is experienced Hes played college basketball for five years but again you see the ball movement here putting stress and strain on the defense finding the gaps changing sides of the floor for your shooter He is absolutely playing with confidence Has it again in the corner Can he hit another Absolutely Barry Dunning Jr from downtown Hes got 14 It looks like its a shooting drill out there for Pit Everybody contributing from the threepoint line How about eight first half threepointers for the Pit Panthers 45 points but good drive and kick there Another unselfish play from Cummings showing that he can be in that point guard role as well Shooting practice out there for Dunning Panthers consistently finding ways to get into the teeth of the defense and kick it out to a shooter Four different guys have connected from beyond the ark If Bingington wants to get back in this game Lilys going to need continue to get touches but theyre shooting it well from outside as well Theyre going to have to attempt more shots And Pits doing a great job of putting pressure on them So every shots contested Panthers currently on a 141 run in just three minutes and gets talked about a lot Nick Some of the most important moments of the game are the last five minutes of the first half and the first five minutes of the second half Pit has no doubt won the closing moments of this first half so far Cummings buries another three Kind of gave the Jordan shrug there When its your day its your day 15 points Hes halfway there to 30 Mr 30 points Just about a year ago he had that 30point game against Eastern Kentucky Really served as a coming out party for him And how about just about a year later 15 first half points for Brandon Cummings and three made threepointers Im going look for a heat check here but the plane show Miner will take it for him cheering and applause I think that was maybe a team heat check right there Yeah that was a team heat check laughter Miner wanted to get in on threepoint party but great shot Thats one of those shoulder shrugs I think he thought he was going to miss it Thats how you know its your day When its your day when misses or makes And Situs intercepts the pass takes it himself for two And for a Pit team on a threegame losing streak Nick this is one of the best stretches of basketball theyve played in recent times Caleppa takes it himself A little English on the finger roll Pitch is really surging right now Theyre Its all starting from the defensive end Theyre getting stops theyre getting deflections and theyre pushing the ball Bingington looks a little worn down Nine first half turnovers commanded by the Bearcats and the Panthers have taken advantage Thats a recipe for success when your defense predicates your offense And this is an example of what coach is saying playing the right way When youre getting deflections when youre getting steals when youre getting stops thats what win these games Jeremiah Quigley normally a guy for Bingmpington that cheering does a great job running point for them He has at least six assists in three of his last four games but tonight having some trouble He does have four turnovers of the nine by the Bearcats in this game Cummings surveying uses the screen from Cappa Kicks to Indraitis baseline and a dish to Miner Kicks out Dunning Jr drills a three timeout taken by Jeff Cable What a what a play from Miner He had three different options 18th I think theyre in good shape to eclipse that mark tonight Yeah Usually when you see 60 shooting its Did they take three threes Did they take five threes No theyve taken a lot of threes Theyve made 10 of them A number of different guys contributing to those 10 threes for the Panthers But Barry Dunning Jr leads the way with four Brandon Cummings has three Youve got two guys in Dunning Jr and Cummings with at least 15 points in this first half And Cummings is going to add to his total cuz he just drew a foul on his way to the basket I hope hes okay Hes kind of grimacing in pain I know he had ankle problems earlier in the season Lets hope he can walk it off And he is trying to walk it off but Oh stepped on a foot there Yep Good things he has those big ankle braces on Might have saved him from a Theres brother looking on his brother Nelly Big time guard during some of the best years of cable era in our colleague Thats right Three seconds left in the first half Cummys going to take these free throws and then obviously from Jeff Cable dont want to risk anything with him in the second half I mean this is a guy who not only brings a lot on the court but beyond that hes again one of two major contributors that returns from last year him and Cameron Corin So you need him as a part of this pit team 17 first half points He will be replaced by Omari Witherspoon to end the half And we hope that Brandon Cummings did not suffer any severe injuries on that last play And we are going to get a foul on the threepoint attempt to end the first half to the dismay of some of the Panther fans in attendance Jason you talked earlier about freshman mistakes Cippa maybe turned his head The C Apoin wasnt a freshman mistake that foul going into the half on a threepoint shot Thats a freshman mistake And I think they are probably checking how much time if any was on the clock at the time of the shot And it appears there might have been two or three ten of a second when the foul was committed by Mari Moore Mari Moore hes a great defender Loved the energy loved the effort but you cant foul in that scenario Thats going to get you a firm talking to Thanks to Chase Shaw for coming over explaining things to us Point four on the game clock when the foul was committed by Moore Jeremiah Quigley will take three free throws cheering to end the half for Bingmpington Nick hard to believe that this was a fivepoint game with 518 on the clock in this first half Yeah Pit really just turned it on They did with their threepoint shooting and its hard to beat If theyre clicking on all cylinders I dont think theres a team that can compete with that Panthers scored 24 points since that 518 mark in this first half Just about everything you could ask for from an offensive standpoint for Pit And they will take a 23 point I mentioned the Bearcats leading scoreer is Demetrius Lily with 164 points per game on the year but only six points in the paint tonight for Bingmpington Lily himself has eight for the game And a foul to start the second half is going to go against the Panthers And Bingington takes over after the quick foul The games not over Bingington wants to get back in this game Have to first take care of the ball Miner feeds inside to Corin and a nice baby hook on the turnaround Gets it to go Corins got eight Yeah they got to take care of the ball and they cant allow their turnovers turn into points on the other end Nothing doing on the drive there from Peterson Yeah Pits done a great job shooting from outside but it all was predicated on early the first five minutes of the game pounded it inside the corn A lot of the success on the perimeter did not happen till later in the first half for the Panthers but very efficient and versatile in the way they attacked offensively in that first half Lily trying to back down Corinpa comes to help and injure Situs pokes away the pass Thats just a great hustle play a great deflection Court getting early position And thats what to do Feed the beast You heard him screaming right when the second half started He was screaming demanding the ball feeling theres a mismatch He wants in on the party too Well and Im sure the officials are pleased that Lily and Corin have held back on the physicality a little bit Remember about 9 seconds into the game a foul was called and Isaac Barnett seemed to signal Guys Im not dealing with that tonight Lets cut it out right now If you notice in the beginning of the games Corin he does a good job luring his matchup into getting in those little chip battles kind of getting their head a little bit You love to see that out of the big man A little bit of toughness Indraitis at the line 63 from the strike on the season He makes the first Should mention by the way we saw Brandon Cummings suffer a bit of an ankle injury at the end of the first half He is on the bench nursing that ankle after those 17 first half points from the pit sophomore Interested to see if Cable will put him in or if hell save him for a big weekend game against Penn State They have on Sunday Donning intercepts the pass tips it to Indraitis Transition ball for the Panthers Laid off to Miner Back to Indraitis and the three wont go Ca the stick back and a timeout taken by Lavel Sanders Another one of those timeouts where hey you get him in the huddle and you say This is our last chance Hopefully Bingham can get together Theres Jeff Cable His Panthers have a 28point lead and hes also got an excellent recruiting class coming in next year Rated top 10 in the country at the moment And hes got three freshman in the top 100 Nick that hes very excited about and capable He can recruit with the best of them But one thing about the NIL era kind of makes recruiting different than what it used to be And to have a top 10 recruiting class and this NI are just a testament to how good of a recruiter he is and the future of this pit program Highlighted by Chase Foster out of Baltimore Maryland at IMG Academy Hes a guy who is expected to be a contributor right away as a freshman for the Panthers a lot of excitement around the program after he signed with Pit top 40 in ESPNs recruiting rankings And Jamal Jones Anthony Feli not far behind him for the Panthers with a roster already starting to form for next season as Roman C Eleppa goes baseline and finishes And thats why there is so much excitement about that class is if you can pair those three guys with CPA in his sophomore year Thats a group that could really do some damage Nick Yeah great drive there by Cepa Another freshman sensation Many say hes one of the best recruits to come out of Australia in recent memory If they can keep developing him pair him with these freshman coming in next year that can be a great team for years to come Of course you got CPA and Witherspoon two freshman contributing for PIT this year Brandon Cummings only a sophomore Andrew Situs just a sophomore So a good combination on this PIT team of veteran talent paired with some young guys with a lot of potential You know especially nowadays in the NIL era theres theres two prongs of recruiting Theres recruiting the players and then theres keeping them So if these coaching staff can keep this team together they definitely show flashes For joining on the threepoint party Cam Corin getting in on the action Seemingly everybody having success from the perimeter tonight for Pit They are now 11 for 18 from threepoint range Corins one of those guys and he works on those shots you know see him in the back gym him and his trainers him and his dad theyre back there working almost every day on not just his big man work but perimeter skills as well So thats thats that was that came out of hard work And Corin not necessarily a threepoint threat Nick but he has improved in that area this year He was just a 25 threepoint shooter a season ago know hes got that up to 33 this year and that helps Even if its just a little bit hes not going to be up around 40 But if you force teams to kind of pay attention to you being open on the perimeter that makes a difference You know the the inside game sets up the outside game You have the outside game it sets up your inside game and Bingington Dunning Jr to lead all Panther scorers and a sigh of relief from all Panther fans watching the game to know that Cummings is all right Yeah definitely if youre carrying momentum from a game like this was looking like may be a big blowout and you really want your key players who contribute to that to carry with you in the next couple games So injury there would have been devastating and he gets the block out of the timeout as well Nice defensive play there from Cummings Nick Panthers up 33 as we get one more look at the denial from Cummings there Oh the ankle looked good there Im surprised unless I missed it Nick to this point you have not mentioned the phrase that Jeff Cable used at the end of shoot around today We both liked it as soon as we heard it Tell me what he said Well he huddled everybody up at the end of shoot round and at the end he said Everybody lets get left Lets get left And I was trying to think what it meant Lets get into the left side of the win column Lets add one to the left side of the wind column It looks like theyre going to do that today 33point lead Panthers very much in control of this game You hear the phrase get back in the win column a lot but you dont always hear lets get back on the left tonight And thats what his Panthers are on their way to doing Im taking that one I like that Yeah You going to use that with your team Ill definitely use it with my team The neighborhood academy Bulldogs Been a bit of an up and down year of course for the Panthers They have not gotten a win since that buzzer beater from DeMarco Miner against Ohio State Looked like it could prove to be a turning point Of course the game before that they had lost to Quinnipiac here at home But you get the buzzer beater from Miner and Panthers follow that up with three consecutive losses to Texas AM Hofra and Villanova But Nick this is a game where you always hear the phrase sometimes you just have to see the ball go in Well the Panthers have seen the ball go in a lot tonight and sometimes you just have to get that win to feel right again get some of your confidence back before this weekends game against Penn State Yeah its such a crucial part of the season as Dunning buries another three What a crucial part of the season You know youre going into the break youre about to go into conference play Its not going to get any easier to get a win like this Thats how you respond to losing three straight games Thats how you draw it up Any coach would love that Larry Downing Jr with his fifth three of the night He has 20 points and the Panthers are 12 for 20 from beyond the arc What a performance by this Pit team tonight Yeah Bingington may be out of the game in terms of trying to get a win but they can still have some moral victories by getting better and getting making a run and getting this thing close Keep playing hard keep figuring out some things for to prepare them for conference play in America East which is a lot of parody in that conference Well Lavella Sanders talked to us about how because of all the injuries and the inability to play five on five in practice for much of the season theyve actually had to practice certain sets and defensive looks in games And you know at this point in the game where looks to be out of reach can use these valuable minutes here to at least get your guys some run against a ACC opponent and prepare for conference play right around the corner Yeah it was interesting talking to him We asked him you know how did you approach that when you only had eight nine active guys playing You know a lot of two on two a lot of three on three You know nothing compares to having that five on five but still able to create that level of competitiveness Cummings off the screen from Caleppa Willther spoon ball fake and kick Donning Jrs is feeling it and he draws a foul on the threepoint attempt I see Thats one way to get him to miss a threepoint shot Still may get three points though See there be thats just a its a great close out but step in the landing zone Yeah Cant step in his landing zone Barry Dunning Jr here What a story hes had Came out of college or high school rather as one of the top 100 recruits in his class back in 2022 Started at Arkansas playing for Eric Muscleman back in the 22 23 season Appeared in 16 games there and then transferred to UAB but really started to break out when he went to South Alabama First team all sunb belt there 151 points per game and comes to pit in his senior season Nick just always good to see a guy who out of high school is a highly coveted recruit maybe doesnt get the breaks and doesnt have the success he thought he might in his first year at the high major level but in this era you can go back to a mid major find yourself get your rhythm back and now hes performing really well in a power conference here with Pit this season Well Dunny is a big time elite player Hes always Hes been a top 100 player Hes been an allconerence player Hes been averaged 15 points a game in division one A great player Its definitely an adjustment The speed of the game the size when you go up to high major but looks like hes getting adjusted especially with games like tonight Kind of was a recent addition to the starting lineup but hes earned it and hes really getting comfortable in a leadership role that this team needs I think every one of those shootarounds early in the season Nick that we went to he wasnt producing in games but you could just tell you and I talked to each other often and said you can tell theres more there with him Yeah Hes really the only player on the roster thats done it at a high level that can you can see the stats You can see the accolades the awards Hes the only one whos done it on this team Just took him a while to click Wilson up ahead to Beverly Gets the and one Hell go to the line Beverly there I know he wanted to take off and dunk something Good job catching his bobble Finishing the crafty reverse Stealing the bucket Oh he wanted to take off there Lost it a little bit but another freshman mistake there Youre going to foul him Dont let him make the basket So Omari Willitherspoon now with three fouls in just four minutes on the floor Singer Situs setting up the offense this trip down for the Panthers Cummings hesitates dishes to Corin and good recovery by Quigley to poke it away Have you seen any of Brandon Cummings high school teammate Malik Thomas over at Arkansas this year Ive seen him Hes the impact player He sure is Huh John Caliperry with a good squad once again for the Razerbacks Couple of very impressive freshman there Thats what Caliperry does best to recruit freshmen know that cheering high school team with Brandon Cummings and Malik Thomas is not one I would have liked to play against I can tell you that Yeah I had the opportunity to see them play together was dominant to say the least especially when they would play against the Western Pennsylvania competition They were unbelievable You could tell it was a different level when they were on the court Great defense by Cummings there against Peterson Cummings squares up lined up a three couldnt hit Rebound goes to Lily Cummings cooling off just a little bit Good defensive play there by Kieran Mullen Panthers still a lot of energy coming from the bench This may be a 34point game but Jeff Cable always coensively and leaving Bingington looking music for a solution here tonight 26 points of turnovers for the Panthers And Nick you said it This is exactly what you want to see if youre Jeff Cable heading into a game against Penn State over the weekend and then getting straight into conference play Yeah And that points off turnover stat is just a telltale sign of how well your team is playing defensively how well theyre converting being selfish I liked the patience from DeMarco Miner on that play He almost waited for Cam Corin to make the cut before throwing the lob You saw it coming Kind of looked like Chris Paul getting down in there patient in the paint throwing it up to his giant teammate The more you can get into the paint as a guard the more good things are going to happen Kind of looked him off He saw it and over lively I guess whos winning that whos winning that big man battle right now Panthers now have four players in double figures Corin with 13 And yes he is winning the battle of the bigs Demetrius Lily with eight points does have nine rebounds as Indraitis takes the two off the fast break Great use of the body there from Incitus on the fast break got a position where he cut the defender off so he couldnt get there and contest the shot Andrew Situs now up to 13 four of seven from the floor Nick talking to Jeff Cample today he is very open and honest about the fact that hes had teams struggle in nonconference play before And most notably you point back to that 2223 season Panthers took three nonconference losses early in the year West Virginia VCU and Michigan But of course that ended up being the team that made the NCAA tournament and winning a couple games when they got there So despite the fact that theyve struggled in this nonconference schedule theyve had some really tough games theres still time to turn this thing around They are 0 and0 in ACC play which is an important thing to remember Havent played a conference game yet And its only December So hes hoping that a game like tonight can kickstart them through the rest of the year Yeah Not only is the season not over it hasnt even really started yet They have a tough conference schedule to start the season and on December 30th Its not even close to over Theyre showing some flashes of greatness Games like tonight really show that they can play with the best of them They can shoot score defend with the best of them They just got to click at the right time cheering He mentioned the toughness of the nonconference schedule with how things have panned out and said he did not expect to have to attack that schedule without Deshawn Jackson without Papaonte for a lot of it Brandon Cummings has missed a few games and when you form a schedule like that youre expecting to have a 100 healthy roster and been difficult for the Panthers to overcome some of the injuries theyve faced when playing so many high major opponents But he talked again about the 2324 season when they were left out of the tournament one of the first four teams out because the strength of schedule number was so low And you can tell Nick that he never wants that to happen again Yeah that was devastating two seasons ago I mean even the most unbiased experts were saying Pit might have gotten jabed not getting into the tournament but you know you make your schedule in the summer you think youre going to have one team and then injuries and other circumstances happen and its unfortunate theyve had to deal with it But you know some point in the season every team goes through something and this can just be their challenge this nonconference schedule could just be their one story and made them a stronger team going into the conference schedule And their nonconference schedule isnt over Playing a school rival on Sunday Penn State at a neutral site Thats going to be an interesting game Blackburn fires a three connects on that And Jake Blackburn one of the bright spots for Bingmpington on a night when there havent been many He is four for four from the field all threepointers Hes got 12 points to lead all scorers for the Bearcats He can really shoot the ball as a quick trigger quick release Its hard to block You just give him the ball the rest of the game Maybe they can get back in it And when you talk about positives to take away for both teams here in a blowout game eight minutes to go thats something Lavel Sanders is definitely going to look at the fact that Jake Blackburn has missed 10 games due to injury but in his second game back hes got 12 points on four threes Only bright spots for Bingington tonight but as a freshman to be this poised and hit these big shots I think theres a bright future ahead for Coach Sanders and Blackburn This is a chance for Pit to get their young guys going build up their confidence See a nice reverse layup Moore with a great dying there More is a great player energy guy true point guard top level defender Nice set there by Bingington to get Demetrius Lily on the roll talked a lot about what the Panthers have next Nick but for Bingington they are sticking around in Western PA They take on Mercyhurst Saturday at 200 They mentioned that they are sticking around in Pittsburgh tomorrow before making the trip to Mercyhurst And not long until they will start conference play as well Well first America East game for them will be NGIT on January 3rd And then they go to Vermont and the Catamounts always a tough out in the America East American America East really balanced league and kind of that magic number in league play in America East is usually if you get to nine wins If you get to nine wins you usually end up in the top three top four of that conference Sanders done a great job putting him in contention each year Hes been there Anything can happen Last year they were the five seed in the America East tournament Lost in the quarterfinal against Albany Mel Sanders hoping he can get his team on a little bit of a run in the conference tournament this year Again this is a Bingington program that has not been to the NCAA tournament since 2009 Witherspoon Great push take there And hes one of those guys He was in the starting lineup early in the season Everybodys really excited about him Coaching staffs excited about him Drew comparisons to Bub Carrington just how balanced he is Big guard Yeah one of those guys Its maybe not coming together as quickly as it did for Bub Carrington but you see the similarities and certainly has some potential that could pop over time Definitely has potential Just as a freshman you got to get used to speed of this game And if youre going to be a guard with the ball in your hands you got to make the right decision at the right time And thats something he can work on And he does it in spurts Hes done it a lot shown capability of it But that comes with shot selection and creating for others needs to show he can do that if he wants to create himself a leadership role in this pit team I mean hes a guard for Maryland You could probably stop there and know that its going to turn out okay for Witherspoon Definitely And hes a guy um NBA scouts were actually looking at coming into this season They think he has a bright future injured Situs connects on the three Hes up to 16 points and hes having a night and you know we talk about coming sometimes people are more comfortable coming off the bench Sometimes people are more comfortable starting and it looks like incitis is comfortable in that starting role Hes been a big key contributor to the spark this pit team needed easing on up Hand down Man down Right in rhythm Mentioned for Indraitis This is his second start of the season The other one came against Eastern Michigan Hes now got a careerhigh 16 points And Nick talk about potential with this guy Hes at Iowa State He was a top 100 recruit And you have to think in many ways the only reason why he didnt get much time last year is because Iowa State was one of the best teams in the country They had a lot of depth at the guard position and because of that inditis didnt see much of the floor and so he comes to pit a team thats looking for help in the back court and gets the start tonight Hes clearly been a bigger factor on this pit team than he was a season ago in a crowded back court at Iowa State Yeah just a big guard Hes kind of People dont appreciate how big he actually is as a guard Hes very athletic and hes a little bit of a utility knife He does everything defensively He can fly around He can rebound He can shoot it He can pass absolutely brings a lot of energy when hes on the floor And Mari Moore with some productive minutes here as well Tips it cheering up to Indra Situs who bounces it to Mullen Back to Indra Situs And the Panthers couldnt quite control it there Wise decision by the sophomore to bring it back out and reset And thats one theyre going to look on film And if Im in Situs Im going to be mad at M Im like I tried to make you look good there I tried to give you a lifetime highlight with the bounce Great defense by Moore there You can see how aggressive he is on defense Thats going to come in handy But right there with a bounce Come on M He was too hungry He was too hungry for the bucket laughter Trying to get you a dunk man Come on Almost looked like something you would see in the slam dunk contest huh You bring out the teammate for help Enderite is trying to give him the bounce but didnt quite work out The next time theyre in that situation Mullen will be ready Yeah Well valuable minutes here Yeah hes telling them right now like Im bouncing that for you Im bouncing that up laughter Come on I want you handling the ball out there Its the most points or most minutes I should say that Kieran Mullen has gotten this year again a guy that the Panthers have needed to step up due to the absence of Papa Keante with the knee injury And so Mullen coming into tonight had only appeared in four games 43 minutes per game in those four And tonight hes got 12 minutes and somehow Nick in the 12 minutes for Mullen he still has not attempted a field goal Hes done a lot of things really well but has not taken a shot yet for Pit You know when youre big you dont you dont have to shoot Defend rebound You can make your impact Thats right Everybody wants to score but screaming youre the best rebounder Sometimes that can put you in four minutes Jeff Cable Panthers not pleased with the foul call against McCari Moore Thats going to be his second screaming Pit has four freshman in right now Good to see playing hard and all minutes are good minutes Yeah you know up almost 40 four minutes left but still good experience Still a chance to learn and catch a rhythm build confidence Remember when Jamie Dixon put you in in the first half of that game Oh yeah You remember that one Who was that against Definitely That was against BMI and I remember I had a turnover and a bad jump shot He took me right out I came right back out I came right back out That was supposed to be my my test to see if I can actually get in the lineup We were dealing with some injuries at the guard position I failed the test Failed the test Was it one of those where you pointed to yourself and youre like Me Are you sure laughter Oh monster dunk there from Wilson But yeah no I knew coming into the game I knew I had the opportunity I cuz three games before that they were telling me I was going to get in in the first half and I was waiting and I didnt get it When I finally got called I was excited but a little too excited Chaos happening near the Panther bench Bearcats down big but still making some highlight plays on the alleyoop from Quigley and Bryson Wilson getting up for the Bearcats But the Panthers are up big here at the feet get right game and the Panthers seem to have gotten right before their next game against Penn State Definitely a get right game and just one of those games that you do it the right way You got to do it the right way They did it with their defense They did it by involving everybody playing unselfishly taking good shots Thats what you like to see Thats really what you want to see Its not just winning by you know 30 40 points Its are we winning the right way Are we doing creating the habits now that are going to set us up for conference play And you see all the smiles and laughs on the bench A win like this can really go a long way It may just be the 3 and8 Bingmpington Bearcats but it can do a lot for this teams confidence as you get into some of the really important games of the season Panthers going to be happy to get back on the left like Jeff Cable told him at shootound earlier today Its definitely getting left in a big way Foul called again against Mari Moore Thats going to be the third on Moore You cant say hes not playing aggressive screaming As a freshman when youre learning to defend at this level with Got to learn how to beat him to the spot Do it without your hands I always felt like refs that kind of pick on freshman They kind of tighter with the whistle on him More just do a better job Just beat him to the spot Youre very quick Beat him with your feet Beat him with your positioning You dont have to use your hands So itll be the second time in the last three years that the Panthers win big at home against Bingmpington The last meeting between these two teams was here at the Pete back in 2023 And Nick a guy named Blake Henson had 26 points in that win for the Panthers Wonder how many threes he I bet you a lot of it were threepointers I think youre probably right I dont need to pull up the box score to know that At halftime you were talking about some of the best threepoint shooters in the ACC during the rankings Yeah I think if you did a fiveyear recent time one Blake Hans had to be on that top three Have to be in it No doubt Never shot a shot he didnt like Hes making some noise in the G League too Ill tell you what they can shoot that basketball And one thing as a player especially now as a coach theres one thing I tell players if you can shoot the basketball you always have a spot on the team And our wonderful crew our associate producer Kelsey Bon telling me that Blake Henson made four threes in that game against Bingmpington two years ago Thanks Kelsey We work with the best in the business Nick Oh we have the best in the business business for sure Club Carrington 18 points in that game That was a great move cheering Great under control move up and under And a lot of the young fans in attendance happy to see the Panthers get into triple digits tonight Do they do they get anything on triple digit night They should Oh no A great jump stop playoff two power up You know he doesnt necessarily play above the rim but great footwork there Panthers with six different guys in double figures Dunning Jr matches his season high with 23 Mentioned Intercitis with a new career high with the 16 Allaround great performance from the Panthers So theyll have the game at noon on Sunday against Penn State and then nine days before they open up the ACC slate at Miami That one will be 700 on December 30th Panthers back at the Pete next on January 3rd to take on Brad Brownells Clemson team And then Syracuse who I know youve seen a lot of this year Nick Romelo Anthony Sun plays on that team Great freshman showing a lot of promise getting a lot of minutes playing a lot of big time minutes making some big time plays Another team that lost to Hofra have since bounced back That just shows how good that Hofster team is I was telling someone earlier today Nick I think at least one of Quinnipic or Hofra will make the NCAA tournament I would not be surprised if both of them make it Certainly Ill have them my bracket More free throws to come here for Amari Witherspoon and the Panthers Approach getting in the game and hes had some experience Hes hes had to practice Yeah we know heve had hes had a lot of practice experience So hopefully he can get in the game and make a lifetime memory And a productive second half for Witherspoon All 11 of his points have come in the second period A game like this could be just what he needed Chase Shaw coming over clarifying it was a one and one there So love the communication from great ref And look at this We go back to 2023 This is Pit Binghamington Barry Dunning Jr maybe doing his best Blake Henson impression tonight Nick Yeah you want to talk shooters Hes a big time shooter You can tell that his shooting was on the scouting report getting to the basket Let Hell let you know about it too after he hits him Thats what I loved about him Well Dunning Jr he may have some work to do before he gets to the resume that Blake Hinson built for himself at pit But I can tell you what they got similar confidence snorts both those guys Some confidence just big wings where every time they touch it its its a good shot Its a good look It It always looks like its going in So it will go down as a 40point win for the Pit Panthers in what maybe their best performance of the season Six different guys
