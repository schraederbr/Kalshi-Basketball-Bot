teams with a tremendous amount of talent This should be a close competitive matchup tonight and weve got a final four quality officiating crew to oversee it Roger Ron Groover and Tim Claggery as we are underway on a Monday night in Raleigh NC State with a number next to their name for the first time in a couple of seasons They finished that final four season in 2024 with a ranking but havent been ranked in the regular season in a few years McNeil from the corner that rims in and out no good Scramble for the ball and we are expecting a lot of physicality Two teams that want to up that tempo not shy to get physical Randle Well you saw that possession there The key to this game is going to be threepoint shots Whos making them Whos not But more importantly who controls the glass right now gets an extra possession Cuadir Copeland the inbounder He followed Wade from Mcnes Hes fit right in right here in Raleigh Going down low Van Allen Luben cant open the scoring Take a look at the VCU starting lineup Jaden Tracy the leading scorer for the Rams Transfer from Oregon shooting over 40 from three Again a really good shot maker Like to go to him early in the game and lets see if they can get him going Try to pull off the upset here This is the freshman Nick Lewis And now Tracy lines up a three Cant connect Offensive rebound Flying in was Barry Evans And hell get two at the line as he was fouled on the putback attempt As we talked about the key to this game and well be watching all night long is the glass NC State got an extra possession at first time down Rams do as well They have a chance to put points on the board with their offensive rebound Now we just mentioned how Copeland followed his head coach Will NCC Well Barry Evans the foul shooter he followed Phil Martelli Jr from Bryant where they won the America East Conference a year ago cheering Like a lot of college basketball both of these teams no returning starters from last years team Thats a common theme I think through college basketball right now Its more common than rare You take a look at the Wolfpack starting five as Williams triggers a three and buries it Shoots 64 Just walks into his first ones and knocks it down Well he has shown why he was the ACC preseason player of the year coming in from a Texas Tech team that made the Elite 8 a year ago Barry Evans misfires And both of these teams not shy They are going to let it fly They want the tempo to be as fast as possible The first to 80 feels like the winner tonight as Williams backto back buckets for him Hes a nightmare matchup You put a small defender on him hell have that Barkley style mid mid post game Back you down shoot over you like he did there You put a bigger guy on you hell shoot it from 30 And right now hes up 50 Djokovic trying to post up inside And hes the 611 Serbian Lazar Jookovic And hes got some size advantage against this Wolfpack front court tonight music Jay hes a matchup nightmare I I dont think a lot of people in college basketball dont know about him yet And hes finally healthy but his skill set is a is a nightmare with smaller guards NC State likes to switch Hell take advantage of it inside like that And hes capable of stretching the defense and shooting threes cheering Now Will Wade knows how dangerous this VCU team is He obviously coached for the Rams a decade ago from 2015 to 2017 He told us today I never should have left This is a program that really doesnt matter who the head coaches they just keep winning They are one of five programs with a winning season in the last 25 years consecutively It is one of those mid major jobs though thats that most of us consider a high major You know its hard for these guys to get games because theyre always good in Richmond Virginia Recruiting bad get talent Ben Allen Luben showing off the range coming When an NC State scores you know the pressures coming cheering Both teams want to score a field goal so they can set their full court pressure Dovic into traffic loses the handle Evans wins the jump ball kicks it out A three on the way Tracy got it Jadrien Tracy answers Evans is putting his imprint all over the game Two offensive rebounds here early Williams got IT AGAIN NOTHING BUT THE BOTTOM OF THE NET And Ron Groover has issued a technical foul after the Williams three Harry Williams knocks down to three and he lets you know about it Williams with eight of the packs 11 early He steps in one Youve got to get to him and close out early Talks trash to a little trash and Ron Gub is trying to get this game under control here early Both these teams are physical They want to play a tough physical game and just trying to lay the foundation of how they want this game to be to be played tonight Just leave it on the court Bizarrely reminiscent of the last game NC State played four minutes into it where Trey Hollerman was ejected against UNCC Greensboro Look Will Wades got these guys playing with a swagger to start the season and the officiating takes issue with it But VCU with Tracy knocks two down at the foul line One possession game Rams ball Will Waynes probably the one coach in college basketball thats not upset when any of his players get a technical foul He just wants him to continue to respond cheering Nick Lewis fights through the double team Kick to the corner Jennings at rims out Offensive rebound Count it Plus the foul Lazar Jookovic a chance to tie it at the free throw line And this is a big key We talked about rebounds being a key because theres so much rotation and help Big guy like Lazar gets in there Jookovic gets in there and his guards trying to box him out Gets the rebound a chance to go to the line for an and one And this is the concern if youre an NC State fan with all your rotation and youre running and jumping cheering VCU can really hurt them on the offensive glass and theyve done so here early We told you two teams that want to put up a lot of points keep the tempo fast 22 points 11 a piece through the first three minutes of this game They get to set their pressure and extend their pressure for a court NC State averaging more than 100 points a game through three their starters the five on the floor right now those five alone are averaging 75 points per game So this is a group that has been confident offensively to start the season and I asked you and shoot around well if youre VCU how do you slow the Wolfpack down And you said I dont think they want to They want to go just as fast They wont Coach Martelli has been one of the more efficient offensive teams in the country in their pace of play Top five in the last two years So theyre not going to slow down This game could very well have both teams in the 80s and 90s NC State goes to the bench Matt Ael the phenomenal freshman whos come in for Quadir Copeland cheering I just told you the 75 points per game the starters provide While Ael has been terrific off the bench offensive rebounding has been a strength for VCU early with Jookovic Hes tied up Possession arrow goes to the pack And when Ven Luben in that center NC State switches a lot If youre Djokovic and these frontline guys for VCU you got to crash the glass Djokovic done a really good job here early He and Barry get Barry Evans getting their hands on basketballs here Van Allen Luben usually not the guy to take the ball up the court and he turns it over Tracy into the lane Rejected at the rim Van Allen Luben atones for the turnover with a stuff Up ahead Williams right to the rim for two Hes got 10 of NC States 13 You got to get back a center defense cheering Lewis step back three Cant connect ANOTHER OFFENSIVE REBOUND THE RAMS CASH IN ONEHANDED SLAM Barry Evans Will Wade thought it was a goend Evans with the onehanded hammer NC State doing a really good job of making shots but the Rams really hurting them on the offensive glass Six second chance points for VCU early in this game The fireworks have started Weve got a technical foul Two teams that want to push the pace and theyre doing just that Player of the year Hes got 10 of States 13 early He has not missed a shot Two for two from behind the threepoint line And youve got to find him and somehow you got to be able to touch him on the catch Make him put the ball in the deck Hollan for three Hits it Trey Hollan fires the pack back in front cheering NC State already with their fourth threepointer here a team Theyre shooting 44 behind a three And Will Wayne told us he thought theyd come back to earth at some point but they hadnt so far this half He said Look were going to regress to the mean Hes laughter a numbers guy but so far so good Will Pack have made six of their last seven shots Holland looking for another Missed it this time Offensive rebound The extra pass finds the freshman Able cashes in cheering Backto back threes NC State up six Suffocating pressure Transition three Off the mark again That numbers changing but the way theyre shooting it right now it may go up Good pursuit of the basketball but ahead of steam that Nick Lewis could not control Itll stay NC State ball Its a great job there on the offensive glass and just catch you on rotation and just come at you in volumes waves and right now youve got to VCU you cant panic You got to settle down here They look a little sped up They want to play faster but NC States playing fast but theyre getting shots within the rhythm of their offense I think VCU is kind of forcing shots and theyve just been able to hurt NC State on the offensive glass Inside to Williams He can beat you anywhere on the floor Matchup nightmare takes your big guys faces them up puts them on a perimeter When you switch a guard on him he takes you inside music We saw his second basket where he just shot right over the smaller guard and you saw there baseline out of bounds play for him to post up on the smaller guard I dont think Darien Williams could be making a better first impression here in Raleigh How good has he been since trading the Texas Tech uniform for an NC State one He was the prize of the NIL the portal And thats what I think jumpst started everything here at NC State at Will Wade when he signed I mean look at his numbers there all the way through the NCAA tournament averaging over 21 a game and hes doing so this year He has carried that postseason confidence the Elite 8 run with him to Raleigh He has every right to believe hes a first team allAmerican an ACC candidate worthy and hes gotten them off to a great start against a very talented tough VCU Ram squad One minute ago this game was tied at 13 Since then the Pack on a seven nothing run VCU trying to weather the storm Yeah lets see what their offense looks like now when hes not out there VCU cant turn it over and the Rams go a little bit of zone here trying to slow the game down I think theyre doing it so they can match up and get a body on a body Evans connects on a triple Much needed make for VCU They get to control you know after field goal as well They like to pressure the basketball Theyll switch up fullourt man Scoop to THE HOOP RIGHT DOWN the lane Cadir Copelan His game has evolved so much from a just a defensive guy when he was at Syracuse a few years back He goes to MCN with Will He comes back now Hes their quintessential point guard their glue guy cheering Bell spinning into a double team Finds Evans Hes in trouble of the corner Passes out of it Shot clock down to five Jookovic has to hurry and thats a travel Great defense by NC State Youre the Rams there after that baseline drive and help You got to reverse the basketball You cant leave it on one side of the floor You got to get to the second or third side against NC State They want to guard their yard but theyre really coming over to help And the scorers table has VCU at 15 Were pretty sure it was a three Theyll take a look at the break to confirm So the officials will come back and take a take a look at that Thats a three Thats definitely a three This is giving me shades of Randolph Childress said Cameron indoor your junior season No Duke fans dont want to hear about that laughter We Copeland again Everything but the finish BCUs got a five on four Copeland trailing Evans right to the rim Missed it Barrys doing a great job of driving but you got to drive the pass and able screaming that just a freshman Hes buried two triples The highest ranked freshman since Dennis Smith Jr for NC State And the Pack keep rolling What a start to this game What a start to this season music NC State on a 122 run as its shown on the scorers table Again not to keep harping on it but should be 256 The officials will take a look at the under2 media timeout This was just a coach called timeout music The difference in the game right now was NC States driving and theyre spreading the ball out to their threepoint shooters Right now VCU is driving and trying to finish in traffic And when theyre unable to get the basket NC States catching them in cross matchups and taking advantage of it Ahmad Noel the transfer from Yukon into the game Number four in black has it here cheering Michael Bell pull up P doesnt fall Battle for the board Stays VCU basketball underneath their own hoop Barry in that last play made the right pass trying to pass it back available He was cutting Got to stay disciplined in their spacing for VCU right now Youre not making shots The tendency is to get closer to the rim Want to get an open shot Safe space Leave the paint open BCU just four of 16 from the floor One of eight from three and NC State defense has been suffocate suffocating from the start and just tough to get the ball in right now for VCU Thats how aggressive NC State has been playing defensively and its been excellent on the offensive end as well NC State now back to their manto man They played zone couple of possessions Now theyre back to manto man but theyre going to switch a lot of ball screens and dribble handoff actions So somebody for VCU is going to have to make a play Shot clock down to three VCU has to heave it Front rim Good possession again by NC State defensively Copeland in transition right to the rim for two cheering applause Iron Groover says no basket A foul before Copeland went up with it I think theyre going to get Sier on the seal on the post up there Great move there by Copeland but the foul is there and the push in the back Great game here fast off NC State your former team on a Monday night He knows how good this VCU program has been One of five T1 programs with 25 straight winning seasons A changing defense again here in a 131 Really aggressive Forces a jump ball there And the Pack have made life difficult for a very talented VCU team that was picked music to win the 810 preseason How do the Rams get their offense going They have struggled in this game just four of 17 from the floor The guards are really young but right now theyre spending too much time on the perimeter trying to guess what defense NC State sent in where they in man Now down that possession they was in 1 131 Now they go sideline out of bounds Now theyre in man Theyve got to get the ball in the paint But when they drive it they got to look to pass it to an open threepoint shooter like that Deep three from Tracy Nothing but the bottom of the net And hes the guy you want to find Dribble drive and pass Traces we talked about shooting over 40 behind a threepoint line Youve got to find him And Tracys got two threes They did upgrade that like we thought they would during the under 12 media timeout Two possession game Sixpoint lead for State Ael on the drive Hes fouled applause VCU really focuses on just guarding the ball So they want they dont want to help if they dont have to help But right now theyre music having a difficult time controlling the dribble penetration from the Wolfpack It was funny Matt Ael was joined by the veteran Dari Williams at their first press conference after the opening night win And Ael was joking around having so much fun up there And Williams says to him Hey you got to act like youve been here before And he goes Hey that was my first college game Im a freshman I havent been here before Hes been so good off the bench for State Tomorrow night our mens basketball double header right here on ACC Network right down the road Davy at North Carolina And then Monmouth taking on Syracuse Another you music want to talk about highly touted freshman like Matt Ael You got to check out Kayen Anthony son of Carmelo leading the Orange right now Lets not forget about Caleb Wilson Thats true UNCC Tar Hills Hes been as good as any freshman going to say he might be the most impressive freshman in the country so far this season There is a lot of good ones cheering Our ESPN national director of recruiting Paul Biancardi says this is the best freshman class in multiple decades They have lived up to it earlier this season They have and hes exactly right Double dribble because of the pressure from another freshman Musa Sag This NC State defense has been absolutely dialed in from tip off The guards have been really passive on the perimeter here instead of exploiting that matchup with Sier Turn your back The pressure heats you up and creates a turnover And everyones going to talk about the Wolfpack offense Thats whats going to happen when you average 106 points per game to start this season But the defense has been equally impressive Both teams offense their best offense is their defense Right now NC States doing a better job on the defensive end of the floor and is generating offensive and open opportunities particularly behind a threepoint line Shot clock down to five Ael keeps it up Forced that one GCU turns it over again The Rams still struggling to find their offensive rhythm Im surprised more teams dont do that When youre running dribble handoffs guys avoid the screen He has to stop Youre running your typical dribble handoff He has to stop Two fouls on Bell so he takes a seat Trey Hollowman back into the game Williams lost the handle Put pressure on the rim here in transition instead A three from the corner Its good Terren Hill Jr drains it and its a fivepoint game Flatout score there Hes another one of the Rams 40 threepoint shooters 47 to be exact And you got to locate him and take away those corner threes When you get stops and turnovers the Rams like to push as well Outlet pass there to Barry and Hill spotting up in the corner And Will Ways not happy about that because that was the top of the scouting report There was Heel on those corner threes And these teams are very similar in how they approach a basketball game Absolutely The way they want to play defensively they want to get after you extend their pressure both want to guard the basketball The Rams want to do more isolation They want you to guard your yard and not try to help as much where NC State will come helping They have no problems double teaming the basketball They want to put you under tremendous amount of pressure Neil great pass No finish though from Vin Allen Luben cheering Phil Jr misses it this time Thats not a really good shot there Thats a settle Best shots come from behind the threepoint line after theres some type of penetration And this the advantage that State has Fade away Got it Darien Williams continues to deliver because theres no answer for him They could just give him the basketball anywhere on the floor He created mismatch Quick three in transition goes begging BCU starting to force it a little bit McNeel misfires Hes still scoreless on the night for NC State Sophomore the lone holdover from last years team averaging 20 points per game but been very quiet in this first half But hell get his touches and his shots He dont have to worry about that These are just difficult shots that VCUs taken Theyre not good shots And youre going to put you on your heels because youre going to be in defensive transition and unable to set your defense And this game has been played at an electric pace but VCU has forced their last three threes Theyve all been misfires And now NC State turns it over Quad here Copeland not happy about it Hes trying to tell the music big guy you got to disengage I led you to the basket As a guard those are the turnovers you dont like Youre trying to throw it in the post Just leads the big man a little too far Trying to take advantage of the Mitch match 15 of BCUs 22 shots have been from three As they turn it over again the freshman Nick Lewis travels The NC State pressure has turned VC over four times The pack a sevenpoint lead under eight Special And all five of those coaches are now head coaches in the D1 level And its unbelievable the coaching tree coming from this university right now getting the better against his former team Copeland called for an offensive foul He hooked Nick Lewis there Turned it over And one thing the Rams are good at doing is theyre beat beating their former head coaches once they leave 19 and 11 when they take on a former head coach going back to 2008 Thats an amazing stat But not surprising ECU is always one of the best jobs in college basketball And a lot of these guys are moving on to high major jobs that are complete rebuilds when they take over and come back home and schedule the game against the Rams and they just reload Can a pull up pop The floater doesnt fall Great job driving but you got to drive to to pass Hand off finds Williams 15 to work with Pull up three No good VCU in a scoring drought thats nearing three minutes McNeel got a piece of the ball there Thats another opportunity there Again Barrys doing a great job of attacking but again hes got to attack the pass not the score You mentioned the pedigree to come through VCU Ryan ODM now at Virginia in the ACC Mike Rhodess Will Wade Shaka Smart and Anthony Grant And against those five coaches theyre 19 and 11 And you got to go back there I mean Jeff Cable was at Pit now I mean so many guys Ray Offred Jacksonville State He just second chance opportunities for VCU Thats been that where theyve been most effective tonight And finally they cash in underneath The points have been at a premium for VCU but theyve got eight second chance points and eight offensive rebounds NC State is really healthconscious and the big wings of VCU and Jookovic can really crash the offensive glass and hurt that rotation when the shot goes up Olive an immediate answer Knocks it down Picking on Djokovic in the ball screen You know he doesnt want to switch Hes in drop coverage and everyone else is switching So theyre just attacking him in the ball screens These guards in their size are getting to their spots cheering Evans a three No good VCU getting good looks Just cant finish Williams rejected by the rim He went up for it but couldnt slam it home And its VCU ball I think the drive by defense there made him readjust He saw the defender Lewis fly over I think he took his eyes off and let the rim block it Hes got a hand to that And Tyrell Ward was flying in late and it just put Williams off enough I think he may have had a piece of that And cheering VCU shooting just 25 in this first half but theyre hanging around Sevenpoint game Hill lights up a triple Got it Some great find there by Lewis Again feels a lights out shooter You got to find him and put a body on him I mean contesting shots Collan backto back mate Sticks it Hes got to feel you cheering Jookovic a three Cant connect Almost another offensive rebound for the Rams That would have been their ninth Colon feeling it on a heat check Misfires but itll stay NC State basketball here Hill gets lost Holman helps out No one helps the helper NC State pays for it Heels knocks down his second three and then Hollerman here comes in and out Jookovic on music that ball screen and gets to his spot Pull up game is money The Michigan State transfer music He was also in the Elite 8 a year ago for the Spartans joining Williams who was there for Texas Tech and NC State has brought in a ton of guys who have been around winning that has led to some immediate success to start this season Foul called on the layup attempt cheering McNeel not happy about it Great defensive possession there And again you get stops you can run And this is the pace VCU wants to play Theyre not making shots but theyre hanging around cheering Wednesday night womens basketball double header right here on ACC Network It tips off right down the road at Reynolds Coliseum Coastal taking on the Wolfpack And then Morehead State is in Louisville Check out two ranked teams on the womens side Wednesday night on ACC Network Tyrell Ward one of two from the line fivepoint game 420 remaining in this first half Real Ward is another one of these high major transfers at Damantha High School Attended LSU set out a year and now hes preseason second team all A10 guy with the Rams Expect him as he settles in to be more and more comfortable within this system Well whats amazing about him is he actually stepped away from basketball for the music 2020 245 season 500 days between college basketball games his last game for LSU and his first game music for VCU Hes been terrific for the Rams I mean this is a program that is picked to win the A10 preseason They have tons of talent with a firstear head coach very similar to NC State under a firstear head coach and a lot of talent assembled on this roster They got to be happy right now This team is taking some quick shots I think the pressure of NC State has sped these guys up a little bit but theyre right here in this game Only down five A chance to make it two That rims out from Ward McNeel still scoreless tonight Hunting the shot Passes off to Ael McNeel lets it fly off the mark Theyre closing the distance on McNeel early They know he wants to shoot behind the threepoint line Adver Tracy going too quick NC State up five 315 left to this first half Its been a good one so far High volume of threes right now but 21 of their 31 field goals are threes They need to spend more time in the paint trying to get to the free throw line And NC State is just efficient on both ends right now Inside of the paint and outside and you got to find a way to get a body on the body to contest shots You mentioned the free throw line Thats how BCUs closed the gap Seven made free throws in this first half to NC States three Williams back kick down He is so dangerous and hes got 15 in the first half But the concerning part about that is Barry Evans at 68 his wingspan Hes the guy you want with his size and length to match up against Williams and he just backs him down and elevates over him anyway cheering Evans passes out to the double team finds Ward goes up strong for two Thats it Thats the recipe for the Rams You drive it baseline you get the Phoenix slot cut NC States going to help Someones going to be there Its a really good offensive possession there Williams calling his own number again And thats why ACC preseason player of the year for a reason Hes got 17 of the Packs 37 Anytime he can put the basketball in his hands its just a good decision Quick shot at transition by Ward That is what has plagued VCU tonight Randolph those quick threes early in the shot clock Williams on a heat check misses it And Jay both teams are do that Thats really part of that Were talking about NC State doing it Theyre just making more threes right now But VCU wants to play the same way If they can get threes early in transition theyre fine taking those Their issue is settling Deep three and its drilled Terrence Hill Jr He just buried his third triple and its a fourpoint game He can shoot it from the parking lot Youve got to get out and find him You cant go under a screen When you switch you got to switch up Got to be close enough to touch him He made that one from Chapel Hill Tough take inside Hollerman will get two at the line This is a Randolph Childress three I wish I wish I mean here the the DHO when he just behind and Hollermans going to switch No way hes going to shoot it from there Hill has other things in mind He is on a heater right now Hill is a sophomore who was here as a freshman at VCU It stayed through a coaching change That is something you very rarely see in todays college basketball But you get a system and play for a coach like that you want to play for because theyre going to have a high volume of guys You know hes going to play 10 11 guys Theyre going to get your opportunities and shots And I think everybodys happy he stayed Well certainly that man Phil Martelli Jr first year head coach for VCU after winning the America East Conference with Bryant And both of these coaches tonight in their first season coming off NCAA tournament runs Theyre both using the that Kelsey Louisville model Ill say which is load up a ton of talent in year one and win right away Hey the schemes are great but when you got the Jimmies and Joes cheering they can flip quick I think both guys hit in the corner They they they have what theyre looking for They know what theyre looking for Them and their staff identified the talent They did a great job finding these guys putting this team putting their team together Shot clock down to eight Ward passes it out Finds the freshman Nick Lewis A deep three from him No good McNeel passes up the three Good ball movement Rattles in and out No good And BCU could hold for the final shot of what has been an electric first half That possession there I think BC State shows the difference in these two teams right now Really unselfish play Not forcing the three but I think VCU has forced a couple of those threes here Theyre going to hold for the last shot They got 7 seconds to work with Evans drives baseline Scoop to the hoop for TWO TO FINISH THIS first half Its a fourpoint game Pressure in this starting lineup on Barry Evans and Nick Lewis NC State will start with the basketball and a fourpoint music lead See Darian Williams trying to make up with the officials for the the early that he received Got the technical four minutes into this one but it didnt slow him down 17 points in that first half These all smiles as we get some water mopped off the court from the halftime show And we are all set to start this second half Randolph Childris Jay Alter with you Buckle up This should be an exciting second half Fourpoint game NC State ranked today for the first time this season under a new head coach Will Wade who of course spent many years over on the VCU sideline as both an assistant coach part of that final four Cinderella run a head coach for two seasons Hes told us I should have never left And then he paused and said laughter We wont get into that He said he was in a hurry and he doesnt know why but he said it was a young head coach and he had so much success early and hes in the right place now though at the helm of NC State McNeel scoreless in the first half misses there Offensive rebound finds Van Allen Luben in attack mode Spins to the rim for two Thats essentially what Van Allen Luben is Hes a post driver turns face drives you uses his body well needs angles to finish at the rim like he did just there Youre talking about the VCU offensive rebounds Now its the Wolfpack that cash in on the offensive class Lob finds Jookovic Passes out This is Nick Lewis Highly touted freshman Pulls the trigger and hits Nick Lewis a big time three Cuts the lead in half That time there was a switch again Took his time Dribbled into a rhythm three and hes fearless Nick Lewis is tough as they come High major recruiting freshman guard ends up here at VCU committed to Xavier applause Youre right The Rams dont get a ton of SC next top 100 players and Lewis number 57 on the list Originally committed to Xavier like you said Randolph Shawn Miller goes to Texas and boom VCU swoops in Has family in Richmond Grandma lives in Richmond and that matters Yeah it matters Gets to go home get some homecooked meals Who would sign up for that Then Allen Luben at the line Jookovic his first foul of the night Then Allan Luben epitomizes the modernday college basketball player Fourth school in four years Notre Dame Vandy UNCC and now NC State Theyve come to him early here Backto back possessions to start the second half Heres Brandon Jennings He was quiet in the first half No points to show for it Posting up Djokovic in attack mode Draws the foul You mentioned it a couple of times in the first half Randolph Lazar Djokovic the junior from Serbia A matchup nightmare He is This is a difficult matchup Hes capable of knocking down threes that time Doing a really good job of punishing switches which he has Theres no shot blockers on the floor Hes the one guy that the length and the athleticism of the NC State lineup now should not bother him And theyve got a lot of scorers for VCU so they dont need him to necessarily be the number one scorer for the Rams but hes capable of it Average 15 points per game for Serbia at the FIA World Cup cheering I mean 611 guy averaging 10 wait 10 and five but hes shooting 55 from the field and 40 from three Williams barreling down the lane and rims out but hell get two at the line We mentioned it early Both of these teams not only do they want to play in a fast tempo but they want to play very physically and and the officials are starting to call some more fouls of this second half You got to get back You cant make the mistake and lunge for outlet passes You leave your guards hung out to dry Back course just too small for Williams Hes going to get in there and play bully ball applause Williams called for that early technical foul I think is both officiating or all three officials tonight wanted to set the tone for what could have been a game that got out of hand You know you got both teams that want to play identical style pace physicality just wanted to send a message Williams is shaking it off to the tune of 19 points to lead the way They didnt slow him down Didnt bother him at all NC State a sevenpoint lead Two minutes gone in this second half BCU still very much within striking distance down the baseline Jan perfect position for the follow Lazar Jookovic cleans up the spill And again he had the mismatch with the early switch and as a big guy you dont have to get frustrated He tried the high low It wasnt there Shot went up Thats what you want to see if youre a big man High off the window and in for two a problem with his size when he drives the basketball cheering Evans stepped on the line and thats a turnover Copeland just gets downhill in traffic and music forced the issue a little bit there But hes again out here early one hour before everyone else at shootound NC State passed down the floor again This time Williams misfires both of these teams It was a track meet and Brandon Jennings beat everybody down Jay you can turn the shot clock off We will not we will not have a shot clock violation here tonight All right in this second half its just whoevers got the balls going right to the rim That was Jedigs first basket of the night This was a pickup football game back in the day Everybody just go deep Were just throwing bombs Turnover VCU has numbers Its a threeonone Lewis screaming no good Evans is there and he cleans up the spill One possession game And this is what they want of course NC State to do as well Get them in the half court and keep a bigger body on Williams They feel comfortable with everyone else If they can help it they want to keep Barry Evans on him but use his limb Then Allan Luben open for three Missed it Get a Rams You can live with that shot Hes the one guy you wouldnt allow to breathe Tracy good play cheering hammering it home The Serbian sensation Lazard Shookovic Its a onepoint game NC State led by as many as nine That lead is shrunk down to one Holland for three Got it Big time response Got quarter screen there Hollerman is not known as being a really good threepoint shooter Hes gotten to a hot start here early part of the season and cant lose him there early LEWIS THE ANSWER ON THE OTHER END This is elite shot making Jay Im tired of watching the guys shoot Let alone look at the pace of this game Williams Finally a miss Then Alen Luben tried to track it down Swiped away These two teams trading punches and its a onepoint game BCU struggled from behind the threepoint line early in the half but Dick Lewis knocks down a corner three music There we got a onepoint game here in Raleigh Theyve seemed to settle down on the offensive end of the floor And Jookovic has been a mismatch for NC State tonight The Wolfpack clinging to a onepoint lead five minutes into the second half Hable hesitates then goes up and hits him Ables another one of the freshman Throw him in the pile We talked about just talented group cheering Amazing freshman class and he may not get the numbers everyone else gets but he has the game Hes got 10 points tonight BCU theyve got a onetrack mind right now and it is number 17 feed Lazar Jookovic in this second half because of his versatility of switching everything and making a conscious effort here to give him the basketball and take advantage of it and hes delivering And Copeland commits the foul Thats his third Stays in the game Heres Nick Lewis finds Jennings Back to Lewis A deep three for the tie Left it short Empty possession but still a really good possession there Couple times theyre attacking the paint Theyre not forcing shots like they did in the first half A lot of in and out Copeland Tough take and hes fouled Copelands got good size and good physicality 66 220 Not afraid to use it Its a big part of their offense when theyre struggling from behind the threepoint line and they get in the half court His size and his ability to play bully ball and post up smaller guards Its a big emphasis on this NC State offense and things slow down Copeland back in the ACC started his career at Syracuse Actually his career high came against NC State playing for the Orange 25 points back in February 2024 and then hooked up with Will Wade at Mcnes and followed him back to the ACC and he has fit right in The early miss and Williams through contact These are just winning plays on the free throw line He gets inside early winsbury misses on a block out And youve got to have a body on Williams at all times especially on the free throw line And hes putting a Wolfpack on his back here 10 second chance points for NC State The threepoint play from Williams Hes up to 22 And the pack back up by seven after VCU had cut it to one cheering cheering Shot clock down to 10 Jennings double team Passes out of it cheering 5 seconds to shoot Pull up three No good Offensive rebound couple of chances at it and Jennings will head to the line to shoot two music PCU commits so many guys to the offensive glass and theyre really in theyre in this game and theyre hurting NC State Theyre catching them in their rotations and they are coming in hard crashing the glass music Youve got Sonier out your big man defending the threepoint shot So its upon their guards and their wings to get on the glass music music Theyre not going anywhere cheering This is just a highle game thats played at a pace that not many teams can play at But Guadir Copeland has to come out of this game He just picked up his fourth foul So aggressive We saw it pay off with him getting his own miss after the free throw and it leading to a Darion Williams and one But on the other end commits his fourth foul cheering So the Wolfpack will go to the bench Allan Breed in place of Copeland Those two both came over from MC And where it hurts NC State is they dont have his size to post up as an option here in the half court Reed floater doesnt drop Kick to the corner a three Its good Tyrell Ward and its a twopoint game Another drive there getting in the paint Spraying it out to the corner for three Quick back the other way like its been all night and Hollowman is fouled This is something that the Rams didnt do in the first half This was a pull up midrange jump shot Now theyre drafting drive We talked about NC State helpside Great find Great corner three by Ward The Rams are here for full 40 minutes Just like that Holly comes back on the other end and gets to the free throw line Cant celebrate too much Makes the first Saturday morning 1000 am Eastern Start your college football Saturday live from Atlanta The huddle crew will be there to preview pit at Georgia Tech in an entire slate A busy Saturday in the ACC Georgia Tech with a win They clinch a spot in the ACC Championship game So lots of drama down in Atlanta Pick the Yellow Jackets to with the protection of playing the ACC championship game You saw that coming Hey if you can run the football like they can anything is possible Wow Brent Key the head coach for the Yellow Jackets Hed appreciate a Will Wade coach team physical Yeah Likes to create turnovers Absolutely Defensive pressure The Wolfpack a fourpoint lead VCU They have hung around Their lone lead came when it was one nothing NC States been in control but they have failed to separate Like to see them attack the matchup with Sonier on the perimeter Shot clock down to three and a travel Hill Jr got tangled up Like you said Randolph good defense by Sier You got the match up with Sier on your threepoint line Youre turning your back against the pressure You got to drive him Force rotation You can tell by the way theyve started the second half that was a big emphasis coming out of the Rams locker room is drive the pass Holliveran buries it from three Trey Hollermans got 17 Rejection at the rim Sier says no A rejection on the other end Christian Ferman cheering Block party on the last couple of possessions A three Its good Chadrien Tracy drills it and its a fourpoint game Every time NC State starts to separate VCU has had an answer tonight Yeah they struggled early in the first half from threepoint line I think some of that was just shot selection Now theyre driving in the lane Theyre driving Theyre kicking it out to open threepoint shooters and theyre taking those shots And I think Tracy is Every time they needed a basket from behind the threepoint line he stepped up to knock down a shot See what the Wolfpack here have thrown up out of the timeout The stay NC State ball 10 seconds on the shot clock underneath their own hoop As we head to break again VCU right back in it Will Wade facing his former team Fourpoint music lead percentage Well what is it Its the number of field goals made plus half of your threepointers made divided by field goal attempts 10 seconds for NC State to work with it They turn it over and VCU cashes in to make it a twopoint game You absolutely crushed that by the way I was a little worried but Well Im not good with math I leave that to my wife whos a math teacher But to to finish it up NC State theyre shooting 67 on effective field goal percentage A good one is 50 to 54 Elite is considered 55 So they are one of the best in the country in that percentage but they are 57 tonight Stole it away Looking to add to this twopoint lead Holan misses it followed up and cashed in the freshman Musa Sag His first basket of the night and its a fourpoint lead for the Pack Last possession there Djokovic got surprised with the double team and rotation They hadnt doubled him all night Shot clock down to five Tracy in trouble Finds Barry Evans for three and he drills it Big time three for Barry Evans and its a onepoint game Hes come in tonights game shooting 20 from the threepoint line That is not his strength but he has stepped up and knocked down a couple of victories here VCU has made their last three shots They shot at 30 from the floor in that first half Theyre shooting at 66 in the second Ward draws the foul and hell have a chance to take the lead from the foul line Great defensive possession there Fans doesnt like to call McNeel got all ball Yeah that was a really good block there by McNeel The fans of the Lenovo Center are right to moan And sometimes you can say well he got him with the body That was all ball Officials have done a really good job here tonight in a tough physical game cheering Well let him slide on that one Tie game at 63 Here it is one more time cheering I think it was clean the second time laughter Now VCUs only lead tonight was at one nothing Since then NC State has been in control of this game The Wolfpack led by as many as nine Oh my god But that lead is now evaporated Although the freshman Matt Able a chance to get it back here from the free throw line Yeah as I was going on and on about effective field goal percentage and you know Will Wade places so much value I could feel the fans being like its a tie game laughter You can have as great an effective field goal percentage as you want but VCU they are not going away Well Im happy you got it out and you said it correctly because you were struggling with it when you were talking about explain to me 17 laughter times by Will Wade eventually said its like slugging percentage in baseball That is that click for me Tomorrow night also a double header right here on the ACC network Navy at North Carolina music You can check out the freshman phenom Caleb Wilson and then Monmouth at Syracuse at 9 You have a double header Monday night double header Tuesday night basketball season in full swing here on ACC Network And the Orange is another team I dont think many people are talking about in the ACC that I think that come March that they will have their dance shoes that they can stay healthy Goes inside to Tracy Hes got it Plus the foul A chance to fire VCU in front from the foul line Theyve been trying to post up Jookovic inside That time they picked on the freshman Matt Able inside You see the flash in by Tracy and gets the angle and gives the pump fake cheering Just a great job of getting it low and having patience cheering Tracy misses it BCU has had two opportunities from the foul line to take their first lead since it was one to nothing And theyve missed them both so it stays tied Williams has a game high 22 and he draws the foul The fouls are really starting to pile up in this second half Thats the seventh foul against VCU So NC State will be shooting the rest of the way I think Barry is the only guy that can guard a manto man in half court The other defenders are either too small or too big You want Jookovic off on the big guys to rebound but music Darien Williams is just too big for any of the other wings and guards except for Barry Evans Yeah With a player like Williams who can beat you on the perimeter and inside how how would you attack that matchup Well you dont want to switch because you can see theyre going right Theyre trying to attack the switch early In the last two possessions even when they had a turnover the four hes trying to force a switch If Im VCU Id tell Barry Evans to fight through the pick Hes your responsibility for the remainder 9 minutes and 4 seconds of this game Everyone else is just too small And BCU I mean NC State besides Trey Hollowerman is kind of struggling to find that other guy to get it going If this game turns into a free throw shooting contest that favors NC State They are 17 of 19 from the line tonight VCU just 10 of 16 Its the Achilles heel of their team Theyre only shooting 67 from the foul line this year cheering And thats the one thing that theyve got to improve on if they want to punch their ticket in the A10 The only flaw that you can see cheering from VCU Rams preseason 810 favorites They are testing a ranked NC State team on the road That rattled in and out for three Was halfway cheering down but applause did not drop and a foul called will send NC State right back to the foul line for a one and one You take that shot all day long You can see the emphasis in the second half to continue to attack the basket Drive the pass Open look by Hill Just knock down a couple of threes Hes not a guy you want to leave open music And its Williams right back to the line We just saw him make two He is six of seven from the free throw line tonight Game high 24 points Hes coming off a careerhigh 32 might just beat it tonight Hes on his way applause cheering Lane violation on the freshman Lucier And because it was a one and one thats a turnover So instead of getting to shoot the front end of a oneonone on a lane violation it becomes VCU basketball Like you can see there hes getting heel of jockey in full position NC State goes to the 131 here If you want to attack that look to the corner for threes or look for a lob Skip pass Finds Ward No good Great rebound by Paul McNeel but he gives it right back Jennings poked it free cheering Jennings with a great steal showing you why hes in the A10 all defensive team Phil Martelli Jrs team is battling against a ranked NC State team on the road Under eight minutes left to this second half This has been a fun matchup since tip off Stolen away Twoon one TREY HOLLOWMAN FLIES TO THE RIM FOR TWO cheering Backing the 131 You got side to side You got to flatten it out at some point You got to throw cheering it to one of the corners and flatten it out Deep three Way too much on it Up ahead cheering WILLIAMS TRACKS IT DOWN GATHERS AND SCORES Hes got 26 cheering Time out VCU NC State on a 6 nothing run Plenty of time left No need to panic cheering Quickly identify after the pressure what defense NC States in and just move the basketball and get any shot you want cheering Pull up Jennings sticks it Big time make out of the timeout Ends a twominute scoring drought for VCU in a game where it has been nonstop scoring It feels like its a lot of shot making the hard playing guys right now Quadir Copeland into the game playing with four fouls Williams good feud You forget with all his scoring and his rebounding Hes averaging over four assists a game Jookovic answers Lazar Jookovic continues to deliver in this second half I expect him to touch the basketball a lot more in these next six minutes Hard screen by Ben Allen Luben and Copeland is fouled at the rim Nick Lewis the freshman just ran right in to Van Allen Luben And cheering I know the coaching staff BCU Rams dont like the foul I mean the call but I I I think teams should do this a lot more Jay They pressuring the basketball come up set a ball screen and thats on his teammates to communicate that ball screens coming Thats not on the official Lewis the highly touted true freshman Jay I can tell you that hurts I got three shoulder surgeries from running into them screens like that Who Who was the toughest screen you ever ran into What the guy that you still remember I would say Clemson front line and and in practice I had my own guys and Rodney and those younger guys And you know back during my time of playing you could cut through the league The restriction of movement was not a part of the 90s ACC basketball You got hit and chuck running through the lane And laughter I got a lot of strawberries on my hip and things of that nature Three shoulder surgeries to pay for it And running them screens like that Its you get into a lot of argument with your big guys about calling out those screens It forces communication This game has been very physical throughout DCU looking for the big fella Djokovic in a double team No answer Righty hook Backto back baskets for Lazar Djokovic And its a onepossession game Jay theres no answer for him on the floor When he sets that ball screen they switch But they look for that high low action He either gets the midmax or he gets it on the glass Then Allan Luben finds the Frenchman a streaking Musa Sier who draws a foul And Ed State in the double bonus the rest of the way shooting two And on that possession VCU just denying Williams the basketball 26 points tonight for the ACC preseason player of the year Instead they find Sier Someones going to have to step up down the stretch if VCU is going to face guard Williams Lets see if Sier can make free throws here Good looking shot but hadnt made any this year Yeah he was brought in more as a rim protector Yeah good defensive player A lot of times when a ball is in his hand in late games you expect it to be a lob or a point blank finish at the rim That time he did a really good job of slipping and cutting unable to convert the uh basket Missed them both but tapped out to Copeland and NC State resets leading by three Darian Williams on another offensive rebound off the free throw line Backing down Double team comes Williams passes out of it Zany for three Thats not his shot and its way off the mark The ball will stay with the Wolfpack though Djokovic pleading his case that it should be VCU ball Theyre trying to wait and see and theyre asking the coach to challenge it New rule in college basketball this season The coaches do have that one challenge Looked like VCU couldnt pull it up fast enough to check and see Didnt want to waste a challenge This is what Copeland presents as a 66 guard Turns it over Tracy read it the whole way Adrien Tracy in attack mode Kick to the corner A three No good Sier rips down the rebound I think Sier got away with a push there That creates a five on four Williams down the lane Contact and a foul applause Just a heady play by Williams They had numbers with Tracy on the falling down on the other end and Williams puts his head down initiates the contact and forces the official to blow the whistle And its the fourth foul against Brandon Jennings Williams been very effective from the foul line tonight Six of seven And the ACC preseason player of the year makes it a twopossession game Hes knocked down every shot you can imagine And again its theyre starting to look for him as we get into the guts of this game Wouldnt be surprised if he touches it nearly every time down the floor The way hes playing he should cheering And for VCU their answer has been Lazar Djokovic 17 in black cheering Nick Lewis trapped He has to burn VCUs final timeout They only had one remaining And Nick Lewis the freshman just used it Hes got to learn Jay He crawls half court Theyre going to trap But we step aside NC State a fivepoint lead A fun finish coming in Raleigh CU ball down five They are out of timeouts which means they also lose the ability to use the coachs challenge It need a timeout to initiate it Theres a lot of time left for VCU to be playing with no timeouts Youre going to learn a lot about your team in moments like this with no timeouts Shot clock down to four NC State The defense delivers again Musa Sag stolen away cheering Look for Jookovic inside on the switches Oh a corner three cheering Evans trying to back down Holland and a foul called Felt like a big moment down the stretch of this game NC State creates the turnover and then they give it right back to VCU They failed to capitalize in transition which theyve been so good at tonight 16 fast break points for Will Wades team and he knows that was a missed opportunity because instead of adding to this fivepoint lead BCU gets the ball back cheering and Barry Evans at the line He has an opportunity to make this a one possession game NC State chances to pull away and just unable to do so Evans has 14 tonight to lead all VCU players Came over with his head coach Phil Martelli Jr from Bryant and they are testing a ranked Wolfpack team on the road tonight Hes getting really aggressive here tonight and his impact for this team is usually on the in off in transition Hes been a main cog in their half court offense He has the assignment of usually guarding Williams And lets see if they try to keep that bigger body on him NC State clinging to a threepoint lead Theres Williams the goto guy all night REJECTED EVANS SAYS NO Williams reathers in attack mode Stolen away Tracy has it Evans Lewis from tie No good Battle for the board Loose ball And NC State gets the timeout Darien Williams heads up play Loose ball He got possession and he takes time out for NC State They still have two remaining A music threepoint lead Wolfpack basketball will step aside for 30 seconds music This was the last possession for VCU Got a good look to tie this game potentially and the freshman Nick Lewis missed it see the guys there You got to get on the ground there and Williams gets music on the floor early and calls timeout I thought that a big play with the previous possession NC State tried to wrench something for Williams and Barry Evans with his length holds his ground blocks his shot creates the turnover I think early in the game theyve switched and allow him to get smaller bodies on him From Barry Emmeris now you got to fight through screens You cannot switch if you dont have to One possession game Buckle up for what should be an exciting final three minutes here in Raleigh And thats a travel NC State in empty possession again down the stretch here because now theyre not switching That you can tell Coach Martelli has challenged his guys Get through screens Were not switching NC State tried to get a rough screen Force a smaller defender on Williams Great mental toughness there by the Rams cheering cheering Ward cant connect Another good look to tie this game and VCU misses again Doing a really good job on the offensive end Didnt make the shot but again theyre flattening out that 131 and getting open looks Copeland playing with four fouls Finds then Allan Luben Goes up strong Missed it Perfect position to follow his own miss Fivepoint lead for the Pack Its a really strong move and finish Lewis has got to get across the half court line Hes picking his dribble up too close to half court cheering Tracy a three Its good Chadrien Tracy burries another Hes got 16 Jay Every three hes hit has been exactly when the Rams have needed it When NC States been on a run or a critical part of this game twopoint game under two minutes to play COPELAND IN ATTACK MODE DOWN THE LANE MISSES THE layup and a foul called Jookovic trying to close that possession reached in and got a piece of Copeland Great job moving the basketball there Evans hits the gap kicks it to Tracy and again lights out Just a really good play there by Kok Makes a first A chance to make it a twop possession game if he can knock down another missed it It stays a one possession game VCU basketball trailing by three Final 90 seconds of regulation in Raleigh cheering Trying to screen it Djokovic is trying to force a match up Force a switch And he wants to roll inside Jookovic calling for the ball Its with the freshman Dick Lewis Double team COMES IN HE TURNS IT OVER Copeland up ahead Ben Allen LUBEN SWIPED AWAY LEWIS STEALS IT BACK cheering Transition three No good Copeland rips down the rebound NC State ball swinging to a threepoint lead BCUs not going to foul Theyre going to play this out with it being a one possession game Theyre going to put Copeland in the ball screen here Pick your match up I think its got to be Jookovic but if not theyre going to switch it Shot clock down to eight Copeland spins his way free Rejected Tyrell Ward delivers VCU out of timeouts cheering HERE WE GO A THREE cant connect and the foul comes in Jadrien Tracy whos been clutch all night misses an attempt from three that would have tied the game And now NC State can make it a twopossession game from the free throw line with 18 seconds left Tracy has hit so many big shots when they needed it but that moment they did not need a three Its a onepossession game You didnt need a three Now if you had driven it got in the free throw line or hit a two Do you like this shot I dont I just think its too quick You almost decide the game because now theres no pressure on these free throws here by Hollowman If he makes one makes it a two possession game Got to string the game along in that situation Put pressure on the defense If that three had come off the dribble penetration I would have been okay with it Well Tracy had hit four threes before that miss And theyve all come in spots Absolutely So thats who you want shooting it but not in that spot Yeah you want him on the other side Maybe someone else initiating the offense but hes had a hot hand Hes hit big shots all night Just think hed like to have that moment back Shot was a little quick Down three With that much time he didnt need to take a quick shot Holland hits them both Fivepoint lead for NC State VCU out of timeouts cheering Same thing now You dont have to settle for a three Put pressure on his defense They get a good look Barry Evans drills it Twopoint game NC State has two timeouts They inbound the ball to Hollowman whos immediately fouled cheering Big three by Barry Evans to keep VCU alive in this game Yeah you need help here And he knocks down a three to cut it to two Great job there Tracy on the catch Hes the guy you were worried about And Barry is knocking Barry Evans has knocked down a couple of threes here tonight and thats just not been a strength coming into the night but he has shot the three ball well Haliban a perfect six for six from the foul line You see a deep breath there The weight of this game on his shoulders cheering big time make If he hits another Will Wades team will go up four which means its a twopossession game The Rams you got to anticipate a miss You got to box out Got it And VCU used their final timeout with 4 minutes and 20 seconds left That has proven costly because they have been without a timeout down the stretch of this game cheering You dont have to have a three here but you got to play the possession HEADS UP PLAY AND NC STATE IS GOING TO HANG ON CUADIR COPELAND READ it perfectly And its the hustle plays that have won this game for NC State say the last two minutes of this game has been Cadier Copeland finishing at the rim drawing fouls on the defensive end getting rebounds and here creates the steel all but ices this game for the Wolfpack Hes just a glue guy He wears so many hats for this Wolfpack group Plays point guard when he needs to double digit score defender Loved as a teammate hated when you play against him is what the best way to describe him Yeah Will Wade was joking with us that you know he when he recruited him the Mcnes you know the game film that popped was against NC State when he had a careerhigh 25 points and hes talking smack to the fans here and he said Look theyre going to have to embrace him because hes one of us now He is And they have Can you not cheer for a guy that plays as hard as he plays Holland ice in his veins down the stretch A perfect nine for nine from the free throw line Hes got 24 points total Holman is enjoying the offensive freedom he has in the Wolfpack that he didnt have in Michigan State 10 for 10 from the line Sixpoint lead for NC State Deep three from VCU No good And NC State holds on The Will Wade era continues a strong start ranked in the AP top 25 And with Darien Williams the ACC preseason player of the year the Raleigh faithful theyre starting to dream again Yeah they have a lot to be excited about The futures great
