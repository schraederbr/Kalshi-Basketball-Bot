really dialed it up in January an 80 undefeated month to start 2026 here in February hosting Boston College We are underway The Eagles in gold Duke sporting Navy at home for the first time this season Whats the recipe for BC to pull the upset tonight Well theyve got to make shots Thats the first thing They cannot turn the ball over which they typically dont do but you got to try to get the ball inside out against Dukes defense You got to play inside out Donald Han Jr misfires the opening three cheering And for Duke Jay its moving the ball and taking care of the basketball and finding open shooters Tom Asar Caleb Foster back into the starting lineup Those two battled through the flu over the weekend in a win against Virginia Tech Boozer winds up the three and opens cheering the story They rule it a deep two Theyll take a look at that at the under 16 media timeout BC starting five Stolen away The steal and the slam right on Q such a good job anticipating Some of what Duke does defensively is scoutbased and obviously they do a great job there but they understand personnel and so they guard people in different ways with different ball coverages ball screen coverages The Boston College head coach Earl Grant said We have to weather the first eight minutes of this game Ive played in this building but nobody else has on my team Have to weather that early storm hand way off the mark Thats a shot clock violation as Camboozer has gotten the party started It is a party in Cameron thats for sure I think they might have to take a look at that They score at a a two on the floor but then right here just anticipating denying the high post and making a play on the defensive end Well up in the crows nest it certainly looked like a three They counted for two So they will take a look at that Strong start for Duke Foster hands it off Tried to feed it into Gumba Scrambled for the ball Jump ball called Possession arrow Hes with Duke Theres the Blue Devils head coach John Sh Hes got Duke 20 and one to start a season for the first time since he was a sophomore An incredible start to this year Isaiah Evans cant connect Dont be misled by Boston Colleges record This is a team thats been in games They play excellent defense and they are not going to quit on any play tonight that they have played better as the season goes on under Earl Grant That is certainly the case this season Two and two over their last four Long possessions to start this game Shot clock ticks down to four Hastings turnaround right hook No good Follows his own miss And BC has some size up front Theyre one of the better shot blocking teams on the defensive end Theyre going to do a good job of trying to score inside You got to establish some baseline play against Duke Ben Ky rejected at the rim Dungo got there to snuff it cheering out Heres Sar in transition through traffic Scoop to the hoop for cheering two One of the things Duke has is positional size And when you have perimeter size you cheering can really use your length and your quickness on that end of the floor right here to impact the basketball Nothing coming easy against this Duke defense Ball on the floor again Evans has it Al we have liftoff cheering Earl Grant has a veteran backcourt with Fred Payne and Donald Han Thats why you dont see him calling a timeout after that dunk Most coaches on an 80 run might but he trusts his guys Now he might consider it Now he might consider it Yes he is You cant call it after the dunk JAY THE PLACE IS ALREADY ROCKING cheering We said at the 16 media timeout take a look at that Cameron Boozer shot that opened the scoring and they did rule it a three originally signaled a two So an 11 nothing start for the Blue Devils who were in fine form Undefeated at ACC play We told you before tip off Debbie theyve done it with defense and boy have they tonight clamping down on the Eagles early Not a lot of switching They want you to stick with your matchup and only emergency switch at this point but their ball screen coverages will change based on personnel Chase Forte good luck cant connect When you overhelp that option is going to be available but you got to knock down open shots against Dukes defense Youre not going to get very many uncontested ones Blue Devils have knocked down their last three shots Got will go to the line to shoot two Coming up right after us right here on ACC Network Pit at Virginia Very similar to this game Debbie When you think about a game like this in early February two teams fighting for completely different things Boston College they just want to make the ACC tournament like Pit Remember every team doesnt make it The bottom three will miss out on postseason play at the ACC tournament Whereas Duke and Virginia theyre fighting for that double bite I think Ryan ODMs team is really solid I I think they defend They have multiple rotations They can change the rhythm of the game Of course Tester Ritter has been fantastic as their leading scoreer but uh I like Chance Mallerie He has really played well off the bench for Ryan ODMs team Part of a starstudded freshman class They know that well here at Camber Indoor Duke defense totally suffocating BC Fred Pay trying to spin his way free and finally opens the story for BC 5 minutes into this one A tough two His off hand under duress late clock Thats the way its going to go right here against the Dukes defense Foster Good patience Splits two and draws contact Fred Payne the 61 red shirt sophomore one of the more improved players in the ACC Look at this tough two right here in the paint John Sh told us today his defense is going to give up some tough shots and hes not going to be upset with that Hell be upset if we foul a shooter if we foul on a personnel mistake We do not want to foul and put the other team on the free throw line Its amazing to see the improvement Duke has made defensively throughout this season still a work in progress according to coach Shy but where they were at the end of December struggling in games against Georgia Tech and Florida State to now just so dialed in on the defensive end Coach Shy said pride and focus We dont spread get too extended and more than anything that defending without fouling Fred Payne has all four for BC Good take off the bounce by Payne And as good as Dukes defense was to start now you got Malik Brown on the floor whos actually their best defender there Theyre the ones that to help you with the iPad to let you know if you should challenge or not Passing side to Boozer Hell make you pay from cheering there Plays the game on balance You cant knock him off his line Hes so strong in his lower part of his body Camboozer with nine of the Blue Devils 16 to start Theyve already separated early in this game Forte tough tank No good Offensive rebound Couldnt clean up the spill Think Malik Brown got a piece of that as is often known to do A national defensive player of the year candidate Brown alongside his teammate Cam Boozer When you got those two in the front court it is tough to get anything inside Deflection leads to two Boston College will take it Donald Han Jr the beneficiary of a bounce way Last years most improved player Donald Han Jr doing a good job defensively Andy Der into the game cheering Lobs one up onehanded Malik Brown applause Not the same rim protection on the floor without Hastings out there for Earl Grant Well Duke has such good good positional size Most teams are undersized against the Blue Devils as Forte knocks down the three But Boston College particularly undersized with the front court tonight Well theyve elected to go with four Well Hayden Shaws on the floor but it plays small right now And loser catches it that deep Forget about it Thats what Im talking about Youre not going to speed him up Hes going to pump fake Hes going to play off two feet A perfect five for five for the likely national player of the year Cam Boozer He has set the tone on both ends of the floor Forte Capi good finish on the interior So the last couple of possessions for BC theyve been able to get inside the Duke defense to set up their shots and their drives Thats what you have to do against Duke You got to collapse that D try to flatten them out and then make a play out of there Camboozer spins into a double team bounces it for Brown Malik Brown on a rack attack Duke doubling up BC 2211 Blue Devils have made their last seven shots Boston College has now won four made four in a row Fred Payne flying to the rim Hes got six of their 13 Fred Payne came ready to play Last three games hes averaged 18 points Hes been a threat on the top of the floor Back door opened off a good screen cheering And now its Isaiah Evans turn to rock the rim Dukes got everybody lifted above the free throw line Its a great back door How about this Duke has made their last eight shots Boston College has made their last four All offense right now and a foul called We have been treated to some highflying and he has really done that with this team I mean when you replace a legend like Coach K theres usually a gap in there And John hasnt had a gap Hes had success every year And I think his evolution as a play caller has grown And you cant do the same things all the time but you can simplify what you do with your personnel because you just go with what works You dont have to have a bunch of plays Their spacing their timing their elite level cutting is what separates them I think on the offensive end Second foul called against Duke in this first half One thing that the Blue Devils have really prided themselves on during this ninegame win streak in ACC play is defending without fouling I think thats the goal of every coach to do that You want to keep teams off the free throw line but you know I thought Patrick Dun was vertical on that point Jayen Shawn misses the first Take another look here You can jump vertical in your space Now if he came down with his arms from that angle we cant tell but obviously the officials thought that he did Shaw missed them both Well Duke has made their last nine shots Their last miss was almost eight minutes ago Were it four dunks in there Yeah theyre getting really good looks Thats the play calling we were just talking about 11 of 12 from the floor midway through this first half Why not Nothing but the bottom of the net THATS HIS SEVENTH triple of the season Now he starts adding that consistently Hes going to generate more space and gravity for cutters for Duke make it 10 straight makes for the Blue Devils Shaw tangled up on the inside Jump ball called possession arrow with Duke How about the quickness right here Forte What a take off the bounce And this is Gungbo right here Short hops it and still scores it You know what Hes a post player Hes used to catching a bounce pass Probably not on the perimeter though And the arrow does stick with Boston College under 5 seconds to shoot Pay quick trigger bounces off the rim No good Boston College desperate for a stop The only miss tonight for Duke came at the 1759 mark 12 of 13 from the floor 10 of their last 10 Thats his second And Kapkis got to go to the bench Jay with that second foul That Thats not a smart foul back Capki they need his size at the rim Heres Kaden Boozer Lost the handle and a foul called And Cameron Boozer who plays 32 minutes a game is getting a good bit of time on the bench right now Boston College in a scoring drought of 2 and 12 minutes And that has allowed Duke to separate in this first half Already a 16point lead Forte trying to shake free finds for a three and he drains it since the 110 run to start the game BC has really settled in Theyve done a really nice job Duke has got has played at their pace but BCs playing at their pace on the offensive end right now Yeah the Eagles are actually seven of 11 from the field after starting 0 for six They just cant get a stop although they get one there But the Blue Devils streak of 10 straight makes Eds Now can you string together some stops if youre Boston College on the road trying to weather this first half storm 11 Shot clock down to four Hastings off the window and in for two If you go from that 110 start BC has played them even since the timeout And when you consider how efficient Duke has been on the offensive end shooting 12 and 14 that tells you how well BCs playing offensively Harris through traffic misses the layup Heres Fred Pay Kick out Stagger cant connect on that triple Heads up Heads up Crosscourt pass Dump off Well defended Brown by Sar Contact and a foul called against Boston College Well Boston College trying to weather this first half storm and Duke does a really good job of not playing to him but also playing through him as you said and and then he can run off screening action which means the bigs that are guarding him have to play off screening action as well A lot of guys dont like to do that or havent done very much of it Foster a good look out of the timeout Duke executes a three Caleb Foster drills it I also thought the cadence with with the way they played the rhythm on that possession their cadence was much better Ends a three and a half minute scoring drought cheering and thats more like it for the Blue Devils offensively Stolen away Boozer right on Q cheering Lost the handle though Evans a deep three Donald Hans really has not gotten going yet Here he is They need him One for five 0 for three from the threepoint line Gunga on the block going against Hastings Good defense Hastings held his ground Good look for Aiden Shaw He cant connect Shaws made one triple this season Open for a reason Boston College in a scoring drought but three minutes now Thats what the scout would say Jay Evans the pain Reathers offensive rebound Boozer steps out for three Missed it Foul on the rebound goes against Duke So Boston College ball But John Shs team playing with great intensity out of the timeout When we asked him the key to this ninegame winning streak he said defe instill that into your guys each and every game So impressive their consistency as this seasons gone on and they stop switching as much So youre holding guys to a higher accountability to guard the ball Corner three Pay misfires Boston College has gotten a couple of good looks Just cant knock him down Evans in transition Hell usually make you pay for there Payne trying to beat everybody back Coast to coast for with Boozer shading him up the floor Payne has played really well for BC in the back court Hes got eight of the Eagles 20 Foster missed it Theres Lucas Ta pull up high Sticks it Mistake in transition Taz takes advantage of it Duke has missed their last five shots and two of their last 10 Boozer trying to change that Triple teamed right now Gets the ball out Evans passed up the three down the lane Count it Plus the foul A chance for a threepoint play the oldfashioned way Second scorer behind Camboozer while Isaiah Evans is taking care of that Although he cant complete the threepoint play The points have been at a premium for Boston College in this first half trailing by 15 cheering Hastings onehanded jam rejected by the rim Boozer the trailer So dangerous Spins his way in Everything but the finish Think Fred Payne has a matchup he can win They should have boomeranged it right back to him in transition Heres Pan Only two points for him tonight Who can win this matchup Shot clock ticks down to five Hastings not a threepoint shooter Thats why Duke started this game making 12 of their first 13 shots but theyve cooled off just three of their last 12 Still a 15point lead though Loser looking for kick to the corner Evans a three Its good Couple of triples Its separation power right Its ability to move the ball to get the BC defense all spaced out Evans has the last eight points for Duke Blue Devils have increased their lead Largest of the night Corner three Much needed for BC Jason Asamoto the transfer from Baylor whos seen limited time dealing with injuries this season Exactly what the Eagles needed Maybe not so much a rhythm triple that time for Isaiah Evans went for the heat check there to no avail Got 45 seconds left in this first half Taves turnaround jumper off the mark Foul called Well keep the ball with Boston College Thursday night womens basketball A play for K double header right here on ACC Network Tips off with Clemson music at North Carolina and then Florida State at NC State Debbie you were there last night What a powerful night Strong inspirational big win for North Carolina on the road Clemson a bubble team desperately needs another big W This would be a quad one for them North Carolina just moved into the polls this week and of course NC State looking to bounce back And I know how much those play for K games mean to you and everybody associated with Kay Yao and the incredible work the foundation does And that was a very savvy play here at the end of the first half John Sh telling his team Let the ball roll Its called kill the clock until the clock ticks under 30 and Duke can hold for the final shot of this first half Well you kill time before the 30 second shot clock begins It doesnt start TILL THE INBOUND BOOZER PUT IT ON A POSTER CAM BOOZER HERE cheering We thought Duke was going to wait for the final shot of the first half Cam Boozer had other ideas and were going to need a couple more looks at that Is scoring guards that have had their way in ACC play except when they face this Duke defense Its the Blue Devils that start with the basketball and a 15point lead Duke started this game on an 11 nothing run They have kept their foot planted on the gas Gumba gone right at Capki who sat for most of that first half with foul trouble and he forces the turnover Yeah Kapki picked up two fouls and he only played 10 minutes in that first half Now they need his size at the rim cuz you know I thought it was a dunk fest in the first half for Duke The rim was open for the Blue Devils Five dunks in that first half Were keeping praise on the Blue Devils defense They force a turnover the opening 30 seconds of this second half But for Earl Grant Fred Payne played well and theyre going to need him on the offensive end They got to get some stops right here and try to cut this lead in half by the 10minute mark Right back to Gunga and Kapi called for the foul Two possessions offensively two passes to Gunga on a post up in isolation in the block And thats John Sh talking to Patrick right before the second half started Im sure he said Listen big guy were going to go to you We want you to punish BCs front line this weekend CC Network gymnastic schedule starts music Saturday where number 20 Cal is at number 16 Clemson and then continues Sunday More ranked matchup North Carolina at NC State Busy weekend for gymnastics right here on ACC Network Dunle one of two from the line Kicks his miss though Finds Boozer TWOHANDED JAM CAM BOOZER ROCKS the rim again We saw the onehanded hammer to finish the first half Debbie And he follows it up with a flush to start the second half Hes got seven baskets and three of which are dunks Duke doing a good job guarding flare action doing a good job keeping cheering their head on the chest of the defender head on the chest of the offensive player Look at this hustle right here by GMA Do a nice job of dropping it off for Boozer to throw it down A couple more clips to go on a growing highlight reel What a special season Cameron Boozer is having Payne step back Got it Fred Payne He has become an elite shot maker in the ACC Hes been Boston Colleges brightest spot the last couple of weeks And in the last six games and counting today hes only had four turnovers So hes taken care of the ball Hes had the ball in his hands for a lot of decision making for Earl Grant and hes delivered Offensive foul called against Duke Fosterss first Payne has 12 of the Eagles 29 You have to think everythings going for number five in gold in this second half Hasnt touched it on this possession though Shot clock ticks down to seven I mean look at Summer move his feet Kough take and he makes it You cant defend much better than that Im not sure how he saw the rim over 68 Sar What a great play Luca Taves the cousin of Jonathan Taves Stanley Cup winner with the Blackhawks and twotime gold medalist with Canada Wide open Foster so shifty Duke does such a good job on the weak side opposite the ball of staying active offensively Boozer the assist He averages four a game to go along with 10 rebounds and 23 and a half points Not to mention the dominance on defense John Sh not happy with his unit that time I mean this is good D a contested two and a beautifully done shot and then a great cut on the weak side by Caleb Foster to the rim But John Sh having an extended word with John Gaffne Now were ready to play Payne tried to squeeze it to Hastings Falls out the hand Ripped away Cam Boozer says no Duke launches into the attack Evans draws the foul Hell get two at the line I mean Boozer makes this deal like hands like a tight end right here He just snatches it out of the air Weve been talking about his scoring but this is the part of his game right here Look at this Just snatches it out of the air and then initiates their break Evans makes the first You think where this Duke team is 21 and a half games into this season 201 for the first time since John Sh was a sophomore playing for the Blue Devils And coach said Look I think this team was unfairly judged on last years second half of the season People forget it took that team that was so good went to the Final Four but to find their rhythm and this team is finding theirs 8 and0 in January and a strong start in February here against Boston College I think it all starts with their defense They have definitely been locked in Their schemes are good and they guard personnel exceptionally well Boozer twoman game with Foster Spins his way free Rolls off the rim No good He thought it should have been a goend Transition three Taves rims out No good Evans lost the handle Pressure by Fred Payne Itll be Boston College basketball right in front of coach SH Thats just five turnovers for Duke a team that turns it over 11 times a game cheering Sar stole it away One on three Lost the handle Itll be That was a big bucket by Moore Had an incredible record 58 and three Its amazing at Cameron New York Stadium Truly when you look at the records one of the best coaches in the nation if not the best Certainly should get more coach of the year consideration That left pass hammered on his way to the rim Hell get two And Debbie we go all across the nation Every head coach tells us winning is hard Now Duke and Coach Shy have made it look easy Its Duke so thats the expectation but it shouldnt take away the job coach Sh has done particularly with this new roster losing five guys to the NBA and hes on his way to 211 And how much better the league is this year undefeated in league play undefeated on the road That Thats impressive Big win at Virginia Tech Of course this week is the Duke Carolina week And we asked Coach SH about potential trap game with BC and he said No way Were talking about it He straight up with his guys about it You know we got to take care of business And he also mentioned what a special place this is They only got five more home games in here They should enjoy it and they should give their best effort and theyve done that so far Yeah this is a strange stretch of the season where this is their only game for two and a half weeks So make the most of it and they certainly have so far 20point lead 5 minutes into this second half Boston College has never quite gotten into their offensive rhythm Thats why cheering the Duke defense dialed in Tamboozer swiped it away Theyve had the deflection or a steal on the last three possessions Cant cash in on the other end that time Its all about disruption right Breaking your rhythm trying to be as disruptive as you can connected on the defensive end Everybodys got a nose on the ball A lob ran well by Brown You cant do that with Malik Brown guarding the inside John Sher told us Malik Browns the only guy he doesnt really get after for not being in a stance I call it the rope and dope Jay Why is that because he looks like hes not engaged Then all of a sudden he throws a punch because he sprints into the passing lane or he gets a tipper deflection or he does that The play he just made at the rim The old Muhammad Ali his boozer lines up the three off the mark goes through his brothers Cadence hands Another empty possession there cheering Both of these teams have really cooled off in the second half Boston College nearing a 4minute scoring drought Payne trying to end it Didnt get a good look Kaden Boozer got to take it away Itll stay Duke Ball underneath her own hoop Camp Boozer comes out of the game Last time he was on the bench Gentleman Boston College put together their best spell musling it off the rim No good They like him in an isolation tonight and especially in the second half Its been one of the adjustments for John Shs offense when Gungas on the floor Boston College only four points in this second half really struggling against this Duke defense A lot of teams have particularly in ACC play and 4 seconds to shoot Finds Hastings to the floater falls Good touch Aiden Shaw excuse me And thats the first bucket for Boston College in 4 and 12 minutes Offensive foul Illegal screen called against Gunga Trying to set that hammer screen on the weak side Watch Gunga right here He steps right into the path of Stagger cheering The Boston College has played nine players All of them have scored Payne has 12 The next highest score is Taz with four Thats a travel First turnover of the night for Fred Payne So Duke a comfortable lead here 18 points in the second half but their last field goal was at the 1719 mark So nearing five minutes without a bucket How do they snap out of it particularly with Camboozer off the floor Well I think they got to go into some motion right here and move the ball And they like the Gunga matchup but looks like BC throw a little zone at him Nope They show zone still in man We might see some zone Harris a three No good And trying to split two Draws a foul Its a good skip over the top in transition by Fred Payne to get it to Donald Hand where he can attack quickly Its a really good take off the bounce to get to the free throw line Just the second trip to the free throw line in this game First of the second half cheering hand has that hitch during his free throws but if they go in thats all that matters Thursday after a double header right here on ACC Network nothing but net will tell you everything you need to know in the ACC on the womens side Looking forward to that Another great night double header right here on ACC Network followed by nothing but net Less than a month until the womens season wraps up and youll be doing the ACC tournament Womens tournaments going to Duth Georgia this year The guys will be in Charlotte The Duke women still undefeated in ACC play Yeah big game Thursday night Duke at Louisville Both teams undefeated on the womens side For first place good ball movement Amena foul shooting three And hell have three free throws when we come back as time as both teams being ranked Incredible And as Jay Bilis says every year and hes right it always delivers Hes right It does Of course last year Duke had the sweep but this year I think Carolina with their 174 record are going to pose some interesting situations for the Blue Devils over there in Chapel Hill Going to be about guard play cuz thats what it usually comes down to See youre being practical with the basketball So its about guard play I say its all about Boozer and Wilson two of the best in the nation going at it for the first time Thats definitely the headline you know when you get to the nittygritty of the game plan And Cam Boozer back on the floor Both times hes come out Duke has gone on a threeinut scoring drown And it has been a sloppy second half Duke has maintained the lead Both teams have turned it over already more in the second half than they did in the first And fade away rims in a tough shot a tough two but obviously hes a big part of the game plan slowing him down and he just takes what the defense gives him right there Hes really not forced a lot of shots but he hasnt had a lot of opportunities either Evans a deep three left it short Cam Boozer in attack mode Duke is on 6 and 12 minutes without a field goal Boozer trying to fix that He lost the handle Itll stay Blue Devils ball So strong and powerful His leverage is one of his advantages and you really cant speed him up That falls off the rim Second effort Darren Harris Thats his first basket of the night cheering Not a good sign for Boston College That was Dukes first basket in seven cheering attempts and yet the Eagles failed to close the lead Cap misfires So thats the opportunity Debbie to claw back He has made 14 on the season You got to be able to go inside out against Duke Usually Boozer will make you pay from there Shot clock ticks down to seven Kane a long way away from the rim Crosscourt pass Capy another three This time he hits it Good job by Fred Payne to stretch that trap and then throw it over the top Kapki showing a lot of confidence taking that three cheering Hes fouled all the way to the rim Fred Payne doing a really good job Watch him escape dribble Stretch that hedge and that trap which looks like a trap and then throw it over the top to Capki whos ready to catch and shoot When you can stretch that double or stretch that hedge out and and create some space and the trap and the h and they did Duke did not have high hands on that it gives you vision to the other side of the floor Coming up next our ACC Tuesday night double header continues in Charlottesville You can check out Ta Ritter in number music 18 Virginia hosting pit right after were done here in Durham Well Duke has cashed in at the free throw line 12 free throws out of 16 attempts And that helps when youre not making shots One of their last nine but BCs not shrunk the lead because of getting to the free throw line That corners been open Led to another three Steager couldnt knock it down Yeah good decision by Evans He thought about it but he can get that shot any time especially from that deep Hastings nothing he could do but foul Camboozer who had a head of steam there The other thing that Camboozer has is incredible hip mobility right He has great versatility Hes a strong powerful guy Not only is he just strong and power he has some elasticity to him as well And the way he moves its really impressive And when he drops that shoulder hes on guard Only two points of this second half for Boozer Give and go Nice Thats called a boomerang pass because you give it right back on a mismatch or an opportunity to score quickly Thats where his IQ is so good and he sees the game After a very highscoring first half where Duke put up 42 only 15 in this second half The scoring is very much slowed down Their defense has protected the lead though Jay you and I were texting with Carlos Boozer the dad cheering today about the passing ability the vision and I asked Carlos you know where did that come from As he picks up a foul at the rim he says you know he taught him that He taught him how to play through doubles He taught him how to watch film Watching film helps you understand how guys guard you And then he has this unselfish quality about him that makes him such an incredible winner I know how proud Carlos is of his son and I mean we talk about what a good passer he is but I wanted to know from Carlos why And he said his unselfishness is his favorite part of his sons game And its not just on the offensive end I think very unselfish on the defensive end as well Hell hell be there for help even if they dont need it And his recovery allows him to do that You got to really rep the schemes defensively and understand And of course Carlos understood all those and he shared some of those with Cam and Kaitton But its been an impressive year I cant imagine how proud Carlos must be watching his kids in this environment in a place that he you know grew up as well Two missed free throws sends Cameron crazy I hope the free subs applies to the broadcasters as well Duke a 17point lead Theyre in cruise control Well John Gaffne is over at the table for an announcement The previous challenge by Boston College has been successful Will be Boston College ball baseline They keep their challenge as well as their timeout Okay so Earl Grant successful coaches challenge BC ball Eagles trailing by 17 Duke has had a comfortable lead really since they started this game on an 11 nothing run The scoring has slowed down though Duke made 12 of their first 13 shots since eight of their last 27 Boston College just keeps coming up empty on the offensive end and cant close the gap Duke just one field goal since the 1719 mark So a full 10 minutes of game action cant connect on the three And usually Debbie one basket in 10 minutes youll lose a lead like this But credit the Duke defense for keeping them out of striking distance And on the season Jay according to Synergy he is just three for 12 on the entire season in the midrange So its baskets in the paint and its threepoint shots And then its his ability to facilitate offensively as a four assists per game passer And with that rebound he just grabbed his 11th double double of the season Hes been a double double machine throughout his freshman season Evans off the mark with the fewest points Duke has scored in any half this season is 31 They are tracking well below that Theyve only scored 15 in this second half Payne step back deep two goes begging when Capki got a piece of that Another one by Capki Nobody put a body on him This is a third opportunity for BC and Fred Payne cashes in When Duke is accelerating through their quarter court stuff they get open looks Boozer steps out for a three Cant connect and an offensive rebound and foul called Dongba being held on the inside Thats the fourth called against Capki So Duke is really having to grind this second half out Well they had the 4227 lead at halftime Just 1515 in this second half I dont think Earl Grants going to take Kafki out either I like it Leave him in You cut it to 15 Hes been a big part of protecting inside He just made two big plays on the offensive end with a couple of rebounds that he couldnt gather but he tapped them out One of two from the free throw line Payne was looking for it Foster got a handed away Shot clock down to three Aamod off the window and in for a deep three and answered prayer All youre trying to do is put a little game pressure on Duke right here If youre BC you get a couple of stops right here and then you get a couple of scores Can Boozer the immediate answer clear out oneonone dump it into the block Let Boozer go to work Im surprised we havent seen more of that in the second half Well they were trying to get Gumba going They went three times to him The first two of the second half possessions and lost the handle and thats a turnover Watch the work that Duke does with Boozer Here he is right here and everyone else goes this way Okay And takes the help away from the midline Now watch what Boozer does He says This is all mine right here Im getting to the midline And he does a nice job of finishing They go right back to Boozer and Kapis got four in attack mode Fading away Rolls off the rim No good Under four minutes remaining Duke a 15point lead Really where cheering its been throughout this second half Stop the basket And these guys work hard Sam and Chase and Frank and Jonathan and Nathan Just a couple of the guys we got to spend a little time with today and shoot around My favorite role is if youre a wiper Two guys under each hoop Whenever somebody goes down they are on the court so quick like you know a ball boy at the US Open I think they put a stopwatch on them sometimes And you you got your half of the court to midcourt line and the other guys got the other half And youre in the firing line too Chase told us whos a sophomore that Khan Caniple put an elbow in his face last year unintentionally Jaden Hastings almost did the same thing right there and he took 15 stitches Here they are in action Its a dangerous spot underneath the basket Thats Jackson right there Hes one of the wipers on the floor tonight They all have different roles They rotate Its a very wellorganized group thats for sure And these guys work and hustle just as hard it seems as the players on some days And you said multiround interview including a stress test And I I wanted to dig a little deeper but they were very tight lipped about it Well I think they they proposed certain instances that could happen in the game and how would you handle it So they got a scouter report also these guys I think one of the kids said Well what would you do if you lost Jod Shs bags And they said Well no no no were not talking about that Thats never going to happen Right Hastings at the line makes the first And Dukes not the only place everywhere we go around the ACC Of course great student managers Youre so good at talking to them during shoot around They open up right to you cheering And with that free throw Boston College is leading Duke in this second half 209 The Blue Devils started this game 11 nothing off tip Since then Boston College has just about played him even I love that John Shy late game here puts the ball in Boozers hands and lets him make a decision with it Almost a onehanded hammer from Malik Brown Just couldnt quite connect Capi fires the three Missed it Evans curling off a stagger Here he comes off a wide pin down Pull up top But Duke is getting good looks in this second half They just cant finish him But if Boston College were able to make more shots than they have in the second half this would be a very uncomfortable finish Hastings Yeah And Duke has led by double digits throughout this second half Last time BC had it the single digits was 2213 So despite the lack of offensive execution is a gets a layup there in the second half It has just remained a comfortable advantage Under two minutes to play Kapy he stayed out there with the four fouls going against Boozer Righty hook on the money Wait content to dribble down this clock Theyre running the same set this time The option is the screen across the lane for Boozer You run the stagger you run a curl and then you set a little cross screen in the lane and let Boozer catch it deep Hes got 19 and 11 Payne hes been the brightest spot for BC tonight Missed it there Shs the Subs back to the bench going to finish it out with this foster cheering Good take for two applause Coming up next our Tuesday night double header continues in Charlottesville with Pit and Virginia And now its Duke Carolina week and everyone can take a deep breath after this one and get ready to head over to Chapel Hill on Saturday night cheering Evans with the block applause and Duke can kill this clock You just said it Debbie Blue Devils take care of business against Boston College And now its all eyes on North Carolina for the 88th ranked matchup between the best rivalry in all of college basketball Boozer finishes with 19 and 12 Another double double cheering moving to 10 and0 and undefeated in ACC play
