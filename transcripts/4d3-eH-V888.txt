so it does go on Greg Elliott and a lot of Panther fans in the building thought he might have drawn the charge keep in mind you got to be outside of that line do you even own that line theyre going to call it a block and fall every single time Applause Music what do you think Julius yeah I mean oh he kind of leaned in a little bit yes it looked like he was outside the restricted area but as you said might have lean just a bit too much Simon goes one of two at the line Panthers working quickly the other way jamarius Burton finds Nelly Cummings kicks out Burton Burton reset three ball Elliott contact no call on the shot Greg Elliott wanted a call and Federico on the glass Applause UT Martin head coach is Ryan Ritter in his second season Skyhawks selected to finish third in the ovc preseason poll and when you have a tandem that consists of the ovc preseason Player of the Year in addition to a guy like Parker Stewart who of course played for Indiana last season that makes for a really really talented Duo to lead this Skyhawk team Julius absolutely all he need to do is you know make sure his team is Battle tested and playing against the ACC team on a roll for the first the opening game of the season this is one of those things you have to do to make sure your team get better so the officials having a conversation about that previous play and all of a sudden Applause Panthers are getting back on defense so Julius will have to get an explanation here and were hearing a technical foul on Greg Elliott mentioned that he was not pleased that he did not receive a foul call on his threepoint attempt and so Parker Stewart Applause capitalizes on the tech and suddenly just like that its 22 after Stewart hits the technical foul free throw Panthers not happy about it but they keep playing back in action after the pause 22 1720 left in this first half Stewart three from the corner too much weak side rebound Burton Applause Burton Drive find it cutting Elliott down low Elliott pump fake tries again tip down ends up in the hands of Desmond Williams Applause Simon step back offensive foul theres other ways to get yourself involved in the game shot not falling get a solid possession of Defense Elliott III did it there yeah you got to get up into them sell it a little bit oh yes Laughter you know when they give you that little nudge right there you know you got to learn how to sell it yeah absolutely you did it yourself no not me not me I didnt I never thought I would get those Applause Cummings lost the handle went out of bounds UT Martin will take over wheres Nelly Cummings another big addition for the Panthers played last season at Colgate a lot of fans might remember him from that first round performance he had against Wisconsin he had 20 points against the Badgers in the round of 64 the NCAA tournament last season pull up jumper Jeffries no rebound Federico a wingspan tap that thing to himself Federico at six foot eleven sophomore from Finland Elliott Corner three short chase down by Williams Up Tempo game so far in the feet trying to shake Henson all fake spinning in the lane trying to find Nicks down low it goes out of bounds four

Nelly Cummings Julius he found his way to Pittsburgh its great to have him back you know he played at the PowerHouse Lincoln Park as you can see in that in that footage right there Mom Dukes was loving this Im sure shes loving it even more right now Nellies father there in attendance here tonight in his first official game as a member of the pit Panthers and just a really special and unique experience for a guy who grew up training in this building with the likes of Brandon Knight Sam young and Jeff Campbells really glad to have him because hes a guy who knows the spirit of this program and how to get it back to what it was like when you were here Julius absolutely you know this guy I mean its always good to play in front of your family especially for your home time so Im sure hes excited about that and hopefully he can be a part of turning this program around now and right on cue in alleyoop to Federico Federico Cummings to Federico connection so nice you had to name him twice dont see that too often huh Julius Applause Music 10 on the clock for UTM Music Jeffries weak side corner triple Off the Mark rebound Hinson already four boards for Blake Henson tonight I think the advantages for the Panthers is around the basket they were settling for the threes early on I think coach cable drew that up lets get to the basket make something happen Music now called on Parker Stewart Applause how about this hoop Julius yeah get in the paint throw it up to you guys want to make a play and more UK Partners number 22 so thatll go down as Nelly Cummings first assist in an official game as a pit panther got to give credit to Nelly you know being aggressive getting all the way into the paint making Federico you know guy drift over to him as we opened that up to team Martin left a wide open yamarus Burton in the corner theres Nelly long on his threepoint attempt Panthers to start tonight oh of six from downtown Music this is the end that it comes down to though Stewart pull up three in the eye of Hinson Off the Mark rebound from Cummings Music Burton spins Williams comes up with the ball finds Stewart Stewart in transition finishes beautiful move with the euro Applause Parker Stewart played last season at Indiana of course started his career here at Pitt back where it all started the graduate student from Union City Tennessee dumped down low Federico the slam cleaning it in there for the Panthers thats where you have the advantage work it inside out Applause a freeze working on Cummings Cummings hit the deck no foul called rebound Federico were calling his name a lot Julius thats a good thing Applause Music Burton called for a travel in the short Corner hes not happy with the ruling Music so you want to see Pitt attack the basket thats the key through the first seven minutes yeah I think they shot the ball so well during the exhibition that they just thought they were the Golden State Warriors you know when you have the size Advantage which you usually do when youre playing a smaller school you want to feed it in there feed it in there until your big guys take advantage of that and then get let the oak the threepoint line open up for you Applause both teams are combined o of 10 from threepoint range to start this game mentioned hit 06 Tennessee Martin is 04 Parker Stewart with five quick points in this one Cummings Cross Court sebandi he fires up a three and foul on the rebound will go against rifen Miguel that was Guillermo Diaz Graham drawing the fountain Music Gail looked like he he should have a helmet or shoulder pads on if you ask me he sure does doesnt he yes sir thats a big boy right there Rife and McGill all of six foot eight senior from Angola 240 pound forward a senior for UT Martin Diaz Graham thought about the three kicks out Nate Santos not that time a good its a good play when you have a guy six six eleven seven foot everyone and kick it out for three though Stuart working in the paint turn around tip chance foul called against the Skyhawks what do you think Julius would you back down him in the post no Ill have to bring him out here on the wing they can play my game you know see what his footwork is looking like you can still jump over oh still you said still is that insane without you do it right now not at all I cant jump over a broom these days come on I wish at least not without feeling like sore my entire body being sorted next day Applause Music eight minutes in here opening night of the season for Pitt and Tennessee Martinelli Cummings to rafale on the floor and its going to go against Jordan Sears Music that was good solid defense he just you know got a little too physical but great intensity got a little carried away Julius thats now the seventh foul on UT Martin so important for the Panthers just eight minutes into this half theyre in the 11 gotta knock him down Applause in the past being in a one and one with 12 minutes left Im not sure if it would still benefit us hopefully you know this squad is a little different Nelly Cummings 82 free throw shooter last season thats both of them Music Julius to your point hit second to last in the ACC and free throw percentage a season to go but not the case for Nelly sinks both foul shots puts Pitt back up too Stewart with five points to his name already on the ninth Nicks driving on Guillermo Hinson lunges up for the rebound Music Applause Music I would love to see Nike sabandi get the ball get a little bunny get his legs up under him Vincent steps back can he get the roll yes first three in the ball game in the first three of the season for Pitt goes to Blake Henson Applause hello sabandi got a finger on it Panthers moving quickly the other way Santos Burton will set the offense uses a screen from Guillermo dishes out to him for the three Off the Mark Henson strives for the rebound Blake Henson with six boards already tonight zabandi cross in the step back rim another rebound Panthers that time Guillermo taken away by Stewart Applause Music they work spinning the lane foul hell head to the line after we take a break just over 10 and a half to go in the first half feels great to have basketball back here in Pittsburgh bye for Parker Stewart who started his collegiate career here at the University of Pittsburgh spent the 201718 season with the Panthers and set an alltime freshman record for a threepoint field goals made spent that lone season with the University of Pittsburgh and spent time at UT Martin going there the next season did not play because of transfer rules but then the following year 192 points a game finished his career at Indiana last year played in the NCAA tournament for the Hoosiers and of course Julius his Collegiate Journey can be defined by resilience in the face of adversity heading into that season in 2020 his father Anthony Stewart suddenly passed away just before the season was about to begin Parker took that year off came back played a great season at Indiana and then decided coming into this year that UT Martin was where he wanted to be yeah hes one guy you know the Panthers cant let get going but Im sure hes playing with a lot on his mind he wants to have a good year and you know I wish him nothing but the best you see there the tweet from Parker in April when he announced his decision to come back to UT Martin for his final season in college as Vincent hits another 34 the Panthers but marker Stewart his father Anthony the longtime head coach at UT Martin of course having to overcome the challenge of Anthonys passing right before the season but really an inspirational story by Parker Stewart to come back and said one of the biggest reasons for him coming back here to UT Martin was to help fulfill his dads Legacy Music Family Ties I think some of his siblings graduated from there as well so you know I think hes doing the right thing hes doing the right thing so far tonight hes got seven points seven of the eight for Tennessee Martin 10 minutes into this first half Applause offensive foul drawn by Blake Henson for pip gotta love those plays Applause turnover and a foul at the same time Henson is active get there set his feet take it like a man hes out of control gotta be under control and jump stop or shoot a little pull up he doesnt look like he hasnt played in two years Julius maybe thats why he hasnt played hes well rested fresh legs no rush from Blake Epstein we spent the last two years at Iowa State but did not play since the 20192020 season at Ole Miss hes Blended right in here for Pitt with eight points you know what three ball no good for UT Martin when you dont play for a while you appreciate the game you miss it so when you get back you have a lot of energy you play with passion because you know what it feels like to not play at all insane trying for his third three of the game that time back rim offensive board Federico other corner for Elliot swirls in for three Music Jeff Capel was proud of the way he improved their threepoint shooting this off season and were seeing the rewards right here tonight the Panthers have now jumped out to a 10point lead here at the P nine minutes to go first half Panthers 188 well Panthers went out and got some Shooters in the transfer portal now Pittsburgh on an 80 run gotta use those threepoint Shooters when you got him heres Greg Elliott and it starts with Federico getting a rebound kicking it out moving a ball being unselfish kick it to the shooter in the corner Its gotta feel good for Elliott who had missed his first three from the field today gets one to drop there and theres up 10 finding their rhythm 80 run in the last minute and a half foreign back in the game with two foul series yeah well they got a 10 10 point 12 point lead they have to uh you know get their guy back in there to get it going Applause Ryan Ritter has two Skyhawks with a pair of fouls Rife and Miguel in addition to KJ Simon each with two TM needs their star on the court heres Cummings for three rebound Curry transition takes it himself shoulders into Hinson gets it to drop better finish to the contact be strong when you get down there Burton quickly the other direction foul and thats when hes at his best putting the ball on the floor attacking the basket hes very crafty got a nice handle jamarius Burton will head to the line one of the best free throw shooters in the ACC last year his 88 percent was second in the conference hes a key returner for this pit team alongside John hugely again who they hope to have back for Fridays game against West Virginia but its for Julius is one of two teams in the conference I love to stand two teams in the conference that have at least two guys coming back with at least 12 points a game its just them in North Carolina yeah when you put that guy Huguley and Burton to pick and roll surrounded by Elliot and Alexa Henson its going to be really difficult to to defend his team because what are you gonna do you have to pick your poison can you help on do you help on hugely help on Burton get to the basket if you do they have Shooters now but anytime you compare it to one of the Blue Bloods thats a good news theres the list returners in the ACC who scored 12 a game a season ago three from the Tar Heels on there two from the Panthers Elliott pump fake hes called for a travel so Panthers turn it over but they do have a nine point lead 752 to play in the first half in Pittsburgh its capable he said Jorge was more of a wing out of the twins let me tell you something Panther fans when you have a six foot eleven player that can defend the wing push it head up and make the pass your future is bright dont wait until the until next year and the year after to start buying your tickets you need to buy them now because this can happen with the blink of an eye you have to take them you have two guys six foot and 11 and above that have skill youre gonna be there in no time and Julius we talk so much about the transfers but lets keep in mind those two are freshmen twins from Spain both right around seven feet tall and thats a luxury for Jeff Capel and the Panthers Im not gonna jump the gun but the last time I saw a guy from Spain at that age doing those things his name was Pau Gasol uhoh I saw with my own eyes in high school I think pit fans would be more than happy if these two ended up anything like Powell or his brother all right Applause seven point lead for the Panthers Parker Stewart working on Jorge Diaz Graham offensive foul and there he is again sliding his feet contesting the shot moving in front of him drawing the foul come on this is 6 11 we talking about here this is 6 11 we talking about here ladies and gentlemen and he come on hes from Europe you know hes good at doing that you know hes great at doing that look at him laughing it off hes happy thats a versatile flare right there Julius yes sir so that gives Parker Stewart two fouls now so he and Simon both with a pair as Greg Elliott Nails the triple Applause thats what he does how important is it for the Panthers to take advantage of this time with Stewart and Simon Beaufort with two fouls you have to wonder you know they can over over Play Store they cant be as aggressive the way that pit is playing defense taking charges so you know its always in the back of your mind I was Rife and Miguel midrange jumper good Music Applause its a solid Spring by Federico finds him on the roll called Federico Federico will head to the line Applause Panthers in the double bonus screen and roll action Cummings able to find a shooter Applause wanna Help win a big rolling when Federico is the presence is going to open it up for Ellie and other Shooters if you want to take away the shooters then Federico is going to be open rolling to the basket so you pretty much have to pick your poison its tough to do when you have an inside outside presence Music Federicos been very active so far tonight for good and Julies have to remember that if John Hughley were healthy he probably wouldnt have even found himself in the starting lineup but hes been so key for pits so far yes the gift and the curse you know some guys step up in an absence of some of your star players and is working out and now that this goes to show you how deep the front court for these Panthers are going to be originally from Finland spent last season at Northern Oklahoma again filling in for John hugley tonight expect hugley to be back hopefully on Friday for the Panthers and Federico making his minutes count ing dumped down low blocked away Panthers come up with it Cummings pull up Federico missed the jam place would have erupted if he hit that Julius absolutely they were already ready to go dont blame him were excited too block here hes off man his wingspan is crazy then he runs the floor very well catches the ball it just got away from him but everything else is great you know contestant on one side run the floor receive it on a run and so all of a sudden Pittsburgh with their second technical foul of the night and that one is on Federico for hanging on the rim so two Ts tonight for Pitt Parker Stewart missed the free throw that time but all going to go over to UT Martin and panther crowd in attendance not pleased with two technical fouls in this first half Applause its gonna be a tough decision who do you sit down Henson Federico both playing well obviously googly is going to be in there but its going to be a tough for Buffalo and playing so well Jeffries pull up three no good Skyhawks have still yet to nail a triple so far tonight Jeffries takes a pullup and he got him Applause Toby Jeffries average just over six a game last season was the only player on the team to start every game Music Burton Cross Court open Greg Elliott three ball no Federico trying to tip the rebound to himself but Parker Stewart and jump with it for the Skyhawks he goes over to Sears Sears drives into Federico rebound by the sophomore Cummings Full Speed Ahead hits in for two and one count the basket for Blake Henson Applause big guys is running the floor and getting rewarded better rewards with big man push the ball up the floor when your big guys is running you got to reward them theyll keep running for you Music lincolnson he shined in the exhibitions for Pitt and hes been the leader tonight 10 points on 47 shooting along with six boards Music Applause Music Applause Music you sent it Julia six boards a piece for Henson and Federico theyre also the two top scorers for bits so far tonight 11 for Henson seven for Federico heres the line for the Junior and the State of Florida started his collegiate career at Ole Miss playing with a lot of energy he sure is isnt he its contagious at least hes talking its a good teammate hasnt left the floor yet cuts inside working down low spins away finds Cummings Cummings a little step back got him unselfish play there by Henson also a lot of big guys is going to force that up so close to the basket let me go ahead and get this one up you know if you give it up hell get it back so you know it makes it makes him unselfish Four Points five dimes for Nellie Cummings Music he said Andy finds Hinson he wants another three ball not that time rebound last off UT Martin after the break itll be Pittsburgh ball they lead by 12 Applause well lets give a warm welcome back to Nike sabandi who takes the floor tonight for the first time since tearing his ACL in an exhibition game just over a year ago on this floor its a guy who shined at Miami of Ohio before transferring over to Pitt and Julius Jeff Campbell said he was set for a really great season a year ago and it was such a shame to see him go down but he is back and eager for the opportunity this year you had to do my homework and saw some YouTube videos and some footage of him and I was really excited to get him unfortunately he got injured he just started really you know practicing that full of strength a few weeks ago so its going to take him you know a little bit of time to immensely get it get back to the form that he was before the injury and he really really finished that previous season off well in 2020 and 21 averaging over 15 points a game across the final five games of that season as a player that dealt with an injury that was you know took a while for me to recover from I know how mentally you know thats the hardest part is mentally to get back doing the things that youre doing before them and Jeff Capel mentioned that as well said Nikes an elite level athlete and when you go through an injury like that there are bound to be moments when you question if youre going to become the player that you were before the injury and for Nike sabandi hes just grateful for the opportunity to come back out here for this pit team in this season well be fine stay out of stand away stay in the gym a little bit at a time well be back before you know it so Dandy had 14 points in the exhibition on Wednesday last week Applause Josh Endicott shooting for UT Martin Skyhawks have not scored in over two minutes Applause High screen and roll has been working for the Panthers and Andy drives into traffic rebound Diaz Graham foul called and thatll go against the Skyhawks looks like its on Jordan Sears Music thatll be his second Applause strong move nice follow you know it was a time when we were always complaining how come we cant get these trees these six eleven seven feet guys and I feel like we got three of them it felt like years ago we couldnt get one of them did you ever play with Aaron gray was he after you he was a freshman when I was a senior there you go you have one of them that wasnt Aaron gray you know I mean he had Aaron gray skill we knew he was going to become Aaron Gray but once he you know came on he was a totally different player by the time he finished his career Music his heart is Aaron gray did theyll be NBA players for sure body for it offensive foul again on UT Martin Applause Music Panthers enjoying a six nothing run so far Music jamarius Burton threw this one its tough not only do you get to contest on a block but you got a guy taking a shower just good defense Music Mandy out to Hinson hes got a hot hand not that time jamarius goes up strong for the board the guard with the rebound in the putback the big man move right there Burton at six foot four climbing up Applause down low Endicott and one Music foreign cant get a rebound he got up there got a running start is that advantage Music now the good thing about the twins is because their their ability to their footwork and ability to slide when they get in a pick and roll and have to hedge theyre so good at doing it because theyre already used to to defending on the wing Music so Mandy kicked to Burton jamarius for three got it Applause jamarius Burton with six points two of five from the field Panthers lead has climbed to 15 Stewarts triple no offensive rebound Curry kicks out Jeffries comes up with a kicks outside Desmond Williams that ones good Applause first points of the day for Williams Al Burton Panthers operating quickly on the other end sabandi he takes a three theres a Swoosh Applause Music the answer Applause if youd see Martin could have got a stop there had a chance to get it under 10 Applause Oakland Zoo is loving this first half in Pittsburgh Panthers up 15 driving a nice finish by Jeffries to quiet the crowd for now Music timeout taken by Jeff Capel first half almost to a close pit up by 13 where can you go for the latest musthaves and every seasons nice to have where can you get that perfect gift for Dad and hot cocoa mustaches for the kids where can you lose track of time or while saving time at the same time lows actually Applause the best place to get everything you need for the holidays Music well both teams struggled early from Beyond The Arc but now finding their stroke from threepoint range Tennessee Martin had one from Desmond Williams and the Panthers respond with Nike sbandi nice job jab step get them to lean just a little bit I saw some Bandy needed doesnt feel like it but the Panthers shooting just 24 from threepoint range in this game five of 21 so theyve taken a lot of threes but improved over the course of the last few minutes to stretch this lead to 13 six second difference between shot and game clock Cummings drives kicks pass intercepted Stewart with seven ticks left gets his eyes on the clock heads left looking Cross Court nobody there Applause somebody should be there though thats the thing automatically you should know somebody is going to be there nine tenths for Pitts abandy fires one up almost at it but the fifth Panthers with an impressive first half showing here at the P the return of college basketball in Pittsburgh being led by Blake Hensons 11 points Federico Federico at seven and the Panthers are up by 13 start going to the best and getting some bunnies they open up for the three but they shouldnt rely on it anyway you know they have the height Advantage keep attacking keep getting to the basket Burger King attack off the dribble is gonna open up lanes for Federico and hence in the finish so important to note as well that the Skyhawks are in some foul trouble Parker Stewart with two KJ Simon with two rifen Miguel and Jordan Sears each with three apiece the Panthers got into bonus just about eight minutes into that first half Elliott step back three got it Music Applause five Tennessee Martin Skyhawks with at least two fouls just after halftime Applause some confusion as to who that went off last initially was ruled Pitbull but call overturned gonna go to the Skyhawks T Martin got to get Simon involved early gotta get him involved early its their best player Applause Music hello Knicks Applause today 14 point margin Applause Music Cummings takes the three balls Off the Mark Applause AJ Simon transition offensive jamarius Burton draws it for Pitt got there on time he anticipated thats great d right there at the same time if Im Simon Im not really mad because hes trying to get it going the last thing he want to do is Jack up jump shots hes trying to move look at this strain from Glade Hinson Powers his way through the paint for the two hes got 13 foreign Applause I gotta leave KJ out on the floor Williams three ball off front rim jamarius Burton transition game over to Cummings Cummings tripled got an end one coming from downtown Applause lets be clear Cummings Henson Elliott and Federico are all new players and they play like theyve been playing four years together already experience of the big panther roster on full display 19 point lead for the blue and gold Music okay kids so heres the thing the first thing you want to do is secure the rebound solid defense secure the rebound get it to your guard push the ball up the floor the best time to shoot the three is in transition so if your coach is telling you thats a bad shot hes wrong as Rick Pitino asks all the coaches that made a living because of that threepoint line right there Cummings completes the impressive fourpoint play hes got eight points splash Applause Panther lead has ballooned to 20 points the opening night of the season Applause Music Falcon Blake Henson for Julius Panthers certainly enjoying this season opener more than their last two of course last year went down to the Citadel previous year lost to Saint Francis on this floor and very different story here this season Applause Music experienced a lot to play the game and obviously they love to play together how they support each other and share the basketball talk to each other you would have thought that this this crew right here have been together for three four years already Williams tipped Away by Elliott UT Martin came up with it KJ Simon scooped it up and got the two Applause thank you Burton quickly penetrates other way kicks out Elliott for three oh yeah Applause third triple of the game for Greg Elliott back door cut by Simon tipped down to play by the Panthers Elliott created that entire Place set a screen for Burton Burton got in he spaced the floor wide open for three coach Capel said you know this kid knows what hes doing he you know what he does well you know he doesnt he knows what he doesnt do do well and he sticks to it you know he doesnt do too much what more can you ask for a player yeah he said the Simplicity is the beauty in Greg Elliotts game and here he is now Burton down low Henson acrobatic attempt Skyhawks transition Stewart down low Simon finishes through contact Applause you know the other thing he brought about Elliot is his energy and his attitude hes a positive kid he said it rubs off when everybody you know you put him in Henson in another room together I dont see how you cannot play with a lot of confidence Burton takes the three offback rim and over Applause gotta get you a bunny those are the ones the lid off the basket AJ Simon has had a quiet night but he scored his four quick ones for the Skyhawks over the last couple possessions and a foul here is going to go on Chris Nix in the backcourt Music KJ Simon OBC preseason Player of the Year averaged 169 points a game a season ago trying to wheel his Skyhawks to a second half comeback against Jeff Caples Panthers who have looked Mighty impressive on night one one stop at a time youre gonna give yourself a chance you got to do it on a defensive event cant trade basket for three no now between Stewart and Simon but not to get it going Applause Stewarts pullup is good Parker Stewart his return to the Peterson Events Center hes got nine points Cross Court hits him one more over to Burton Burton goes Baseline kicks outside Nelly for three back rim no good rebound Williams Nelly tried to poke it away and he gets a foul called take us to a break 17 point lead for Pittsburgh 1527 to go in this one from the beat and Jason Capel here for the Pitt Panthers look at the synchronous nature there of these two Julius making the same exact motion yeah come on they look like brothers you think the only Brothers they missed this you or me Jason I forgot Jason and Julius come on were our throwback picture at we gotta dig that one up Laughter its a lefty the strong move finish through the contact Applause Music okay you team Martin you want to cut a ten by the 10 minute mark hints in the put back hes got 15 is that the goal Julius ten about a 10 minute mark but youre not gonna do it giving up offensive rebounds around a basket like that door God Simon blocked at The Rim by Hinson gonna be called a jump ball and thatll stay with this guy Hawks on this end you can start to see KJ Simon getting more involved here in this second half Julius yes sir youre gonna need them lean score all everything he had a tough first half but you know Applause trials and tribulations you got to learn how to get over them Desmond Williams triple connects Music engine in Stewart with a little bit extra Stewarts shoving both teams going at it officials have to step in the way ugly scene at Mid Court foreign thats the end of it Applause chippy Applause Music Applause Julius to me just looked like a couple guys that got tangled up well you know Henson got a block jump ball he gave him a little tumble finger you know were not with the towel now here so you know theyre down there battling tangled up Music Applause you got to keep your cool but its a lot of trickery going on in the interview they know how to lock arms and hold you in there so believe it or not you know this is both of them yeah you see him running back up the floor Henson trying to look as innocent as he can but maybe locking down that arm of Parker Stewart and of course Stewart was not happy about that and so officials now taking some time to review all involved in that incidence stemming from Blake Henson and Parker Stewart solving competition Music love to see you guys getting after it especially if youre down on a roll you got to play with a chip so you know you cant just let these guys try to punk you off so you know what are you gonna do and maybe a little bit of frustration setting in from UT Martin trailing by 14 however they have started to put together a little run here in the second half so youd hate to see Parker Stewart affected by that altercation at midcourse Skyhawks have made four of their last five field goals starting to get on a little bit of an offensive roll but can they keep clear of their emotions getting the best of them here in the second half I know Elliott got attacked in the first in the first half I believe the Panthers had two do you remember was it Hinson I got the other one yeah Greg Elliott Elliot got one who was Hinson he better be careful whomever you know you cant had a pile up get the referees throwing technical fouls around because if its one of those guys who already have one theyre gonna be disqualified foreign Applause the scuffles you know you never hold your own players back certain things you just dont do when we start getting into it like that Applause Julius to answer your question it was Federico Federico for hanging on the rim that got that other Tech in the first half for Pitt so for Henson of course dont want to add another attack but he hasnt gotten one so far tonight Applause Parker Stewart on the night with two fouls personal Blake Henson with one personal so far in this one the easy thing to do is to give them both a technical foul I dont think it was really clear or who instigated what I think both players were just playing hard and got carried away sure officials Tonight Tony Henderson Trace Downs Claire Aubry taking a look and well have one more look ourselves so you see Nelly bumping Stuart late Stewart retaliates Blake Henson meanwhile hes going over to the Oakland Zoo oh the push on Cummings wasnt necessary so that you know thats one thing so I think you have to give Stewart a technical for just pushing Cummins I dont think he can throw Henson to the ground that easily so Im gonna say that was more of an acting job on Ensign yeah oddly enough Hinson doesnt really ever show retaliation its Cummings that comes in and continues to scuffle at Mid Court Applause Music so I would think if there are two players that are charged in this it would be most likely Parker Stewart and Nelly Cummings but Julius will just have to wait and see I think its the best you can do as a double deck foreign competition I dont really see anything that malicious to eject the player I mean I dont understand but this is why I dont have the striped shirt on yeah lucky thats not our job huh because I would have just let it all go Music Applause Applause oh Applause well continue to await the ruling here Julius I dont think it was the tangle between Henson and and Stuart I think it was more of Cummings walking past Stewart and him pushing him and how to handle that situation Applause that would still just be a technical foul that would still be one in my book I still I wouldnt I wouldnt give him a check for the situation with him and Henson that guy shes getting tangled it happens all the time Music Applause in the pit Panthers just want to keep this game going theyve got all the momentum in the second half theyve got a 14point lead Applause they want to resume play Applause in that long last now the officials meeting with UT Martin head coach Ryan Reeder Music so you see Blake hinston he was just announced in the venue here as having picked up a flugger foul on the play Applause ground Stewart was called for a flagrant as well foreign and so Parker Stewart is actually going to be ejected from this basketball game Applause Music as we still begin to sort out what happened here on this midcourt scuffle Parker Stewart is not happy but thats going to end his night and then his trip back to Pittsburgh Applause Music Applause and so weve got an official coming over to give us a word Applause Music all right so thanks to our official for coming over and explaining Parker Stewart picked up two Flagger ones on the play he has been ejected from the game and for Pitt Nelly Cummings and Blake Henson getting called for flagrant ones themselves so thats how it all sorts out Julius two flagrant ones on separate Panthers but Parker Stewart picks up two flagrant one fouls on his own and gets ejected from this game Music Applause Music Applause and after all of that we resume play in the second half here at the Peterson Events Center Applause lots of emotion on this opening night of college basketball Nelly Cummings finds Federico on the road good for Pitt

on the previous play Panther bench loving it you said it Julius John hugleys got to be excited to get out there on the floor with this team yeah they got a great rotation Hughley Federico twins can play some down there its five thats a fiveman rotation an important to mention too the Panthers without will Jeffress tonight and when we talked to Jeff cable he said so much conversation about not having John Hughley but to him will Jeffers has been really important as well said hes improved a lot in the off season prior to suffering a foot injury and when they get him back thats going to be another key piece to have hes very athletic I think defensively and rebounding his his really good skill set I think its going to relieve some some pressure off him in the previous years a lot of people was putting pressure on him to sport a basketball I think on this on this team right here he wont have to focus on that he can just do what he does well foreign Music range Off the Mark bouncy Santa play just under eight minutes to go in this season opening game when we come back well tell you a little bit more about the Diaz Graham twins debut game for Guillermo Diaz Graham and his twin

throughout this college basketball season for Jorge and Guillermo both played at IMG Academy originally from Canary Island Spain and Julius we were talking earlier about the luxury it is to have a pair of seven foot twins on your roster yeah yeah especially ones that skill can put the ball on the floor shoot the basketball defend thats a blessing Applause tonight have made an impact in a

tournaments in the last three years Julius of course mentioned earlier that he starred in their Tournament game against Wisconsin a season ago really made his presence felt on a national scale and Jeff Capel wasted no time in finding Nelly in the transfer portal and bringing him back to his hometown here at the University of Pittsburgh he had the alerts next to his name so as soon as he entered he got a notification so he knew right away first team on Patriot last season averaging nearly 15 points a game now tonight with the Panthers eight points and seven assists for Cummings Music and most importantly a 29point lead heres a drive into contact goes Jordan Sears and a strong finish very strong he got up there foreign Cummings left open for a triple rims out Santos flew in for the rebound but KJ Simon comes up with him Simon Music hits the deck and hes called for a travel Applause trying to make something happen frustrated trying to force the issue foul trouble just hasnt been going his way today and he lost his teammate Parker Stewart who was ejected from this game earlier in the second half and Julius you noted earlier different story when youve got Simon out on the floor

of the night for the Pitt Panthers led by Blake Hensons 27 points in his University of Pittsburgh debut and what stands out to me Julius the top four scores for Pitt tonight all new to the roster how many times do you see that happen at a university times are changing unless everybodys a freshman thats newcomer but how many veteran flares come right in and have this kind of chemistry this is this is just abnormal you said it earlier though Jeff cable went out and did his work in the transfer portal well that was the big question you know is this you know on paper they had Talent they had experience but how is this team going to jail um right away I guess the experience is the answer give me experienced players and theyll figure it out Jeff Gable told us he has nine scholarship guys that are healthy and can play and keep in mind that that does not include John hugley and will Jeffress who they hope to have back in the near future theyre hoping Hughley is back Friday against West Virginia but this is the most experienced roster that Jeff Capel has had in his fifth season only 17 players in the conference have 75 or more starts Pitts got three of them on their roster in jamarius Burton Nellie Cummings in Nike savandy Music and we didnt talk about William Jeffers enough you know imagine when he gets healthy hed come back shes going to have more depth at the backcourt position its all about experience in college basketball Panthers have a lot of depth in that area this season Guillermo finds his brother Jorge for three Off the Mark sabande fighting for the rebound Nike so Bandy comes up with it kicks out Santos no good Nike sabandi still fighting for the basketball comes up with it again Marshall the runner finally no Panthers with another offensive board

all Spirits are going to be high fans are going to be excited Applause the last thing you want to do is have a letdown going into that game so hopefully everybody show up and show out Music eating fish into the game another local kid from Murrysville PA went to Franklin Regional High School former team manager found his way onto the roster hes enjoying these minutes theres a block by Jorge no soup for to you Applause Laughter oh wanted another one another one were counting that when you need them enjoys you know its its just the first game of the season but tough to remember the last time there was this much life in this building yeah its been a while its been a while you know a lot of unfortunate things happening on and off the court but you know you got to leave those things in the past and just build on what you have now and the panther fans you know you gotta you got a bright future Applause Panther bench having some fun Oakland Zoo enjoying it Music Pittsburgh on their way to a 10 start the first time since the 20192020 season Applause Jordan Sears connects on the triple Panthers still pushing Applause hes strong Sears I think need to be more aggressive you know coming into this game wasnt talking a lot about him but just looking at his style he could knock down the three he can get to the basket hes very strong I feel if he you know gets more aggressive out of the Season go on hes going to his team you know a lot of Justice Applause Sears on the night with seven points on two of eight shooting 81 shooter from the line in his career misses the front end of two Music Applause Music Applause Music oh well Applause foreign Santos three Off the Mark Music I thought the big fella was calling for onball screen oh wait a second uh oh we saw him dribbling it earlier you showed he can do it but if he was going to show us he could run a pick and roll it better be sold out for the rest of the season thats a whole new day Music me tell you something if that young fella was calling for a pick and roll and ran a pick and roll I was about to say Kevin Durant right now yall these fans are excited enough Julius Music stuff on the bridge for a moment tough to not get excited though if youre a pit fan for sure UT Martin gonna have to keep it together they got Youngstown State coming up Wednesday short break gotta prepare put this one behind you we dont have time to hang yet Music gotta have a shortterm memory heres the twin connection on display nearly resulted in a two for Jorge Music Applause shortterm memory the key for the Skyhawks Panthers meanwhile will be doing whatever they can to carry this performance into Friday as Jorge Diaz Graham adds another block to his night and Jorge gave it a little finger Wang hes gonna get called for a technical so the Panthers with a 24point lead a successful night lets follow another technical calm look at him slide his feet stay in front its gonna be tough the ability to stick with the guy hes going to take away the floater to pull up good luck so I think thats the look of a guy whos been teed up in a 24point game with 10 seconds left you know I think thats by default anytime you raise your finger at the player you think so yeah I think they even did away with that in the NBA score here from Pittsburgh as the Panthers are 10 Julius Music solid performance Henson came in play very good game but even for them shortterm memory because you got the Mountaineers coming in on Friday so for Julius page our tremendous ACC Network crew producer Sarah maculan director Kevin wheeler Music
