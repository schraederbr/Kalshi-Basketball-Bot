you got to go back to Tucson 1997 NCAA tournament second round Stanford beats wake and what would be Tim Duncans last game as a demon Deacon Duncan was absolutely fantastic H that one two more on that later oh we got a little forgot to start the clock off the game clock here we got dun 18 points 20 boards in that one maybe the clock operator needed to hear it in French as well Music Stanford will control it is a team coming off backtoback home wins last week against Virginia Tech and Virginia theyre looking for their first ACC Road win they have not won on the East Coast so far losses at Clemson and pit got here on Monday theyll stay here all week with a game at North Carolina on Saturday looking for raino comes back out to the Duke transfer Jaylen Blakes here is raino 42 in red maneuvering on Fon Reed the soft touch and as advertised and as you see you know ability to put the ball on the floor spin move ID dextrous uh really good and shooting the ball with both hands around the basket inside that pained area Reeds got his work cut out front and Reed must stay out of foul trouble Tyler Johnson making his fourth straight start at point guard for Wake Demon Deacons three and0 with him as a starter Salis one of the top scores in the ACC and youve got hildr who had 31 last time out against Miami ran agall knocks down the three theyve been waiting for that threepoint shot to come around oah sellers the USC transfer 52 from deep in conference and then of course you got Reno and Donovan Young The Freshman making his second straight start Fon Reed great position down low and draws the foul on the red shirt sophomore uger wall well the start thats Stanford w at least on their first couple possessions exactly what they the bucket inside and then get out and transition and knock down a triple this team outscores opponents by over five uh per in the first half so they need a fast start because they dont finish as well as they start first two possessions were absolutely fantastic Aton Reed gets the first for Reed simple for him hes got to stay on the floor and avoid the silly fouls it is and and its its not the fouls when youre challenging the Big Fellas underneath they going for an offensive rebound he gets in trouble uh fouls 80 feet away from some playing defense and uh it puts a lot of pressure on on Wake then to have a big body and a big presence inside look at wake picking up full court pressure here yeah thats going to be something to watch wake wants to play fast they want to play with some Tempo thats going to to test the Stanford team which doesnt have a ton of depth well we had a chance to speak with coach before the game and he says that they they lack a lot of depth they how to get it from their starts Blakes the three he knocks it down how about Jaylen Blakes 14 half per game this year it his three seasons of do never averaged even three and a half points a game well I I just like Stanford the way they broke that and then took their time in the half court execution and found their shooter right out behind the ark Salis leaning in coming off five straight 20po games well youre seeing what Salas loves to do right get in that painted area if he doesnt get the easy basket he he he join uh draws fouls he get an opportunity then to get to that free throw line El knocks it away from raino hrth gets it back a tap not there R SN thats the rebound averages more than 11 a game maybe some uh defensive goal ending there Blakes the three over Salis two triples for Jaylen Blakes one of the most improved players in the country we knew what he could do on defense his offense has been a surprise even to his head coach Kyle Smith well and hes a thief on defense as well over two steals a game Salis gets free from sers and interesting Stanford comes out with sellers on Salis we expect to see Blakes at some point pick up Hunter Salis yeah and you see right now Ray no doing a great job getting on that defensive glast and again another drive inside earning another trip to the free throw Applause line the fou is on hildr look at this right here scoring Improvement you can see last season at Duke less than two points a game and then this year the explosion lot more comp confid from coaching staff and 142 points per game Ive never seen anything like that before and when you throw in the five assists and the two plus steals thats the stat line with the 14 and A2 points thats reminiscent of a Stanford guard for many years ago in brev Knight yeah co co co exactly you brev Knight owns four of the top uh steals records per season and for the first time now a chance to break into that hes got 33 on the season already in 16 games are you kidding me he got to the free throw line something he does very well hildr over to Reed going hard at raino and one wow nice Fort Vision sharing the basketball and then big read 250 lb 71 putting that left shoulder right into the shot blocker and draws that foul on right now look at it one more time just a hesitation little pump fake got to utilize that pump fake make more I like to see more kids do that around the basket get that Defender up in the air when hes going coming down just go right into his chest chance to get the oldfashioned threepoint play Reed has five of the seven for Wake three for three at the line and des picking up Stanford full court yeah I watched them in practice on Monday energetic group high energy love playing for Coach Forbes Applause Music Blakes say eight guarded by Tyler Johnson whos got active hands Jah sers down low heres the double raino skip pass uger wall that one rattles out offensive rebound young blocked this is a wake Force Team theyre not yet into that next four out first four out group for Joe lonardi as Spillers does work down low but theyve got Stanford today Virginia Tech on the road Saturday if they hold serve in those games then theyve got their opportunities with Carolina Duke Louisville and pit as the next four and sers knocks down the jumper hes been shooting it well in conference play this year well fers on the glass on defense fillers on the glass on offense theyre getting their buckets inside but theyre not finding these Stanford Shooters in transition theres cam hildr 31 points in the win Saturday against Miami H six threes in that game he was absolutely on fire second time for his career going over the 30p point plat out great ball movement Donovan Youngs three rattles out I thought you told me Stanford was going to walk the ball up and down the floor this is Fast and Furious yeah they are going fast K Smith worried a little bit about the depth but really are this games got a nice Pace Tyler Johnson beating Donovan young theres that quickness from the sophomore good ball handling rejected the scen defense thought he was going to come back over to the top but he goes back along that Baseline for a quick two Reno setting the high screen sers using the shot fake less than 10 to shoot Lakes has provided early offense contested shot block wake is at its last three from the field hildr bobbing weaving using the 10 offensive rebound Reed doesnt go and its snatched away by The Freshman young whos missed 10 games with a foot injury this year Stanfords got to do a better job on their own defense of glass a couple offensive rebounds now for we Reno Applause misfires teams have to be a little gassed media timeout was supposed to be under 16 we have not had a Music whistle Ty Lord Johnson shaking baking cant connect well better job that time by the Cardinal keeping the guys in the white out of the painted area but youre right both teams a little winded at this point as the pace has uh slowed down here I think next stopage of play uh well get a break Blakes and there is the whistle Blakes to the free throw line both teams get the much needed under 16 media Music timeout second round 97 NCAA tournament head coaches were Dave odm and Mike Mike Montgomery Tim Duncan 18 points 20 rebounds and his final game as a demon Deacon Revan Knight paced Stanford Mark badson former Stanford Cardinal now the head coach and Cal also on that Stanford team and Tim Duncans daughter Sydney happens to be a volleyball player for Stanford so theres a connection between both schools I love that and uh the big fundamental what he got five rings Matts got a couple brevan Knight might be Im not sure if brevan Knight got himself a ring in the in the NBA but uh you know what a game that was by Revan Knight and of course Tim Duncan and Mr funer went on to be a Hall of Famer in the MBA and a lot of the Wake Forest contingent will scream that Tim Duncan was fouled a lot in that game and a lot of those fouls were not called different different time different exactly off to a terrific start for Stanford hes got nine of the 16 for the Cardinal yeah three of five shooting doing a great job make himself available getting behind that Arc In transition now he picks up Salis Blakes as their best on ball Defender marker Frederickson Spillers back iron on the three is five of 17 on the season now great job defensively by Stanford keeping that ball out there on the perimeter did not allow salz to slash to the basket Reno such a good passer out of the post sers left it way short and itll be rake ball well when I was at practice on Monday the big emphasis for wake fars was get to Reno on pass they were not going to allow him to have any opportunity to start putting the ball on the floor and operating against just one Defender and then and that full rotation as fast as you can to get out along the perimeter and find the shooters Juke Harris talented freshman from Salsbury North Carolina in the game awake as we get another whistle the foul is on Benny healer former walk on from pal bires of states in California yeah can I just say something about giler real quick I could watch their practice on Tuesday the kid did not miss he is a shooter he Strokes it from the outside hes a hustler scrappy little player look for him to get some shots up in this game from behind the AR he was put on scholarship last season and again former walk out really played his way into the rotation a year Music ago Harris explosive and rewarded how quick was Harriss first step to gain the advantage on the defender it puts too much pressure on the black back line of that defense when you start driving it down there around the block and that is two fouls now on Maxim raino so mark it down again for a big guy he plays 34 minutes a game how much trust does Kyle Smith have in his senior to keep him out there or is it an early bench call it is yeah you got to get him out of the game just let him settle down a little bit we talked about his parents being in the house tonight maybe a little extra uh nervous energy um for raino and I think coach Smith just to say come on down here simmer down a little bit we get you back in some around at the eight seven or eight minute Applause Mark opportunity for Wake now with Stanfords best player on the bench with two fouls ch por Harvard transfer looking for Aiden camon ball on the ground shot clock down to five off the hands of sellers Hills with the steel well you can see that first offensive possession without Ray know did they did not know where to go Salis ran out of room hey the officials are letting them play theyre getting bumped around around that basket just like 97 AAR travel Applause getting physical at the Joel Steve Forbes Demon Deacons four and one in conference play and really since hes been at the helm wake has more than held serve at home theyre one of two teams in the ACC undefeated at home this year year 80 entering tonight and in the last four years 55 S at the Lawrence Jo Coliseum yeah doing a fantastic job only Duke with more ACC wins in Conference during that stretch so looking to go 10 and0 to start the season for three of the last four seasons and yeah thats a you got a nice little homecourt advantage in here bring that Deacon in here on that motorcycle they got the cheerleaders in the band theres nothing better than college basketball in e oh you saw it all when you played it North Carolina Lefton Reed now doesnt have to work on raino going right at Pon Harris poked it away and it extends The Possession theyre trying to get the shot clock reset Reed Miss fired shot clock should have reset to 30 because Stanford had possession it only reset to 20 and one of the officials is trying to get the attention of the shot clock operator they dont stop play yeah what when you asked me how does wake attack now that Ray knows out you see the emphasis with Reed attacking inside youre also going to see Spillers looking to do some damage inside as well gers three is knocked out of bounds itll stay with Stanford fresh 20 defensively too you were at practice on Monday we were at shoot around today so much of wakes emphasis was around what to do with Maxim Reno now hes out of the game that changes the calculus on defense yeah and and theyre doing a nice job right now to just staying at home and playing oh that was a charge of not call I tell you what these officials are letting them bang B I like that transition by weight get the ball off the basket run the other way to get the bucket but the ball out and stay with wake and the Baseline out of bounds but theyre going to go inside it really look for salz to try to attack the basket when he gets he on this left corner right here theyre going to ISO let him operate he gets Baseline double team Salis able to find Juke Harris Frederickson down low H likes to post up as a guard theres the double HRI somehow slipped through it another offensive rebound oh wake has killed him with see Second Chance opportuni air ball from hriff unable to take advantage three possessions essentially in one yeah good looks down so low he got a wide open look along that right Baseline got it knocked down six triples in their last game when it went on one 88 points right now we far stuck on 13 awell with his second to three Richard sophore with nine points along with seven rebounds and six helpers in the win against Virginia on Saturday I like Ryan I tell you what you practice hard things good things happen for you in the course of the basketball game and thats exactly what that young man did yesterday he put his hard hat brought his lunch pair and he went to work in practice and Nar comes out here and strs a couple from the outside geler picks up his second foul he heads to the bench now Wake Forest 0 for three from long range today theyve been better of late shooting it from the outside its been a season long struggle and a part of that is a little baffling Hunter Salis again whos been better of late 29 from three this season 41 last year Parker Frederickson came to wake with a reputation as a threepoint shooter hes been in a season long slum this is a better threepoint shooting team than it show but at some point the sample size adds up he turns it over there look at the quickness of which Stanford gets out in transition goes and draws the foul Salis right now hes so much Attack Mode hes always in attack mode right now maybe over penetrating and he lost that ball first foul on Ty low Johnson Applause oah sers at the free throw line those nice looking green shoes hey we got a good one for you between two of the nations best on Saturday noon Eastern ESPN its Alabama and Kentucky four versus 8 you turn it on in the SEC every night it seems Its top 10 top 15 top 20 match up ASC is loaded this year Ill tell you what he had about nine or 10 teams over there that can can actually flat out get done F fun conference to watch lot of tripling by Johnson lets see if they go back inside to read they do help coming from the backside agal nearly stole it away and re with premium position there he just used that Big Frame 7 foot one 200 they list him at 250 I kid probably close it about 265 he just put his left shoulder and his left cheek right into the defender and just trucked him right up underneath the basket went up strong are you speaking from experience there Hey listen I got if he wants a couple more pounds I got a couple he can have offensive foul on Blakes again both teams so intent on driving it into the paint that uh theyre a little bit out of control weve got some turnovers now and then this one here just runs right through the defender giv Chas a lot of credit right sliding those biscuits eating those Nikes out in front of the driver and taking that charge Reed with seven points to lead Wake Forest Salis just one of four and two points in the early going Johnson shakes ug wall Applause Music Applause Carris fading away thats not the shot you want there that one leged Falling Away jump shot way far just seems discombobulated offensively under wall no good camon the rebound comes back to seller sets just fires and well get an over the back foul on Aiden camon Stanford by six look for its first ACC Road wi Maxim raino went to the bench with the score 1513 and 1214 to go in the half he picked up his second foul in that interim you wondered how Stanford could weather the storm well theyve extended their lead and it appears hes going to come back into the game with the two fouls yeah we figured right about an 8 minute Mark right yeah bringing back in there make sure that he didnt get that third hell play probably five minutes and in the twominute Mark getting back out of there but wake only managed two points with r No on the bench he kept trying to go inside they came they cant run a snake eyes now opportunity for Reed who has been fantastic in this first half to go back to the free throw line where hes about taking three free three free throws already but right now both teams really shooting it poorly from the outside Stanford is under 40 and uh wake is under 30 for the first part of this game Reed misses the front end of the one and one wake one for its last 11 from the field Stanford one for its last nine yeah and wake has not hit a three yet Stanfords already got four in the basket there is Reno thought about the three a computer science major and math minor truly a man of All Seasons excuse me leges the Tough Run 11 to lead all scores oh that tal sellers got away with a bang 75 ft away from the basket with his team already in the oneonone yeah coach wants you to be aggressive defensively but dont be making any silly fouls out right now the defense is playing great dont allow wake to go back to the free throw line and try to get some points the easy Applause way Stanford with its largest lead of the game and theres Spillers AB State transfer who had 17 Saturday the most hes had an ACC play yeah you will see a heavy dose of Spillers and Reed trying to get that third foul on raino before the Music Applause break heres that clock at eight yeah theres that patient Stanford offense you were talking about aara looking for help beats the shot clock and that did not not hit the rim violation well talk about W struggles offensively defensively they have been very solid very few opportunities when theyve had opportunities to get their defense Set uh has Stanford been able to score its the transition baskets the threepoint shots its the second chance opportunities the only time Stanfords really been able to get going but theyve got theyve got r no on that launch back look at that Coach look at that record down there hes established a culture here at Stanford hes been a winner everywhere hes gone 5 years at Wazoo winning Conference record in his last three seasons and a year ago he led Washington State to the NCAA tournament the last time wazu had been dancing Tony Bennett was the head coach in P the Tony Bennett the Hall of fam red Virginia yes with that wo I didnt even realizeed his dad Dick Bennett thats been a long time back so obviously coach smth he knows how to get it done what say Google me Im a winner awall picked up his second foul Smith was at San Francisco he was at Colombia three straight 20 win Seasons with San Fran with Colombia in the ivy league he led the lines to its highest win totals in the modern era so hes won everywhere season one in Palo Alto at Stanford and again its not just your first season with a new team its a new league its the riggers of travel he downplayed the travel but you have to admit and you have to imagine at some point once you get late into the season that has to take a toll on any team especially when youre coming out to the east coast for a couple of games every few weeks yeah sure less time in the lab in your practice facility as well youre going to play 20 games over the course of the AC season youre right that all adds up ELD to Salis a long three P gold at the end of the rainbow well you get a couple free throws and then you come back the opposite way and they knock down their first triple of the game got a onepoint game here all sudden wake flis has got some momentum in this basketball game Blakes sellers Corner three the answer love the extra pass right you know its that hockey assist you move that ball from side to side Defenders cannot move as fast as the pass and you get a wide open Corner Pocket triple Stanford five of 10 from three wake has only attempted four theyve hit one hildr contested does not get the bounce at home its Tapped Out by Spillers Sal wide open bang Second Chance points I kill you every time its not the initial shot you know and you got to get that rebound cleanly now you dont want this guy getting hot going to the locker room cuz hes a hes a fire starter once he gets going its hard to put him Applause out look at this one more time just get this pass and knock it over to the right side you get a little taste different from the right side you come back and say hey find me over here on the left side let me knocked down another triple and this kid all of a sudden he gets on a heater its going to be bad news for the tree his last five games boy 55 from the field and not shown 41 from three hes one of the best offensive players in the ACC meanwhile Fon Reed we talked about the fouls picked up a silly reaching foul thats his first yeah 14 foul four and a half a play you know itd be one of those things if Stanford could get a couple more foul they can go to the line theyre a good free throw shooter shoo 90 an ACC play trying to get it to Reno instead hes denied giler had to launch the three gilers got to get that inside he a 7 one body down there find a way to get to the big gu ildr caught a jagged path to the Lane missed and a tie up between Sellers and Spillers Oprah Uma possession arrow wake I dont want to keep beating it but Wake Forest is outworking and Stanford on the off on the glass right now and getting these extra opportunities has allowed them to gain the momentum make B any sport basketball especially you get that momentum going to the break and good things happen to you in the second half yeah wake wants to live inside theyre using the offensive blast six offensive rebounds as Reno comes out of the game remember he has the two fouls yeah thats a good opportunity to get him out on defense smart play by coach Smith elth against Applause sers Salis hes got eight got to put it up using the screen nothing and Stanford ball Stanford a moment ago led by nine wake has closed to within one SC and score the Dream Season continues Ohio State Notre D cant wait the cfp national championship presented by ATT begins Monday at 730 pm Monday in Atlanta the Irish and the Buckeyes Scott who do you like in the championship give me Notre Dame and Riley Leonard We Trust baby go IR and that offensive line even with some injuries they held up well they made the key plays down the stretch the defense has been strong Ohio State I think has more talent but there is something about that Notre Dame team theyre hot camon spinning on Reed lost control of the ball and if thats a foul on read it is thats his second Music well when you are going against a shot blocker you cannot fade away because it gives the shot blocker the space that he needs to measure the distance and go block the shot you got to eat that space up just the way young man get go right into the chest of the shot blocker and even if he gets his hand on the ball youre getting into his body and youre earning trip to the line and Canon not much of a scorer three and a half points per game have a career high 9 and 12 minutes on Saturday so Reed on the bench with two fouls Reno on the bench with two fouls both deer and uger wall for Stanford also have two personals yeah if your coachs B you got to be happy right now you got the lead in the ninth Le score of the nations only got two points Tyler Johnson finesses that one in yeah not really a score hes been a little but more aggressive offensively since hes been getting these starts that did a nice job working himself right to the free throw Applause line Heelers in there for Stanford Lakes over Frederickson looked good coming out this fired but no penetration not with the dribble not with the pass lightning quick Tyler Johnson throws it up off the rim rebound battle won by Donovan Young Applause Music Applause if youre Stanford youve been able to tread water with your best player on the bench for a lot of this first half and we get a blocking foul against Wake Forest yeah down there trying to slide along that Baseline very rarely you going to get that call and thats going to be his second personal foul the sixth team foul now on for at one more time you can just see outside the numbers anytime you get to those shoulders those armpits of the defender youre going to get that call every time so nice job putting the pressure on Hilbert there and he slide those feet couldnt not keep up so hildr to the bench with the two fouls in Comes The Freshman Juke Harris they like Juke Harris they I was talking to their SIDS basically their their sixth man comes in be very aggressive slasher takes a ball through the basket and defensively can guard multiple positions one through four Johnson defending Blakes oara against the Freshman Harris the Harvard transfer called for the offensive foul oh maybe a little too much shoulder I say theyve been letting a play for 18 minutes and all of a sudden now throw that right shoulder into the defender I want to see this one more time we down here on this block does he establish that position yeah certainly did you got to call that one went right through the numbers chisam Makara an undersized four averaged 16 half at Harvard last year one of three undergraduate transfers to Stanford they hadnt had one in the previous 15 Music years Johnson tried to fit it in there dangerous throw and were going to get a foul against W Forest its on juk Carris yeah its its kind of a silly foul theyve been off ly going to that glass and now this is going to be a situation now with you got a team thats struggling to score and you put them on the line without their best player on the floorers line Stanford Stanfords got almost 3 and 12 minutes since its last field goal and the one and one gives them a chance at the line sellers 84 its good womens basketball Sunday afternoon double header you got Stanford taking on number number 16 Duke and then Oklahoma against Dawn Staley South Carolina Gamecocks the number two team in the country at three Eastern that is Sunday on ESPN 2 and Music ESPN J oiah sers got hes almost a 5040 80 guy 49 from the field 41 from three 84 from the stripe entering play knock those down very cooly and stash Stanford back in that lead now 2927 these are two teams that put up 88 points in their last games and they really havent got anything going offensively reverse layup by Johnson no offensive rebound Spillers and two shots coming yeah I think he came in down low didnt block out tried to jump with them and Spillers going to win that battle every time thats a young long athletic young man so cam second foul thats now four Stanford players with two fouls in this first half Spillers last year at appstate averaged a double double in conference that was his first D1 season began in the junior college ranks coach Ford call forb his guy the back court thatll be interesting to see if uh wake doesnt try to put on a little trap here in this final 137 try to get a turnover before the end of the half Spillers more than halfway to his fifth double double of the season six points six rebounds in the opening half sellers accelerates and uses the window wow they went right through that press like a cookie cutter I can tell you what you get out of that press real quick and you can get a transition bucket and uh and left left everybody in their weight so to speak 11 for sers Salis off the T just so good putting that ball on the floor getting anywhere on the floor that he wants to starts on the right side of the lane finishes on the left hes got 10 after the slow start Blakes and sellers have 22 of Stanfords 31 11 a Applause piece aara finds a cut it sellers beautiful ball movement and Steve Forbes calls a timeout they use it or lose it timeout well take a quick one as well less than 50 seconds to go in the opening Music half osiah sers has scored the last nine for Stanford looking for its first ACC Road wi wake unbeaten at home and if youre Kyle Smith the Stanford head coach boy Maxim Reno one of the best players in the ACC in foul trouble for most of the half picked up a second foul with 12 minutes plus to go and you got a chance to take a lead into halftime yeah Sellers and bles as you said been fantastic and that thats what you need you you need guys to step up thats a sign of a good team when their star goes downers have facing a little adversity they step up and perform now a stop at a bucket be huge the locker room Stanford looks to be in his Zone Salis lost it Blakes leading the break and hes got 13 the back court for Stanford with 26 in the opening half wow big turnover by Wake Forest those live ball turnovers now thats with six straight points all in the paint for Stanford here to end the half 10 with fast break point Salis contested pull up hes got a dozen to lead weake final Applause ticks sers Hees and it doesnt go but Stanford takes the lead going into halftime yeah it wasnt great basketball but either side both teams played hard who is that guy for you well I you know cam H hilberth was been the guy the last game against Miami where he went for 31 one points he knocked down six triples he was absolutely fantastic in practice on Monday it has not carried over to the game in the first half lets see if he can get himself off the launch pad here in the second half HRI just one for seven in the opening half but comes up with a steal makes a big defensive play sometimes thats a thing that gets your offensive game going and they forgot about him and hriff had a wide openen three and then fouled a freshman Mistake by Donovan Young well they are struggling from behind the arc and cam has not been able to get one to go I understand closing out on the shooter but uh running into him kind of after his shot knocking him to the floor so its going to be side out of bounds they avoided the Cardinal mistake of putting them on the line for three freebies yeah they really like Donovan Young from Pasco Washington one of the tri cities along with Kenwick and Richmond great backing down raino and thats a smart move there by Reed you know hes got the two fouls go right at him yeah coach fores called that play right from the bench like a good coach would say Hey you know this kid does not want to get an early third foul on him lets go right at him n points for Fon Applause Reed last year when Reed was eligible in the twotime transfer rule was waved it changed the arc the trajectory of of wake season ultimately decks lost a couple of games down the stretch on the road they had some early scars but if you watch that team last year with Fon Reed in the lineup it looked like a sweet 16 team to me and I think the rest of the ACC with what they did in the tournament Justified that wake should have been in the dance a year ago and look at theyre going right back to read on Ray no inside again and trying to get that third foul but yeah 7 foot1 250 lb I could why he elevates A teams uh opportunities and success rate averaged about 10 points little less than eight rebounds last year numbers a bit lower this year he and Spillers both back to the basket low post players you had Andrew Carr last year more of a stretch four which gave Reed more room down low HRI going right on raino who held his ground and the Frenchman Scoops up the loose ball yeah great great job of playing long and big around the basket without permitting the foul what they got to do is get R Noah wal offensively now he got him on the floor he got take advantage of his minutes get him going hes only got the two points and remember Reed has two fouls as well Blakes recovers under wall the corner three raises the rim dont understand why they dont just sh a little turn five post up the big guy and let him hop I was going to ask are you surprised how few touches Rs been getting on offense as Spillers gives wake its first lead of the night yeah using their length around the basket to going inside Reed spellers and just trying to overpower they were fantastic at points in the paint 70 Advantage points in the paint raino Catch and Release the accs leading score from Deep yeah what over talk to the his parents uh during the halftime break they they werent all smiles but that big threepoint shot they going to put a big smile on their face I asked them where they from they said theyre from Paris you ever been to Paris I have favorite city in the world city of Lights I got to get there hildr no rebound young Vanessa and Philip his parents in the building tonight Aug wall Reno hang it in the L well I tell you what I was just saying they got to get the big fell the ball down on the Block he said hey I dont care what youre talking about Williams Im going to step out behind you I can knock down a couple triples and he grabs uh snatches a rebound yeah leads the ACC in points and rebounding and youre Stanford dont you got to feed him hes the hot hand right now Aral with an open look that doesnt go s the board I dont like that shot by Aral I know youre wide open but you just had the nice leading score in the nation knocked out a couple triples feet of the ball the basketball youre on the road trying to get a victory riding while hes hot look at reol just does a nice job you see that he gets his feet set early before the ball finds him hes already on balance on On Target and then this one again after you visualize that ball going through the hoop the basketball gets as big as a big as a hula hoop and you knock down back to back triples third foul on Ryan uger Wall Reno already with six as hildr gets the free throw six points in the second half and uh you watch Max R know everybody talks about Cooper flag being the breakout star of the ACC and rightfully so 42 last week ACC freshman record hes made Duke arguably the favorite to win it all in the end maybe the favorite right now for player of the year but Maxim Reno who had a pretty good season in the Pack 12 for Stanford has made quite the introduction to the ACC audience if youve watched him play well again great footwork great touch great vision good in hands hes not as stiff at 7 foot one hes very mobile and agile look at him trying to go to work here on Reed he walked theyre going to get a foul on the floor oh theyre going to say Reed pulled them off balance and Reeds going to pick up his third personal foul and that is huge you be the judge Applause let did it did that right hand hook underneath R did it hook because r no slammed into he had to hold on for dear life well Renos not a checker player he is a excellent chess Music Applause player Reno again too strong and we get a foul its going to be on Jaylen Blakes his second well they got read out of there after he picked up that foul but I was curious if Reno knowing that he got that foul that he wouldnt just go back inside again he decided to try to come back and shoot another triple hes been hot maybe a bit of a heap check but when youre that long you could put that much pressure on the defense around the basket and with his passing ability I know the double teams coming but he can pass right over the top of the defense and find one of his hot Shooters Johnson The Love Harris above the rib the high hand hand off you got to love it gets everybodys butts up out of the seats and after R hit a couple triples it was getting kind of quiet in here until that play if youre Stanford now are you going straight to 42 got you there he is raino another three offensive rebound Blakes puts it up toward the rim and now wake will push with Tyler Johnson hriff against Reno who used that 71 frame yeah look at the the Eiffel power trying to shoot that one around he was so long right got those long arms up in the air look at him posting up strong down giler no good rebound to Johnson again kind to keep harping on it but I I dont think the Stanford team is doing themselves any favor by not getting the ball inside first to the big man offensive foul on Wake Forest and Tyler Johnson well you get the defense looking one way and you sneak ball player along the Baseline for the JM Im over here in Central Park come find me I play little chesscom myself partner got challenge these guys to a game once I get into my castle then I dont know what to do but raino certainly does you saw what he could do in the wait room compai major math Miner chess player and then you throw in the personality and the flare of a dartanion he can wear about as many masks is Monte Cristo now passer shooter shot blocker scorer rebounder look at this one more time when you want to be able to move when your your pieces around the board well coach Smith does a nice job drawing this one up out of the timeout they said no more these shooting these threepoint shots lets feed our big man down low and let him go to work that time the king had his way down in the paint Blakes just picked up his third Music Applause foul Stanford has led most of this game thats what Spillers does best Spillers just big body right he just throw that right shoulder right into the defender with that little left hand hook look like Ray no was thinking about maybe coming over and blocking the shot said n its not worth picking up a third foul trying to come over the top of one of my own teammates 10 points eight rebounds for Trayvon Music Spillers this is oah Applause sers like Spillers right 88 rebounds per game sers puts it up not buying offensive rebound Reno back to sers Second Chance Reno down low feathery touch and hes up to a dozen 10 in the second half yeah and how about the extra pass by oiah sers right there to his big guy right just saying we got to get this guy going bucking inside last time let me spoon feed my big man underneath for an easy two give us the lead got called sass name in a moment Juke Harris Two Shots well nice movement without the basketball and as you said Sals name hes the one that gave Harris that ball and Jes just one of these crafty little ball players for a freshman just kind of figuring figuring things out where he needs to be on the floor try to gain it advantage and talked about sellers 23 and2 points per game over his last five ACC action but the willingness to give the ball up to one of his teammates you know thats thats the coach Forbes culture and you mention J Harris has become a real key reserve and wake is hoping to get another big reinforcement Saturday against Virginia Tech Omaha beloo the Iowa State transfer former fivestar former McDonalds allaman you see him in the black shirt on the bench he might be ready to come off the bench and give Steve Forbes 10 12 minutes this weekend yeah coach say we can get a look at that uh give him a scan either today or tomorrow and everything looks good then hes going to be able to go on the road hes been out since mid November with foot in in getting close to the end of that timeline 8 to 10 weeks uger wall now has missed a few wide open threes but on cleanup Duty Max raino yeah ARs working hard but hes hurting him but at Max raino is doing a good job flexing inside hriff a chance at the line thats exactly what hriff iss he hes been on The Struggle Bus right unable to get going say one of those guys in the second half thats got to pick up his game game best way to do it is get yourself to the free throw line B of the foul and that last rebound by raino gives him his NCAA division one leading 14th double double this is Stanfords 17th game cam hrs numbers from Miami over the weekend yeah you see those six threes thats what we were talking about right like they just could not shoot the ball from the outside and I I I think that Cams got to be that guy can find his stroke and like I say you get to that free throw line practicing your stroke in game its one thing to do it at half time but one of the thing When Youre Hearts pumping and get the adrenaline going you knock a couple down from the free throw line do tremendous um lift to your confidence shers from 18o tipped it to hildr yeah they know was coming over the back there it was a questionable whether or not that could have been one of his third fouls Music has not scored in the second half out of control and he traveled yeah you were you were just saying hand score right so hes going to use his wheels and try to get to the basket or draw some contact but he has driven ball early in both halves ineffectively like almost like hes trying too hard to get the contact and hes getting himself out of control and off balance only the fifth turnover for Applause Wake Reno with 14 and 10 geler will shoot two you know geler hasnt got the numbers offensively this kid I told you in practice on Tuesday did not miss the shot but then again theres another little crafty move by Keeler just driving it hard to the basket gets that body contact he just flipped that thing up to make sure he was going to get a chance to go to the line Galer 19 of 20 at the line this season announcer Jin Saturdays ACC Network basketball triple header uh you and I will be in blackburg for Wake Forest Virginia Tech real tough start with a lot of personnel turnover from Mike young Virginia Tech starting to play better of late Notre Dame has Marcus Burton back they visit struggling Syracuse and cow is just down the road to take on NC State in rally elds pass knocked away who else Reno just using his length defensively now playing a little bit loose and free uh on the defensive end now that hes got those two look at that slash around the back thats where I want to see that young man Ryan Li not out there behind the yard put the pressure on the defense and take it to the rout Harris offensive rebound put back Spillers one of the easiest ones thr going to get all all season long because because raino Mist tying his jump he thought that ball was going to hit the rim once and end up bouncing off the rim a couple times left Spillers wide open SP having up game Lake still hanging around down by two sers blocked cellers cant believe it I made a million dooll Move Along his Baseline and hes slapped my shot away Salis pulls up his first basket of the second half and were tied at 50 W nice job by Sal he was so out of control out time that make the better job of getting himself on Ballance and pulling up for the jumper time out with 1105 to go in the second half the Joel coming to life Philipe and Vanessa Reno Max seams parents and we said it at the top of the broadcast if there was no C flag in the ACC this year Maxim Reno right now would be the runaway favorite for ACC player of the year last five guys to lead the league in scoring and rebounding have G on to win player of the year yeah one of my old teammates hor grandon that list in 1987 took it to me and Jr Reed we couldnt do anything with they hor that was preg goggles aell along the Baseline with a little hesitation stord back on top and they need that you saw the graphic Reno doing the heavy lifting in the second half not much help yeah thats the second basket by anybody other than Rayo has been arall twice now in that painted area you think coach Smith didnt CH yank his chain and said stop shooting him those threes and get your boo your booty inside Salis gets separation for he is so good from that midrange game I know thats frowned upon by the analytics folks but thats an arrow in his quiver that he needs to shoot not by me Im a 9s kid I love I love the midrange game you got to be able to knock that one down to keep the defense Music honest car over Harris for two yeah coach Smith told his team no more outside shots we are going to be aggressive and taking the ball of the basket if you shoot the ball from the outside you can come over here and sit by me and watch hes got five guys out there now that are hungry to attack the P yeah 23 paint points for Stanford 24 for Wake Dees had a season High 50 paint points in the win against Miami Saturday shot clock of five and geler picks up his third foul yeah thats the 17 foul so well have some free throws for Wake far or Salis when we come back Applause Music Applause Music he is the biggest star in college basketball Cooper flag and this might be the easiest guess who of all time yeah I listen I dont like to give a l those Duke guys a lot of credit but I absolutely would pay to go see Cooper flag perform and you could see those numbers there you would you couldnt tell who would be the play ACC Player of the Year based on those numbers that you put the the side by side with Ray no and flagin you cant help to see that right nos got better numbers there Parts flag does play for the number three team in the country and there have been a lot of games where flag has not had to play late he could have inflated those numbers too I see what youre talking about there yeah and I do agree as somebody who did college football this fall with Andre wear who in his 89 Heisman season spent most of the second half and a lot of fourth quarters on the bench because his team was up by 50 I I understand and listen theyre thinking big picture at at the University uh of Duke right so they they they want a national championship and if they can save some minutes on flag now as r no turns the ball over theyre going to take advantage of the SP mother bench late in games that are already blown up steal there by Johnson Fon Reed back in with the three fouls setting the screen Salis leaning in over Blake Stanfords best perimeter Defender oh Salis has got some bunnies because he hung in the air as the defense is coming down he got a cleaner look at that basket putting wake back on top and this place is going bananas crowd on its feet oara blocked by Spillers and Spillers with a nasty growl after he blocked that one H rolls out this place was ready to erupt the LI might come off this basket they can get a stop here in a bucket Blake Forest is working hard right now this last three minutes theyve been the harder working team on the floor Blakes and sers scoreless in the second half after scoring 13 a piece in the first half and get it to R know theres the double team AAR leaving inside and slips it in well you know I was complaining about some of the outside shots but now theyre attacking the Basket closing the gap on those points in the P oh they let Sal get away Salis against Reno this is becoming a battle of wills right now who wants it the most whos got the most heart and desire this final 745 to get this victory Applause moving scream well sometimes you got to get creative when the big guy comes out to you you will show a step through little backat can Chicago style off the backs backboard and in the bucket Anish R Scott Williams these are your player of the year candidates and its time for the stars now raino and Salish both among the top four scorers in the league as well yeah you know I had to throw a Carolina guy on there but I love sakovic is uh boy there what hes doing out there in Cal over 20 points per game but it has been the Stars here and I and I this is going to be fun to watch here this final 735 you got already know with uh 10 12 points here in this second half and Salis with 10 points so stars is about to take over Salis wants it hes got 22 agal denies him six straight 20point games for Salis Tyler Johnson leaning in and this is wakes largest lead of the game yeah its been close neither team has been able to jump out to a double digit Advantage little Stanford had to nine early but it has been all weight here this last four minutes as theyve stolen the momentum and theyve taken the lead sers the drive and kick auger wall down low how many took a shot to the nose Ryan tough F fought basket along that Baseline hes got three of those here in the second half where hes just put his will into the defense and say you cannot stop me and Im going to the basket hes got a dozen heres Johnson got that great first step and now and Salis marked by an outstanding defender in Blakes Reed was setting the screen Salis doesnt need it good D but better o and Salis has gotten hot now 12 points here in the second half give 24 for the game trying to put the team on its back got a little Swagger in his step Reno Double K quickly sers for three got it his first basket of the second half hes got 16 missing an action for the first 14 minutes of this second half and like you said they finally did a nice job playing through cers let that double team come and then they got to try to Scrabble to find the shooters and they could not find sers on that right wing Johnsons picked up his drible in the paint Salis again Reed sets the screen Salis pass down low and one Tron Spillers Spillers has been a man amongst boys going in that pained air area for bucket after bucket and thats twice now sellers has find found his teammates cutting along the basket or into the paint and gotten them some easy opportunities so if hes not scoring the ball he is spe spoon feeding his M for easy high percentage shots thats why the reason theyre shooting over 50 here in this second half the foul is on Aiden camon Richard freshman from Andover Mass its his fourth and its the ninth team foul on Stanfords awake in the double bonus from here on out meanwhile now the Demon Deacons only have three team fouls so thats something to watch with 5 and a half left Reno on the bench getting a quick Applause breather who steps up for Stanford be good I like Ryan AR going inside for another bucket here goes Blakes to the basket ham for two its a second time now Blakes has made that extra pass interior passing into a higher percentage shot got ourselves a onepoint game with just over 5 minutes to Applause play this is a good one par this is a real good one with 24 its not touched it on this possession tend to shoot Spillers the South po oh hes got 16 Spillers is doing his darn thing he has brought his everything in his toolbx right hand left hand power shots and one 16 and nine how about this both teams have hit their last four shots Blake strong Drive puts it up a double double for Spillers Salis you get the sense of basket here and this place explodes 15 to shoot Bulls down on this left Block B Reed young brought the double reed almost walked Spillers inside hes got 18 Spillers is putting on his show and Coach Smith needs a timeout and he takes a time out wake with its largest lead 401 left in regulation Trayvon Spillers has scored the last six for Wake Forest the deakes have made their last six shots and Salis and Spillers have been doing the heavy lifting in the second half yeah they really have but look at the numbers on 11 of 12 shooting so very efficient on top getting those 24 points REO checks back in for Music Stanford well thats where you got to go right like they Stanford pulled away with Renault on the bench you got to go back to AO play through him how about the high low feed the big guy finds the cutting ug wall well you know everyone all the attention goes to REO every time he gets his hands on the ball weight Forest has been programmed to double team and so you start ball watching and you send somebody for back door cut excellent use of the timeout by coach Smith and the Applause staff they finally get it to Salis shot fake shot clock at five guarded by sers Salis over sers head well you cant play any better de in sers dead but Salis hes smiling he realizes hey I am on fire giving my six field goal of the second half 27 Wednesday is for the hunter auger wall Blakes now Reno clear path missed the dunk oh right now had a wide open Lefty jam it couldnt finish it that was a big Miss with that Sixpoint game with 240 to play they needed that bucket they got to get a stopper wake can make it a repossession game largest lead of the night for the daks Salis has 27 make it 29 with a chance for 30 well you hit a big three everybody comes up out you trying to run you off that threepoint line and I have said it all night long the kids got the ability to put the ball on the floor and go anywhere but this what up against the shot clock great defense Im just going to throw a little higher in the air and let it fall softly through the basket and look at that split the double team catch the defender in the restricted area have the concentration to finish the play you played in the 90s with a guy who wore the same Jersey as Hunter sales who in crunch time you could throw him the ball and he was going to get to the foul line or he was going to get to two yeah and then put the team on his back and and and lead him to Victory and thats exactly I dont ever want to compare any college kid to the number 23 in the Chicago Bulls but hunter silus right now silus right now he is getting it done to be certain fourth foul on Wake Johnsons third and Blakes will get two free throws still only the fifth foul well a chance to get to that line score some points with that game clock stop so again we seen the carinal attack inside a lot here in the second half and that was a smart one by blak he has not been able to get much tonight going here in this second half he had 13 at halftime has not scored in the second half sers did the heavy lifting in the first half one more have the two fouls gets the free throw we remind you Saturday at noon on ESPN top 10 match up at R Alabama visiting Kentucky and my old teammate Mark po head coach now at Kentucky how about the job he has done take over for John caliper left for Arkansas and kuys got a top 10 Squad this year although they have that lost to Clemson which is one of the few nonconference banners the accs been able to hang lock for blocked from behind by the 65 sellers what a defensive play by sellers what looked like a short tube H gets swatted away looking for one out ear pass stolen away yeah let him too much you got to get a bucket there when youre down by two three possessions you got to find a way now you got to get a stop and look at wait for trying to use a little of that game clock Johnson launes thats not his shot at all and Steve Forbes calling for a timeout and I think Steve Forbes is beside himself with plenty of time on the shot clock a mistake by Johnson but possession still with Wayne with about 13 seconds on the shot clock Tyler Johnson who was six of 25 from three coming in 19 a year ago launches a three doesnt come close and Steve Forbes on the sideline threw his hands up and started screaming time out time out got to resettle got to regroup sevenpoint lead less than 90 seconds to go and you look at wakes numbers the last three games slow first half theyve picked it up since halftime yeah John has been good but thats not exactly what coach fors wants him to do you see the 51 fil goal shooting with him out there leading this charge now being able to get guys like Cam and and Hunter going but coach was beside himself he was bent his mind he couldnt get that timeout called quick enough settle his young fell down and try to get this a sh a field goal here in this last 11 seconds of this game a shot clock we always enjoy our visits with Steve Forbes hes the best unfiltered honest offensive Johnson puts it on the floor thats for his speed well thats exactly right great timeout by coach for his team down push that lead back at the nine keep Johnson under control REO with a big Tri I dont know what the french word is for airball but I think these uh demon Deacon faithful are letting him know exactly what he did there well they they got a trap they got a foul do something here to get the ball out of the hands of the Wake for and wake is a superb free throw shooting team and hildr 8 2 to the strike now just not enough on the road down the strats to stop salus kid was absolutely fantastic I think Stanford theres still 51 seconds left to go in this one and down by nine could be 11 after these couple of free throws but they dont have the depth they made some silly plays in in a crucial stretch of this second half with Reno on the bench they got a play more through and know if theyre going to get a win in Chapel Hill on Saturday and it makes you wonder did they just get worn down late in this game because wake started yeah really to pull away last 6 seven minutes of the second half otherwise pretty close game much of the night but Wake Forest n ranking at number 80 Joe lardy has his own rankings so for context SMU is in in his next four out career entering tonight SMU was at 75 wake at 88 as that one doesnt come close so wake with a win tonight if they beat Virginia Tech on Saturday its not going to help their resume but losses to either of those teams could hurt them as Salis tries to Corral it they dont blow the whistle then youve got the opportunity games with Carolina Duke Louisville and pit Carolina quad 2 which could be quad one by the end of the year the other three as of now all quad one wake has a very real chance over the next few weeks to play themselves right back into the NCAA tournament conversation uh I 100 agree and theyre not only are they playing well they play hard and I saw it in practice on Monday and even when they were down and struggling to score here shooting under 40 in the first half it dont Splinter they continue to work in like you said you nailed it they wore Stanford down here tonight Hunter Salis 30 points 18 in the second half he and Trayvon Spillers down the stretch shoulders as broad as Atlas put this team under backs yeah Im glad you mentioned Spillers cuz he was absolutely fantastic he picks up that still wo dribble out the clock with his double double 18 and 10 with three three huge field goals to put put wake up for good Hunter Salis on a sixgame heater six straight 20po games he went for the big three 0 30 tonight wake remains unbeat
