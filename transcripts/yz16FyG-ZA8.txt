O has been playing Hes been terrific Gotten better as the season has gone on He jumped center with Johan Bruno And its Virginia in their sharp orange road uniform for the basketball first Ditter takes a look back out trying to back his way into the paint Heres Don Hall the starting point guard with three on the timer Got to put it up Malik Thomas able to beat the buzzer and he buries it A good start to the basketball game for Virginia quickly back the other way Kawasi Reeves gets fouled and will head to the free throw line Well thats exactly what coach ODM was worried about Georgia Techs ability to play quick even after playing defense Great defense for 30 seconds and they get burned on the outside shot Lacy Reeves like a blur right in front of music our scorers table down the right side Got out after that that made and they throw about a 55 60 ft pass to him that he was able to catch in stride to get to the bucket Gets fouled Reeves is another one of these yellow jackets that must stay out of foul trouble and must deliver offensively and he is a fascinating young man from Mon Georgia After basketball he wants to go into education and he tells his teammate Bay and Dongo that if and when Bay opens up his own school back in his home country of Sagal Kawasi is going to be the principal and they both agree on that Its going to happen Yeah I I love that You know teammates getting together after their careers at college and and doing something positive for a great a good community cause Heres Sam Lewis back out to Hall the BYU grad transfer back to Malik Thomas former USC Trojan and San Francisco Don He was out by the bay the last couple of years Test Ditter lost it on the way up because he was fouled Thats what Tess Ritter can do Like he everyone worries about his outside shot but you remember this guy is had a good quick first step He gets to the uh foul line quite a bit and show 15 free throws against Notre Dame by doing exactly what he did right there Put his head down and take it to the brack And for Damon Starttomire the person who picked up the foul is the man he can least afford to pick it up Find Dongo as Tess Derritter makes the first Well thats going to be the matchup right Dongo and Ditter on both sides Whos going to get the better of that matchup I think hes got a good chance to win this game First two points for Derritter Early 51 Virginia lead Back into the starting lineup for the Yellow Jackets at the point is Lamar Washington after having given way to freshman Eric Chatfield Chatfields available will come off the bench tonight Jaden Mustaf to Aai Fleming the freshman on the pull up from the baseline Cant get the roll Good rebound for UVA Sam Lewis dribbles up himself Great defense by Virginia Kept the ball on the right side of the floor Theres Ditter for three Cant connect Well Ditter has struggled shooting the basketball just lately Hes now 0 for his last nine over the last three plus games Over the top and Dongo gathered it for a moment finally gets it to Reeves who stepped cheering down the sideline Tough possession that time for Georgia Tech by Dongo had a good position on the low block there Just could not handle that pass and slipped out of his hand Thats one he wished he had back He has lit Virginia up in the past This kid averages 168 points 73 rebounds and two blocks in his time against the Cavaliers going to have some fullourt pressure here by Georgia Tech One of the things Ryan ODM the Virginia head coach told us earlier today hes concerned about with the Yellow Jackets is their pace and tempo Got to make sure we dont let them get up and down Dip with a full head of steam is fouled It looked like Fleming came over as help defender and picked up the personal his first And its a good thing he fouled the Ritter cuz he had some evil intentions when he was driving that thing from the left side in to the center of the floor there He looked like he wanted to try to take a piece of that rim back to Charlottesville with him He was coming high and hard with the finish Well as we showed you earlier Derritter averaging nearly 16 points 6 and 12 rebounds a game Hes a 23y old former professional who Ryan ODM had come over from Belgium Hes got two years of eligibility according to the NCAA Hes a freshman now and will get an opportunity to play next year if he doesnt turn pro or go back to Europe to continue his professional career Wow he missed both of those Hes a 75 free throw shooter And then we got a lane violation on UVA So another violation You can hear the official saying there was a violation there Ball had not hit the rim yet These guys crashing in Theyre trying to get that rebound Strong drive to the bucket and the Yellow Jackets have their first field goal of the night Sorry Doug thats Jaden Musta And we welcome you to Atlanta Georgia Early in this ACC game between 14th ranked Virginia and Georgia Tech the Whos take a 73 lead over the Yellow Jackets With Scott Williams Im Doug Sherman And Virginia comes into this game Scott the hottest team in the league having won six in snorts a row and off to a good start here this evening Yeah they got that one triple to start the game up against the shot clock but everything else has been hard to the basket on both sides Look at that swat inside Off the block Here comes Sam Lewis Good hustle back by Endongo But that is his second personal foul And that is a big problem for Georgia Tech Yeah thats the one Dongos got to let him go And look at this protection at the basket there Ritter comes over just swallowed that basket up And then Virginia theyre not the Virginia from a few years back where theyd walk the ball up the floor This team scores over 80 points uh a night So theyre third in the ACC in scoring Theyll be an awful lot of ACC teams if they were in that position But uh coach ODM says the story of this season so far is sacrifice That is starters sacrificed minutes to the reserves who sacrifice the ability to start perhaps to come off the bench Yeah And its and its great to watch team chemistry the spirit that they had in the morning shoot around and even pregame here uh at 700 These guys are all about winning They brought 22 times only lost three They dont care who gets the credit as long as UVA gets the win Uh Odienzo big number 33 one of the elite shot blockers in the ACC into the game Derer going end able to finish with that left hand Dreder sees something he likes and he is constantly attacking the Yellow Jackets right in the heart of their defense Coowak has come into the game for Georgia Tech as Dongo picked up those two fouls And Georgia Tech once again playing without Moila their 610 freshman and without Payton Marshall their 7 foot sophomore So ifo gets into foul trouble youre in trouble Malik Thomas makes it a nine nothing Cavaliers run Wow Theyre really doing a nice job on both the sides of the court Defensively theyre allowing the Yellow Jackets just one shot Then theyre getting out and running in transition if theyre not going to the hole Theyre penetrating Hinds this season Theyre and still at about 77 points a game in ACC actions So theyre flat out getting it done And then they like I said they will opportunistically run when they have a chance And the other part of it as theyre riding a nine nothing run here to take this 11point lead on Georgia Tech The Whos dont turn the basketball over Theyve got two point guards a starter and a guy who comes off the bench who are onetwo in the league in assist to turnover ratio They have so many things going for them Yeah And Virginia is really slapping this defense on them right now Theyre making him shoot all at uh perimeter shots and theyre limiting him to one shot and theyre getting out going opposite direction Thomas cant get the bounce Sono kept it alive but Georgia Tech has it in the hands of Mustaf Well they got the shot blocker in there Ono this kid blocked about two and a half shots a game Does a fantastic job controlling the paint on defense Well you know you think about it Virginia has two of everything I mean Enzo is an elite shot blocker but the starting number five player Johan Grunlow also blocks two per game Hes third in the league in block shots They have unbelievable rim protection usually 40 minutes a night Yeah 51 blocks on on one side as a starter You come in you got off the bench hes got 65 blocks Chance Malleries pass a little too tall for the big man This is when Dill Jackack has got to get in that paint Stop fighting some side for two in the paint They got to score off of those missed shots by Virginia before they can set that defense This is Chance Mallerie the 510 freshman right there in Charlottesville St Ans Bellefield a top 100 recruit Committed to the previous coaching staff and decided to stick with Ryan ODM and his staff and its worked out beautifully Tony Enzo plucks the rebound away Finally able to grab it and secure it as Coowak Well thats what Georgia Tech needed right Backto back stops It wasnt a pretty stop but yet they came up with the ball Pass intended for Kurowak And weve got a whistle Virginia I think Tillis had the ball but he was on the end line And so Georgia Tech catches a break and will keep possession And Telis he comes over from UC Irvine out there in California Hes another one of these guys veteran players Hes down here battling underneath But I love that Jaden Mustaf This kid is really having himself a good season He plays hard every night for coach Stamire regardless of what that scoreboard says Devin Tillis one of those sixthyear college guys Hes from Los Angeles Spent the last four years at UC Irvine and was all big west second team a season ago for the Anteers The offense has stalled here for Tech Got to put it up Jazz Kelly just off the bench Onenso with another rebound Yeah just chewing glass right right thats what Virginias doing right now Really not giving the yellow jackets any second chance opportunities Theres a little instant offense Jakari White the best threepoint shooter for the Whos off the bench with his first three Yeah 45 shooter a specialist off of that pine He was that guy that we asked coach starter about Who who are you afraid of Hes like its not the lane guys you talk about He mentioned Jakari White That guy coming off that line thats instant offense that could stroke it from distance Yeah Game changer who also defends and can get a highlight done off the takeaway Here comes Hall off the nice feed applause from his fellow point guard And weve got our largest lead of the night at 19 to five Well Virginia is not messing around And they are not half stepping They are not taking Georgia Tech lightly They are slapping the defense on them and they are getting out and running These transition buckets really hurting the yellow jackets early on in this game So youre saying aint no half stepping Aint no half stepping Is that right That cant play again Another one and done as Hall crashes the glass Hall back to Tillis spotting up The deep three is good And once again the guys they call the bench mob delivering immediately Scott Well these guys are experienced hands They know how to play They know how to get themselves open He gave the ball up willingly and then found his spot on balance That pass on target from Hall Easy triple Poked away And here come the Whos once again Hall with Washington to beat The foul is given and a chance for three A 10 nothing Virginia run The yellow Denon Hall is from Plain City Utah to Fremont High School and served a twoyear mission after high school for the Church of Latterday Saints in Fresno before flying the first part of his college career at BYU Unable to complete the threepoint play Now if youre Georgia Tech youve got Bayongo back onto the floor Chaz Kelly at the point and off the bench for the first time Eric Chatfield Jr Where do you turn here If youre the Yellow Jackets youve also got Cam Craft out there Good threepoint shooter Yeah you go inside to Dongo and play a little inside out Craft off the bounce at it Rattle out Yeah you know but thats a better look Thats a better offensive set than some of theyve gotten where theyve just been up against the shot clock So having Dongo back out there will help him But if he gets his third foul early in this game that big cheering time trouble Did he just get the third foul reaching Well looked like hes the one who reached in Chatfield was overmatched physically and Dongo came over to help No they give it to Chatfield Well that was close and I know Coach Stomire has got to be breathing a a sigh of relief there but Dongo was trying to reach in there but a big mismatch Im not quite sure how the young fell got stuck on one of the best young freshman in the ACC TZ Ditter saw that match up and his eyes lit up Well thats a true freshman Eric Chatfield was listed at 51160 lbs trying to check a 23yearold test deritter at 69240 Good luck Yeah it was the ultimate mismatch for sure and coach starter will not want that to happen again uh in here in this first half or even the rest of the ball game Kelly gives it to dangerous pass White nearly stole it away Kiraak takes the bump puts it up and gets the roll off the back plate You know Chowak was working with one of the big man coaches and the shoot around for about 20 minutes on moves just like that up against the pad I love when Young Bigs get an opportunity to see that that work really pay off quickly in in a ball game Grimo puck flucks the rebound away Dritter now takes it to the bucket and lays it in So when youre struggling shooting from the perimeter why not put it on the deck and go The kids got a great ability to handle the ball Two three dribbles in traffic up against pressure Uh in fact hes the one applying that pressure Uhoh lost that off the foot Yeah dribbled it out of bounds Good defense by I found it interesting that Ryan ODM the head coach for the Whos offered up to us today that when he sees Ta Ritter he pointed up to the ceiling here in the building and said I see him as kind of like Matt Harping Hes not Matt Harpering now but the Yellow Jackets former AllAmerican is kind of who he sees the same mold out of Tester Ritter Yeah you got some NBA scouts out here checking out Tesa Ritter and hes putting on an early show for him His ability like you said to put the ball on the floor putting that pressure on that defense playing with uh concentration after the contact to finish these buckets around Thomas and Lewis back on the floor for Virginia This is Lewis Chfield loses his defender Immediately double team Dongo being hounded Puts his head down and gets blocked by Grunlow again Elite rim protection for Virginia at all times The Kelly three winds up going out of bounds off of the Yellow Jackets This is an impressive show of defense even uh when it looks like Dongos got an opportunity to get a bucket inside They got another sevenfooter coming over to to erase his shot and he stayed with it and you got Kelly a good look on the perimeter But again 0 for the threepoint line here in the first 10 and 12 minutes of this basketball game Your Georgia Tech cannot find the range from the outside Yeah they are one of the better shooting teams percentage wise in the ACC Georgia Tech fourth in the league at about 37 coming in but Virginia defensively has styied that Meanwhile Virginia has been free and clear Malik Thomas with his third triple of the night Yeah And thats five now for Virginia who averages about 10 as the Ritter gets a spill on Dongo He wrecks the round No match so far tonight here in Atlanta Dinner has outscored the opposition by himself 11 to7 and its another tech turnover Virginia three on three Throw it to the rim Theyre making it look easy Malik Thomas is into double figures These live ball turnovers are just a disaster right now for Georgia Tech Coach Stmmire doesnt want to have to take a timeout but his teams down by nearly 30 He really is Ritter on the bench as we resume play just over eight minutes remaining in this first half Theyve already had three runs of nine nothing or more Yeah And then you know Coach Stami calls that timeout to try to get a good look but they couldnt get a bucket out of that timeout And they did get the stop Well they have forced seven turnovers by Tech Craft A little strong on that three Long rebound comes to Virginia Well Georgia Tech is one of the better threepoint field goal percentage teams in the league But they dont shoot a lot of them And I know now theyre down by over 30 and theyre going to have to start shooting some but you dont want a quick try fire three with 22 seconds on the shot clock off the triple by Mallerie Theyve now made 14 baskets 10 of them have been assisted at both ends of the floor The Whos are playing near perfect basketball Yeah And and and six triples to go along with those 14 field goals So like I said again a nice balance of going inside and then on the break after after missed shots theyre able to find their shooters on the perimeter And when that youre up by 30 plus points that rim gets to be the lot the size of a hula hoop It is much easier for guys to feel confident when theyre firing behind Theyre going to knock it down about the only offensive answer for Tech so far tonight Hes got five of their eight points Grunlo takes a seat Ono back out there Yeah Grunos not that guy that averages a lot of points Uh but hes long Hes a Hes a great defensively He slides his feet Hes that communicator on the back line of their defense letting know every where everybody needs to rotate as Georgia Tech slaps that fullcourt trap on one more time here Mallerie able to work around the pending double team Good ball movement Virginia attacks get a point blank shot Just couldnt finish this time trying to speed the Cavaliers up It could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing because they dont mind playing fast Virginia foul char Malik Thomas picks up his first and now Jakari White returns The grat transfer from North Dakota State who we should note is flying for the first time with only tape on his left hand and wrist on the slam dunk against Maryland That was a Sports Center top 10 highlight He had a tough landing and missed some games with the injury but he is getting very close to being 100 once again for Virginia Well he hes a straight sniper When hes when hes fully healthy he can really stroke that thing from behind the arc Dungo trying to work his way on Odeno Bring it back outside Mustaf has it Six on the shot clock Lefty runner Onenso pulls it down But even a guy like Tillis has bought in defensively right now Tillis was the best player on UC Irvine last year Didnt play a lot of defense but now you see him playing defense on one end stopping move stuff and then he cracks in another another three Hes got seven triples here in the first half This team is third in the ACC in uh threepointers made at 10 a game and theyve got seven here in the first half This things getting ugly denied cheering just picking up block shots one after another and look whos running down the floor with everybody else 33 now Tillis looking to go to work The former anteater has it poked away and Dongo gives it up to Washington right down the lane and one positive play right there Washington comes over snatches that ball out of Tilliss hand And that was great execution of the break He gave it up got it back and finished after the contact I love that one right there Maybe thats the spark that the Yellow Jackets need to kind of get some mojo going back here to try to finish off this last six minutes of this first half Chance Maller So the foul has been given to Chance Mallalerie his first The Ritter comes back Tillis with a smile on his face receives a congratulations from the bench to our right Well you you mentioned the depth of this Cavalier ball club having nine guys that could be starters on on uh any team here in the ACC Good ACC conference by the way Um and it is showing here early on just the depth of this squad Well you hear coaches say that that we have eight starters or nine starters but usually theres a significant drop off somewhere That just does not seem to be the case for Virginia Enzo gives it to White Has a step on Washington Now pulls it back out takes it and lays it in Working that baseline to perfection Well you know the scouting report is Whites a threepoint shooter and you get up on them and you can see still quick to the basket Very impressive the way you have multitalented players that can do many different things Well Ryan ODM and his staff with the backing of the university money the way Reeves knocks down his first two points just did a marvelous job of bringing in an entirely new set of players except for one and theyve got pieces that fit Scott cheering and they fit real nicely and he he said the best thing about these guys even though theres so many new guys is the chemistry on his squad as Oi Inso goes and gets on the offensive glass and beats Mallerie for another triple My goodness its raining threes down here in Atlanta again Averaging over 81 points per game Weve got 4 and 12 minutes left in the first and they are knocking on the door of half a 100 Ditter Mallerie tries it again This one wont go Ono will have a chance for three and a chance for 50 on the board cheering Yeah I think that might have been on Nongo underneath there and thats going to be his third foul of the half So hes going to have to go sit down for the rest of this half But uninso if hes not blocking two shots on one end hes down here grabbing offensive rebounds I love the use of the pump fake there And again give the big man coach for the Cavaliers a little extra bump in this paycheck this week because these guys are doing the contact finish the drills uh like they do it every day in practice And you were talking about how much you love those big man drills back in Carolina during your 15ear NBA career right You love that Well Coach Williams uh Roy Williams was our big man coach my first two years and we did that for 45 minutes for laughter every uh every practice uh before two days before a basketball game And it made JR Reed Pete Chilut and myself much better basketball players You didnt always like it when we were going through it but it it made us better pros thats for sure And you can see these Virginia uh Cavaliers they practice and they practice hard We saw it this morning in the shooting round the energy that they have and it is translating in here to this first half of this basketball game Gary White looking for a foul call Didnt get it Coach Stamire is yellow Now theres still 3 minutes and 53 seconds left to go in this half They got to find a little something here Not saying that they get go on a 10 10 to2 run but they got to find out something in their offensive game that gives them the ability to go in half at halftime and then regroup And again their best player Bayono has been in foul trouble just to compound all of their issues The way Reeves could get going He is their leading scorer at over 15 per game Its now 4918 Yeah And they kind of come out of here with a little bit of a zone defense and give the Cavaliers a different look Wouldnt you believe it Like everything else theyve thrown him behind the arc Don Hall banks in a triple from the right wing Virginia is now nine of 16 from beyond the ark Well Kesi Reeves starting to heat up Yeah hes their best player coming off of 16 points at Notre Dame You know he can be that guy that can provide that offensive firepower And like I say a couple backtoback buckets offensively and now youre feeling a little bit better about yourself with three minutes to go in the game And look at this one right here Washington with the just a just a little snap pass right on time on target And after Weaves hits that Reeves hits that little midrange shot All a sudden that threepoint shot becomes a little easier Johan Grunlow the freshman from Germany at the free throw line Must grabs the miss Catch and shoot for Chatfield Too strong White hustling for the ball And they say that was off of Virginia And so the Yellow Jackets keep it Yeah Quacy Reeves down there battling underneath trying to keep that ball alive I I I like the young fellas ability to shoot that three but that pass he caught kind of on the top of his shoes like the tongue of his shoes and he tried to shoot it all in one motion from the top of his shoes the threepoint range That ball didnt have a chance Well Mustaf off the baseline out of bounds able to get the easy two Yeah Mustaf has come to play right This guys a hard hat lunch pail guy as well Eight points now in the game You know he and Reeves Dongo Washington Those are the guys that they got to lean on here in these lean times Your Ritter catch and shoot from the foul line Hes got 13 to lead all scores Hes making it look easy Doug This guy he can pop it from that midrange spot there right at the elbow the free throw line If you come up on him too close hell put it on the floor and burn it right by you Reeves rises up Missed everything And here comes Jakari White It has been a blur of orange from one end of the floor to the other all night long No connection there Trying to find the lob to Grunlow whos looking for a foul Didnt get it Yeah the referees I think are putting their their whistles in their pocket a little bit because Grunlow just got knocked to the ground when he was trying to run that right way He thought he was going to go for the high hand off That ball just sailed out of bounds Lewis replaces White for Virginia The Whos have their starting unit back out there together Chatfield off the bounce Nice little pull up First two points for the young man from right here in Atlanta Well quick the other way Thomas down the other way And again Gruno there with the follow That last possession that was a nice job on the screen by Carowak for the Yellow Jackets offensively Let Chel get that little um bucket right into the center of the lane Washington goes to the left hand and banks it in This is a guy that got to get himself going When he was going well he was averaging about 10 points a game about five or six assists Georgia Tech was uh you know they were playing good basketball but hes kind of falling off He was just one of five at Notre Dame for two points and they got the doors blown off Ditter Grunlow Kiraak able to track it down to the corner One minute to go in a first half that Virginia has led right from the start In the blink of an eye it was a 30point game Looked like Thomas either got a piece of the ball or of Reed Saying he may hit him on the elbow He missed that one short and badly to the right by about 2 and 12 ft So Kazi cant believe that there was no whistle on that call by that foul Aeno replaces Derritter Bruno goes out None of these Virginia players average even approaching 30 minutes a game Its go in run as hard as you can for three or four minutes get you out And its not even like its play good hard defense for three or four minutes Thats where the emphasis is And like I said even though they score uh over 80 points a game its still the emphasis with Virginia is still on the defensive side of the balls Phillips rises up for three One thing the Virginia bigs have done they sprint up and down They go on rim runs and they have themselves in adv advantageous positions as well Its not just the little guys getting out to run Yeah a chance now here for with 17 seconds on the game clock to play for the last shot of the half Thomas and Hall in the back court Tillis comes up to set the screen Hall pulls the trigger Got it Everything going Virginias way Their largest lead music of that half was 35 And that is the largest lead for any team in any ACC game so far this season Virginia is been moved Once he gets uh shut down he can spin back and finish with the off hand through contact Lamar Washington back into the starting lineup at the point for Georgia Tech tonight Gets it into Dongo whose jump hook misses the iron altogether Yeah Dongo playing with those you know he didnt get a chance to play rather with those three fouls Hes got a little rust from that first half but thats a good look for uh Virginia sorry for Georgia Tech to take that thing hard inside the dongo but another triple That is their 10th Lets make that their 11th threepoint shot here of the evening 11 of 19 Malik Thomas has done his part now with 14 points Mustaf and Reeves along there with Washington and Dongo And here is the freshman Aai Fleming who had a quiet first half Shot is blocked by Grunlow And here comes Virginia Hall quick inside Grunlo lays it over the rim for two Well Hall doing what he does This kids first in the ACC and assisted turnover And hes always got his eyes open And Grunlow he does a nice job just running to the front of the rim like he was going to offensive rebound the ball And Hall the grad student just with the pass right underneath him with that great court vision All he had to do was catch and go up strong with him Yeah we cant say it enough that Hall as you mentioned is better than 3 to one in assist to turnover ratio And the guy whos nipping at his heels in the ACC is his backup chance Mallerie at nearly three assists to making risky plays or or passes under duress This is Jaden Mustaf the sophomore out of Death Catholic High School in DC Here is Tuesdays ACC mens basketball double header presented by Troll Price First NC State travels to Charlottesville to take on these 14th ranked Cavaliers 700 Eastern Then the Hurricanes take on music the Seminals who are surging in Tallahassee All available right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app Thats NC State Virginia game is going to be a good game I dont know if you caught what NC State did to North Carolina last night Dave Black kicked him in the head took the fight right to him and took Carolina out of that basketball game early much like Virginias done here to Georgia Tech Billy Thomas quietly now with 17 points Yeah leading all scorers This kid is just getting it done Chaz Kelly from the corner for three Just the second triple for Georgia Tech They have not been able to keep pace obviously with Virginia but their their 12 triples but a much needed triple there as Thomas launches another one Long rebound comes back out to Thomas The lead was once 35 It is again 35 Paul with the shot clock down to two puts up an air ball out of bounds with 710 of a second on the shot clock Itll be Georgia Tech basketball regardless Almost said that was one of the easiest looks hes had all night and Paul kind of squirted it out of his hand before he was ready to shoot it Theyre going to get Valerie Tillis on Enzo back in his game Just two minutes and 15 seconds off of that game clock He likes to platoon his guys in and out but this even this is a quick substitution here in the second half So Jerritter and Grunlow out Chance Mallalerie out there Tillis and Odenso the other reserves who have come back This is Chaz Kelly the backup point guard for Georgia Tech with the basketball Loses it Odeno to Tillis Pulling up is Thomas Offensive rebound Mallerie No look pass deflected away Virginia keeps Finally gets to the corner for Lewis Finds a little room and puts it in Sam Lewis Well theyre getting offensive rebounds Theyre going inside for buckets Theyre hitting the midrange games Theyre knocking in triples If youre Georgia Tech I dont know how other than maybe going to a a zone defense maybe a 23 or boxing one or 131 to try to match up against this Virginia Salt offensive crossover And the finish Ono couldnt block the shot and came away impressed One of the few shots Oneno hasnt blocked tonight thats going around him in the painted area He got backto back blocks on one possession earlier Hes got two blocks for the game But I love that one I tell you this kid must stop He plays hard He puts his head down Hes got hes got some live legs and broad shoulders to power through that contact around the bucket You remember his father Jared Mustaf a 610 ACC star for Gary Williams back in the day at Maryland First round pick of the Knicks in 1990 Jadens not as tall as his dad but hes as strong and as thick as his dad was Yeah And he plays with a lot of energy and hustle and want to that his dad did as well He used to give me fits in uh when he was up there at Maryland and I was at North Carolina That 1990 draft by the way Georgia Tech Dennis Scott went fourth overall Dennis is in the building watching his alma mater play tonight Yeah I got a chance to talk to D3 and at halftime I told him to go suit up Just his squad can use some threepointers right about now Lewis looked like he might have gotten it blocked there to clean it up Bonets Mallerie No thats not Mallerie Who is that for Virginia late to get up That is Lewis Looks like hes okay I I didnt even see what happened for him to get get knocked to the floor but you know these Virginia guys they sell out on on every defensive assignment So not surprised that our offensive assignment one of these guys would get get wiped out underneath there So theyre putting a little fullcourt pressure now here on on Georgia Tech as they drop back into a manto man Among the things Virginia has done very very well this year They are 22 and three overall Couple of chances at the rim for Mustaf comes away empty Virginia leads the league in rebounding and in offensive rebound and also threepoint defense They hold their opponents to under 30 shooting from the arc So we shouldnt be surprised that Tech has not found a rhythm here tonight Virginias defense has been disrupted Theyre number one in the ACC in the f of the arc They 298 like 30 just like you said Thats keeping out challenging shots but its also making teams have to take shots up against the shot clock Curry shots offbalance shots where theyre not getting good clean looks and shots Jakari White comes free Kiraak had his hands on it Here comes Eric Chatfield Jr Young man whose dad grew up in Queens I think on Enzo got a piece of general little uh layup attempt and if he didnt you know the Georgia Tech players anytime theyre anywhere near the basket know hes around at the other end gets blocked from behind by Craft Here comes Chatfield These officials are certainly letting them play here I think theyre only going to call the fouls that they have to try to get this one over as quickly as they possibly can Only the end zone Carowak battling underneath with the ball White dribbles up all the way to the basket Shot was blocked by Fleming Great recovery by Fleming to challenge and block that shot Craft got it Three ball to the left wing for the Yellow Jackets And their red shirt junior from Chicago Yeah their second uh three here after only making one in the first half Theyve already got two here in the second half We just played over five minutes Virginia attack on the glass tonight 3618 Yeah its the points in the paint though Thats the one that jumps out at me 182 advantage to Virginia Uh excuse me for second chance points not points in the face Second chance points 182 Martin Carrer has come into the game for the first time tonight for Virginia This is Don Hall off the up fake driving in on Chatfield trying to take advantage of his size Kiraak the rebound Chatfield will bring it up for the Yellow Jackets Yeah Chadville was giving up some inches but he was giving it everything he had to Don Hall there and he he stopped him from getting the bucket Thats just some want to out there out of that little Chatfield 10 to shoot Kiraak looking for help Finds Craft who rises up Long rebound into the corner out of bounds Back to Virginia the switching on Virginia the stepping into the driving lanes and giving up their chest with their body not letting Georgia Tech change sides of the floor with the ball Then thats a kind of a a one footed Dirk Ditzky threepoint attempt there and he cant find the range all day to line it up and test Ritter has his first made three in four games But like you said though right like get the ball down into the scoring area quickly Nobody from Georgia Tech out within 10 to 12 feet of Tester He he got the laces right on the ball before he shot that one and knocked it down The ability look at it Just nobody even on the right side of the floor Heck I think I could still go out there and make that one Doug you saw me knocking those midrange jumpers down after the morning shoot around I dont know about out to the threepoint line though I like the midrange The midrange games open opens up my threepoint shot Just want you to know that Mustaf the one offensive weapon tonight for the Yellow Jackets Well it opens up Mustaf cuz he his outside shot because hes been driving it inside there and now he he stepped out there behind the arc Is that three of three for Georgia Tech from behind the arc or three of four Tony Eno that has been one part of his game hes worked so hard on He didnt even practice shooting threes at his previous college stops but between his hard work and Ryan ODM saying You know what If youre working on it and you can shoot them were going to let you shoot them Just wanted him to shoot it better than that last one Enso is Well thats where I like doing what hes doing right there Patrolling that paint defensively coming up with his fourth block shot of this basketball game Telling Fleming he shall not pass take it out on le for 27 this year on threes Just had a quick conversation with his head coach on the way out and Im guessing as Onenzo smiles down as he sits at the bench It had something to do with the shot selection on that last possession You guarantee it that uh he he did not with 13 minutes left to go in the game You want to make sure you finish this thing out correctly how when the game is salted away and listen theyre still in command up by 33 points but theres still a lot of time to play and as I have been around many thousands of basketball games funny things happen all of a sudden Georgia Tech can catch hot get hot behind that arc and make this thing a contest first point tonight for Bayongo foul trouble and Virginias defense has just held him in checkagveraging yeah he had 12 12 points a game We slapped the commentator Jinx on him Talked about how he loves playing against Virginia and averaging 17 points a game and over eight boards Uh and he came out here in that first half and he picked up all those fouls Couldnt get a bucket and turn the ball over a couple times 5second violation That pressure by Georgia Tech forces the turnover Hey still got some fight here in these yellow jackets trying to sting him down there along that baseline and they got that turnover Ditter with the steel and the flush he had in Dongo in hot pursuit and by is slow to get up Good sportsmanship by Ditter went over there and picked Dongo up there Got him back on his feet He took a nasty spill after this turnover He kind of lost his balance in his foot race right here and hit the back of Ditters heel He went down hard and look at Ditter come over here and uh and help him to his feet I like that about that young man A lot of guys like to stand over you and gloat and point on you and everything else when they get a a dunk in transition or over somebody and thats fine at the pro level I dont know maybe a little too much of that here at the college level with Hall defending Dango has the pass taken away and here comes Mallerie up the right sideline Skip pass to Hall on the left side for three Bruno up above the defenders to grab that rebound and a foul against Tech Theyre just so long right You take down on Enzo you come back with Grunlow you and uh hes able to choose some glass So you got Tesa Ritter out there and they theyre just owning the offense and defensive glass Theres not a whole lot that Georgia Tech can really match up with them Now you got the two bigs out there both Curac and Dongo but they got their work cut out for him Chatfield goes out with his second foul Tillis has come back in for Virginia Our officials tonight Tommy Morrisy on the baseline didnt see who that was off of so he asked Bert Smith over our way and they figure out that its Virginia basketball Mark Schneer is our other official Yeah I think Mallerie was trying to work it underneath the Grunlow and it went off of one of the Tech uh defenders chest Mallerie going to work Heres Tillis Dongo on the defensive glass and he will dribble up Tillis you know hes got a a great knack of beating defenders off the drive and getting to the paint If he just had a little bit more rise it would allow him to get a little bit more on balance and hed hed finish more of those in the painted area Craft blocked by Grunlow trying to split that double team Fleming lost it but was fouled and weve got a Cavaliier holding his right knee 11s 14 That is Tillis who is in some pain We can get back on the floor sooner rather than later 1141 remaining in the second half of what has been a onesided game right from the opening tip Virginia led by as many as 35 points in the first half Led 5927 at the break and the Yellow Jackets have not been able to make any sort of significant push Theyre up against the shot clock again Washington has it poked away and once again here comes Derritter with a nongo in toe and almost a carbon copy of what we saw two minutes ago Yeah Ders ability right like to hit these live ball turnovers and within two or three dribbles get it to the attack area is very impressive This kid is as good as advertised So for the 11th time this season he has gone to the 20 point plateau Just that little rip away Washington a little loose with the ball and Ditter with Dongo trailing has to just let him go with those the foul issues that he has Well you know he went from playing against 30yearold former Duke AllAmerican and number two overall pick Jabari Parker overseas to coming and playing in the ACC Thats the level of competition Now he was a reserve He was a role player in that league but thats the type of player hes been accustomed to playing against Yeah So that just the size of opponent is is smaller and speed is slower and uh hes able to again hes got great guil skill set Hes not just out here you know bullyballing guys Hes his ability to be able to put the ball on the floor and knock down midrange shots And hes already got one triple tonight Look at this half court pass Elijah Gertru just into the game Missed in transition there trying to clean it up to Ritter Now Grunlos got his hands on it He and Mustaf got tied up They went in there fighting for that ball down there amongst the cheerleaders there Neither one of them wanted to get that ball up I think theyre going to call that a tie up Yeah jump ball on So Virginia will keep it on the alternate possession Well the Cavaliers came into this game in second place in the ACC a game back of Duke in the lost column with Clemson just behind but the Tigers lost in the opening game of our double header tonight on the ACC network as Derritter finishes So Clemsons lost three in a row The Tigers are now 10 and4 and Virginia holding on here is going to be able to give itself a little separation from third place and keep pace keep touch with first place Duke Yeah And and theyre doing it by getting on the glass These second chance points now up to 22 chance points for Virginia as Dongos able to go off hand off the glass and cut into that deficit Ditter has the last six Virginia points Give him 22 on the night Runo Among the things Virginias been working on lately another rejection for Grunlow is knowing when to go trying to find the best shot possible Gertrude misses in transition and they have had a lot of close calls lately Even though the Whos are riding a sixgame winning streak they want to play better basketball as we head towards March Yeah theyre theyre certainly doing it tonight There going to be no close game tonight obviously in their defensive ability right Theyre third in the in uh in the ACC and block shots And thats a nice little transition buck Was that Lacy Reeves there knocking down that little free throw line jumper Grunlo tries again This time hes got the rain and immediately glance over to Ryan ODM right in front of us and a couple of words exchanged actually one way to the other The coach saying something to the player Yeah Well it was a little bit better than the one on Enzo shot out there up by 35 That one was true because you got that ball below the free throw line And again no defenders with within 10 ft of some of these Cavaliier threepoint shooters Kelly commits the foul on Mallalerie and once again one and done at that end for Georgia Tech Theyve had very little done on the offensive glass because Virginia has just been cleaning it up Fullale substitutions for Virginia Grunlo and Derritter head out Sam Lewis has returned as has Malik Thomas out there with Don Hall on Enzo and then the inbound man is Gertru returning scholarship player from a year ago Well yeah and this is an opportunity right you youve got these guys theyve been working hard in practice and dont always get the m the minutes because like you said theyve been having a lot of close basketball games I like to see coach ODM here going to some of these guys that dont have the opportunity to get a lot of minutes um to keep them excited about what the team is doing A chance to show their skill set And at the start of the day Joe Lardi had Virginia on the five line as the 17th team The net has Virginia as number 18 at the start of the day And they are close to moving up to the four line Although Alabama beat Arkansas in double overtime The other team right ahead of them playing tonight is Vanderbilt They were losing to Missouri at halftime And so if the Commodores lose perhaps the Cavaliers would move up to the four line Joey Brackets will get it all figured out for us by the end of the night I love Joey Brackets Hes down He he breaks it down even from game to game He doesnt even wait for all the games to finish If if the noon games done on Saturday hell readjust depending on who won who lost And we saw that last week we were at Virginia Tech when you you know they dropped even though they hadnt even played yet Dongo hammers it home One of the rare live ball turnovers that Georgia Techs been able to get tonight against this stingy Virginia bunch And coach Odum he had to go for a little stroll toward the end of the bench He did not like to see his team cough that thing up and give up an easy bucket in transition And so Jakari White will come in at the next stoppage Weve got 722 remaining in the second half Gertrude trying to take advantage now of Chatfield Able to shovel it over to Oni Enso for the layup Well it took Gertrude a while to find his big buddy over there on the other side of the painted area but he had a couple Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets that he had to fight off first but Mono uh sent that one home I thought he was going to slam it but uh just with the power layup Dongo in a crowd has it knocked away and out of bounds Georgia Tech will keep it But Virginia from soup to nuts in complete control Number one Michigan music 630 Eastern time on ESPN Thats the game that I most want to see Yeah I mean youve got Yaxel Lenden the best player on the best team in the country who have just been destroying opponents this year Can they handle Cam Boozer and the Blue Devils who are playing as good a defense as anybody in the country Yeah you mentioned Lindberg Hes got 144 points per game seven and a half rebounds But its not hes just not the only story Theres four other dudes averaging in double figures on that squad as well So Cam Boozer and the Blue Devils they really got their work cut out for them And Dusty May and his crew have got it working in Ann Arbor And I Mara another one who has transferred in from UCLA a big a real true rim protector coming up Saturday night 630 from Washington DC on ESPN I had a last year in the NIT and that kid is just energy in motion Hes got a fantastic u ability to score the ball down in that painted area Shoots 50 from the field Uh and if he catches it with two feet in the paint just put two points on the board Yeah good chance hes going to be the first upper classman drafted this year in the NBA draft after the run of freshman The former UAB Blazer might be the top guy who is not a first year And again since were doing a Virginia game I should be saying first year not freshman They are first years there on the grounds Speaking of first years how about the draft prospects Caleb Wilson in action coming up Hopefully in action at Syracuse 100 on ABC on Saturday Flemings Boozer and unfortunately BYU has also suffered a huge injury and so AJ Deans will have more on his plate But so much talent in this freshman class Yeah it really is And hey I know hes not really a true freshman like you said but watching our kid D Ritter operate here in his first trip through the ACC has been impressive as well as that was kind of a wild shot underneath there by Kuazi Ree and hit the bottom of the backboard Well there goes another terrific freshman and Mallerie couldnt finish We spent a bunch of the last couple of days talking about theres up above the rim We spent a lot of time talking about who is going to make the ALA ACC freshman team and it seems like there are four guys who are probably locks It is just star studded this year and weve got a battle for that fifth spot Although the way Tester Ritters been playing tonight it may not be an argument Off the turnover here comes Craft And you see Boozer Aorei Wilson and Brown the headliners true star power from 1 to four in what will be the ACC all rookie team almost certain when we find out next month and by some people on this roster and thats what we started the broadcast Ryan ODM talking about the the fact that guys have sacrificed roles was a top 100 recruit hometown kid decided to go to UVA regardless of the coaching change and then accept this role and hes been marvelous right from the start yeah he he hes the guy that you really liked and uh I could see why kids got the Ford motor strapped to his back the way he flies up and down the floor Tech has a 6 run I also wanted to throw out Dame Sar the freshman for Duke Hes only averaging about five points per game but if you watch the Blue Devils he is kind of the head of the snake for what could be the best defense in the ACC White around and out Tech making a little bit of a push here They trailed by as many as 38 The last time there was a 39point lead in an ACC game Got to go back a couple of years Actually back to 2021 Last time Virginia led anybody by that many They had a 39point lead December of 23 against North Carolina Central And in spite of that Coach Odin is seeking perfection as well He should Yeah you see him fired up right there Hes telling his squad Take care of the basketball It doesnt want these careless passes thatll lead to careless turnovers Heres Chatfield Finds Craft Got a good look and a rebounding foul underneath Got big dongo down there rustling underneath trying to get on that offensive glass They havent been able to get many offensive rebounds but that time gaining advantage Oh looks like its going to be Kaci Reeds going to the line to shoot the front end of a one and one here Fouls on Thomas That is his third personal And yes Kesi Keon Reeves Jr at the free throw line And before he puts his first up Ditter and Hall return for Virginia Thomas and Mallerie go out Tomorrow night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the Nothing But Net Crew will break down music the night in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend and early next week Weve got yall covered all season right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Glaci is able to put both of those down now to get to a dozen points in the game Well Virginia caught a break there on a dangerous pass Somehow Don Hall came away with it and came up with two points I thought Dongo had the the steel right here in half court right in front of us It almost looked like he had two hands on the ball but Crafty Hall snatched it away and was off to the races Dongo turns down three and then is fouled on the baseline by Johan Grunlo Well obviously being down by so much you got to slap the fullourt press on him there But a nice pass there uh by Jakari And somehow Dono just did not come up with that ball And I dont know how many dunks on the on the year halls got but hes happy to have that one right there Uncontested they have had except for the New Years Eve game in Blackburg against Virginia Tech The same starting lineup and the guys all nine of their regular players have largely had the same role And Scott you can speak to this when you were playing for Dean Smith at North Carolina in your 15 years in the NBA you wanted to know what your role was Yeah it makes you a better player right It gives you an opportunity to go out there especially if your your role lets your talent shine minimize your weaknesses as well But I love this by the Cavs They said they they play with pace They share the ball Uh and they defend by dictating and disrupting the offense And thats exactly what they have done uh to this Virginia to this uh Georgia Tech team here this evening They have just dup disrupted their offense They had nine run or three runs of nine points or more in the first eight minutes of this low gets in deep and hooks it in Yeah its been Virginias ability to get just about anything that they want offensively throughout most all of this basketball game has probably been the most impressive thing and the way they they clear their defensive glass Uh really not allowing Georgia Tech many opportunities for second chance points Well thatll take us to our final media timeout What happened to that Yeah I I dont know exactly I think I I ate my hair along with all the other Big Macs Ive had over the course of the year but uh yeah I look pretty good with hair Ill tell you what I see Oh yeah I see why I had a couple dates in college All right Well I uh I have enjoyed this year with you going around to different ACC stops to see the memories come out of you And weve got a stoppage and a timeout according to Joey Brackets If things hold out right now Cal first four out and Virginia Tech in the next four out that of as of this morning But as weve talked about Joey Brackets will have everything formulated once again before he goes to bed tonight I I love that But yeah how about the stronger ACCs this year right Obviously with Duke being the the cream of the crop there But with Clemson Virginia some of his other squad Louisville we can make some noise in the tournament this year Craft off the turnover You know what Georgia Tech has outscored Virginia here in the second half Yeah and like I said it its tough for kids even though no matter how good a squad is when youre playing uh with a 35 point advantage you just get a little loosey goosey and coach ODM is trying to fight against that because he knows how big the game he has on uh Saturday is going going to be so against NC State So you dont want some of this late spillage to cheering seep over into the game on Saturday How about that rim rock Elijah Gertrude came up with the steal and had a burst that I didnt know he had 9162 Reeves Tough shot Jakari White grabs it 240 remaining in regulation Virginia has led right from the start Gertrude Another rebound for Endongo How about that move by Jakari White though that penetration and then the whip pass through the defenders right on target to his partner out there on the threepoint line Dongo gets the roll And I think White if he had realized it could have had layup The defenders went flying He was already thinking pass If he had just looked up to the rim I think he had a lefthanded layup Yeah I think sometimes his body is moving faster that his mind can even process how quickly he is open and he had and again one thing on his mind when he got inside there was to go right and pitch and the way theyve been knocking in triples tonight I I dont think that was such a bad play at all find his partner wide open off the line and you said Guit had already you had the jam sometimes you finish off that jam with a nice jumper from the outside was probably the last well see him dongo tonight he came on he got 13 points in this in this game But all in the second half yeah all that foul trouble in the first half really put Georgia Tech kind of behind that eightball and they could never really you know get their their footing and then it allowed Virginia to kind of run away with this game and put it to bed in the first half Makes a pair Cavalier substitution number 35 Now he will come out We get our first look at Carter Lang a 69 red shirt sophomore from Charlottesville Also out of St stands Bellefield the powerhouse school a mile or two from JPJ So he grew up in the shadows of the arena in which he plays in now Is that what youre telling Just like Chance Mallerie Yep Contested finish for Mustaf He is the lead score for Georgia Tech tonight 18 is a new careerhigh or it matches his careerhigh from last year against Central Arkansas Mallerie under control waiting there to block it though was Reeves Craft back to Reeves Craft from way down Yeah Kras got a couple good looks from behind the yard She just again not able to find the range because Virginia does such a good job of challenging all those threepoint shots Nice offensive board by that young man coming in Little lane coming in cold off that bench Now hes going to crack up a three Carter Lang cant get the roll Good work inside by Martin Carrer the VCU transfer who followed Ryan ODM from Richmond to Charlottesville He didnt play for the Rams last year getting an opportunity to play for coach ODM here tonight You mentioned it right Like its all the guys on the bench now like Hall and Derritter uh cheering these guys on that dont get an opportunity to play as much because when theyre in the game theyre the ones cheering them on So they appreciate that This is a real tight group considering how many new faces and players and talents uh and personalities that they have They have come together quickly and gelled And sometimes you got to have the the best player in the league to be the best one of the best teams in the league Sometimes you just need the best chemistry uh to have one of the most successful squads And thats exactly what they got cooking there over there in Charlottesville Yeah this is just the fifth ACC game Carrer has gotten into this season He knocks the ball out of bounds and it looks like itll stay with the Yellow Jackets So for Georgia Tech theyre on the verge of losing for the eighth straight time and falling to 2 and 12 again this year Only 15 of the 18 teams in the ACC will qualify for the ACC tournament to be played in Charlotte this year And for the Yellow Jackets that is very much in play along with Pit Boston College Notre Dame Those are the four teams currently at the bottom of the standings Three of them will not qualify for the conference tournament Wow what a performance by the Virginia Cavaliers showing every bit of being the 14th ranked team in the country here tonight Great showing and um I like the way they prepared this morning They were locked in for their morning shootout and they brought that same focus and intention
