Scoreman Zack Randolph Uh he is light on his feet Again he is a guy that can do a lot of damage around the basket with his scoring or passing Its hip controlled by the Eagles as we are off and running Great to have you with us on the ACC Network Heres Claudell Harris Charleston Southern transfer coming off a 22point night against Vanderbilt on Tuesday The step back jumper is good Well he provides that dimension to this Boston College team You need to get a bucket hes a guy that can do it Quick hands for Zachary Harris in and out The rebound for Ben Middlebrooks Inserted it to the starting lineup by Kevin Keats after he had 13 points a careerhigh against Miss on Wednesday First start of the year for the Clemson transfer And that might be to defend Quenton Post Well see what the matchups go But this is the marquee matchup right here These two big guys going at it Burns only had five points for the Wolf Pack in their disappointing loss in the ACC SEC challenge on Wednesday night in Oxford Cs offense must be effective moving it from side to side but Harris says Ill take a three Well he liked that match up there again NC State switched Hes got a big on him backing up Thats two big time shots to start the game off Hes 61 points shy of a thousand in his career Over 20 games in double figures last season for Charleston Southern Burns on the baseline against post to Middlebrooks Applause and a kick ball So Claude Harris wide open and this right here sometimes your offense breaks down Middle Brooks is out on him He thinks thats a mismatch and I would agree with him Thats a deep contested three and Claude Harris has got it going early on for Boston College Eagles with a new 20 or Wolf Pack with a new 20 to shoot Heres Casey Morel deflected by Prince Alipe Marcel the Virginia transfer who averaged 11 last year Hes up to 14 this year and hes a guy that could be outstanding on the offensive end Earl Grant talked about energy uh his team needed to be locked in early against this NC State team early on Uh theyre a more energetic team beating off the crowd Morel to step back too strong and Alipe the rebound BC can get eight and seven for Prince Alipbee Theyll take that Right Well I think its that along with again key staff to watch turnovers What a take by Post Too strong with the layup attempt Here comes NC State in transition for Middle Brooks Missed the bunny but contact Foul on BC Well this is the area that Boston College wants to keep NC State out of They dont want to give them transition buckets That time off the miss Uh NC States a team again they want to get out in transition and get offense before that BC defense can get set Middle Brooks gave them a boost off their bench Wednesday He had 10 points by himself in a 10 to nothing run against Old Miss He was really the lone bright spot And I think the uh reason hes in this game starting lineup that to go along with right now hes matched up against Quenton Post when they go manto man after the foul on Jaden Zachary Hes hounded in the back court gets by the defender Jaden Taylor the transfer from Butlers joined by another transfer Arizona State DJ Horn as its out of bounds off of Claude Harris and Wolfpack basketball NC State traditionally one of the top turnover forcing teams not only in the conference but in the nation And youll live with that Although you dont like turnovers its not a live ball turnover Thats the area when we spoke with Earl Grant he said Look we do not want to give them live ball turnovers Lee Bait gobbles the rebound Hour will be counted on for a lot of offense this year by Kevin Keats Hes fourth on the team in scoring Just a little over 11 points per game Devin McLockton skips a pass for Jaden Zachary Post popping out over 50 from distance but hes going inside and gets pulled down by Middle Brooks Pat Driscoll the veteran official all over the foul on Ben Middleg Yeah thats great positioning by the veteran Pat Driscoll right here Again he just grabs his shirt And that looked like it was going to be a bucket or right there a foul I like what Boston College is doing right now Theyre moving Quinton Post Not just posting him up down low and the block but theyre moving him up to the threepoint line and then getting him isolated and giving him space to operate Mohamd Diara checks in for the pack Diara is a transfer from Missouri They have seven firstear players in this program as Post tries the jump hook Taylor one of those seven brought in by Kevin Keats Theyre an old team Thats what he wants to do is he wants to be old every year And thats key for all these teams You need some veteran experience Here comes Claudeell Harris Thank you very much West Durham with Malcolm Huckabe Im John Mina Perrell BC off to a nice start with a fivepoint lead NC State has missed all four of its field goal attempts Well the energy for Boston College to start this game off Uh Earl Grant must be pleased uh with that aspect of his teams game thus far early on Theyre the more energetic team right now Kiara trying the onehanded slam Got flustered by Post Here come the Eagles An erratic start to say the least for the Pack Music Post punched away Here comes DJ Horn The half skip on the jump and the conversion That was pretty beautiful move that time by Horn And thats the one area Earl Grant and staff talked about Boston Couts cannot give up live ball turnovers Thats NC State staple They want to get points off of their defense Orange shooting 35 Wolfpack shooting 44 as a team An awkward move by Deon McLockton against DJ Burns in the post and its off of Zachary ML Harris got BC going a transfer from Charleston Southern He was impressive from the Wolfpack The ACC opener for both teams BC has five wins NC State has four in its first six And we know that man DJ Burns is a offensive facilitator He has three leading games in assists out of their first six Yeah he can beat you in so many ways He can score down low on the block but what uh the coaching staff of Boston College was concerned about his passing Hes second on the team NC State in assist Hes a very good passer from that post position DJ Horn at the point for Burns at the elbow Post guarding him Burns got it They called him DJ Buckets when he played at Win and he got one And coach Keith said he probably could be the mayor in rally He is such a charismatic kid Really really enjoy speaking with that young man And again he is just so talented down there That time Boston College does not double and he gives him a little sky hook that time over post He did say a mayor with a caveat though They have to win Well thats like anywhere Hey look if youre losing games certainly not going to be that popular but again hes so important to what NC State does offensively Born too strong Elite Bay fighting for the rebound Punches it to the Eagles Donald Han who just checked in Quinton Post Hes the engine for BCs offense Hes become dynamic And credit to uh the Boston College co coaching staff Hes not only turned into one of the better players in the ACC but in college basketball he is putting up ridiculous numbers And I think the big reason why hes a matchup problem Yes he can score in the block but hes over 50 from the threepoint line thats very difficult to match up against A modernday big man Those that can shoot the three theyre invoked Elite Bay on the baseline and the rebound engulfed by Mo Diara Here comes Michael Okonnell Stanford transfer One of those seven first year newcomers for Kevin Keats Burns gives NC State its first lead And thats one of their best offensive possessions right there A little rub screen Patience by Casey Morcel And thats a nice little bounce pass to DJ Burns Their offense now is starting to pick up Eagles riding a scoreless drought of more than two and a half minutes That was a problem for them last year They won 16 games as Post back rims it Okonnell at the elbow is bumped by Elite Bay BC has DJ Burns rules on defense What does that mean Well right here though again offensively these are his rules dribble drive Uh the help is there and thats excellent offense by NC State On the other end right now Boston College the problem John is theyre settling for jumpers NC States doing a great job defensive rebounding Theyre blocking out and not giving Boston College any second chance opportunities Okonnell the inbound for Burns That was an easy look over Quinton Post And the problem with uh doubling Burns we talked about it Hes one of the better passing bigs If you double him he can pass out of that Right now though single coverage he is having his way Donald Han way off the line The freshman whose father was a star in Virginia from 97 to 2001 Open three They got it That was DJ Horn He was given a lot of air space Well early on in this game Boston College they were the more energetic aggressive team but they were getting quality looks Right now that has changed NC State thats beautiful transition offense right there Dribble drive draw two guys kick out to the corner for a wide open three Elite Bay takes the three BC scoreless drought over three and a half minutes NC States riding an 11 to nothing run but a travel call by Kurt Smith on Michael OConnell as NC State has built its largest lead at six points And you cant run transition offense any better than that right there Again that was a concern for Boston College transition defense Thats what NC State wants to do They want to either turn you over get out and get in transition or off of misses That time dribble drive The help was not there Collapse your defense And then the end result a wide open corner three NC State right now in this last five minute stretch has been very good offensively Theyve made four of their last five shots to increase their shooting output to 42 NC State shooting just 31 from three Chaz Kelly the post on Middlebrooks A power against power and he picks up a foul Is that an aspect of post game that hasnt improved Yeah and I like that uh change up Again the last three possessions for Boston College John were all contested jumpers outside of the paint Give your best player right there a chance to get a touchdown low in the post and then either get him to the foul line or hes going to get an opportunity to get a deuce Thats a good adjustment by Boston College Again theyve been stacking really the last three four possessions Get some paint touches BC is the third best free throw shooting team in the country at 83 Another uptick in their offensive output That number was down at 70 the last couple years Brooks out of the lineup for Kevin Keats And Daryl Grant was really honest with us You asked Hey coach any you know any secrets to that He said I cant take too many I cant take any credit for that Guys have just been making free throws But certainly it helps when they get to the free throw line In particular Quenton Post draws so much attention You got to make those freebies Earl Grant said he had a few sleepless nights already this year after their loss to Lyola Said he couldnt sleep for four nights That happened in Kansas City They rebounded nicely since that point Chaz Kelly sophomore guard from Houston in the front court to McLockton baseline What a nifty move by Allen And you can see the change again Attack to paint Thats something Boston College wants to do They dont want to settle for contested threes The drive See if you can get some paint touches off the bounce or post entry passes Harris building off his 22point night against Vanderbilt Has seven Good defense by the Eagles Armani mighty But Claudeel Harris they brought him to Boston College with this in BC shooting 31 as they trail the five four and two Wolf back but percentage of threepointers 27 that number has to increase Yeah and thats really not a strength of their game Again they have to make some Theyve been better this year percentagewise and also makes I think in this game right here you saw it the last two possessions they need to attack the paint If you get one off of a dribble drive thats fine But they dont want to start off shooting contest for threes Okonnell The pocket pass is stolen by Chaz Kelly Here come the Eagles with numbers They slow it down in the front court Drive by Kelly Rebound for Armani Mighty who puts it up and in And he draws a foul Mighty is someone they probably expect maybe 5 to 10 minutes a game Thats a big time offensive rebound and put back Again the emphasis by Boston College attack the paint dont settle for jumpers Thats something uh Coach Grant talked to us about at shootaround Uh we must try to get paint touches Theyve done that on their last three possessions Foul was on Mo Tiara his first with Mighty at the line To give you an idea Mightys averaging only six minutes a game less than a point That was his third field goal in just seven attempts thus far as Diara has the board Coach Grant uh and both these teams talk about uh adding some depth Diara and an N1 So Modiara has an offensive arsenal He had a double double in his first game as a wolf back Thats a beautiful move As you take a look at Coach Keats resume we talked about it coming off the NCAA appearance last season Both these guys uh do a really good job in the player development area And hes got to be pleased right here how his team has responded to the initial surge that Boston College had to start this game off They went up early 72 but then its been NC State on the other end Offensively Ive been impressed with their spacing and ball movement Theyve had some high quality looks Kevin Keat said its about growing and trusting for this team with so many new players It feels like its been slow to develop thus far He was outspoken about that after the game against Old Miss when they lost by 20 He says Were still trying to become a cohesive team Yeah And I think this is the area right here that he said Look we have to set the tone defensively They try to get 40 deflections every game Uh theyre going to get out and contest the passing lane and theyre going to try to make it difficult for you to run your offense Zachary and Harris in the back court for the Eagles with Mlock in post and Mason Mats it up front A fade away by Harris and a transition opportunity for Diara who missed the slam He was flumxed by Claude Harris who crashed into the BC cheerleaders on the baseline And here comes Post on a triple team and he travels Thats a break for Boston College again The contested three Thats good hustle Lets see if theres a foul Yeah he looked like he might have got him on the arm there Kevins not happy And I think hes got a valid argument again from that angle there It was so quick So but certainly again thats a break for Boston College because thats another transition bucket denied That was part of Earl Grants keys to the game Transition defense defending the three limiting turnovers What youd expect but a lot of times its easier said than done Under 10 to shoot a wild pass a deflection for the Eagles with Zachary He blows the layup BC ball with 20 to shoot Eagles have only made two of their last 11 buckets Yeah I think right now uh credit NC State again you know defensively thats what they want to do I think Post is a guy that needs to get some touches right now Too many contested jumpers by Boston College Try to play through Quinton Post Get him isolated in particular with this lineup out here If DJ Burns is guarding him let him go to work That foul was on DJ Burns Away from the ball comes another substitution Kevin Keats substituting liberally Giara hits the bench Applause and mainly uh John right now what hes doing hes just rotating bodies at went post but Kevin said look thats the matchup that we have to win again hes going to get his points we just want to make sure theyre contested and hes not getting easy uh looks from beyond the arc or in the post Zacharys been quiet for the Eagles he had eight assists a career high against Vanderbilt Three by Devin Mclackton Not usually his best shot The rebound for DJ Horn And theres a three by Jaden Taylor who averaged 12 last year to leave Butler Well you can see the contrast in offense Early on Boston College they were getting some good looks That has changed Right now NC State again in transition Beautiful secondary break Thats a self the second pass Sloppiness on the offensive end continues for the Eagles as NC State has made five of its last 11 or seven shots BC scoring drought now up over two minutes Coaching staff not happy with that post entry pass Again Quint Mo hes there Hes got two feet in the paint Just got to be a better pass Thats a missed opportunity right there for Boston College Bourne trying to knife through the defense Ball stuck too much for the Wolf back in their last outing Not the case in the early going today Earns the hook shot Post fights for the rebound and draws contact from Ross whos whistled for the foul And right here again theyre staying home Theyre not doubling off uh and theyre allowing Quinton Post to play him straight up That time he wins out but thats going to be a theme that we watch if DJ Burns continues to score at the rate that he has early on You see first half free throw percentage is 50 attempts through seven games So theyre only averaging 15 which may explain why they have been so effective at the line But Rogren says Were trying to drive the lane more Thats where we want to get to draw more free throws Yeah And again because theyre not a particularly great threepoint shooting team he said Look were a team that wants to get after you defensively uh theyve done that Now the question is offensively can we be patient and then try to attack the paint Another three for the Pack and the weak side rebound after the miss by Taylor by Mclackton Eagles zero field goals the last 245 Up and under by Zachary and a foul Good idea by Jaden Zachary Absolutely Because its in the paint again Its simple Uh Coach Grant said Look attack the paint off the bounce or trying to get post or other guys posted up there in the paint area Thats going to be the key to this game On the other side Kevins talked about it Look we have to set our defense keep Boston College out of the paint get stops force turnovers and then we need to be a transition team And Jay Zachary is a throwback player probably a guy that you played with many years ago and that type of glue guy a guy that Earl Grant likens to Matim Cle when he played at Michigan State And thats a great analogy right there And he said look he loves the way he operates Uh he brings that leadership Hes a guy thats been around And I think the big thing for him his assist numbers really have been fantastic to go along with one of the top steel guys in the ACC Music Zachary at 11 points per game A bump from Horn but no foul Burns foul line extended back for the Arizona State transfer horn Marcel joins him in the back court Taylor also part of their three guard attack Two to shoot for DJ Burns Baseline put back Diara just beat the clock That was effective Yeah And nobody blocked him out that time but just great work Really not much to it He just crashed the offensive glass Nobody put a body on him and thats an easy uncontested deuce What a game thus far from Mo Diara Eight rebounds five points off the bench A lead bay crosscourt for Mason Matson who led BC with 40 threes last year If he can be a 35 to 40 threepoint shooter that will make BC a better team And thats not a bad look that time off of good ball movement just unable to connect And now uh NC State again I like their patience Theyre just going to DJ Burns and let him go to work That has been the formula Boston College has got a decision to make right now Do you leave him alone or you got to go double I think you got to dig Maybe not double but you got to send somebody over there cuz right now he is just scoring too easy Burns has eight to lead the pack Zachary penetrates ran into the diara wall Patriscoll said theres contact against BC and Prince Alipe So DJ Burns is going to work on the baseline spinning past Quinton Post The Wolfpack lead remains seven Header for mens college hoops on ACC Network First its Ruters taking on Wake Forest at 6 Eastern South Carolina faces Clemson to wrap up the night Always outstanding action on the ACC network Last night on ESPN 2 you watched Yukon and Kansas Yukon 13ame win streak was snapped What a game Yeah really good game Great time of the year right now And uh we got a game right here in KI forum Uh credit NC State Oh theyve done a nice job playing through DJ Burns and he has really been the guy that they have not had an answer for in this first half thus far Think about how awkward it could be Malcolm on defense to play against Burns And we talked about his passing ability one of the better passing bigs in college but right now theyre just letting him isolate That time they put him on the free throw line Theyre moving him Theyre putting him on the wing putting him on the block threepoint line foul line Theyre putting him in different positions to get isolated And the concern is his passing ability Thats something that Boston College and the staff was concerned about If we double uh hell give guys a lot of open looks And last February the fifth worst loss at home ever for BC to NC State 30point loss Burns had 18 and 10 and the Pack made 15 of 30 threepointers This is their largest lead of the game at eight Burns wants to get seven assists Earl Grant knows that Thats what Kevin Keats wants too Yeah and I think right now they got to do a better job Boston College uh getting into the paint Thats not a good sign right there Turnover Casey Morcels been quiet Zachary the rebound Vadell Harris directing traffic looking for Elite Bay Now he holds Almost traveled and hes comes up lane Looks like he turned an ankle Three by Morcel Airspace connects So dicey moment for BC with Claude Harris their second leading scorer headed to the bench with an apparent ankle injury Yeah thats huge He went down immediately Got isolated on DJ Burn Yeah he just Oh he turned that over good and he knew it immediately Tried to elevate Lets hope that young man is okay You said it Second leading scorer and so important to what they need in terms of having that second option and a guy that can go get you a bucket off the bounce A game of runs for the Pack This is an eight to nothing run BCs scoring droughts have been hindering their cause Mlakton nice back cut and an equally good pass by Post Yeah both these bigs we talked about it DJ Burns Quinton Post but both guys that are willing passers they draw so much attention But lets see the adjustment now by Boston College if they decide to send somebody at DJ Burns Morcel the take against Elite Bay Burns too strong Heres Zachary Donald Hand on the floor for the injured Claude Harris He gets the ball from post The three is good for the freshman coming back from a torn ACL Thats just the second three of the game for BC in eight attempts Taylor is fouled by hand You know how tough it can be to come back from an injury especially an ACL But Donald Han they think might get 22 minutes a game by the end of this month And this will be key for Boston College Again Quinton Post hes going to draw attention Thats a beautiful find by Quinton Post Hand again a guy coming back from that injury Coach Grant staff said Look theyre trying to get him not to try to get it all packed in one game Its going to take time but thats certainly a good sign if youre Boston College and knocking down threes Fade away from the corner is good as Jaden Taylor gains more confidence Taylor has five Burns has nine Tiara has five Horna has five Production all over the sheet with a pack post Rough sluting for him Theyre making it difficult Yeah And thats good Just really mantoman defense right there in the post Again you know hes going to score They just want to make sure theyre contested Theyre doing a good job of making everything difficult for Quinton Post right now Bourne takes the three and makes the three Well hes smooth isnt he Thats a beautiful step back again Lot of space created off the bounce Uh thats a big time shot brought him in as a combo guard Coach Kevin Keat says he needs to get better defensively but his offense its pretty good Zachary takes the three and he connects Applause swapping long balls Thomas Burns on postlocked in the weak side rebound Here comes Zachary to hold for BC Zachary has turned it over just 12 times this year He has 34 assists Eagles drastically better taking care of the ball from last season when they went 16 and 17 former high school tight end on the baseline And thats the play right there Boston College needs to do Put DJ Burns in the ball screen Force him to heads and recover That time they went out Im going right back to that If Im Boston College ISO him on the wing put him in the ball screen and make him have to defend on the perimeter High dribble by Horn Diara fights with post on a 5050 ball and the possession is towards the pack That will bring us to a timeout Devin Mockton Hes nimble says Earl Grant 3226 John I think this right here though is going to be a formula for Boston College Put DJ Burns in a ball screen Force him to either hedge or flatten out Either way hes got to recover and and cover a lot of space on the defensive side I think thats going to be a play Boston College needs to go to but hes out on the court And Deon Mccclacton is one of those instrumental players that Earl Grant wants to build around He says hes part of this foundation He had a chance maybe to leave in the portal but he said to Deon Mlakton and Jaden Zachary and Quinton Post were building a house here If you guys leave youre going to be renting a room for a year Well credit though right now in this game NC State so impressive John how theyve run their offense uh with standing that initial run by Boston College to open the game up NC State has been really good at getting high percentage looks that time on the out of bounds underneath Theyre just getting some wide open looks Theyre executing on the offensive end Today our crews have you covered in Charlotte at the ACC Championship game between Louisville and Florida State Coverage begins at 6 Eastern with ACC Huddle Continues after the game right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app showdown Seinals try to remain in the thick of the college football playoffs the fourth ranked team in the country Jaden Zachary four for four at the line State Music Hes had an impressive first half moving the ball on the offensive end and DJ Horns been main part of it and he gets the nice roll off the back iron I really have been impressed with Horns change of direction He is shifty that time Crafty little head fake and then soft touch from the foul line Thats a big time bucket Not bad defense Thats just a guy with a big time offensive reparing Applause pass And thats been there John Again NC State anytime you play a team like that theyre aggressive in the passing lanes you can get some back doors Applause Casey Morel Tiar has been terrific this half for Burns dealing on post and a double tied up by Chaz Kelly He was industrious tying the ball up and you now see the adjustment by Boston College Earl Grant has seen enough of DJ Burns going to work I like how they doubled though They doubled from the baseline but that time he could not see the double coming Again he has good court vision Watch this back door though right here Anytime you play against a team like NC State thats aggressive in the passing lanes you must get some back doors going just to loosen up that defense Excellent execution that time by Boston College That was Devin McLaclin playing quarterback The old high school allstate Georgia tight end Kelly draining the clock 1 second differential Shot clock game clock Guarded by Horn Take Mlakton The three And hes got it Devin McLockton from downtown The fourth three in 10 attempts in the half And BC ends with some offensive production They only led 7 to6 at the 1458 mark but this should help their cause This is one of the few open looks Boston College has had I think if youre Kevin Keats youll live with MLK that down but again better execution to close the half out for Boston College Eagles shooting 38 NC State 47 threepoint Wolfpack lead The Hill with Malcolm Aabita Prell Great to have you with us on the ACC Network Our first half highlights Malcolm Some interesting offense for the Wolfpack led by DJ Burns Yeah he was impressive in the first half Nine points Every time Boston College left them alone uh he had an answer Uh for me though DJ Horn uh hes got a big time midrange game He got it going early in the first half for NC State And then credit NC States defense Theyve done a nice job bottling up Quinton Post but theyre going to need more of this right here Theyre going to have to make DJ Burns defend Earl Grant said it going into the half Uh Mlakton and other guys are going to have to step up and hit some perimeter jumpers when theyre left wide open Your numbers BC cold from the field The good news for them And over the last five minutes they outscored the Wolfpack 159 in the first half but fast break points are glaring And that was a key to the game for Real Grant to stop that And a lot of those were off of turnovers again uh turnovers or quick contested shots imbalanced by Boston College And thats what NC State wants to do Uh they want to get out in transition before the Boston College defense can get set On the other side I think Boston College they got to get more patient again Uh more ball reversals Uh they were shooting some quick shots early in the shot clock Be more patient offensively against this NC State defense BC with just five turnovers as NC State usually forces 15 per game So thats another bonus for the Eagles As Ben Middlebrooks inbounds as we start the second half NC State in the away red BC in the home white Eagles get Claudeell Harris back He was questionable to return with an ankle injury but he is back Scored seven quick points to start the night Almost a steal by Albe as Casey Morcel the Virginia transfer tracks it down to Burns Oh he can make a living on the baseline And there was confusion that time Boston College bench thought it wasnt tipped They thought it should have been back court Not of the case uh according to the refs And thats a nice little dribble drive bounce pass to DJ Burns Burns former Big Cell player of the year at Winthre Quinton Post to Claude Harris The Charleston Southern transfer The fadeaway and Taylor weak rebound Almost threw it away and DJ Horn had to come back with traveled Thats good job though by Jaden Zachary although veteran referee uh Viscos going to talk to him But this is huge right here having Harris back on uh the court He started this game off hot and then right there though turned his ankle over Looked a lot worse So again thats a good sign if youre Boston College him back out on the court the second leading scoreer Entered the game 18 for his last 33 from the field including 22 against Vanderbilt Eagles Terrific night against the Commodores on Tuesday in the ACC SEC challenge with the split 77 ACC win seven wins seven Harris to the rack an athletic maneuver on the baseline and thats the dimension he brings to this Boston College team Again shot clock winding down Isolate him He is a guy that can play off the bounce and make difficult shots Marcel had three first half points Hes averaging 14 Taylor got Mlakton in the air Five to shoot Long range Morcel rims it out fought with post for the rebound Both guys paddling Thats what you like to see though if youre grant again defensive rebounding he said was going to be huge in this game No second chance opportunities for this NC State team Eagles plus two rebounding They have 20 The Pack has 18 Post still scoreless from the floor but a foul on the Wolfback Well Claudell Harris has been so good early on for Boston College Look at what hes done the last four games That time again switched off middlebrooks Thats a mismatch that Boston College wants and they had great floor spacing and that time allowed him to operate from the high post 28 games in double figures for Claude Harris at Charleston Southern last year when he averaged 17 and a half Applause NC State has not trailed since BC led 76 at the 1458 mark of the first half What do you think the questioning by Earl Grant is over Well coaches are always working the refs I think though theyre going to need more uh defensive stops I think that was the issue early on or excuse me late in the second half NC State was getting some wideopen looks Horn the Arizona State transfer Burns over the top of Post and man he converts DJ Burns DJ buckets Thats a big time offensive rebound put back and that time Post didnt block him out and Burns just really uh cleaned up the offensive glass Harris the drive and NC State lost by 20 to miss and Burns only had five in that one Different story tonight Yeah that one right there again uh out of position DJ Burns doing a great job and hes got such soft hands Coach Keats just raves about him Big personality Uh but hes a guy that to me one of the better passing bigs in college basketball DJ Burns Foul is on DJ Horn Reminds you of Zack Randolph Absolutely A poor mans version Zack Randolph was one of the better NBA players but a DJ Burns reminds me hes got that same body type but very crafty and just understands how to play has soft hands and great footwork Ben Middlebrooks backed up PJ Hall at Clemson and an offensive foul says Bert Smith B Smith Lee Cassell Pat Driscoll the officiating crew Lets see right here again Nice He sold that one He sold that one right there But again its about the positioning I think thats the key thing Uh but the NC State bench I think rightfully so That one right there Again not sure if there was enough contact for him to go down like that Third foul on Middlebrooks who started for the first time today Tomorrow night the Huddle Crew will have their annual Selection Day special a twohour show that will include breakdowns and analysis of the ACCs Bullbound teams and their matchups Coverage starts at 6 Eastern on the ACC Network and the ESPN app Jaden Taylor my goodness a punctuation point on the steel Yeah he has been great Eight steals in the last five games he came into it That time Post had no idea Hes got great anticipation again Another steal Takes it away from Mlton who blocks in but he fouls him as Taylor crashes the baseline I said it Eight steals in the last five games coming into this one Thats a big time steal and finish Uh check the rim right here That is vicious And then the latest one right here Again just great anticipation Now if youre Boston College and the refs are going to take a look to see if this was anything Now again I dont think from that angle right there Hes just making a play on the ball So again I dont think I would be surprised uh if that warrants a flagrant foul at all Again hes making a play on the ball He actually looked like he got some ball there So I dont think theres much there other than a guy making a play on the ball B Smith Lee Cassell Pat Rriscoll the conference Now I think the question is did he make contact with the head Thats the key area And Lee Cassell will give us an explanation No upgrade to the flagrant one foul So it is not a flagrant and I think thats good Just two shots Yep And I think thats the right call on MLK I like this how this officiating crew It wasnt a long debate No you go over there you make sure you get the call right and then you play on And again I think thats a right call A good job by this officiating crew Again that one did not need a long debate Thats just a guy making a play on the ball and optimally thats what it should be Less time the better spent contemplating whether it was a flagrant as Kevin Keats clearly not happy Taylor hits the two And John heres the adjustment Boston College has to make They got it in the first half a couple of times You have to get back door cuts again NC State thats their staple Theyre going to contest any wing pass Theyre going to be aggressive in the passing lanes You got to be better with the ball Taylor is making a living forcing turnovers which is the hallmark of NC States defense we told you throughout the game And here it is again Best turnover margin in the ACC Thats Kevin Keats came to Raleigh and this is his 199th career game on the pack sideline Yeah and they shoot for 40 deflections a game I think theyre going to get to that number again if they keep up at this pace Boston College the adjustment Get some back door cuts Use ball fakes to try to loosen up this aggressive NC State defense See the eight turnovers for the Eagles Mocked in the lob Thats the first field goal of the game for the ACCs top scorer Quinton Post Yeah thats a beautiful high low that time Again a good seal by Quinton Post Makon with a beautiful post entry pass Oiara the Missouri transfer Hes giving them a boost off the bench Burns the fadeaway and the board from Post Two possession game as Zachary nice through the lane post takes the three aston got pushed to cross the lane Here comes Taylor in transition to Morel Burns industrious again Too strong though Morcel the board Boy theyve been active Three wide open DJ Horn gets it back The league bay takes it this time Double team against Zachary post Got it Not pretty but effective And that right there opportunistic in transition again Uh you have the numbers Thats a good read by Jaden Zachary Post has eight two field goals in seven attempts averaging 21 points Applause Chippy on the defensive end for Taylor Pounded by Zachary Stolen by Harris Twoon one And hes got a slam dunk My oh my That was special Music Defense turns into offense and a jacked up crowd at County for this is all set up Hustle play by Jaden Zachary on the floor and then the assist to Claudeell Harris Right now though Boston is an instigator for BC on both ends of the floor Yeah hes been the key in this 60 run right here Beautiful read to Quinton Post set him up for a nice little short jumper but its been his defense Pesky right here coming up with points off of turnovers He gets the steal and then off to Harris for the monster jam BC on a six to nothing run Scoreless drought Two and a half minutes for the Pack Zachary with two of BCs five steals Heres Jaden Taylor in the back court with Michael OConnell and DJ Horn DJ Burns and Mo Diara up front for the pack Burns Okonnell the Stanford transfer puts it in He graduated Stanford in three years with an economics degree in New York And John thats great job on the offensive glass Thats happened a couple times now in this game They have such great spacing The wings of Boston have to do a better job blocking out on the defensive glass High percentage shot from McLton rolls out and after a coachs timeout moments ago this is such an important week the week at ESPN as Quinton Post misses the bunny Please give now if you are capable vorgdonate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research DJ Horn at the baseline slipping by the BC defenders He is so shifty and weve seen that time and time again Great pull up game that time though getting right to the basket You have to respect his jumper that time Nice little hesy and finish Horn one of two in double figures He has 14 DJ Burns has 13 Zachary fadeaway He averages 11 points He has nine And Errol Grant calls him the glue He is the heart and soul of this team of the leader defensively but also a guy that can knock down shots for you as well Horn again Diara fighting for the loose ball and a 5050 win for Mo Diar whos had a terrific game He has 13 rebounds one shy of his careerhigh set against the Citadel on November 6th Its Donald Han checks in along with Chaz Kelly for the Eagles Music Connell inbounded 20 to shoot for the Pack Slide pass by Burns Outstanding And thats why I call him one of the better passing bigs in college Thats a beautiful back door pass for DJ Burns Right on target All he had to do was catch and lay it up Thats excellent execution that time Out of bounds underneath for NC State Taylor the beneficiary as Donald Han tries to force it and its a foul And John right here again Not many bigs can make that pass Thats beautiful read by DJ Burns Again he does so many things for them offensively He can score Uh but his biggest I think strength is his passing his ability to pass whether its a double team or within their sets and hell go to the bench for Kevin Keats along with DJ Horn Its Middlebrooks Morel OConnell Taylor and Diara for the pack Eagles with Zachary and Kelly in the back court along with Donald H and the put back Quinton Post has 10 11 shy of a season average Steel almost in court by Jaden Zachary So some energy on both ends of the floor but both squads dip and tuck and Horn and DJ Burns Those two guys combined for 27 points right here Horn on the defensive end Hes one of the better defenders in co in ACC uh getting it done on the defensive end But then on the other side Boston College doing a good job uh creating offense with their defense They have 12 points off of turnovers Here come the Eagles with a steal Chaz Kelly and hes got it in transition Another point off a turnover for BC Thats 14 points off turnovers for the Eagles And thats been the story in this game right now Boston College really we thought coming into this game NC State the team that wants to force turnovers Boston College doing a nice job getting some offense with their defense 10 turnovers for the pack as Prince Elite Bay gets up gingerly Has some injury issues throughout his short PC career Okonnell hounded in the back court by Chaz Kelly and he fouls him Now on the other side if youre NC State Boston College aggressive in the passing lanes try to get some back door cuts They were able to do that early in the first half Taylors shot engulfed by Donald Han Here comes BC Kelly had a terrific European tour in the summer Elite Bay the rebound Eagles out rebounding the pack by four Kelly aims for the three and Taylor steadying influence the Butler transfer Each team has not hit a three in the second half Middlebrooks the Clemson transfer and Bert Smith calls a foul on the Eagles Chaz Kelly Wednesday night its a double header for mens college hoops on ACC Network First its Ruckers taking on Wake Forest at 6 Eastern Then South Carolina faces Clemson to wrap up the night Dont miss it Standing action continues on the ACC Network After R1 well send it to Charlotte ACC huddle crew will take over and set the table for you for the ACC football championship tonight between Louisville and Florida State Lets see the adjustment if Boston College bring somebody to help Burns baseline Ball loose Horn hand on him from the elbow Hes got it That type of game for DJ Horn 16 points Came into this season 253 career threes A big time big pickup in the transfer portal for NC State And his pullup game really has been impressive this afternoon Not one ACC team wanted him in the portal but Kevin Keats was glad to take him as Prince Alipe draws contacts between Horn and Burns Theyve combined for 13 of the 21 NC State hoops Yeah he homecoming for him from that rally area And coach Keith talked about it He said Look out of high school not too many people on him Uh came into the transfer portal and they jumped on him right away and it has been a big time pickup for them You look at his numbers I think the biggest thing for him though uh the threes Uh he came into this season veteran guy but over 250 career threes made shooting 83 entering the game from the line Thats their sixth miss Theyre eight for 14 And Middle Brooks just whistled for his fourth foul So hell go to the bench replaced by Mohamed Diara Well Coach Keats has done a really nice job rotating guys in and out getting DJ Burns in and out uh getting some of the other bigs like Middlebrook Uh hes uh distributed the minutes with his front court Eagles most foul shots theyve missed in a game this year seven Third in the nation at 83 from the line Horn jab step and its pinned on the weak side What a block by Armani mighty Wide open three for a league bay and its an air ball Applause Well John what I like about this block a lot of guys may have punched that into the seats Keeps it in play Again thats a heads up play for him not uh to put that one into stands Keep possession for your team Mighty with his fourth block of the season giving Earl Grant some positive minutes tonight off the bench The sophomore from Toronto hasnt played much Still just learning how to play the game Hour the runner and Claude Harris Eagles more than two minutes without a bucket And for three Hes got it onepoint ball game John we saw him out here at shooter round and then a good hour and a half before the game as well too working on that same catch and shoot with the coaching staff Second three of the game for Donald Han Michael OConnell Low by OConnell Quick first step Thats a nice answer Again the heads was not there for Boston College And thats a nifty finish that time over the defender to Chaz Kelly Jab step in the lane and cant get it but hell go to the line Kellys become more aggressive offensively I mentioned his European trip but Donald Han will take this threepoint shooter And thats a rhythm shot right there That close out is late And again this is something we saw him working on shoot around and then an hour and a half before the game with the coaching staff Again when you play uh this time Post is not out on the court but they know those shots are going to be there for those guys in particular when youre out on the floor with Quinton Post So the foul shot issues continue are mighty mighty to the bench Post back in Hes g good a good two minutes with Elite Bay joining him on the bench But Eagles 50 from the line and thats going to hurt you Tight game like this Those are missed opportunities Lets see if NC States able to capitalize Theyve missed their last four from the line Taylor to Burns Hes got a season high in points DJ Burns 15 actually one shy of his season high Hes done it three times 16 is a season high Kelly pulls it back out John that last play by NC State Thats textbook pick and roll offense Post pass deflected out of bounds DJ Burns seven for 16 from the floor in 29 minutes Taylor yep DJ will take it on the baseline Big story in the second half for BC Ineffective at the foul line One for eight in the second half after they were seven for nine in the first Jaden Zachary driving the lane and he will go to the line after the foul was called on Jaden Taylor So Earl Grant said We have good foul shooters and we practice it a lot We also want to get to the lane and thats been a part of our success but no doubt frustrated by their inability to hit today Malcolm Yeah 8 to 17 in this game 740 to go Youre trailing five Certainly to close this game out Uh theyre going to have to hit some free throws to try to get back uh even in this game I like though their strategy their adjustment in that first half They were settling for contested jumpers Again the emphasis on attacking the paint Uh certainly that is where Boston College wants to be Before that Miss Zachary was five for five from the line NC State has led for more than 26 minutes trying to improve to five and two This is the ACC opener for both schools Pat Driscoll calls a foul on the seven foot transfer from Mississippi State Quinn post who is a candidate for national player of the year I know its early but the lines hes putting up monstrous only player in the nation with 219 24 assists per game and 23 blocks Different story for him though with 10 points and five rebounds Taylor back door and a foul They are driving Malcolm and theyre finding the cutter Well I tell you what thats the key right there The cutter Boston College aggressive in the passing lane right here Again hit back door Jaden Zachary hes gotten a couple of steals Thats a design play right there Again get it to Middlebrooks Fake like youre coming for a dribble handoff and youre going to have back doors Again the wings of Boston College and guards very aggressive playing the passing lanes Great addition by Kevin Keats to add Jaden Taylor Butlers leading scorer last year And he calls Taylor their best on ball defender Hes taking on the other teams best offensive player Havent seen Dennis Parker Oh and on the offensive side right now Boston College I think you have to get Quinton Post a touch uh he has not uh really had many opportunities Again uh put him in a ball screen try to roll him out or put him in a ball screen and try to dive him to the post Either way though I think hes a guy that needs to get a touch offensively if youre Boston College Applause He has 11 One of four Eagles in double figures out tie with Claude Harris for the team lead with 11 Screen by Diara Taylor to Okonnell Ify back cut by Mo Diara Applause and its BC ball Not a bad look by NC State again Another back door cut unable uh to get that layup to go right now Lets see where Boston College goes offensively Zachary takes the three Casey Morel has the rebound Is that a good idea No thats a quick one right there Again uh early in the offense I like that better Put post in a high screen and then let go from there And the answer by Casey Morcel has been quiet He has six points Both of them on threepointers is averaging 14 Post That was outstanding What a move by Quint Post And again the spacing but the post entry pass thats where you need to go if youre Boston College Let your best offensive player get a touch almost every offensive possession to close this game out So Post after no field goals in the first half has four in the second Ben Middlebrooks playing with four fouls coming off a career best 13 points against Miss and he puts it back Going to work down low Thats just great work on the offensive glass Post got the initial stop Bidds just kept at it grabbed his own rebound and put it right back up State has had the answer throughout the night The drive by Zachary and an M1 opportunity Zachary tireless Hes up to 31 minutes He averages more than 30 minutes per out Well right here again beautiful move by Zachary but this opposed Hes got to come out and hedge on that ball screen of Casey Morcel one of the more improved players uh in the ACC You said it averaging close to 15 points a game but hes shooting the ball well from the threepoint line And then on the other end I love what Zachary did right there Rejected the ball screen went baseline and theres that blue guy again as Coach Grant calls him And a nightmarish night continues at the free throw line Zachary does not convert on the M1 after the foul was called on Michael OConnell Eagles have missed 11 foul shots Theyre nine for 20 matching their season best trips to the line with 20 Colorado State was the other one that game they lost in Kansas City is the drive by Morcel is off the line but he picks up a foul Well Boston College came into this game as believe the second ranked team free throw percentagewise but that certainly is going to change after this game Foul was on Zachary his first Orcel has gained more confidence with each outing for the Pack Double figure score for them last year when they won 23 games and went to the NCAA tournament Our crews have you covered in Charlotte at the ACC Championship game between Louisville and Florida State Coverage begins tonight at 6 Eastern with the ACC Huddle continues after the game right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Dont miss a moment as Florida State tries to secure a spot for the College Football Playoffs So the counter punches for the pack have been prevalent DC trying to cut into this deficit Zachary the wild drive and a foul says Pat Driscoll Thats on Michael OConnell Third on the Stanford transfer And Boston College has used that play a couple of times now uh just using a side ball screen uh with Zaden Jaden Zachary and Quinton Post As you take a look at Zacharys numbers and the assist again a guy that leads them getting them in their position But I think the big thing for him the steals he really has turned into one of the better defensive guards in the ACC Zacharu 13 Impressive number when he scores 15 or more Theyve won nine of their last 10 Donald Hen to the bench Prince Alip Bay back in for Earl Grants squad Okonnell is sidelined by Kevin Keats So its Horn Porcel and Taylor in the pack back court with Burns and Middlebrooks in the front court Eagles counter with Zachary Harris Bay post and McGloin I think NC State is going to try to get Burns in the high ball screen and then roll him down to the post Orcel patient three Mlock to the board Triggers a fast break for Harris Comes up shy High percentage shot engulfed by Taylor Here comes Marcel Thats a great contest that time by Taylor without fouling again Verticality just went right up Forced Harris into a tough shot Burns the spin on post but rejected by Post Zachary and he threw it away Applause Missed opportunities for BC as they trail by five Pack have his second half scoring edge 29 to 27 They led by three at halftime UC has 10 turnovers Fade away by Marcel Cluadel Harris for Zachary down the lane with a left hand attempt Post and the reverse put back Post has 14 Well thats a good play by Boston College Run Uh Earl Grant said he wants to try to run uh when they get their opportunities A foul on Jaden Zachary And that will take us to our final immediate timeout When push comes to shove who will have the upper hand But right now John Boston College trailing by three This games going to come down to defending DJ Burns Thats a great individual defensive play by Quinton Post but then transition defense is going to be key for NC State that time missed the opportunity for both teams Boston College uh if they go back to the film free throws uh John that really has been the story line in this game Boston Colleges inability to convert at the free throw line On the other side NC State theyve been really good NC State has been to the line 11 times Theyve made 10 BC 11 for 22 from the line In the half theyre four for 13 Third best foul shooting team in the country entering the night Foul before the break was on Jaden Zachary his third AC Morcel at the line Former Gatorade player of the year in Washington DC Applause He has eight points Two for two at the line Played 29 minutes Applause Hes been solid for NC State Casey Morcel started his career off at Virginia and has just improved his offensive output every year One of the better perimeter defenders but now has turned into a reliable scorer Devin McLockton another terrific game for Earl Grant He has 11 points and seven rebounds BC rebounded by three post 11 second half points Not a bad first step And thats why hes a matchup problem You have to step out and honor his threepoint shot Nice little ball fake And thats a big time finish by Quint Post Eagles outscoring the pack by one in the second half Taylor the baseline lost the ball Burns to Taylor has been a nice combo but not that time Quinton Post again he shoots the three ball so well and as a sevenfooter has the ability to put it on the floor and thats a big time finish by Post The man trailing him was was Ben Middlebrooks who has four fouls And theyve done that a couple of times now If Im Boston College again go right back Give Quinton Post a touch Kelly to post Applause Zachary trying to cross over Backing in post on Diara Fadeaway Yes sir Quinton post feeling it And a timeout Kevin Ke BC has not led since it was 7 to6 at the 1458 mark of the first half We got a good one Dont go away Well take a 30se second timeout Be back right after this Post is the only ACC player to rank in the top five and scoring rebounds and blocks Uh this is a great execution by Boston College Gets your best offensive player a touch every time offensively He was cold in the first half Credit NC State They did a nice job defending him Now if theyre playing home single let him go to work Give him a touch every time On the defensive end what would you do if youre BC in the last 98 seconds Uh you got to send somebody at DJ Burns Theyve done a nice job digging You dont want to double off him though because hes such a good po uh passer Burns backing in on post and he matches him So Burns with a season high of 17 points We talked about this matchup at the tip Two of the best bigs in the ACC going at it DJ Burns Quinton Post Zachary spinning with a left hand A frenetic second half All tied at 68 in the final minute Applause Morcel under 10 to shoot for Burns Post calling for help and an air ball The key to that play Quinton Post pushed DJ Burns out of the post He had to catch that out on the wing Time out BC We will take another timeout Come right back after this When you order a Big Mac in the McDonalds app today youll earn points you can redeem for a free Big Mac in your future Future USA Thanks Earn free food with the app A thriller in Chestnut Hill NC State BC tied at 68 The defensive strategy What is it for NC State Well right now Boston College again Quinton Post did a nice job pushing DJ Burns He catches the ball outside of the paint Thats key Earl Grant likes that again when hes caught it two feet or one feet foot in the paint hes scored or hes been really difficult to handle post had to push him out he did it that time offensively right now theres no question Im putting went post Jaden Zachary in some type of ball screen action and go from there if Jaden Zachary can get to the basket fine if not you got post kick it out to him and then let him operate certainly though I dont think TJ Burns would be on the court in this situation for NC State for defensive purposes Post leads all scorers with 18 Burns both candidates for all ACC honors Burns with 17 He has been efficient coming off a fivepoint night against Old Miss But the key for this possession with 268 left in regulation is patience for BC Absolutely Obviously you dont want to go too quick Uh theres a differential on the shot clock and game clock Uh but uh certainly Jaden Zachary is going to have the ball in his hand and I assume Quinton Post is going to be in some type of ball screen action with him with the 4second differential shot clock game clock Zachary will hold at the logo eyed by Jaden Taylor now with five to shoot He drives towards the rack and he misses it The back attempt no good Quick outlet to Taylor Here he comes down the lane Puts it up and it is no good Music Earl Grant has taken the jacket off and he is frustrated Overtime Hes okay right now though John we got overtime Yeah he played 18 minutes Gave BC six points on two threepointers but it is overtime The first overtime Malcolm Huckabe for either team this year and an offensive foul dropped by Jaden Zachary and John Kevin Keats during shootound Talked to DJ Burns about that He said you cannot move on that high ball screen He went over it with him a couple times right there No argument that time uh from Coach Keats Thats not a good foul by DJ Burns right there He is too important for them to pick up fouls like that Burns with his third foul Applause Condensation on the floor They do play hockey at Johnny Floren They played hockey last night Nor Eastern beat BC last night here And you youre familiar with that condensation on the floor I am But Im thinking Im chalking that up how hard these guys have played Both teams really have played well and played very hard and physical in this game Post terrific second half but he forced it against Moiara And now Zachary goes down Here comes Taylor in transition Taylor has been a positive influence on this one with 13 points and six rebounds And the corner shot Thats a big three Scramble situation that time A Zachary got caught up on the screen Boston College was in the scramble on the back end And great patience by NC State to get the corner three Diara career best 16 rebounds and that three And now with a counter Brockton One of four Eagles in double figures He has 13 and eight rebounds Orsel thought about the three Burns crosscourt stolen by Zachary Three for Claude Harris Second three of the game for the Charleston Southern transfer Eagles with their first lead since it was 7 to6 at the 1458 mark of the first half And an air ball Both teams have left it all out there They really have And right now Jaden Zachary is huffing and puffing at half court And Earl Grant knows he cannot pull him out of the game right now Hes played 38 minutes and he has 16 points when he scores 15 and more The Eagles nine and one on their last 10 mlton for the cutting of league bay Post cant convert Here comes DJ Horn Hes been terrific Morcel with three Got it Long range Casey Morcel He has 12 Thats beautiful transition offense Unselfish play by DJ Horn Threeon two dribble draw defender and then kick it to Casey Morcel Thats textbook transition offense The bounce to post blocked by Diara Diara has just simply been superb He really has And again going up against one of the better bigs in Quinton post Thats a great individual defensive effort How does eight points 16 rebounds and the big block sound Thats great right here though I like NC State going back to DJ Burns Orcel the fadeaway Post corrals the board Here comes Jaden Zachary And more contact against Zachary A double team with Burns and Taylor And Zachary will be at the line The foul is on DJ Burns And John this is key right here Dont double DJ Burns Dig at him that time Thats great defense by Boston College Dig show like youre doubling and then go back out get a steal On the other end a transition offense so key in this game for Boston College Both these teams really have done a nice job running their transition off of makes excuse me misses or turnovers Zachary is 8 for 10 at the line EC 12 for 23 season low percentage NC State tying its season high for turnovers with 13 Thats 26 for them in two games Eagles back up by one Theyve only led for just over six and a half minutes Applause Under 10 to shoot Horn flustered by Zachary Jaden Tiller The three What a counter by the Butler transfer Thats a big time bucket Right now though Boston College overhelping the dribble penetration killing them Its breaking down their D And NC States doing a nice job executing finding open shooters on the perimeter Thats three threepointers and four attempts at overtime for the pack Fel Harris Zachary to lead Bay with a onehanded attempt My oh my that would have brought the house down I mean got a hand on it It may not make Sports Centers top 10 but Ill tell you if he got that one to go down it would have been number one My goodness Look at this lob He was trying to rip the rim off Great execution and for a recognition by Zachary And man this has been a fun game back and forth Both these teams playing at a high level and theyre going on an empty tank Lebe took off from upper campus Were on lower campus That was from upper campus But an admirable effort in terms of the relentless nature of this game Both teams as youve mentioned throughout Totten here theres condensation on the floor Theyre diving for 5050 balls and theyre playing allout basketball Well I think a couple things uh freetos that has still been a issue uh for Boston College right now for the game 13 for 24 54 Uh Albe with two big free throws right now for Boston College Hes 0 for two from the line Lebe with two points on five shots from the field Played 34 minutes Applause This is when it gets tight as he backends it DC missed nine foul shots in the second half Applause So one out of two for Elite Bay Hell pick up full court Zachary ran into the Applause DJ Horn And thats not a good foul Fourth on Jaden Zachary Its Its not only is it his fourth you mind dont mind the aggressive but youre putting uh NC State on the free throw line again He put on the brakes that time and Horn has played such a great floor game uh for NC State that time Thats a veteran move right there Just put the brakes on forced the foul Born first trip to the line He has 17 points matching TJ Burns game high for the Pack Applause last season at Arizona State Really a big time pickup for coach Keats and NC State and he nails two free throws to push the lead back to three Money shots huge shots and pressure for DJ Horn Poston Zachary playing a twoman game A three Thats not what youre looking for Theyre going to take a look to see if that ball was blocked Now again Im not sure that that was uh tipped Not sure thats the shot coach Grant wanted Again you dont mind if its a open one but thats a heads up play right there They think that theyre going to switch excuse me that uh hes going to be open He sees it goes back out the post and thats a heads up play by NC State on the defensive end Bert Smith and Pat Driscoll watching the monitor for the replay What do you think Malcolm Again from that angle right there did not look like it was tipped Now again this looks like a better angle right here Didnt look like it from my angle Definitely got some hand Yes hand Yes ball No And its hard Now again one might say the reason why he shot an earball is because he blocked the ball or his hand Uh this is going to obviously be a huge call DC has gone three minutes without a field goal which has been a tone throughout the game for them Scoreless droughts Theyve also missed their last four shots And I think that one right there not a good one by Post Again 29 seconds You still dont need a three in that situation Again if it comes off a dribble drive and youre wide open yes still have plenty of time to drive the ball set up your defense try to go for a steal Uh but certainly again heads up play by NC State and recognition by Jaden Taylor A reminder coming up after our game our crews have you covered in Charlotte at the ACC Championship game It will be Louisville and Florida State Coverage begins right after us for the ACC huddle continues after the game on the ACC Network and the ESPN Kelsey Riggs and the crew will take it away as they wait patiently in Uptown Charlotte We got a good one here tonight in Chestnut Hill two teams uh with two of the better picks in the ACC Quinton Post DJ Burns going at it And then the guard play really both these guards uh Jaden Tiller and Ford have been fantastic They really have And ball was not tipped with 306 Six remaining in the first overtime and NC State to inbound fullourt It will be Mohamed Diara to trigger So youre Boston College You have time for one trap and a steal If they get out of it then you got to set you got to foul Taylor in the back court and a foul on Prince League Third on the sophomore from Minneapolis Taylor to the line for the back Hes four for four from the line Part of their 13 for 15 effort Youre looking for a story line you start there NC State 13 and 15 at the foul line BC 14 for 26 Yeah thats pretty much the story line Again evenly played game both teams The difference in this one so far has been right here at the charity stripe NC State has taken care of business Boston College but came into this game weve been talking about it one of the better threepoint shooters free throw shooting teams percentagewise and that has not been the case tonight BC has gotten to the line for the most times this year at 26 So theres a positive but Zachary with the three and he hits it Called a two His foot was on the line Patriscoll was there to watch it So its a twopointer by Zachary and a timeout Timeout 8179 pack Dont go away as the thriller continues at County Form The holidays on Dales farm werent very festive until he saved big on a Bluetooth speaker with Amazons last minute deals And now order a Big Mac in the McDonalds app today Youll earn points you can redeem for a free Big Mac in your future Future you says Thanks Earn free food with the app The Home Depot committed to filling the trades gap 8178 And John right here NC State does not hedge on the ball screen Now thats a missed opportunity right there for Jaden Zachary They get the jumper to go but thats a clean look Thought he had a three right there Foot was on the line but thats a breakdown by NC State Again you do not want to give up open threes to Boston College right now DC shooting the three six for 19 32 NC State 8 for 18 44 Good timeout though by the Eagles Absolutely Set up your defense right now Again you still have time for a trap and also to try to get a steal but you got a foul now that theyve gotten it in Triple team on Marcel finds Horn and now the foul is called Patriscoll was eyeing Deon McLockton and Jaden Zachary Its called on Mlakton Thats his third So NC State 15 of 17 from the foul line DJ Horn will have two shots Lets see right here Again that angle tough to tell but again veteran official right there Its positioning with these officials Its all about being in the right position He was right on top of it Had the best view of anybody and veteran official crew And thats all you can ask for if youre a coach is theyre in position to make that call Bert Smith Pat Driscoll Lee Cassell the crew And another knockdown at the line This is going to be one of those games where Kevin probably says You know what We did grow We did mature He talked about their growth process with seven newcomers and NC State becoming more cohesive despite their 20point loss on Wednesday night in the ACC SEC challenge at Old Miss Horn extremely unnerved at the line Yeah hes a veteran guy Thats why they brought him in last season at Arizona State Uh you know he can shoot threes 250 career threes coming into this season But I think its these type of situations having a veteran guard like that with the ball in his hands an excellent free throw shooter as well too He has iced this game right now for NC State Fivepoint pack lead Timeout NC State upcoming games They have Maryland Eastern Shore and UT Martin back at home and then theyre taking on Tennessee on ESPN 2 in two weeks followed by St Louis and Detroit Theyre going to be a fun team to watch all year Yeah and this is again a huge game Both these coaches uh know look this is an early ACC game Uh one where they now have some more out of conference games but resume builders We talked about that NC State last season and the NCAA tournament Boston College trying to build towards that resume Either way again both teams uh played extremely uh well extremely physical game right now though the edge to NC State because of the free throws Theyre going to need some time off tomorrow after this affair Claude Harris from the distance Tiara the board and a foul by Mlakton on Horn Fivepoint NC State lead They can ice it with a couple makes here by DJ Horn Well if youre coach Kevin Keats you have to be pleased with how your team executed as you look at how he utilized his bigs to defend Quinton Post who had a quiet first half and then uh your back court in particular this guy right here uh he was impressive Uh DJ Horn to me was the key uh to this game in the second half and first for NC State Hes hit some big shots Yes Uh he is up to 20 points but for me it has been his ability to break down this Boston College pressure Horn and Taylor combining for 38 points 12 of 24 from the field That was his first miss at the line Game high 21 points for the Arizona State transfer GJ Horn Zachary and Harris The miss at the buzzer And thats all she wrote in overtime
