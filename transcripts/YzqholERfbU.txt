as much of a score even though he does go ahead and get 16 points a game as well not the leading scorer for his team but absolutely the heart and soul behind the Panthers now Henson Burton Cummings Elliott a lot of new faces new additions through the transfer portal they have really paid off for Jeff Capel and the pit Panthers as duke wins the opening tip we are underway and our second quarter final of the day up top for Mitchell really been an underrated guy I think in the ACC this year Lively will kick it out phillipowski open and knocks down a triple and a great way for Duke to start thats an absolute great start for the Blue Devils espresso considering they did not play Yesterday where the Panthers did so to be able to see the basketball go through the hoop early is a plus we saw that early with Miami today a bit of a choppy start they did get rolling Elliot with a pullup pop that wont drop Mitchell with the rebound we were talking with John Shire earlier today he really centered on Mark Mitchell as a guy that people should be talking a lot more about well Mark Mitchell has been the most consistent first year player when you consider the fact that what he does offensively and defensively even though he didnt get any of the ACC honors coach higher recognizes his value again boy does he want this starts back to back three and you can tell the Blue Devils are prepared for this matchup as we get an opportunity to see the Pittsburgh starting five Federico Federico seven for seven from the field yesterday yeah he has 18 inside no Mars Burton averaging 16 a game at a good one against Georgia Tech 21 he got to let it fly Obi he knocked out two already yeah you get the heat check youve earned it approach to the big good place to go there shot clock is at seven Mitchell in close what a quick start for Duke you couldnt ask for a better start and thats one of the things that we talked with John Shire this morning he told us its important for us to get off to a good start we know that Pitt has already established a rhythm they scored 89 points last night theyre familiar with the arena who said are you playing your best basketball of the Season he said absolutely so many things coming together right now including good health for the Duke Blue Devils Burton cant hit and Pittsfield gets shut out Applause Proctor philipowski thought about another three big guy Hanson goes down but more importantly turned his ankle yes on that play hes down right now out of the action and an official timeout and Kyle filipowski whos nailed a couple of Threes here early and gripping his leg he looked like he just said to Lively Im all right and now up on his feet or at least one you see that left ankle roll a bit oh thats even more than the bit thats the second time it actually rolled twice on that possession Henson looking to the official for a call as philipowskis going after the basketball but once he corralled the basketball unable to put much weight on it going down and after the great start from the accs Rookie of the Year hes going to have to check out and have the injury tended to weve seen a lot of that in this tournament havent we guys rolling ankles yeah game one we saw two Florida State Seminoles turned their ankles Matthew Cleveland and both Baba Miller had to leave in the first half roach will swing it Whitehead fires so what do you do you take out the one of the top freshmen in the country and you bring in another one Off the Bench who steps up and knocks down to three in his place 11nothing Duke not slowing down in the least without phillipowski get you an update as soon as we can on Kyle Hinson a little shot in the air well shorts Whitehead on the attack Lively and the whistle there as he draws the foul they have removed the shoe of the side you can see that from here Music 16 45 to go first half and Federico with his first foul Lively 63 percent at the line the Freshman from New Jersey we met in Philadelphia with 28 points 15 rebounds in the first matchup versus Duke so will you ask the question where do you get that offense from with philipowski out now on the bench but you also have to throw in the fact that Jeremy roach who has led the Blue Devils and scoring seven of their last 10 games did not play in that matchup versus Pittsburgh so they have even more offensive Firepower right now and thats another one of the things John Shire told us the offense is now starting to catch up with their defense which has been dominant all season long a roach honorable mention all ACC nearly doubled as ACC scoring average from a year ago 12 to nothing Duke Panthers will take anything they can get right now 22 wins 10 losses during the regular year Burton trying to get to the paint off could say and draws the foul jamarius Burton 16 points a game named to the all ACC first team draws the foul on Proctor and Tyrese Proctor did his job on that possession he Bell Burton out with the foul what Proctor did not realize is he has the elite shot blocker standing behind him and Derek live so he does not need to foul on that possession Lively 67 blocks which was the third most by a good freshman in limited minutes as well hes starting to get healthy get things going for himself offensively and defensively as well still a alldefensive member all ACC defensive team member this year even though he played the first half of the Season not 100 Nike shoebandi on now senior for the Pitt Panthers Sixth Man of the Year of the ACC and they could use the help they finally get on the scoreboard 122 Blue Devils heres Roach Applause Proctor looking for a screen Lively came up and enrolled over the top heres Mitchell shot clock is a factor down to four and a rebound by Burton who gets five a game he can be a big time scorer theres Lively with his SWAT head with a kick out and you move it around here for Whitehead and he here milled that one that was rushed by Drake Whitehead backing up still trying to get to the threepoint line and shooting that we look over to the Duke bench it looks like Philadelphias putting that sock back on Applause CE they added some taping augmented to take job he had savani fishing underneath nicely got by Federico yeah nice play by Federico to avoid the shot blocker using the rim as a shield to get it up on the other side because Derek loudly was tracking that one down Applause Proctor Lively there nice fire from Proctor great role by Lively didnt mess around a beeline to the rim catch the basketball and of course Pittsburgh Defender making a business decision to get out of the way when you see the seven foot one inch Lobby attack in the room good idea get clear of that Duke in search and win number 24 they have been reliant on their defense which has been exceptional this season holding opponents to 31 from three Savannah on the drive tried the window and came up empty Applause so approaching the 14minute mark Duke off a very hot start although Kyle filipowski has been on the bench for some time well see if he shall return Mitchell thought about it hell drive it keeps on moving and gets it to go down strong pump fake to get Hanson in the air the C part is going to the basket and the Blue Devils getting it going here early in Greensboro Coliseum ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents to help you get through lifes happiest and most difficult moments and shank and duck in original movie streaming March 10 only on Disney Plus and he came to the bench and sold head athletic trainer Jose fonseco it Hertz he continued to cheer his teammates on they added layers of tape he went back into the hallway ran up and down the hallway just a little bit and I was given the thumbs up that Kyle filipowski is good to go back into the game so I see a guy say Im okay and I think what he means by that is Im not seriously hurt yeah that means its not broken yeah he knows that as Burton hed say Henson going in strong will draw the foul and here is philipowski getting some running in some jogging in moments ago well weve seen you know a number of key players throughout this AC tournament already turned into ankles earlier we talked about Matthew Cleveland day one Armando baycott last night and now philipowski an early in this game after knocking down two threes and getting everything going so uh be interesting to see when he comes back into the mix but he looks like hes geared up and ready to go and youve got to think about the 2815 he hung on Pittsburgh last time and the start he got off to today Jeff cable was thinking it could be some Deja Vu so Matthew Cleveland the star for Florida State he didnt sit down he stayed up the entire time before he returned after he turned that ankle the lapowsky sitting on a bench at least for the moment Applause over the top aiming for Lively and out it goes and back over to the Panthers one heck of a turnaround for Pittsburgh from last year and they were 11 and 21 nearly a complete reversal they went hard to the transfer portal they grabbed Mellie Cummings Blake Henson and Greg Elliott three new starters to bring Pittsburgh back to life also the Diaz Graham twins stepping into the lineup this year The Freshman Jeff capels done a tremendous job selling the different personalities and new players into the mix and building a winner in Pittsburgh shot clock inspiring and thats going to be a violation Guillermo could not get rid of it seven foot freshman then they give it back Jeff cable ACC coach of the year and of course coached with John Shire at Duke Capo was a terrific player in his days as duke as well they both were yeah Jeff Cape was the associate head coach for the Blue Devils and John Shire started his coaching career at Duke those two guys very close friends foul there as Whitehead went in strong but its going to be an offensive and we were talking with John earlier today and he said Jeff Capel has a great basketball mind I always enjoyed being with him in the basketball talks that they had between games John Shire learned so much it also mentioned how much Jeff Capel mentored him as a young assistant coach in the business and again you know assistant coach is on the same staff you spend a lot of time together getting to know each other and each others Tendencies yeah now it goes Lively with a couple of rejections Mitchell off the Fate that gives it away Savannah from the corner rolled out boy that was in the cylinder tip tip to know moose on the deck Savannah comes away Applause for Burton the Fall Away thats sweet and well see Burton get to those spots a number of times throughout this game but one things for certain John Shire knows that and one of the reasons why hes going to have Derek Lively camping out in the middle of the lane to try to help Dukes Defenders guard Burton in the painted area Duke doing a good job sharing the sugar here early Bosque is getting ready to return to action with 1116 to go and on his feet getting ready to come back on the floor he hit a couple of triples before he went out he has had a tremendous rookie year and more on the big one is his Mobility season opportunity to Sprint down the floor the pass leads him to the basket he is able to finish at full speed the second chapter is his back to the basket he has the ability to recognize where the help is coming from and spin away from it to score on the inside but then his ability to stretch the defense a pick and pop action makes him so tough to guard if you help off of him he can knock down the three went down with an injury earlier he has checked back into the game Corey the importance of philipowski huge for Duke it absolutely is Andrea I guess we started this game off in chapter three already we skipped the first two as he knocked down two threepointers to start it off early looks at another one lined it up unable to get that one to go but good to see califoropowski back on the floor right back in no hesitation at all you mentioned he didnt play the first time these two teams met no and hes a Difference Maker for this Duke team that we talk about how well theyre playing down the stretch a lot of that has to do with Jeremy roach filling in off the ball now when he was injured he was the point guard the coming back Tyrese Brock is taking over the majority the ball handling responsibility Rose is off the ball now hit the number five seed Harry Simpson will lock that one up there but too strong no double by because they lost a couple of games at the end of the season quick strike Radisson getting in and running the floor and Duke looks really sharp on offense 206 not to mention defense holding pit to just six points almost Midway through the first half Burton denied just no easy shots here for the Panthers well OB Im a firm believer that the Duke Blue Devils are the best defensive team in the ACC now from a scoring standpoint scoring numbers theyre behind Virginia but of course we know that Virginias offense always has a lot to do with that but from its no goal percentage standpoint defensively as well theyre right at the top of the ACC with a touch kicks it out high that three wont drop Locked Away by subati here he comes you missed last season because of a torn ACL but he can really score it Cummings with a misfire still suck at eight points Duke by the way the winningest ACC tournament team in history with 107 wins in his tournament 21 titles that won 70 percent of their games philippowski no because its returning missed a couple shots he has and may not have the same lift on that jumper that he had going out but again he is always going to be a threat beyond that Arc and allow so much space on the interior for the Blue Devils when they have the ability to penetrate and find a guy like that on the criminal Diaz Grand the seven foot freshman back in Savannah yes big bucket for Pittsburgh Nike Savannah you mentioned the Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC who has had big performances in the ACC tournament back in 2021 at a 254 game to start it off for the Panthers young doubled up gets out of there Applause young and they fouled him over the back thats Diaz Graham with the personal he had to remind Dre that not only does Kyle filipowski have all those other things hes got some toughness to him as well not going to get out of the way of Henson trying to walk down the floor does not mind playing through contact maybe a bit of a chip on the shoulder for the Blue Devils that they would have been right in the hunt for the ACC Crown had a call gone their way at Virginia on February 11 you gotta get inside and get it done there remember philipowski went to the rim very controversial call there and OB I believe that in all honesty that may be the best thing to have happened to the Blue Devils and the reason being as we see Federico we get another easy bucket they play with that chip on their shoulder this team even though theyre the only Global college basketball team this program they play with a chip on their shoulders because they feel as though they do not get the necessary respect that starts with the head coach John Shire and it triples trickles down all the way through his team into launches he was wide open not that time and take it away the turnover Here Comes Whitehead put it on his hip and he stuck it in a beautiful move there well he was determined and Duke leads it 2413 hell go to the line another one of the many Dupree devil prospects in their first year in Durham getting out making the play the Rick Whitehead getting the job done outstanding laying down 7 41 left Duke got off a very quick start and they pretty much maintained it 2513 on Pitt Miami a winner in game one tremendous effort in that one 7472 lets go to Drake Applause Music Applause theyre giving Duke too many easy points too many wide open shots turnovers he said we have to make them take contested shots or make the players shoot that we want to shoot Corey for Duke who is that who does kit want to shoot the basketball if you have to pick anyone on the floor right now that you want to shoot specifically from Beyond a threepoint Arc you want that to be either Tyrese Proctor or Mark Mitchell simply because those guys who are capable of making threes dont shoot in at the high clip that you see from pilipowski as well as the Rick Whitehead who both have already knocked down threes in this game alright three for filipowski on the afternoon the last one looking like the first couple that he hit in between had that ankle injury but hes bounced back now hes going in underneath Dan makes it so looking like the ankle is okay as he said immediately after he hit the deck hes looking like the ankles okay and Obi let me tell you who else hes looking like hes looking like a young Christian Laettner right now and the reason I say that is because not only is he doing damage when he gets to back back to the basket on the Block he has the ability to step out and shoot it from Beyond the threepoint range and again to Christian Laettner was the best college player that I ever played against again when you think about what he was able to do backtoback Championship playing the final four every year he was in college and he was special I only played against a one year thankfully his last year my first year at Virginia but he was special and right now Kyle philipowski looking a lot like his head with a reach in foul High Praise indeed he has 14 points it has 15 as a team yeah Im not sure what people realize hes seven feet tall and again you know Im not one to give people their property with their listed height hes actually seven feet tall and has a shooting stroke that I mean hes shown that off already but the toughness and the ability to put the ball on the floor play off the bounce as well as back to the basket he is a complete offensive package so 6 20 to go here in the first half Duke has opened up a 3115 advantage trying to get together here with Ron Gruber finally giving the ball the pit on the Baseline Gruber Jamie lucky Tommy Morrissey an AllStar crew here with seven final fours combined Applause Fall Away by Burton yeah that rattles in and thats a tough shot again tomorrows Burton is capable of making tough shots but if youre the Blue Devils youll live with Burton having to make those to beat you because Im not sure he can make enough of those over this great big defense thats a tough shot as well it spins off the iron it wont go for Rose but it whistles as Marius Burton First Team all ACC performer this season having to go to tough looks look at Mark Mitchells extension trying to block that shot great offense beats good defense anytime but its going to have to be a lot more great offense from Burton ensigns first and roach with 73 percent honorable mention all ECC ENT talking about Burton and Company Burton with previous stops at Wichita State Texas Tech they get a lot of guys who have multiple stops on Jeff capels roster I mean heck their roster is older than some NBA teams yeah but when you think about the togetherness in which they play youve got to give Jeff Capel a lot of credit for being able to blend all these new guys and make a winner out of it that should be trying to hold him up and grab him and lets see what they decide to do on this ball 5 40 to go break away by Mitchell Sammy lucky and Ron who were talking it over theyre going to go over and have a look at that that was not a basketball play so going to be interesting to see what they come back with this Henson just behind the play reaching out and grabbing Mitchell so that he doesnt come up with the Highlight dunk but you see thats not it basketball play there well and you know what Ill be with the left hand he has a shirt but he does reach around and smack the arm thats going to be an interesting call because that was much more of a basketball play when you get an opportunity to see it on replay than it was in live action you see as he grabs the shirt with the left but he does reach around with the right hand Im not sure the way this one would go I would like for the officials to award Pinson it is going to be a flavor and you know I think Corey if the first move is Im grabbing the shirt it almost doesnt matter what you do after that yeah I didnt want to see that be a flagrant foul but I mean I understand the call absolutely and Jamie lucky having a conversation with Henson over it and thats thats the right call theyre grabbing the shirt were reaching around with the right hand to smack the arm makes it more of a basketball play but that is the correct call and your first reaction was yeah because all I could see was the inside so that left hand grabbing reaching out for and that was the first foul and so with that being the first foul thats the right call so Mitchell at the line to shoot 76 percent for Mark freshman from Kansas City one of the things that John Shire was talking about was this guy does so much for Duke that goes unnoticed hes actually had a lot of big plays over the course of the Season he made a gamesaving chase down block against Boston College he also hit a game ceiling three with 11 seconds to go to beat Notre Dame not a big scorer nine points a game for rebounds but does a lot of things you know in the reality behind it was if you put him on the all ACC freshman team its four Duke players and Judah Miss so thats one thats really the only reason I believe that Mark Mitchell did not make the allfreshman team but you know when you when you look at his performance this year hes been spectacular I know you had the broadcast yesterday wake and Syracuse I thought Jude events should have had a shot there at the end of that game Gerard took instead didnt make the shot and they paid at the end has his tip scooped up by Mitchell a leader rebound is moose and saved by Pitt a 3517 here in the first half theres Graham off Target and another whistle 506 to go in a half Applause give a look at our Pack 12 Music he has suffered a big injury yes injury issues for UCLA Mick Cronin doing a great job getting that number one seed in the Pac12 tournament but Arizona had a great nonconference slate they were a little inconsistent in Pac12 play but they can be dangerous in mark and to put it in Cummings Burton getting 16 points a game Applause Cummings puts on the brakes Applause sabandi shot clock at seven he has Graham going in strong and another foul its a flurry of whistles here down the stretch of the first half and thatll be on lively number one Guillermo Diaz Graham seven foot freshman the 611 I should say his brother is seven feet he gave Pittsburgh great minutes down the stretch yesterday when Federico Federico got in foul trouble with those four fouls Guillermo Diaz Graham came in and played 14 big minutes with Jeff Capel and helped him secure that win to make it into the quarterfinals here today 3519 later on tonight itll be Virginia and North Carolina thats at seven and a 9 30 Clemson and NC State and the other quarterfinals back to the scoop man thats a pretty play he just kept driving and driving and you know when you look at Tyrese Proctor now as a primary ball handler for the for the Duke Blue Devils you always go back and think about when Coach K would always make a move Midway during the season to change the fortunes of his team well this year that move that John Shire made his predecessor would have appreciate it when you think about moving Proctor to the point guard position and roach off the ball Duke with another opportunity here in the last four minutes or so the first half to extend their lead and they have owned this thing from the opening couple of possessions where philipowski nailed a pure three each time even when he stepped aside with an injury they kept on scoring Grannis with a great fake the shot by Roach they certainly got an open look yeah but well say this this is a long basketball game and this Pittsburgh Panthers team is as tough as you get as they go by the leader jamarius Burton theyre not going to walk away from this down 16 right now but would be no surprise to me if you see Pittsburgh make this a close game early in the second half we saw it in game one between wake and Miami Miami was sailing along an 18point lead fairly deep into the second half Miami would win by two thats tournament basketball player absolutely youre never out of it especially with this threepoint of Pittsburgh Second in ACC threepointers made per game got it inside to the big guy Lively for the basket to make it 3921 you just get to see Derek Livelys Improvement as The Seasons gone along finally healthy and playing the best basketball of his short due career Applause Burton Zips it to Cummings recognizing he has that defender in the air not only get the free throws but get the foul against Mitchell Blue Devils sailing along here against the pit Panthers lets toss it to Dre W thanks Dave well these two head coaches are so familiar with each other they also played at Duke in the ACA ACC tournament coach Capel went two and four in the tournament averaged 107 points per game coach Shire 72 in the tournament at 174 points per game and the MVP when they won the ACC tournament so coach Shire getting a bit of an edge Corey as far as playing in the ACC tournament goes she absolutely did have more of an edge playing in the ACC tournament you also have to throw into consideration that Jeff capels last three seasons starting his sophomore years when Coach K was actually out injured and did not coach the team the second half of the Season it was a struggle for the Blue Devils his second and third year they got things back together in his fourth year but in his first year he played alongside the great Grant Hill in the backcourt they made it all the way to the national championship game where they lost to Arkansas in that game but Jeff Capel was a flat out problem on the court and again if you look at the individual numbers his numbers may be a little better than shires were even though Shire was the ACC tournament Most Valuable Player yes he was Applause Corey when you talk to you of Coach Capel yes and he actually wears the same number as coach cable and the same uniform his name is Tyrese Proctor except for Jeff Capel was a better shooter at this stage but Jeff cable and Tyrese Parker are very similar as players the ability to play both guard positions at 65 Jeff Capel was an issue for anyone that he dealt with on the court Duke continues to look very much at home here in Greensboro approach getting away from the D filipowski hunting another threepointer heres Proctor shot clock at three he gets it up there and he buries it and Dre that is very Jeff capellike as you watch Tyrese Proctor growing up and you look at Proctor and the the relationship that he has with his coach with his teammates this is a very similar impact that what Jeff Capel had when he was a freshman with the Blue Devils stepping into the lineup from a team that had been very good early and becoming a starter on their team and having a huge role so count that basket but philipowski committing a foul after they going to take a look I think theyre looking at you know someone hit the deck pretty hard underneath the basket and theyre looking to see if there was any extracurriculars on that play the basket will still count but there could have been a foul and theyre looking to see if this was anything flagrant afterwards yeah I mean okay if you give philipowski the foul so be it but theres nothing there on that play nothing dirty just contact the most big guys so common foul there stay tuned for the AllState Halftime Report with Rhys bonds and Seth common foul there I wonder what what happened to Seth if bons found him real hard right now on the set you think Steph will get up you sound like you want to see that not going to say that I want to see it Im just wondering what it would look like you know Fons and our teammates when with the Denver Nuggets and Ive seen them foul guys pretty hard when you know hes one of the nicest guys youll ever meet oh sure but you dont want to push the wrong button because he can get physical if necessary Ive seen it and you dont think that Seth has come really close to pushing the wrong button many times in their Association uh no no no no no no not TV chef Greenberg coach Seth Greenberg yes but not TV sub Greenberg guys are great together and with Reese they coming your way very shortly here from Greensboro 4428 Duke in command under 90 seconds to go Applause chill over the top Lively is grabbing a nice play defensively although its all him and out and so itll be Duke basketball diminished 16 on the clock and the two big twins he had to play together here for Jeff Capel hes looking for something but hes looking very calm and the reason hes looking so calm is because he understands how long of a game this is even though his team Trail 16 right now go get him in the halftime lock room regroup and try to find a way to adjust to be able to slow down Duke on the offensive end foreign Applause Proctor going oneonone the kick his roach with a triple yes sir Music is Proctor Jeremy Rose the twopoint guard lineup for the Blue Devils has been spectacular not only here this afternoon but for the last 14 games since roach has returned from injury heavy traffic Lively with another rejection but there was a foul before that Proctor with number two and that will put Diaz Graham to the line with 458 to go and slowing down Duke offensively thats half of the equation the other half is Pitt has been held to 28 points it took him forever to even get on a scoreboard but this is something that Im sure Jeff cable was expecting coming in he knew it was going to be difficult to score against against Duke Im not sure he was expecting this type of offensive performance from the Blue Devils and when you consider their shooting from Beyond The Arc but as coach Shire told us the offense is catching up its getting close but he also mentioned that their defense is getting better and thats why Duke is one of the hottest teams nationally not just in the ACC coming into the tournament on a sixgame winning streak now Duke base 17 looking to add on before the break theyre going to be stolen away and right back Radisson hit the deck and tumbles over as he draws the foul Applause and so the Panthers had it for a split second and quickly gave it right back so Granderson heading for the line 357 showing Blakes will step in for Proctor whos playing with those two fouls right now and Blakes of course had a stretch where he was really the offensive weapon for the Blue Devils during the middle of the Season at backtoback 17point games career highs for him but no much more as a Defender and not necessarily in the rotation right now but a guy that John Shire still trusts on the court in crucial moments renison the 66 grad out of Oakland California thats the first foul shot hes missed Applause its been exceptional this year so less than half a second Applause and about a four second differential clock Applause shot clock Burton trying to give him a little lift right before halftime Savannah 10 no rebound battle for loose Applause thats how the first half comes to an end its a little bit of Life there with the great tail end of the half for the Panthers Duke with a season best 48 points and shooting 63 percent the offense is catching up Obi the defense has been spectacular all season long but right now that offense is picking up great this season and again when youre thinking about the pit Panthers they had that toughness as well theyve got to get stops first and then get their offense going well theyve won 22 games this season averaging 76 points a game so they certainly can score Duke opened it up throwing a 164 run that was behind filipowski he got hurt but they didnt slow down and they were only better when he came back yeah those 12 assists on 17 made field goals just shows the continuity and Dukes offense and the way theyre sharing the basketball playing as a unit right now and Jeff Caper who attempted to sit down to start the second half on his feet already after a early turnover Lively kicks it out Proctor at three rebound batted controlled right underneath that up and in that was fortuitous and the bucket by Mitchell but you go back and you talk about how we outline those freshmen energy Rhythm changer thats a essay 50 50 ball John Shire talked to Dre about that on the way out after seeing his teams give up that 5050 ball Mark Mitchell making up for that mistake Cummings need some help he bounces up top here for Burton Music he could really use this guy to get hot on the pit side that rolls off the iron tipped out by the Panthers so the Blue Devils will have it leading 5032 Applause lets check in with Andrea thanks Dave well I caught up with Coach Capel coming out of halftime and he said the biggest adjustment his team has to make is they have to play harder and with more Force he said he felt like those early threes from philipowski knocked them back a little bit as philipowski hits another one to write on the Queue hes but coming into the game they wanted to close out short on philipowski because he was two of 11 from three in the last four games but theyve got to make an adjustment on him and immediately Dre as philipowski gets so much room and knocks down another three and then gets out and gets the fast break easy layup Jeff Capel going to his bench Blake Henson will most likely not be on the floor when they come back does not like the defensive effort temptation to college basketball is brought to you by principle when you take care of your team they take care of business the Lebowski started the ball game with six two points second half five out of seven and how about the boyish head coach John Shire he Blends right in he absolutely does I mean it was just 13 years ago when he was playing in the ACC Tournament winning a tournament championship in the most valuable player also a national championship back in 2010 in traffic and kicked out for Cummings cant find the range there shires done an excellent job no easy task to follow a legend and the coach absolutely 160 at home this season the first ACC coach to ever go undefeated at home in their first year but I want to say that maybe his best job that hes done to this point is preparing his team for what theyre doing today with the double by coming into the ACC tournament and being prepared to play from the beginning of the game from the tip theyve been prepared all night long yes from Jump Street Duke finishing the ACC regular season ranked in the top five of the conference the 37th time in the last 40 years so its been a lot of business as usual to Duke leading 5732 Applause Mitchell up top Lively will let fly yes and for those that dont know he can do that I watched him do that from the time he was a freshman in high school and you see Derek Lively has the ability to shoot the three ball his mom Kathy Drysdale hanging around in the stands and I know shes loving that seeing her baby boy knock down the big three some of the frustrations starting to come through here for the Pitt Panthers they need more of that there she goes you talk about a big time player right there OB shes shes of course his biggest fan but also as tough as critic as well Applause rocked her back for filipowski shot clock to six Lively setting a screen to Lebowski Another Touch shall lean in Applause Music hes a bucket filler hes a guy that goes out and scores regardless of the defense hes that good offensively and he is showing it off and you got a member 28 points 15 rebounds first Pittsburgh in the first time he was priority number one on The Scouting Report for the Panthers coming into this game sure and all hes done is scored 22 points in the first 24 minutes eight for ten shooting oh and he missed a few minutes with the sprained ankle by the way we shouldnt note that that actually happened in the first half no digit you would not be able to tell though Im back very strong from that Applause 6334 they are laying it on the pit Panthers hits the number five seed kick it up top here and thatll rattle home for Diaz thats Jorge stepping out knocking down the three ball the Diaz Grand twins in my opinion are going to be very good for Jeff Capel in the future getting a lot of great experience under that belt as freshmen brother giardo also on the floor Applause lets roach with the kick from the corner another one switches in here for Proctors Applause theres nine out of 18 from three years Graham will finish that one on the other end and the struggle for the Panthers has been defensively not expecting that coming into this game Im not sure anyone was expecting Duke to operate this well offensively but theyve gotten everyone involved sharing the basketball extremely well and executing to the highest level going up high and draws the foul as well so the Tucker shots are falling and resulting in an add one for the Duke Blue Devils we absolutely say thank you in black history is history is that simple and Dre great job with that and of course when you think about those sitins it Sparks so much around the country as far as young people recognizing their rights and more of those happen throughout the country but a lot of thats not it right at A T thank goodness it did talk about athletic courage that kind of Courage thats a wholly different matter this is on the antique campus 69 39 Duke in complete control they started out the game 12 to nothing they started the second half 12 to nothing thatll get you a big lead like this shot clock down to 10 Burton heavy traffic people all over him still loose he has Graham kept on working man gets a bucket and what youre saying right now from Jeff Capel and his staff is Im gonna play the guys that are going to compete that who he has who hes has on the floor right now the Diaz Grand twins of course Nelly Cummings Nike sabandi and jamarius Burke he know these guys are going to compete for him gonna wave that off and thats going to be against young and offensive foul is Graham hitting the deck he is up coming up later on tonight Dan and jail have the call at seven number two seed Virginia number seven North Carolina followed by Clemson and NC State to three and the six what are your thoughts about tonight well I believe were going to have some special action tonight as the officials go over Jamie lucky Tommy Morrissey to talk about was there anything extracurricular on that but when you look at the bracket you cant say for certain right now but it looks like Duke will be moving on into the semifinals tomorrow with a huge lead here with 13 40 remaining then the Virginia North Carolina matchup huge implications Beyond this game simply because its an opportunity for the Tar Heels to gain another quad one victory at this point of the Season North Carolina may need to win the ACC tournament to get into the NCAA tournament and also Clemson NC State right now North Carolina State firmly in the field Clemson not even though theyre the third seed so a big game for both those teams we also have to remember that Clemson has beat NC State twice this season hard to beat a good team three times in a year and on North Carolina you know I didnt have to win two do they have to win the whole thing do they just have to get to the final heres what theyre looking at yeah theyre seeing if Ryan young actually elbowed and that was that was no yeah thats his head again thats not an elbow going over top so glad there was no additional action on that Miamis the number one seed they played their way into the semifinals with a victory over Wake Forest to the 7472 Miller with 18 Wong with 17 and they will take on the winner of this one and the semifinal round bless me on Feed and one as well a lot of fouls here this stage of the game I love the fact that theres still energy on the Pittsburgh bench they see a bucket and more importantly the teammates are up cheering on the coaching staff is on a Jeff Capel and his staff recognizing their season is not over and theyre still trying to accomplish something even though theyre down big in this game there are things to be accomplished you look at that great staff of course Tim OToole Milan Brown and of course little brother Jason whos quite grown up now Mama cape in the stands Im sure checking her boys out there she goes there goes Mama Cape we caught you Mama Kate with the popcorn I think you may hear something about that 1313 to go another foul second round yesterday and jamarius Burton just went to work yesterday on Georgia Tech showing off all of his offensive Arsenal but not just about his scoring his playmaking also had eight assists in that game and pretty much willed his team to a win grandison must fly and buried that one Mitchell beats everyone to the ball s it off and young finishes to play 7144 Cummings quickly to the other round no Applause young again trying to make a move out for granison wide open for the three of the Blue Devils really laying it on now Applause 10 for 20 from threepoint land for Duke today Diaz Ram too strong rebound poked out hell get a second chance sebasti in and out another loose ball controlled by Mitchell Tom Sawyer wanting to settle things down for his team make sure with this big lead they dont get too loose with the basketball continue to execute Mitchell takes off strong and draws the foul so Mark Mitchell will be at the line when we come back OB I think its fair to say that the Duke Blue Devils are enjoying themselves everyone touching the basketball getting involved into action and the bench is loving the way theyre sharing the sugar c network Carlos Im in Carlos Boozer posing for some photos signing some autographs kissing some babies and then hell be working tonight that is pretty much working for booze though because he does the same thing when hes actually on air hes just booze hes there of course gets the opportunity to cheer on the Duke Blue Devils and you know when you think about Carlos Boozer as great of a player as he was he may end up hailing in comparison to his twin to his one of his twin Sons Cameron and six foot nine right now a sophomore in high school is the best player in high school basketball regardless of class OB that means as a sophomore hes valued higher than the seniors coming out of high school right now youre talking about in the country Im talking about in the country and Im gonna go as far as to say outside of Victorville mignon but maybe in the world I mean thats how good this young man is right now at 15 maybe 16 years old has a twin brother Katie who is a special talent also very well coached well let me tell you this theres a lot of Rumblings that the age may change for the NBA minimum age for eligibility yeah if so if it goes to 18 Im not sure were going to see Cameron Boozer in college basketball thats how good he is right to the league quite a prediction there ll go the other way 1108 to go duke in total control 7644 do I hear this rumor correctly that Carlos said at some point rented out his house to Prince um he didnt know he was running at the prince oh so you know this story oh I know this story he actually went to check up on the house and noticed that everything was painted purple and thats when he found out that who was actually renting his house in Los Angeles at the time and uh yes he had a a famous renter on that one I believe he was also escorted from the property letting them know that Hey listen you dont belong here you dont have one purple you cant wear this youre wearing Duke Blue you cant come in here with that on Laughter is the other great story I think we all know that Prince could play a little basketball he was a Avid basketball fan I can remember my early days in the NBA and playing against the Minnesota Timberwolves and he would be sitting Courtside so he but the fourth of Dave Chappelle skit with prince playing basketball thats where I got the story from and Im like I dont know if I have laughed harder at any single thing it was it was a kill it was it was Eddies brother who was done yes yes Charlie Murphy Charlie Murphy oh it was so funny 10 40 to go Applause Young good feed theyre gonna Blakes got to shoot back did not Mark Mitchells upset of his teammate because he didnt shoot he cost him an assist make sure they left it well short a little bit greedy Burton lets fly over Mitchell but not there for him it just never found a hot hand Dukes defense pretty special today and another whistle with 1009 left Obi theres some motivation behind coming to Greensboro for the Duke Blue Devils one of those is if they get this win today theyre up 30 right now theyre looking like theyre in good shape for that they get a rematch with the Miami Hurricanes who flat out embarrassed Duke and Coral Gables the last time these teams switched on the year one and one but Miami definitely got the advantage and got the best of in their Coral game buries another triple for the Blue Devils coming into this season everyone expected for Tyrese Proctor to be the guy that would be the shooter for Duke got off to a slow start shooting the basketball from Beyond The Arc but you see this is that time of year where the freshmen now are no longer considered freshmen and Tyrese Proctor is getting the job done on the floor Proctor with nine assists by the way Miami scouting yeah Bill Corner Cody Campbell over there checking out for accidents he gets back in the game hes able to knock down the three Duke incidentally with 21 assists you know that Miami has noted that 7949 Blue Devils can look ahead to Miami next down the lane oh Mitchell what a great adjustment and later that he was thinking about the slam but laid it in gently yeah showing off great touch with Mark Mitchell attacking the basket with the contact still concentrating on the bucket more importantly getting the job done defensively after the bucket once again great offense beats good defense Nike sabandi stepping up knocking down a big three still to come at seven oclock number two seed Virginia number seven seed North Carolina on ESPN Dan Sherman and Jay billis and then Clemson NC State will be the finishing game at 9 30 on ESPN semifinals tomorrow at 79 30 championship game on Saturday at 8 30 pm on ESPN Burton into the paints rebound tip to the corner Applause hes 27 to go pit will keep it you see Mark Mitchell attacking the basket acrobatic this is similar to when the goat went up and changed to the left hand and finish it off and of course when I say the goat everyone knows who the goat is then only can be one goat and he played in the ACC tournament from the corner the jumper wont drop here for Henson Applause well Blakes recognize it so he does switch hands going to the left Jacob Blakes attacking the basket goes up with the right but switching over to the left the contact the finish and opportunity for the M1 you know you caught this but whenever you compare anyone to Michael I do remain quiet um I I hopefully I was not comparing anyone to Michael but if I ever do compare anyone to Michael and its not Kobe you should remain quiet 352 Duke in complete Command here theres contact To The Head And as Diaz Graham is trying to swipe at the basketball does follow through and hit Blakes in the face so I understand the call its the right call Blakes still with the concentration to finish it this could be a fourpoint possession forgive me more than that because Duke will get the basketball back after the free throws sophomore from New Jersey 66 percent foul shooter hell get two here Applause we have Blakes has shed the mask he wore that late in the season Applause and again maybe should have had it on after getting whacked in the face on that last possession did you ever have to wear one no that wasnt for me itll be I would have just had to go out there and risk it no way I could play without claustrophobic no way I can play with a mask on because some guys wear it for a while and then when they remove it they find they need it yes they get used to it and you know I try to play with contracts once and that was awful that was it for me yeah top leader spins it in right now dude has been unguardable Obi we could see a hundred he put on Pittsburgh in this game its still almost close to eight minutes remaining Duke already with 86 points shooting 74 here in the second half foreign Applause 8652 long day Jeff Capel for the Caples John Shire s to be on the same bench as a coach with Jeff the Duke now going headtohead Applause Elliott has it blocked seven and a half minutes remaining dumping it down for young in heavy traffic cant connect and commits a foul Applause weve seen Ryan Youngs role with this team decreased as The Seasons gone along with the development of Derek Lively II but he is an important factor for the Blue Devils moving forward in the first matchup between these two teams young had seven offensive rebounds seven of the 24 offensive rebounds that Duke had in that game and he has been a great backup for lively to have and help him develop this season now pit back to the foul line here with 7 24 to go Applause Miami a winner earlier today 7472 over Wake Forest one point had an 18point lead is coming in and doing exactly that knocking it down shoot another member of that freshman class we mentioned all the freshmen for the Blue Devils in this game except the shoot so making sure he gets his name in the scoring column the line driver wont go by Henson as he makes his way back into the game Applause top and that wont drop by Elliott kind of been a nonfactor in this one Young Music well I thought that NC States performance last night was going to be the top offensive performance of the tournament but Duke making a run at 100 and we start talking about the matchup as Blakes continues to defend picks up the foul on Cummings on that possession blanks with his second personal and we thank forward to the matchup tomorrow night Duke in Miami a twopoint victory for the Blue Devils at Cameron Indoor in the first matchup between the two and then a flat out beatdown Music in favor of it Miami when they play the game in Coral Gables a big Monday and that is when I believe everyone nationally recognized just how good the Miami Hurricanes were as a team of course fast forward to today the Miami Hurricanes are the number one seed ACC regular season cochamps alongside Virginia put Miami has seen enough Bill Courtney letting them know were out of here we know who will be playing tomorrow taking it back to the hotel against the 9056 you dont have to scout much anymore Duke is completely blown out pit Reeves spinning in the lane against it to go so some of the guys dont play very much for the Blue Devils get some minutes here at the end with a score like this Applause Christian Reeves of course give me the opportunity to mention my little Oak Hill brethren 71 freshman out of Charlotte Santos will release but cant hit it sabani on the way and hits it well you got Virginia North Carolina your thoughts on that game at seven oclock the two seed against the seven seed we had a desperate North Carolina team beat Virginia in Chapel Hill the last time those two teams got together the first matchup between the two Armando baycott turned his ankle a minute and a half into that game did not play and Virginia was able to win that match up in Charlottesville the issue to see how Virginia responds theyve gotten back on track offensively in their last two games after struggling mightily over a stretch of about six games on the offensive end of the floor Tony Bennett with a lot of time to prepare coming into the ACC tournament hes one of the best of making adjustments now dont you think itll be a terrific game Clemson and NC State late tonight at 9 30 I honestly think thats the matchup yeah I mean again youre talking about pure anger from NC State the way that Clemson went to PNC and embarrassed the wolf pack on senior night a 20plus Point Victory where Clemson scored 96 points I believe in that game shoot with a misfire I dont think you can blame Clemson for being a little chippy as well about their attitude because they are the number three seats but people are talking about them not being in the tournament which doesnt make a lot of sense 9262 Duke with a big effort here today in the quarters ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times you said this tournament would be decided by the backcourts those two teams North Carolina and Virginia split this season how do you see that game plan out well its a guards World Dre you know that and so when you think about the matchup between the backcourts but you so we highlighted Virginias backcourt but RJ Davis and Caleb love the way that they played last night was the way that we were expecting to see them play all season long the talent is absolutely there but when you throw in leaky black who in my opinion was right there with Reese Beekman regarding ACC defensive player of the year this is going to be a tremendous battle the difference in that game will happen in the front Court will Armando baycott have the level of production on that sprained ankle that you expect to see from him or what Jane Gardner be the guy that wins it in his home state Armando a very quick healer youve seen that and he knows he has that reputation the trainers can work miracles too and he was able to come back and play some on that we tend to go on this one and how about The Return by this guy philipowski 50 points last two games against Pitt he hasnt played much today and he has 22 points hasnt had to he got off to a great start knocked down the first two threepointers and then started off the second half scoring five straight points and I mean he was just locked in offensively you know from the beginning of this game and give John Shire a lot of credit I mean its difficult to watch everyone else play and sit at home come in and be able to pick up at that level right away but the Blue Devils absolutely did that here this afternoon kickball here yeah hes played for only 15 minutes in the game hes been resting and smiling and being a good teammate the rest of the time not a lot of time on the court but he hit the first shot of the game a threepointer nothing but Ned and right away you had a feeling Pitt realized they might be in trouble today and then seconds later he hit the next one another threepoint and then they were really in trouble it happened fast you saw Derek Lively get involved into action 13 points for him Tyrese Proctor had 11 points and 10 assists a doubledouble at the point guard position and then of course Mark Mitchell with 12 points of his own so all the freshmen getting involved in the action Jimmy Rose didnt even have to have a big game Santos going down the lane for the slam coming up on the last two minutes here 9265 Duke really completely ran away with this thing early in the second half although Pitt was still way way behind that buried from that 12nothing run by Duke to begin the second half yeah I think that was the most impressive part you know I believe everyone was expecting for Pitt to come back and make a strong run at the beginning of that second half but the Blue Devils were not having no parts of it and again that thats the maturity of this team youre watching grow up you know on the Fly we talked about their freshman five freshmen in the mix for them in the rotation thats just a type of afternoon its been for the Panthers he is Graham unable to finish slam Applause rapper on pass Reeves with his stuff thats how you do that a minute 21 to go duke in fulltime celebration ball naturally they have been for about an hour Applause yeah John Shire emptying his bench Duke with 27 assists thats an ACC tournament record for anybody all time in OB this team is ranked 25th in the country come on man if that doesnt show the disrespect for the ACC more than anything does if youre trying to tell me that this team is ranked 25th nationally right after winning six straight games getting healthy and all that theyve done the Blue Devils look poised for another strong March they sure do and we look at what has happened this year last season you know entering the ACC tournament only two teams ranked Duke and North Carolina who both end up of course at the Pinnacle of success last year and then you think about only the five teams getting the NCAA tournament bid three of those teams advancing to the elite eight Duke North Carolina both reaching the final four of Miami to the elite eight this season were expecting the same level of success from this ACC once they get to March regardless of the disrespect from the national media and from the NCAA tournament Mystic Dukes playing as well as anybody in the country they are I mean again and you think about Duke but this is a team that got blown away by Miami that shows how good Miami is Virginia of course what can be anyone on any given night theyve beaten Baylor they Applause that one launched Again by shoot whos been doing a lot of that since he came in and you also have to mention even though this has not been the afternoon for Pittsburgh this Pitt team went to Northwestern and beat them by 29 and I watched that game Chris Collins is my God Chris Collins is great friends with Jeff Capel and the fact that theyre great friends is the only reason that it wasnt more than 29 because Pitt had everything going for them in their game thats the number two seed in the Big Ten but yet this conference continues to get disrespected the joy brackets pinning an 11 seed on the pit Panthers come NCAA tournament time another ACC tournament run is over theyll pick up a one win and the one loss Duke about to move on into the semifinals against Miami at seven oclock tomorrow night Virginia Carolina Clemson and NC State coming up later on tonight to determine who moves into the semis good opportunity to see Bracketology by Joey brackets and you see Virginias a four Miami and Duke has five seeds NC States at 10 Pitt is 11 North Carolina of course most likely will have to win the ACC tournament to get in but Obi this is my last ACC game of this year and so I want to make sure that I let the world know give me my 10 ACC team Ill take on any conference in the country there you go by the way you can stand there for a long time Ive been saying it from day one and I firmly believe its from the beginning until now a pleasure being with the allseason partner my man enjoyed it Universe our producer Kim Belton right there with us for so many outstanding days and nights what an outstanding afternoon for Duke 9669 they roll past bit today they really have a strong performance by the Duke Blue Devils disappointing performance by Pittsburgh but their season is not
