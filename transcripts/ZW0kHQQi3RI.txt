inside H Pavilion the oy jerseys of Plenty among the Cal student section as the ball is up the game is on with Coach Jared hash Chris Sylvester our entire crew coach calg going for a third straight Victory while Miami desperately tries to find that ACC wind colum before a long flight home to Coral Gables well not surprising Golden Bears go straight inside deat Soko hes with Stellar absolutely Stellar against Florida State missed the layup but I expect more of that moving forward Miami still windless through now eight ACC games after suffering a 37o defeat at Stanford Wednesday night and they have not come close to a victory since early January the first games after Jim Lena called it a career Reus petritis gets knocked down and the hurricanes have Come Away with a pair of stops to begin the game Johnson pulls and fills it up hes been really struggling from the perimeter just 21 this season and thats a welcome sight for the Hurricanes no question this our eighth different lineup this year looking for that secret sauce trying to get going and so far its working Bill Courtney is the interim head coach of the Miami Hurricanes does have some head coaching experience six seasons with the big red of Cornell sooko off the Wilkinson Miss and M has the first golden be points tonight I think you can see the game plan for Cal right now four shots all have been within five or six feet uh thats the first one to go but theyre looking to punch it inside go inside first double figures and three straight for Soko who had his first double double in a cal uniform last time off the side of the glass and ripped away from Kyrie Music Huey both sides missing some Firepower tonight well tell you more about that shortly the Golden Bears were impressive here Wednesday night beating Florida State 7768 as DJ Campbell misses the free line jump shot and last Touch by the Hurricanes Miami is without Lind hiid a starting big man averaging 11 and seven and for a second straight game Cal without its leading score a top five score in the ACC no Andre sto yakovich a guy that you coached last year at Stanford absolutely heck of a player they played last game without him against Florida State able to have success a DJ Campbell hits the three just his 10th of the Season Cal 6 of 23 from the outside in that win Wednesday night against the seminal this is the first ever meeting between Miami and Cal of course a big football game between these two schools back in early October that Drew a lot of national attention little bit of a different feel here on the hardwood late in the clock its Johnson this one bangs off the heel and ricochets to petritis Wilkinson and it Hors shoes off the front rim freshman starting in place of sto yakovich just as he did Wednesday night thats Paul Jo sophore from France with a downtown hit a fast start for Miami from the threepoint line is going to be huge Cal again is attacking inside first the next thing is uh I think coach matsons going to be talking to him about getting to the offensive boards now because they were tremendous this against Florida state with 24 yeah Miami taking a couple of early leads in this game never came within sniffing distance of a lead each of their last two lopsided losses but trius finishes at the glass the trius the spark plug does a little bit of everything had a double double last game but really does a nice job from assist to turnover ratio getting some points rebounds takes charge does a little bit of everything great drive right there first year Golden Bear spent the last couple of seasons in Colorado Springs at the Air Force Academy this one bounces off from Joe Bay Soko grabs it for California just underway here in Berkeley its retro night as Wilkinson is rejected by AJ ston McCrae I really I really like the mindset of Cal right now theyre going downhill to the rim uh not a great percentage yet but boy I like the way theyre attacking rim and I think the percentages go up as the day goes on if they stay with that mindset Bill Courtney whos been toying with his lineups and rotations electing to bring his leading score Matthew Cleveland Off the Bench here tonight Cleveland averages more than 14 a contest Black Shir FS it up really nice balance of their offense after going inside get some good ball movement but really a step in three a natural three for flure in Rhythm a highly decorated player over 1500 career points spent the last 5 years in Phoenix at Grand Canyon Cleveland on a turnaround uses the window and missed Applause it Golden Bears have opened four of 11 on this end petrius recovers the Music Ricochet now jovon blackshire the veteran just one of 11 from the field here Wednesday night but knocking down his first attempt in this one hell peel back and misses everything as Cleveland grabs it for the Music Hurricanes coast to coast Matthew Cleveland scores well that last shot for black sh is what we call a heat check unfortunately for him didnt fall ends up being a transition basket Cleveland with his size I think could POS some problems that bounces off but aridus betray will have the first free throws of the night on the other side better start here for Miami as the Hurricanes eye their first ACC win in Bear territory you the Music Applause Music 2 2 oh Music Miami and Cal will get very comfortable with each other years down the line but Golden Bears one of three ACC newcomers meeting Miami for a first time ever on the hardwood it has been a tumultuous Run for the Hurricanes who open the season 3 and0 theyve won just once in the following 16 games against the Cal team thats been pretty good on their home floor this season Bill Courtney was thrust to the top of Miamis program when the legendary Jim Lena called it a career the day after Christmas last month says it hasnt even been a full month since Jim stepped aside but its kind of felt like 2 years that thats much his team has struggled but hes hes trying to stay optimistic and perseverance was a use a word he used quite often in shoot around today as he he tried to get these guys to engage and and lock in no question hes hes college basketball coaching is not an easy profession right now but then you throw in something that you havent prepared for the offseason youre preparing as an assistant now as a head coach hes doing a great job as you said remaining positive trying new things as we talked about different lineups different personnel and number one one staying positive trying to find little Victor Matthew Cleveland pulls up on the elbow and it bounces in instant offense from Matthew Cleveland who leads Miami in scoring and has four quick ones off the bench Lee Dort has checked in for California along with Christian Tucker spright on three short Joshua Ola Joseph misses his first attempt tonight off the cow bench State McCrae gliding Baseline Blackman Ts a three and its short jayen Blackman rejoining the rotation after missing Wednesdays loss at Stanford with DJ Campbell off the glassing in a Blackman on this end hes a heck of a shooter he just hasnt shot it well in ACC play you know that the change in the lineup pretty good start for Miami they they have a comfort level on the offensive right now but on the defensive end theyre going to start needing string some stops together hurricanes have opened four of 10 there is another make for Johnson he had just one threepoint hit in the first 8 AC games and hes got two here in the first 6 and A2 minutes well with kid out its going to be something that theyre going to have different um opportunities for different guys guys are going to have to step up just like Cal you have St yakovich out of the game everybodys going to have maybe a little bit different role they dont have to play Above uh you know what theyre normally trying to do but just a little bit more efficient maybe a a little bit more aggressive but both both ends are going to have different guys looking to step up a bit coach this is the area of the floor where Miamis really struggled since Jim Lena stepped aside theyre towards the bottom of the country in defensive adjusted efficiency as they get a stop here off the blacker Miss theres no question the defensive ends where its at its been their biggest struggles that is a blocking foul on the drive from AJ ston McCrae much to the dismay of the bench as they call it the Cal student section behind Music Applause us Ola Joseph does a great job looks like he gets his feet set it is so hard in college basketball right now to draw a charge uh the rules are written to really benefit the offense certainly looks like a charge feels like a charge but you have to be there so early now uh obviously dont get the call there Cleveland picked up by Ola Joseph he Fades he fires and missed it off the back rim Cleveland second season at Miami after two years at rival Florida State as Tucker is whistled for a carryover you know Cal has the lead right now by one but if youre Miami you have to feel great about uh you know Cleveland coming off the bench giving you some scoring power um threepoint Shots by Johnson pretty good offense uh theyre going to have it have a great great focus on rebound on the defensive end but overall Miami has feel really good right now Blackman off the side of the iron his second attempt from back there last Touch by Ola Joseph we just showed you the Mad Dog Mark Madson in his second season guiding this Golden Bear program turns 49 years young next week of course played at rival Stanford the nine years in the NBA won a couple of championships with sha Kobe and the Lakers in the early 2000s its Johnson comes up short on this one onepoint lead for the Golden Bears and a whistle away from the basketball the foul on Brandon Music Johnson there was mad dog back in his playing days Im not sure if we call this a highlight but uh it is a video I mean he hes hes added some moves since then Im sure he loves uh having that on video blackshire spots up in the corner and buries the Applause three hes shooting that great balance great confidence both of his made threes are that way Doon blackshire mentions just one of 11 from the field against Florida State off to a much better start tonight Cleveland and the late whistle for a foul sign lead Dort and Matthew Cleveland will have the first hurricane free throws when we return blacker has made one three gathers himself thats two Music warri he e e hey jump on the old bird and lets go play some Conference basketball just the 3000 M trip from home in Coral Gables for the Miami Hurricanes out to Palo Alto the first of two Golden State matchups on Wednesday night didnt go so well 37point win for Stanford and then the bus trip up to Berkeley for Miami long Redeye flight home back to South Florida tonight and well theyre hoping to take a victory with them thats the goal and talking to their staff if everything goes well and hopefully for them they get that Victory its still a 3000 Mi flight back and they get back about 7 am tomorrow so uh life on the road in the ACC is not easy but its part of the reality well the tumultuous season for Miami the beat has gone on for Matthew Cleveland whos averaging a career best in points per game third in the ACC at 52 from the field and hes at its six of the first 15 for the Hurricanes who are hanging around in Berkeley almost halfway through the opening 20 see Miami with some token pressure again trying to get Cal out of rhythm get back into manto man defense on this Tucker kicks its Wilkinson and tapped around recovered by Cleveland the hit ahead Chu missed the finger roll but earns a couple more free throws for The KES this this is going to be a game I think that easy baskets are are really going to be a defining part of it you see Miami getting a couple baskets in transition which is good the offensive rebounds for Cal uh has been a theme the entire season they already have four offensive rebounds Eight Second Chance points but if Miami can continue to get some easy baskets in transition thats going to be a nice way for them to stay in this Applause game Spencer Mahoney a transfer from Washington State checks in for the first time this opening half for California is the Freshman Divine Ugo chuku from Sugarland Texas splits the free throws to put the Hurricanes down a point not surprising you get a stop on defense Miami goes back to their press then back to man the man try and get two stops in a row Golden Bears open to six of 17 on this half of those makes from the perimeter Wilkinson kicks mones open and he buries the three love that offense great ball screen continuity change size of the floor multiple times and then get a threepoint shot at the end of it Red Shed under Kyle Smith at Washington State last year Austin Schwarz has the answer for the Hurricanes another intriguing young freshman that Miami brought in over the drops the hammer tell you what you have to like Cal right now with the ball movement theyre sharing the basketball theres player movement as well its not sticking in anybodys hands right Applause now C they rank towards the bottom of division one in assisting on made field goals assist on about 40 of the shots they make and already today thats five yeah that changes a little bit with no Andre sto yakovich its Mahoney on Target again right on Q offense gets to the paint another assisted basket playing for each other really good feel on the offense right now for the Golden Bears Spencer Mahoney hasnt gotten a ton of run here in ACC play but has come off the bench and hit a couple long range shots Ugo chuku to strong Cleveland Soares in for the second chance and a reach in foul on re is p trus sharing the sugar here for the Golden Bears exactly right right and to do it most effectively you find ways to get to the paint off dribble penetration they do it multiple times finish at The Rim really good balance Inside Out scoring but I love the idea theyre just playing for others right now and its not sticking in anybodys Applause hands its Schwarz on the drive and a whistle foul against California this ones on Tucker so Austin Schwarz the true FR from conquered in North Carolina had four threes in a game at Wake Forest earlier this month the SPN top 50 recruit at a high school Kane speed out Yukon Indiana cleans and others for his freshman season Services Hey Monday night features a great SEC womens basketball matchup on ESPN 2 as second ranked South Carolina visits Knoxville to take on 17th rank Tennessee tune in to ESPN 2 at 7 Eastern on Monday Music night was imperative for Miami not to fall behind big early and within four here with nine and the half to go in the opening 20 well talking to Mark Matson he had a great deal of respect for the talent level on this Miami team wow cant have that mental mistake right there fing a threepoint shot could turn into a fourpoint shot but as I was saying Mark Madson uh understands the talent level on this team is very very high theres a great deal of respect there but theres a physical talent and then theres the mental Talent of making sure you dont put yourself in position to foul a threepoint shooter Matthew Cleveland has to challenge the shot but come down to the side of the shooter uh certainly cant handle four point fourpoint plays right now if youre Miami says sky is the limit for his young freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson who had 18 points in his first Collegiate start in place starovic Wednesday night Cal has already matched their threepoint make total from that Victory Wednesday over Florida State theyve hit six triples here in the first 11 minutes Johnson in and out its the second time weve seen Cleveland going into post up I wouldnt be surprised if we see more of that moving forward Mah Fades fires Johnsons there to grab the Miss deil Bea highest rated recruit in program history misses from the midrange the five star Prospect McDonalds All American coming in W wraps at home and thats the possession for Miami you cant have a shot on one end without any passes midrange shot under duress and then giving up a layup without any passes on the other end those are the two plays you got to avoid six straight for the Golden Bears to stretch this lead to double figures Johnson keeps firing and thats his third make of this opening half when I talked about guys stepping up I think uh he understood that was going to be him shooting the ball great Freedom great confidence three threes missed all four of his field goal attempts at Stanford Soko gets rid of it quickly and Wilkinson missed everything baa picked up by petritis tries the midrange again this time he hits the other thing that does on a m shot is going to allow Miami to set their defense when its in transition thats the layup that Cal got now with the set defense hopefully they can can force some ball movement multiple Music Applause sides Wilkinson with a step through the contct round and down it goes for Jeremiah Wilkinson well Wilkinson was a little bit quiet but hes used to coming off the bench you know he hasnt started a whole lot this year except for last game but now hes in his comfort zone attacking that rim perhaps bidding for his second ACC freshman of the week onor this season although its been pretty tough to beat out Cooper flag for that award on a weekly basis yeah thats an Applause understatement Golden Bears have H six of their last eight from the field its Wilkinson open for three sasoko Taps it out a second effort and Tucker threw it away thought money was going to slash towards the rim and Instead The Golden Bears turn it over sevenpoint lead for Cal on retro night in Berkeley Music Applause Music Applause ser Applause yeah e e Applause Cal Bears heating it up from the threepoint line L 6 of 12 50 from the threepoint line to start right now Campbell hitting one a pair from black she right now stepping in every time and what youre noticing is theyre not just threepoint shots theyre assisted threepoint shots which really bodess well the game plan is to get to the paint make plays for others and its one thing to have a plan but its another thing to execute the plan and C is doing a tremendous job of that seven assists on the game coach Matson has to feel great about how the team is sharing the basketball mentioned they matched there threepoint make total from Wednesday nights Victory year over Florida state theyre 13th out of 18 teams in the ACC they only average about seven made threes per game thats not necessarily the focal point of their offense but right now theyre getting clean looks and theyre knocking them in yeah and it is you know its hard when you have one of your best player down with stovic hes not playing tonight but theyve done a really nice job developing the game plan and then executing it and part of that game plan is get to the paint and make plays for others Joe B A couple missing is inside here come the Golden Bears Wilkinson finds Campbell extra pass black Applause shirt Matthew Cleveland with a head of Ste recovers and kicks but the book it and inside out love that right there Cleveland in the post is going to create attenion inside out paa really easy step in three for him but I again I really think theyre going to continue to try and get the ball inside the Cleveland cuz he can create some some different situations for them Miami has also nailed six triples this opening half blackshire flashes the leather shot clock down to five its Wilkinson trying to create and he elevates for the two Hand finish that is a highlight finish from an explosive guard explosive and scoring explosive off the ground well soaring in double figures hes got 10 in this opening half the Freshman has excelled in the starting five Music again promising Young Piece for Mark Madson to hopefully build around although you dont get to build much in this day and age of college basketball pocket pass Cleveland lost it picked up by Campbell Golden Bears on the Move Campbell flutters it in for two and Bill Courtney wants to talk things Applause over eightpoint lead for the Golden Bears on their home floor in Berkeley eyeing a third straight win Applause Music hey Applause who tell me to take it the Cal Bears have built their opening half lead back to eight Jeremiah Wilkinson in the absence of Andre sto yakovich filling those big shoes and doing it rather emphatically boy it must be fun to make plays like that that was great going straight down the paint off two feet must be nice Wilkinson the 18point effort in his first Collegiate start against Florida State Wednesday night does have three 20o games this year an exciting young freshman for Golden Bear fans to get really excited Music about So Cal is uh promly a manto man team they threw out a little token press the second ago and this possession started in zone so trying to change it up a little bit I think theyre really pleased with their offense but defensively I think theyre trying to change it up a little bit get a little bit different feel this was deflected out by Reus petritis Johnson out of the shot fake and lays it in Brandon Johnson the guy that Bill Courtney calls a win first player hes been very frustrated during this long Ling streak Miss from Wilkinson on the outside and itll stay here as Miami F mty Soko game high 11 for Brandon Johnson picks up his second foul with 416 to play in this opening half ly kid for the Miami Hurricanes tonight on what weve been told was a coachs decision Cal has to be careful right now of just getting in a comfortable game you know things have gone pretty well offensively and when that happens oh thats Lee Dort as I said theyre pretty comfortable offensively right now but on the defensive end they cant just get comfortable and allow them to score thinking youre going to outscore Miami you have to find a way to really creat some kind of tough tough defense and right now its not working its just both teams are scoring at will its a great out of bounds play for Cal a screen a back screen a great pass a great finish really a welldesigned play by Mark Manson couple dunks for Lee Dort Junior from mckin Texas who spent the last two years under Jerry Stackhouse at Vandy Jerry Stackhouse right across the bridge now on a Steve Cur assistance with the Golden State Warriors field goal plus the foul and Jaylen Blackman completes the threepoint play so Miami has to be pleased with what theyve seen these first 16 minutes on that end of the floor well both coaches at halftime going to be talking about the defensive side of the ball finding a way to get stops because it just has not been efficient for on a sid step release Campbell missfires and it stays here again much to the dismay of that Miami bench having some trouble boxing out to Cal bakman and the Golden Bears have a fivepoint lead late in the opening half Music Music think l to the well our big Monday double header on ESPN starts at 830 Eastern NC State heads to Cameron indor to take on Cooper flag and second ranked Duke thats followed by Third ranked Iowa State against Arizona at 1030 big Monday is on ESPN and the ESPN app Duke at Wake Forest in improving the 9 and0 in conference play Cooper flag per usual stuffing the stat sheet uh North Carolina place that you called home for quite a while as an assistant coach uh surviving an overtime scare against Boston College five Road winds in seven ACC conference games today and this is that juncture of the Season where things start to get a little wacky right oh theres no question uh last week most of the top 25 lost a game uh on the road at home you just know youre going to be in for a battle so uh not surprised surprising this time of the year you get to you get a lot of that Miami winless in the ACC but hanging around here in this opening half against the Cal team going for a third straight win patrus lost it AJ ston McCrae the leather Larsen and had it swatted out from behind by DJ Campbell Campbell arguing that Stan McCrae had touched it last this time of year you typically dont have great great offense because scouting so good everybody understands tendencies All the plays but if you like offense this is your game both teams have been extremely efficient shooting well uh not a lot of turnovers dangerous pass recovered by Blackman he steps into a three and it swirls off the iron but its going to stay here with Miami the foul on Lee Dort seventh against cow will put Kyrie huy the Idaho State transfer at the free throw line for the one and one Cal has a great luxury right now with sasoko being out having Dort being able to fill that rooll foul right there but he is a big body and a great rebounder fi Miss fires on the front end of the one and one missed the first two and a half mons of the season with a left hand injury this is only his fourth game Game of the Year being asked to play a bigger role in the absence of ly kid tonight Atrius they really earned those free throws no question and Cs done a nice job theyre running a continuity ball screen offense uh which really gets the ball hopping from side to side has all the different players touching it uh and then they what theyre doing is on the third side is trying to attack and get down hill P trius do a nice job drawing contact drawing the foul right there getting to the free throw line now petritis in that Victory here against Florida State Wednesday night 12 points 13 boards mty Soko had a double double to first two Golden Bear double doubles of the season and they happened on the same night really surprising to me cuz both those guys really could get a double double on any night theyre such good rebounders and you know 10 points for both of them theyre around the basketball enough thats going to happen patrus Five Points three boards this opening half the cow lead is six inside of three minutes ston McCrae one and done for Miami Here Comes DJ Campbell butrus attacks again th jumps out of the JY once more for Cal thats been the theme right now in transition but get into the paint a great great pass by petrius and another assisted basket for Cal well thats three now if youre keeping track on your Dort dunk tracker this first half Cleveland fires away wide right Miami is cooled off from the field Cal can stretch this thing back to double figures with a field goal on this possession Bears have led by as many as 10 on their home floor this first half B of Joseph spoon feeds Campbell petrius in traffic and he threw it away its another Golden Bear Applause turnover P trius again getting downhill great dish right there Dort knows what to do with it when he gets it right there theres no question Cleland jumps up and rejected by Dort doing it on both ends Wilkinson feeds him inside and he missed at The Rim but he comes away with the loose ball in a crowd and puts it up and in Second Chance points lot of action right there Dort running the floor after he blocked the shot rewarding himself with a missed shot offensive rebound put back lot of stats sheet stuffers right there for D Cal Le by 10 and theyre plus 10 in the second chance points call but the off balanced Hue is there and has the stick back really important basket right there for a lot of reasons gets it back to single digits this last minute psychologically for Miami in particular is important if this stays in single digits I think it gives him a lot more confidence going to the second half but if it you know gets to 10 12 points their confidence may be shaken a little bit Campbell probing floats it the corner on target thats Joshua Ola Joseph with a downtown hit and three trays Off the Bench Wednesday night against the seminal largest lead for Cal the cithm is strong late in this first half its Cleveland and he answers back we have offense continued offense how with a chance to get to get to 50 before half well the ignitable Matthew Cleveland with nine points Off the Bench Miami back within single figures shot clock D Wilkinson steps back Cur on the way missed it tapped off the glass and that is how the opening 20 comes to an end well buckets on bucket Wilkinson a green light freshman 13 field goal attempts through 20 minutes as 10 points in his second straight start again no Andre sto yakovich the fourth leading scorer in the AC CC averages close to 19 a game for a second straight time test missed Wednesdays win over Florida state with flu like symptoms and out with a hip injury tonight the hope is to get sto yakovich back for a midweek trip to Dallas to visit Andy Enfield and SMU in cs next game after this one long flight home for the Hurricanes theyll fly overnight and land in the we hours of Sunday morning and thats not how they wanted to start the second half Applause lost by 37 their first game in California part of this Golden State Road Trip coach theyve been here since Monday its uh these extended road trips are not easy you know different time zones and then by the time you get adjusted youre going back but uh the reality is its its the new world were in everybodys going to have to figure it out well black sh had it knocked away after the step through here comes de Bea and he lays it in the first half was extremely clean on the offensive B between the two teams 17 ass six assists six turnovers first two possessions both teams turn it over with the starting just his seventh game of the season tonight same starting five begin this second half for Miami that began the game blackshire off the back iron ston McCrae baseball pass and its knocked out off Miami Paul Joe Bay went up for the layup and Cal recoiled defensively in time to get it right Music back itll be interesting to see Miami theyre looking to run this half if they continue that trying to get easy baskets but Cal does a nice job right there getting back getting deflection get back possession on this Music end shooting 47 on the night black Shar with the shot clock in a single figures working on ston McCrae underneath wraparound pass knocked loose and taken away by the Hurricanes again I like what Miami has done its a little bit of a Bend but dont break on the defensive end make him shoot over the top of you if they give you the basketball take the seal and try and get in transition kry huy couldnt sneak it around Mi Soko inside DJ Campbell side step three oh sooko Taps it out but right to Jal Betha The Freshman on the Move huy jump stop and a finish off the glass Miami has the first four points of the second half they have to be thrilled with how this has gone again solid defense nothing fancy making Cal shoot over the top no easy baskets and then theyre getting out in transition its been a while since Miami has been in a game with this little time left Campbell comes up short on the floater and last Touch by the Golden Bears weve talked about Miamis defense needing to be better this second half and thats led to some high percentage looks on the other end last thing if youre able to get some steals it gets you out in transition um really nice job theyre pushing the basketball looks like theres an intent and a plan to push the basketball this second half giving the youngster from Philadelphia J with Thea the McDonalds on American the high school Slam Dunk champion an opportunity at the controls of this offense but Thea foul on California its on MAR Soko will send the Freshman to the free throw line for two long losing streak that Miami hopes is coming to an end soon as soon as tonight theyve lost 18 straight conference games dating back to last season of course just two years removed from the first final four appearance in program history and they were within the top 10 early last season injuries became a part of it and then slowly but surely they lost their core from that final four Squad and that Id imagine played a big role in Jim Lenas decision to hang it up midseason theres a lot of factors to this obviously and if youre Miami what youre trying to do is not lose confidence youre TR to trying to remain positive build on the little things build on the little successes see if you can get things going a little bit Ive Loved what theyve done theyve attacked the rim in the first half they shot 38 from the field where Cal shot 48 10 of points better because Cal got to the rim this half Miami is getting to the rim more effectively than Cal you see the success for Jim Lena in 22 and 23 Deep runs in the NCAA tournament didnt get there last year despite all the expectations and of course the tumultuous campaign at this one has been DJ Campbell has the first Cal points since the first half Campbell a transfer from Western Carolina was one of Mark madsons bigger transfer portal editions in the off season but Thea off the side of the iron but Tri has had it recovered by Miami underneath and Johnson cant put it back here comes Campbell on the move oh and a tie up ston McCrae got two hands on it as he went to defend the drive and Cal will keep it with 26 on the timer both teams getting out transition right now heck of a call heck of a defensive play right there right now the second half has not been as clean as the first half but theres a lot of action lot going on both ways the effort has been there for the Hurricanes tonight their coaching staff had kind of questioned it a week ago go in that loss at home to SMU where they gave up 117 points to the Mustangs very much in this game tonight on the road Wilkinson C now one for five to start the second Music Applause half the first half for Cal we emphasized weve talked about it ball movement player movement the ball was hopping its sticking a little bit more this half they need to get that thing moving again late in the clock Johnson backing in Tucker turns around comes up short and here come the Golden Bears Wilkinson on the move and lays it in Jeremiah Wilkinson has a dozen Johnson knocks over petritis and a blocking foul called oh Miami hanging around in Berkeley looking for that coveted first conference Victory they Trail by six on the road in the Bay Music Area e e e e well you can help people affected by the California wildfires in 2025 by donating at redcrossorg ESPN to help the Red Cross respond and help people recover just devastating images coming from Southern California the last few weeks uh the good news is it sounds like many of those fires are contained and under control but boy those people still need your help redcrossorg ESPN and uh youve called California home for quite a while now I know you know many that have been around those scary fires down south yeah obviously Ive been been there and know a lot of people know people that have lost their homes and certainly a sad sad deal wish them all of our thoughts and prayers Miami basketball here out of the timeout the shot clock down to five Johnson realizes it pulls the trigger and hits the three has fourth tonight after knocking down just one in Miamis first eight conference games tell you what every time we go to timeout and this games in single digits Miamis confidence is going to grow C needs to try and turn it up try and get some easy things in transition but bottom line is they need to get some Applause stops Miami outs scoring California 94 to begin this second half Wilkinson steps through Dort wasnt ready for the pass and Cal turns it over heres Cleveland couple free throws for Miamis leading scorer the flow of the game right now the confidence is growing with Miami uh theyre getting stops on the defensive end theyre getting out in transition theyre getting points at the free throw line and you you really can you can see confidence growing on their bench you can see excitement from the guys on the bench cheering for their team guys are given a few more high fives and so for Cal right now you have to have some some semblance of uh a fight back right now get the excitement back to be honest with I wouldnt I wouldnt be surprised if uh Miami continues this for another minute or two to get the trus back in the game because hes a oneman wrecking crew of energy and excitement and the whole bit so hes the kind of guy that uh could help spark them kanes within a point trailed by 11 in the final minute of that first half Matthew Cleveland now 11 points Off the Bench B of Joseph facing up on Joe Bay and it pops out its a great play of great look just didnt go in Cleveland gets it back from Johnson Applause Music Kanes last lead was 65 3 minutes in St McCrae couldnt cash in from the Applause corner Campbell across the floor its good jhua Ola Joseph with his second three of the night he was too close on the last one on the easy layup he didnt want that farther you go out the more points you get really nice Rhythm really nice Applause shot Johnson matched up with Lee Dort backs him in kicks it out buta on the Move thats a silky finish for the Freshman I sure is great spacing with the other guys took the defense away Bea aggressive drive but had space there Lua walking a little ginger ly as he recoils defensively DJ Campbell Thea again favoring that left side as he comes away with the rebound yeah I think I just told the official he has a cramp so hopefully he can work that out in live action Divine Ugo chuu to the scores table Cleveland in a crowd nice defense inside from the Golden Bears as they get it back blackshire skips it Tucker dra a foul pushing in transition great job by Tucker there getting to the free throw line is a great way to stop some momentum there Christian Tucker a senior from Chandler Arizona spent the last three seasons at UTSA in San Antonio second in the American Conference at 5 and a half assists per game last season well markk Madson in his first two seasons in Berkeley has often gone to the transfer portal to try and build his rosters I mean who isnt doing this these days I was going to say its not we can put this graphic for any any team in the country right now and thats just the the world of college basketball but Mark Matson has really done a nice job not just getting good players The Possession Aral points the way to Miami off the free throw Miss BJ omite who averaged almost 17 a game in the Summit League at North Dakota last season had averaged double figures through four games this year before suffering a season ending injury Mark Madson made that public last week you know but these transfers I think I think hes done theyve done a nice job as a staff not just getting talented players but get guys that compliment each other and I think they have they have momentum right now in the league and um with what they have and the pieces they have it wouldnt surprise me if they continue this all right now theyre going Zone uh after a pass or two they may go man as well kind of in the middle of possession trying to get something going defensively to get some multiple stops in a row see if Joe Bay can be the Zone Buster walled off by Soko shot clock down to five ston McCrae and Soko there to clear away the Music Miss blackshire tried to sneak it to petritis Johnsons there for the takeaway and Soko is down Tony Padilla blows it dead and that will send us to a timeout Mar sasoko slow to get up after a golden bear giveaway tight game in the ACC tonight Cal by three on its home floor down the stretch at home against Miami the Lear more are by trans the world sustain engineered packaging and integrated TR engineer to get it there e coming up Monday on acc Network the Huddle crew will reveal the 2025 ACC football schedule breaking down each team and looking at Key weeks and matchups coverage of this twohour special begins at 9 Eastern on ACCC Network already some early season schedule reveals Miami will open against Notre Dame C against Oregon State M Soko took a shot to the side of the head before that last timeout and has gone back into the locker room for further evaluation yeah it looks like not only one shot maybe a second shot as well so certainly unfortunate right there the second half both teams are shooting into into 30s in terms of their percentage so its not quite as clean as the first half more deflections defensively a lot more activity defensively for both teams Miami is out scored C 138 to open this second half Cleveland leaning in tough bucket and give him one on the house Matthew Cleveland will have a chance to tie it so we talked about that in the first half when Cleveland gets down there hes a real threat to score but hes also a threat to pass out so Cal worked off on this in their shoot around today really trying to have great activity with the perimeter players theyre not going to double theyre not going to sell out but what they have to do is try and get the ball out of his hands but thats thats something thats uh can to be effective for Miami going down the stretch Matthew Cleveland is one of the more accomplished players in the ACC over 1400 career points has 14 Off the Bench tonight and weve got 55s on the board in Berkeley Wilkinson for the lead Dort turns couple good looks there really good set play Great Looks they got exactly what they wanted just couldnt Applause finish beat Cleveland all right same look in the post he finds Johnson and Miami has its first lead since the opening minutes timeout Mark Madson you can feel the confidence growing for the hurricanes on the road in Northern California and for good reason confidence getting the ball into Cleveland hes a scorer and a passer big finish up two women basketball team returns Hospital th January 30th of Carolina Applause and e e e impressive second half put together by the Miami Hurricanes who have jumped in front of California with 1052 to play well you nailed it going into the timeout right there confidence is growing for Miami getting the flections running the floor on the break great balance offensively from shooting threes to getting it in the post theyre getting a few offensive rebounds now theyre having some token full court pressure but the bottom line is this is a talented team coach Matson told me that before the game he said they do not lack for talent but confidence is the key factor and its growing right now for Miami see how the Golden Bears respond out of Mark matsons first used timeout Music tonight Campbell working on the Freshman Ugo chuku shot loock down to five spins elevates and fls it in its an awfully nice luxury as a coach just to have somebody be able to make a play for themselves late in the shot clock they had an offensive possession that didnt turn into anything it was good idea just didnt turn turn into it and then mckin just finishes Cleveland right back at you the soft touch on the left hand finger roll and right now Agent Zero on both sides getting after it but Wilkinson I wouldnt be surprised if he goes right back again looks to get downhill the youngster for Cal the veteran for Miami doing the heavy lifting on offense tonight the Hurricanes back up two here inside of 10 minutes Cleveland picks up Campbell Wilkinson PSE and hes fouled on a three for the second time tonight thats where is a coaching staff if you have hair it turns Gray and so what they have to be able to do you know its a really a touchy situation right there I dont know that he landed in the same spot he shot from he was drifting forward a little bit as a Defender you have to let him land uh but at the same time you expect him to land where he jumped from so um got to give him space to land right there but defensively youre dont feel great about that one cuz you feel like you played it pretty well foul is on AJ ston McCrae Cal one of the best teams in the ACC at getting to the free throw line they average more than 22 foul shots a game and theyre first in the ACC and free throws made per game where they average about 17 and Wilkinson sinks all three to put the Golden Bears back in front Cal trying to change Tempo just get a different little feel uh of the second half cuz its just been a grind right now Miamis building confidence so they went from a soft press back to a zone right now ball goes middle theyre looking to match up man a little bit more Cleveland side the hot hand forces it up and its going the other way a foul away from the basketball on Brandon Johnson as Miami turns it over Applause inside right now petritis working hard to box out both guys fighting pushing draws the foul going the other way Golden Bears Just 4 for 12 from the field since the start of the second half got 45 of the opening 20 minutes Wilkinson skips it Corner po Here Comes Ugo chuku off the O of Joseph Applause Miss Johnson didnt put enough on it Johnson maybe should have shot that hes been shooting it great from the threepoint line today open look for Applause Campbell coming up on 8 minutes to play in bir cam its a great shot that you cant turn that shot down its just you got to have to make some of those this last eight minutes Hugo chuku crosses over out to Cleveland five to shoot we go chuko Baseline and a foul with one on the timer The Freshman has a chance to put the canes back in front and Petrus does so many good things defensively uh but there he gambled CL shock clock you just want to be solid they were in a bad spot he gambled off the corner his man goes back door they end up getting to the free throw line thats one I would label that as a mental mistake well the intent was for a Divine with a red shirt back in the summer but really turned some heads in preseason camp Hey Monday night weve got a great womens basketball matchup on ESPN 2 as second ranked South Carolina heads toight Knoxville takes on 17th ranked Tennessee ESPN 2 7 Eastern on Monday night in Newfound ACC country were nodded again 60s on the board inside of 8 Applause minutes the most competitive that Miami has played since earlier this month and and seemingly each possession they have a little bit more confidence theyre talking a little bit more defensively theyre sliding their feet challenging shots St up a shot there DJ Campbell connects on the turnaround to put the Golden Bears back up too 11 for Campbell tonight to go along with five boards and four assists Applause Music Joe Bay steps back and puts it in the bench right now for Miami is as excited as theyve been all season theyre jumping up theyre highfiving theyre Music celebrating the canes have matched cow step for step mokos back in the game for the Golden Bears its good news for Cal after he took a couple shots to the face earlier in the half another late shot clock possession petritis Taps it out black sh off the side of the iron Here Comes Cleveland with a head of steam a nice contest from Campbell to get in there and alter the shot really great effort getting back in transition I like that Miami is trying to push and transition themselves though trying to get an easy basket just Cleveland got a little bit off balance and a great Hustle by Cal to alter the shot Wilkinson tried to skip it inside the Soko and Cal turns it over again Miami the active hands defensively they disrupted a lot of those entry passes tonight no question a lot more deflections in this second half especially some of thats turned into transition if Im Miami I dont want this thing to turn into a grinded out game I want it up and down free Applause flowing Johnson took the extra step before the jump stop and the Hurricanes give it right back but MI YY eager to hit that ACC win column theyve got a onepoint lead in Berkeley inside of 6 minutes big shot from Paul job Music Rec the impr easy digal toal St every make most importantly has made Comm to a cleer SafeRide guar the sa way to Music the Eastway with Oak airport airport of the Music golden its time for the gr start cut the video Music e e Applause well it is retro night here in Berkeley we take a look back on Golden Bears of yester year of course Jaylen Brown the reigning NBA Finals MVP played here for a season under quanzo Martin Kevin Johnson made a name for himself here in Berkeley back in the mid 80s and well I mean before the big three of the Bay Area KD Stephen Clay there was kid HH and Murray back here in in the mid90s a few years ago its sad were talking retro and Im in the picture but uh I guess when you turn 50 all bets are off and and the only assignment we had for you all week was to dig up your old Cal Jersey you could find I have it its in storage and I went to the storage shed I could not find it so uh I failed I Applause failed C Trails by a point dying a third straight win but Miami has been a tough customer tonight hurricanes havent been within single digits of a final score since the early days of January Reus Petrus will head to the free throw line to try and put Cal back in front but you said it if Miami could just hang around for a half and believe a little bit coming out of the break theyd make a game of this and sure enough they have absolutely and uh you know I if Im Miami I dont want it to turn into just a halfcourt grinded out game I want to keep it free flowing play loose play Confident but what Cal did there I love it got back to a little bit that ball screen continuity it got to multiple sides of the floor they got going downhill they got to the free throw line they shared the basketball this half they only have one assist and thats the exact opposite of what we uh talked about in the first half so trying to make plays for each other uh and then on the defensive end find ways to get stops if youre Applause Cal fifth tie weve had six lead changes in this game the last foul on Brandon Johnson whos got six for Miami he heads to the bench with 530 left and a tie game so weve seen this defense a couple times the soft press back into his own and then they end up matching up manto man later in The Possession Joe Bay out of control and he draws a foul so the sophomore from France played well at Stanford Wednesday night at 97 boards on the farm well head to the free throw line for the Hurricanes whove been pretty efficient at the foul line tonight 12 to 15 Cal had a little bit of miscommunication up top allowed Miami to get downhill there and didnt know if they were going to switch it it was a dribble handoff theres a little bit of space didnt know if they were going to stay with their own and switch it ends up getting into the free throw line Joe Bs seconde hurricane appeared in 16 games as a true freshman last year was a fourstar prospect ESPN had him as the 14th best play in Florida coming out of high school into West Oaks Academy in the Sunshine State kans by Applause two tail of two halves here coach it really has been theres no question and the the ball movement hasnt been quite as good I mean were at 17 16 on the shot clock weve only had one player handle the basketball so far there we go now were making assist for somebody in the big big finish and one with Soko well he needed that hes been pretty quiet Applause tonight there their second assist of the half and again its making plays for others getting the ball moving getting players moving and a big finish Christian Tucker with the no look setup forced to too his third assist tonight mty spent the last four years playing for Tom ISO at Michigan State originally from Mali in Africa has been using his nil money to build a school and medical clinic back in his hometown in mly the way the staff and the administration talks about him is so wonderful just a a great human loves his team loves the university plays hard what college athletics is about Jo B operates downhill stops pops and flutters it in So cal played the exact same defense Miami went back to the exact same offensive play they didnt get fouled but they made a twofooter right there lot of confidence shown by the young Paul job down the stretch as the Hurricanes reclaim the lead Wilkinson explosive move and off the window and in it goes its a play they love to run late in games right there a little bit of a a brush scin or a ghost scen getting Wilkinson going to his left and downhill I really expect them to do that again Joe Bay hangs comes up short Cal had a five on four but again Tony Billa blows it dead and thats Joe Bay whos been a big piece for Miami here down the stretch well check on him on the other side onepoint game in Berkeley help than for our partner chicka every assist recorded during todays men game results in a generous donation of 10 meals from ChickfilA to local organization so far this season 130 assists here at thats 1300 meals for those in need thank you to ChickfilA chicken and go lucky R is presented by Pete cofy born here in Berkeley and committ to older better fresher coffee section 17 bro H youre getting free coffee yeah there you go be excited about it e Music Applause well Miami just two seasons removed from a final four appearance for the first time in program history but the following two seasons have not gone as planned for the Hurricanes whove won just 21 of their games following that final four run two seasons ago that came to an end against the eventual National Champion Yukon Huskies the first of Coach Hurleys repeat there in stores and well a win tonight will go along long way and boosting these numbers up just a little bit yeah we should may call that slide the good news bad news good news is youre in the final four and then theres some bad news afterwards but uh I tell you what highly competitive game got guys cramping up a little bit fighting hard its been fun watching the benches a lot of enthusiasm on the benches from the coaches and players and uh they know both teams know last four minutes will decide this game six ties nine lead changes and a onepoint contest inside of four minutes in Berkeley I think youre going to see a lot of Wilkinson late in this game making plays for himself or for others Little Ghost screen right here him going downhill to his left again St McCrae stayed with him Wilson just a little bit better and I think what youre going to see on this end is Matthew Cleveland same kind of thing finding ways for him to get it in the post or drive himself cuz he can make a lot of different plays and to timeout Miami after the Cal back in half a minute threepoint game 333 to play Music Music Cal LED this game by his many as 11 points late in the first half Miami has taken a couple of second half leads but hurricanes Trail by three here with 333 to play on a night where interim head coach Bill Courtney is hoping to register his first victory since the great Jim Lena called it a career the day after Applause Christmas ston McCrae attacks and scores in sight really nice job coming out of the timeout they have a little bit of false action end up being a oneonone play out the entire side Satan did a nice job finishing right there under control Music Miami working late in the clock again bet Tri is falling away here comes Matthew Applause Cleveland Cleveland and Brandon Johnson pacing Miami with 16 points a piece tonight Cleveland for the lead its in a round and down for Matthew Cleveland and Miami has jumped in front with with 242 to play Matthew Cleveland is not only a talented player hes an experienced player has confidence hes been in this kind of situation before comes off the ball screen with a lot of confidence gets the roll a lot of action coming up last 242 well it was a week ago Cleveland had a career high 31 points in a lopsided loss at home against SMU hes got 19 tonight and none bigger than that step back goahead three here inside of three Music minutes hey our big Monday double header on ESPN starts at 830 Eastern NC State heads to Cameron indor to face Cooper flag and number two Duke thats followed by Third ranked Iowa State and Arizona at 1030 big Monday on ESPN and the ESPN act IA State erasing a first half deficit in 10 coming back to beat the sundevils and well try and sweep that desert road trip Miami trying to split this Bay Area road trip they lost by 37 points Wednesday night at Stanford but theyre up two and a great chance to get their first Conference win finally in this game tonight if they can finish well anything they should be playing loose and confident obviously theyre excited right now they know theyre going to be getting on a plane for a long flight and it would be a whole lot sweeter with a win uh theyre smiling coming out out of the timeout right now high fives uh I think its something they dont have a lot to worry about and right now Cal you know you kind have two options one is get that ball moving from side to side have everybody touching it the other option is kind of keep it simple uh get Wilkinson going down hill both teams are kind of opting for some false action and then getting in the ball handler to make the play getting downhill with a lot of space Miamis last win was back on December 15th at home against Presbyterian it has been a long time for the Hurricanes that wind column has been very elusive since Jim Lena stepped aside Divine Ugo chuku picking up the foul and Miamis one away from putting Cal in the bonus the rest of the night Miami has to know right now that uh this is a great opportunity and you dont do it by trying harder its almost just relaxing having fun trying to get that win on the board right now you look at those results of late they have come all that close the off for Jeremiah Wilkinson hes uh you know its funny right now Cal has the most confidence in Wilkinson with the ball in his hands hes young he doesnt have the experience but boy is he Dynamic and offensively for Miami I still think Cleveland is a great option Jo B back in the game swings to Cleveland for the lead and he missed this one tapped around and recovered by sasoko who swings around the elbows with the Miss pretty good look for Miami on that one Cal got caught in between their Zone going into a man was a step late but they end up getting the defensive rebound after a Miss shot Wilkinson steps through and puts the Golden Bears in front he has matched his career high with 25 tonight the timeout hurricanes with 89 seconds left to play theres a freshman Phenom in berley and his name is Jeremiah wikinson nobody should be surprised right now one end really good offense get a clean look doesnt drop on the other end time and time again getting the ball to Wilkinson getting to his left hand finding ways to get downhill Big Time bucket minute 30 left his fourth 20 point game of the season and matches the 25 he had back in November here against Mercy Hurst and heres our game summary inside of 90 seconds Wilkinson the game high 25 Cleveland with 19 to Pace Miami and while both teams shooting above what they usually do from the perimeter in this game they havent had that same type of success in this second half no its been fun to watch the the defensive adjustments by both team the defensive energy by Botham team teams and and what youre seeing now is offensively both teams I think are simplifying Wilkinson what hes doing everybody knows whats going to happen hes going to get the basketball hes going to try and drive to his left hes shown that he can go to his right but if youre Miami right now youre getting Gap help youre finding ways to get the ball out of his left hand and getting somebody else to shoot the shot you do not want Wilkinson going left making another basket youve seen that story too many times there were question marks when Andre St yovic was listed out on Wednesday against Florida state with those flu like symptoms Wilkinson answered the bell with 18 points in that game a cal Victory no sto yakovich again tonight dealing with a bad hip and Wilkinson has stepped up again and matched his season high of 25 points you have to think Matthew Cleveland will be at the focal point of every possession on this end from Miami down the stretch well I agree but Cal now is their showing Zone and when the go ball goes middle theyre matching up man can Miami get that ball to the middle and then try and get Cal in some of a kind of a scramble situation getting out of this Zone Miamis Best effort in a month can they pay it off with a victory Jo B out of the shot fake now its patha shot clock in a single digits Cleveland on the Baseline picked up by Campbell Soko helps defensively Cleveland Nails the turnaround jump shot and were tied again Applause now a foul after the make not a foul rather a delay of game warning on the Freshman Jalil Bea that wont cost Miami anything here could be costly if another delay of game comes against the Hurricanes Matthew Cleveland in the post that was against the zone They never got out of the Zone because the ball never went into the high everything you could have hoped for tonight tie game inside of a minute its Wilkinson again dashing down the lane and a foul called in the act of shooting Jeremiah Wilkinson that just look like a carbon copy of the last four or five possessions for Cal its pretty easy being an analyst right now we know whats going to happen theres going to be a little bit of a little bit of an action get the ball to Wilkinson going left and hes making things happen hes doing a tremendous Music job now the FR from Powder Springs Georgia was the first incoming freshman to Ink with Cal under Mark Madson and he has shown a lot of trust in his young Frost tonight his 14th game in double figures scoring so on the other end Miami I think they want to find a way in this early zone defense to get it to the middle ideally in the first 10 seconds and then when you pass it out Cal is going into a manto man and you might be able to get an opportunity as theyre transitioning from Zone to man or if you want to score late in the shot clock now youre going against the man so can they get the ball to the Middle season and career high 27 for Wilkinson Golden Bears by two Cleveland begging for the ball MAA drives across the floor ston McCrae it bounces off tapped around taken by blackshire the shot clock is dark C races up the floor and Campbell will peel it out as hes fouled by beo with 214 boy Matthew Cleveland the entirety of that possession was asking for the basketball and he never touched it other was it was just a stagnant possession against that zone the ball never went to the middle they it was on the perimeter the whole time you got to find ways to threaten the paint and you want Cleveland obviously to be able to touch the basketball I love what Cal did right here in a break situation if you can get a get an easy basket an easy layup you would take that and go up four they didnt have it try and burn a couple more seconds oh Campbell Miss fires on the front end but it ricochets back to him and hes fouled again this is right now Miami what I want to see them hes getting a great huddle communicate and find a way to get this rebound if theres another Miss right here this is exactly what youre talking about Cleveland wants the basketball he has the experience we want him to get the ball in his hands I also think finding ways right now continue to try and get the ball in that zone early into the middle obviously theres not a lot of time left right now expect Miami to push the basketball try and get downhill plenty of time left you dont have to have a three even if he misses this you dont have to have a three each side has one timeout remaining Campbell drills both Miami has to go taking too much time way too much time Cleveland hit and fouled by petritis with 81 thats where experience comes in Matthew Cleveland when he gets the basketball he goes downhill immediately gets a shot immediately continue to get the ball into his hands if youre Miami but you just dont want 10 seconds to run off the clock by the time he does get in this Applause hands so I think petrius and I think fairly would argue there wasnt much of a foul but defensively if you dont show your hands a lot of times thats going to get called anyway so the trus next time hes going to want to show his hands get them above get them out but show the refs that your hands are not in there cuz sometimes the refs dont have a great angle to see where your hands are Matthew Cleveland enjoying his seventh 20 plus point game of the season tonight hes now got 22 two all right its going to be one possession game full court press potentially dont foul right away try and get one steal and then foul but you dont want to take a lot of time five wide P Tri is serving as the quarterback and finds guess who Wilkinson whos seemingly had his fingerprints on every Big Moment down the stretch for California tonight absolutely all were going football I know football seasons over right now but uh taking the ball out of bounds everybody getting on the Baseline running their down andout patterns their their button hooks I dont know a darn thing about football but I can pretend they do a nice job getting it in getting fou executing the play well Im surprised petrius knew how to pass that hed spent the last two years at Air Force they never pass now Wilkinson continues to add to a career night now 28 for the young freshman he is not shy played with a lot of confidence second one short Miami has a chance and Bill Courtney before the Hurricanes could even think about a game tying attempt uses his final timeout now Im going to ask you a question that is often asked around this juncture of a game that looks like this do you foul so the answer is yes okay but theres a caveat right now because with 4 seconds left in the half court situation you have to expect that theyre going to be going up to shoot the basketball so the answer is if you can get somebody to put it on the ground and foul in the balls on the ground I absolutely believe in fouling but if there is any concern any worry that theyre going to go up and shoot the basketball you cannot get your hands in there so you have to have discipline uh coach Madson needs to be able to you know trust his team right now with the direction hes given if you dont feel like theyre going to understand the difference between somebody going into a shooting motion then maybe you just take your chance but I love the idea of fing as long as theyre putting the ball on the ground and theyre not in their shooting motion ideally Miami I would love for them to draw a play right now that doesnt require two or three dribbles somehow get a couple of screening actions so somebody can catch and shoot immediately because that would give you enough time for an offensive rebound Miami not a good threepoint shooting team but they have 10 makes tonight do they have one more in them across the floor its Schartz touch pass Cleveland he puts it in with a second left Wilkinson Hees overtime in Berkeley what a game what a play excited about playing basketball and I think they have a group right now thats playing for each other Cal led by eight at the break Miami outscored the Golden Bears 4032 the final 20 minutes of Regulation Golden Bears have it first in the overtime session so the next thing to look for I think were going to get a variety of things offensively no question so Miami actually now tasted of Cals own medicine theyve gone Zone to get the ball out of Wilkinsons hands a little bit clock in the single digits Joe vineer opens up the OT scoring and thats what I was going to say there there needs to be some secondary scoring for Cal theyre going to struggle if all they do is go on the perimeter thats what they have to do get the ball in the middle of the Court thats where youre going to be able to break down that zone a dozen for Paul job who sinks the game tying elbow jump shot now black shirt dribbles underneath skips it out Campbell hesitated there watched by Cleveland now gets the mismatch with the Freshman Schwarz and draw is a Applause foul so for Miami now I think you know with Jo B feeling comfortable in there just got a post touch in the middle of the floor I think thats the thats the secret sauce right now is find ways to get him touches if if thats who you want in the middle and then now that hes made that shot hes going to draw some attention hes going to want to spray it to the other players and then what Cals doing is going man and so now you can really drive oneon one and try and create some situations from there DJ Campbell the Junior from Hampton Virginia puts Cal back in front was a perfect six for six at the free throw line on Wednesday night in Cals victory over Florida State and now four for five in this game both teams are comfortable with knowing whats going to happen and now its the ability to attack efficiently theyre going to stay in that zone stay in the zone until it gets to the middle Cleveland has it knocked away Johnson recovers Joe Bay for the lead and he missed it off the side of the iron unless you get to the middle youre going to be shooting a contested three for Miami right now so there has to be a real focus of getting it in there wison crossing blades with the Freshman Schwarz Music clock into single digits Campbell goes Baseline elevates and draws another foul its on Schwartz Applause again your secondary scorers are are making plays right now theyre doing a really nice job Campell get into the free throw line it was really good defense right there just at the end of the day Schwarz ends up getting him on the elbow got to be disciplined enough not to do that doesnt hurt as much when you tap the shooting Applause sleeve well DJ Campbell double figure scor last year with the catamounts of Western Carolina in the Southern Conference a 17 tonight four straight free throw makes an overtime was 2 two1 theyre not trying to get steals out of this just trying to slow it down to touch around the perimeter is going to be hard theyre going to stay matched Applause up Johnson finds Joe Bay across the floor intercepted by Campbell Coast to Coast they put it in six straight for DJ Campbell its Banger after Banger in overtime from DJ and a Sixpoint lead for the Golden Bears and his confidence is skyh high right now in Miami if youre not going to pass you have to dribble it but you have to get the ball inside the threepoint line attack attack attack there we go Cleveland serving as the Zone Buster but he missed the turnaround jump shot 10 boards for Soko inside of two minutes Cal has outscored Miami 82 in the overtime session I would expect the hot hand again in regulation it was Wilkinson now its going to Applause Camp theres petritis backing in Jo the double clutch and the contact and eventually the free throws for Reus PES its hit some sort of reset button at the end of regulation and they have gone about this overtime session so professionally so comfortably on their home floor as Joe B has fouled out yeah I mean and obviously Campbell lighting it up helps everything but that last possession was a really a good possession they mil so much time off the clock they got the ball to multiple sides everybody touched the basketball and at the end of the possession they go downhill get the ball to the paint draw a foul I mean if youre going to design a play or an offense late game situation up six thats exactly what you want to do well Joe Bay done for the rest of the night whatever remains of it 138 on this overtime session and after Joe Bay hit a jump shot on Miamis first trip the hurricanes have not scored and now they find themselves down seven you know thing Miami has to do is they you know they have different guys kind of floating in and out of the middle uh Cals not really doing a a heck of a job trying to keep it out so we need but Miami just needs to get a body in there throw him the basketball then they can look to attack where does the urgency come from on this end for the Hurricanes its Schwarz deep three its good Austin Schwarz thats like medicine right now for the hurricanes and theyre back in this game down four with a Buck 22 to play theyre not going away the other answer is just shoot it from 25 ft knock it in call timeout youre good to go well how do you beat the Zone Austin Schwarz had an answer that possession absolutely deep shot challenged shot but at the end of the day everything looks good when the shots go in an ESPN top 50 recruit out of high Applause school a capable threepoint shooter his 20th make this season and Miami now out of timeouts Golden Bears Mark Madson has two in his back pocket and its Cal basketball with a bu 22 on the clock up four points trying to survive at home and went a third straight game this is a home heavy stretch Cal feels like this is a stretch that could change the trajectory of their season its a stretch where they play five of six here in Berkeley and the lone trip is the shortest excluding Stanford it it it must feel like a puddle J jump going to SMU after going cross country every other week in this conference piece of cake piece of cake I think what youre going to see here is Cal is going to try and milk the clock and Miami does a nice try and gamble see if they can make Cal burp it up and Cal does a nice job milking the clock right now they bring it inside of a minute now its under 10 on the shot clock look to drive make plays for others thats the recipe blir put in the Applause dagger Miami needs to score quickly now they cant take 10 15 extra seconds on this possession right now they are Schwarz dials it up from coner and he missed everything excellent job of Cal on the offensive end sharing the basketball then petrius late shot clock they get down to six5 on the shot makes a play like they did in the first half make a play for your teammate come get to the paint make a stop that was really good stuff yeah Mark Madson wants timeout his team has taking control here in overtime up seven with 40 seconds left and Joon blackshire has added to the great guard play for Cal tonight it was Wilkinson as you mentioned at the end of regulation Campbell early in overtime and blackshire may have just hit the biggest shot of the night absolutely and uh the guard play has been really really good as theyre getting the basketball in right now if youre Miami youre youre willing to gamble some you dont want anybody to throw the basketball um you know a short pass if they throw it over the top and they complete it so be it U if Cal runs that similar play out of bounds where theyre having everybody start out of bounds making button hooks and you know making down and outs and things like that I would face guard him and make him make that football pass and as you said petrius if hes inbounding it hes from Air Force we dont know if he can really throw that ball in the football scheme of things so lets lets test his arm a little bit I think Justin Willcox helped Mark Madson with this DJ Campbell bouncing around and California gets it across ston McCrae fouls petritis with 332 for right now obviously not turning the ball over is is Paramount but then also getting the ball in your best free throw shooter hands and so just being intentional about who has the basketball uh as you get down the stretch right now because now its be smart defensively try and extend the game as long as possible by playing your Zone and playing your two21 press and then come to this end and do exactly what to try to stay knock in your free Applause throws well Matthew Cleveland sent this game to over time with an off balance three with 1 second left in regulation but C has been able to recover here in overtime they lead by eight 30 seconds left Cleveland will Spin and draws a foul Matthew Cleveland working on another big night in ACC plays 26 points couple free throws on the way you could argue that no team is has had the Tipsy Turvy road that Miami has had this season with the midseason resignation of Jim Lona people forget Nigel pack is on this team hes missed the last 10 games now one of the more accomplished players in all the college basketball and Bill Courtney I mean he told us last night at practice theyve just been trying any type of lineup any type of rotation and while they might come up short in this game uh theyve got to find some type of confidence to leave town with absolutely you know at the end of the day what you want the guys to do is try try and get as much conf conf as you can try to be excited about being part of the team about representing your University and to be honest with you this is called life you know it it gets tough once youre out of college youre going to have a lot more lessons in life that are going to challenge you and you have to be able to overcome adversity keep a positive attitude and so as much as anything right now its the life lessons of sticking together keeping positive and hopefully build a little confidence around along the way and then they keep playing like they did tonight theyll theyll theyll get a win before too long Bill Courtney says every day since Jim Lena stepped aside those two have been in touch its often gone to Jim for advice during this tough stretch and the tough part about what Bill Courtneys been asked to do here as the interim there arent a ton of kids on this roster that have been able to learn the culture that Jim larena instilled in his 13 and a half Seasons with this Miami program Matthew Cleveland whos been here for a year and a half is the most tenur player on the squad Dayton McCrae drills the three makes this a fivepoint game with 16 seconds left trius will facilitate Campbell will race to the basket and Johnson has fouled out with 13 seconds left you know culture is something that in college basketball was always thought of as a fouryear proposition that freshman learned the principles of your system and your core values and then as sophomores they really become ingrained and as Juniors and seniors you not only live those principles but you teach them to the Freshman so culture being four years now is its a different deal I think coaches that can really develop and build cultures year by year um are going to be the most successful and thats not necessarily an easy thing its a different Paradigm than whats been in the past when you think about all the great coaches from the ACC that have stepped aside in recent memor Roy Williams coach K Jim beheim Tony Bennett right before the start of the Season at Virginia Ron Sanchez has been the interim head coach for the ho this season and boy it just looks a lot different than it did a few years ago in college basketball Divine Ugo chuku out to ston McCrae and he buries another three Miami within three with 72 and Mark Madson will take that final timeout though hurricanes refuse to quit tonight dont shovel dirt on them yet Im impressed they havent quit it all theyre making plays down the stretch theyve stayed together you know the hard part is its a whole lot easier to build confidence and build excitement after a win but theyll be able to go to the locker room either way after this game and and and take some take some things that we consider as building blocks so but it is sure a whole lot easier with a win either side has any more timeouts remaining after Mark Matson took his last here with 72 so Mark Matson Cal right now theyre talking about not only getting the basketball in theyre talking about uh they dont have any timeouts they dont have the possession arrow and so they need to get the basketball in dont let the ball get tied up and then uh ideally get the ball in your best best free throw Shooters hands but this is not a time where you can get sloppy um you need to have options a and then if option A isnt there get to option b quickly P trus right now he understands he can run the Baseline he should use that to his Music Advantage the other thing I would love right now if your petritis is ask the official to count out loud so you know when you need to throw that basketball in the trus gets it into Wilkinson he is not scored here in the overtime session but has a chance at a 30 piece if he can sink a couple of free throws here Matthew Cleland Jeremiah Wilkinson the senior and freshman respectively big knights in the scoring Department both teams have shot it above their head so to speak from threepoint territory tonight neither team is really oriented around its perimeter shooting but its been a strength for both Miami and Cal and the Golden Bears in good position to win their third straight this is a big boost in a year where the ACC is only taking 15 of 18 teams to the conference tournament in Charlotte absolutely if you want to finish your finish your year in Charlotte for sure Cal doing a nice job here just burning a little bit of time with the Press well Matthew Cleveland will add some garbage time points hes got a 30 piece tonight for a second straight Saturday and Music petritis has it knocked out by Bea and that is incomplete pass apparently Air Force is still a running team wheres the fullback dive when you need it oh this is reviewable obviously inside of two minutes and the officials will try and make sure they have this right if it is with Cal thats more than likely enough for the Golden Bears to escape uh a pesky Miami team tonight good think off the right hand of Bea there yeah I think so I think so and if thats the case keep it simple if youre Cal dont throw it too deep or anything crazy make sure somebody touches the basketball and get to the locker room and get out of here heck of a game heck of a game lot for both teams a lot you can take from a lot you can learn from I think thats going to be cow ball Miami did a nice job forcing him to throw it deep though that was the right play it was a little bit uh more inaccurate maybe get a clean clean catch throw up a heave that was that was their chance for sure and so Miami executed defensively what you needed to do long 3000 plus mile trip back to Coral Gables after this one for the Hurricanes theyll get ready for a two game home stand in which they hope brings them their first post Jim Lena Victory theyve got Virginia on Wednesday Notre Dame a week from now other thing theyre looking at here is the clock 710 of a second was originally placed on the timer and well add a little more maybe 89 28 seconds Z Matthew Cleveland commits a foul before the ball even comes in not the worst idea with no its a great idea sub 70 free throw shooter in Mar Soko bottom lineage youre deciding whos going to shoot this one if he misses this first ones just catch it no dribbles Let it Fly you know maybe you could get one dribble but I would just say catch it turn right now you know who if anybody play quarterback in high school and thats a WRA Bill Courtneys team has been questioned their effort during this losing streak Miami gave it all they had tonight and theyll come up just short on the road in Berkeley well nice job for Cal to find a way to get this done but a lot of credit goes to Bill Courtney and the Miami team as well Cal survives in overtime at home and the Golden Bears have one three straight as they
