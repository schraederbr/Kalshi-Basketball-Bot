yeah coleman ryan was in heat check mode all game against duke he had a career high 28 points 21 in the first half he is hot right now in his last five games 16 points a game 63 from two and sixty percent behind the arc irish 17359 three weeks ago at coral gables game two tonight we get matt potter brent hampton the umpires and on valentines day who else is the referee but ted valentine and miami wins the tip and the canes who start their sixth different lineup in the last six ball games have first crack at it and wong early and heres a look at the irish starting lineup features cormac ryan in there for a second straight ball game too paul mike bray started him after the georgia tech game and it paid off with 28 points the first time these two teams met it was 7359 but the score was not indicative of how close the game really was you see leski get the irish ahead and heres miamis second possession elijah olanie is the transfer from stony brook whos had an impact since uh coming back into the lineup after an ankle injury and wong on the reset of the offensive iron a minute in inside the shot got blocked off the hand of harlem beverly in a notre dame fight miami a very resilient team this year with all the injuries distractions interruptions notre dame had to shoot 65 percent in the second half in the first meeting to pull away foul was on nate leszewski his first and harlan beverly at the line not a particularly strong freethrow shooter this miami team is 13th in the acc at 68 percent three ball from orion missed off the back iron it will stay with the irish and of course the notre dame head coach 61 year old mike gray now in season number 21 the alltime winningest coach in notre dame history and hes had five 21 seasons in the acc and he has a great pulse on his team Music after the georgia tech loss that story today was fabulous cormac ryan did not get a shot off with an opportunity to tie or win the game mike gray met with his staff on the bus next day he decided to start cormac ryan at duke paid off with 28 points coaching is so much more than xs and os and recruiting you have to know the pulse of your team and this guy right here does it as well as any coach in the country paul why does he have such a good feel this team this not the third or fourth straight year theyve been really good once february hits does it sometimes take teams a couple months to jail sometimes and certainly this year all bets are off i guess yeah absolutely his team is the junior class is the the core of this team so last year they started to see the light at the end of their sophomore year they started slow this year i think a lot of teams started slow except for baylor and gonzaga this year and maybe iowa and now theyre starting to play with that confidence he told us this morning this team now is showing signs of life and theres still plenty of games to go on juwan durham as nasir brooks the transfer from cincinnati had a chance and he will go to the line where he is 62 percent so the irish have committed a couple of early fouls here but a moment ago beverly couldnt take advantage at the line and neither can brooks by the way the free throw percentage we spoke of its 68 from miami it drops even further down in conference play to 67 percent and brooks hits the back end to put the canes on the board 211 into the ball game and its unusual for notre dame to follow this early they lead the country in fewest falls at 11 per game so they only have nine more mulligans to go yeah lob for the post during the catch and scores with the right hand nice bucket for the tampa grad student juwan durham whos been playing pretty well as of late he also leads the acc and field goal percentage in conference play everybody talks about the shooting and the spacing the passing of notre dame and thats all true but they have a little bit of an anchor inside with geron durham last five games this stat is incredible last five games hes shooting 74 one point lead for the irish beverly had it altered recovered durham heres hub the irish trying to get in transition without numbers ryan trailing at the front notre dame does not need numbers to put it up no sir skip for cormac ryan a shot fake gets him to the baseline back around the front for hub back room miss on a triple and brooks the rebound miami has to do a great job in this game of chasing notre dame off the threepoint line its going to be a big key in this game jim larenega said when they catch the ball weve got to be there on the catch misses from the perimeter on the right brooks recovered the deflection and then he is fouled and thats going to be the second on juwon durham so all three notre dame fouls belong to the two guys in the front court leski enduro and here with 16 21 to go juwan durham is in foul trouble and nasir brooks goes back to the free throw line and that means nicola who played 13 minutes in the victory at duke the other day has to check in early for the 6 11 tampa native durham joe a big body six eight 230 pounds hes got a little outside shot but he is primarily in the game to bang inside Music still a 43 ball game goodwin in the corner theres joe go dropping to three 11th triple of the year for the senior from ontario yeah he can make that catch and shoot threepoint shot percentage is not great but if you give him time he can make you pay irish the fourpoint lead on joe goes triple here paul and his own youre going to see a lot of zone defense by the irish tonight theyre gonna have to make miami prove it but gusty feeds ola knee nice move underneath for the basket yeah jim laranega has seen zone all season long they havent been real successful against it but they do a great job of not settling just to shoot that threepoint shot they do a great job of working the baseline the short corner in the middle and cormac ryan drops a three so backtoback threes for notre dame their last two possessions theyve doubled the number on miami early its never been a problem for notre dame to score points if theyre going to finish strong the second half of the acc its going to be about the defensive end isaiah wong drops a three now neither team can miss and hub tries to keep the answer cannot Music twopoint game wong for the lead and miami has it yeah no body pressure against isaiah wong you gotta get up into his space take it away make him put it on the deck force him into help the last two threes by wong hes had plenty of time and space jogo on the attack all the way to the rim for the easy bucket not a lot of defending at either impal Music everybodys afraid of foul trouble miami doesnt have enough bodies to get in foul trouble and notre dame doesnt play defense usually with enough urgency on a regular basis to be in foul trouble next pass oh yeah brooks delivers on the dunk hes got three miami back in front on the hammer from nasir brooks mike bray told me last week he said look weve been doing a lot of oneonone compete drills trying to teach my guys how to play defense on an island driveby hub got blocked heres beverly trying to get to the rim the kick back from augustine pull up in the lane by cameron mcgusty and lazzewski the rebound for the irish federer had five lead changes here in first six and change and make it six on the hump drive first points for prentiss huh yeah miami totally was lost in that conversion first thing you do is stop the ball the second thing pick up cutters to the basket a little bit of a ymca feel right now getting what they want the two teams are 1123 and theres the drive and bucket from mcgusty ryan is hurt on the play and a foul is called snowy south in indiana cormac ryan on the move toward the notre dame locker room team doctor going to give him some treatment and you get a look here he stepped on the foot of nate liszeski it looks like paul he did and hes holding his his ankle now he walked off under his own power which was a great sign but he went to the locker room so theyll take a look at it see how severe it is yep cameron magusti will shoot the free throw fouls on nate liszeski it was his second so notre dame brings juwan durham back in with two fouls to go with jogo goodwin hub and trey wurtz has entered the lineup to spell cormac ryan so mike bray finds himself doing some shuffling with fouls and now the injury to ryan much like jim laranegas been dealing with all year not quite as much but that was a pretty good analogy yep keep keep your eye on two in the white for notre dame trey wurtz is a proven outside shooter notre dame has to play with more of an urgency on the defensive end yeah theyre hot right now theyve won five of their last seven theyre trying to make a run here to knock on the door for an ncaa tournament and they havent come up with urgency defensively by anthony walker is good nice move by the sophomore from baltimore hes a much improved player for jim laranega more finesse than physical but has skill inside joe has one bounce away durham made the save to hub heres works missing from the perimeter trey now three of his last 12 from the floor and walker back to work for his second field goal two trips to baskets paul and theyre getting them easy points in the paint for miami right now were just just dominating this game heres the feed jogo got it to durham took the extra dribble and will draw the miami foul and that will get us to a timeout keynes have been on a bit of a run here six nothing run over the last 94 seconds to build hes got to feel pretty good as him his teams hit seven of the last eight shots from the floor and has a fivepoint lead here paul well jim laranega has built winning programs bowling green george mason and miami obviously george mason has that final four run but this year i think hes done a great coaching job and people will probably hit me on twitter and say what do you mean hes done a great coaching job there seven and 11 and three and ten in the acc and youre saying hes done a great coaching job yes hes lost a bunch of starters before the season hes lost players during the season one of his top freshmen left the program and he still managed to keep this team competitive in winning two free throws for juwan durham trims it to a threepoint miami lead Music kanes got dane gack on the floor along with uh anthony walker elijah olaney you see isaiah wong with the ball foul line heres walkers already got two field goals make it three what a nice boost hes been off miamis bench here in the last couple of minutes oh hes long and athletic they put him in the middle of the zone jim larinega now is experienced at playing against zone hes seen that most of this season they rotate mcgusty wong and walker in the middle of the acc logo paid off three ball from the perimeter for dane goodwin 39 3point shooter with his 28 triple of the year and the irish two within two dane goodwin may have to have an extra special game if cormac ryan doesnt come back elijah laney fighting for a second chance in a bucket yeah good point paul i think the threepoint thing takes a hit words and goodwin may have to make up some ground there inside durham hard to the basket hell draw the foul either walker or gak matt potter from underneath will tag dane gack itll be his second the 22 year old red shirt junior born in egypt moved to australia hands miami their second foul dont forget weve got a special womens basketball matinee for you coming up at noon eastern on acc network and the espn app katie myers miami team who lost today at florida state will be in atlanta to see nell fortner at georgia tech high noon basketball on acc network and always on the espn app wow look at this paul he went out in pain and he comes back got it taped up little ice sometimes they just retape it a little bit tighter and they realize that its not a severe injury of course and hes a tough young man i mean mike gray told us hes all business hes feisty hes competitive thats the way he was in high school miami has 12 of their 23 points in the paint against the zone thats not a good sign for notre dame walker the miss works the rebound heres hub bounce pass turo went for the righthand hammer and it got blocked by brooks Applause brooks is just a physical wall inside for miami and that time durham blocked the first one then the second one and ted valentine i think is spotted a foul if this is on jajuan durham its his third Music its on nate leschewski itll be his third oh wow yeah they got wishevsky on brook Music and thats one where le chesky just has to stand straight up not even challenge the shot in any way off the ground hes saying to himself i went straight up but you know any any movement at all in one direction or another youre giving the referee an opportunity to make the call i dont say give the two points but let the two points go and keep yourself in the game yeah instead he has to come out you get a look at notre dame really playing with four guards and juwan durham miamis built a fivepoint advantage here and mcgustys three and durhams save and then bounced it off of brooks it will go to the irish and that last possession notre dame went to mantoman so mike brady sensing that his team needs a little shot of aggressiveness and paul you mentioned this they dont commit many turnovers they dont commit many fouls and already the irish have committed five team fouls notre dame notre dame is a team that doesnt beat themselves and mike bray doesnt have you know many rules Applause dont turn it over and dont skip class thats what he told me and when it comes to the offensive identity yeah theyre all about the offense theyre about taking care of the ball shooting threes dont turn it over and dont commit foolish fouls they just need a an influx of defense they need to get their defensive intensity ratcheted up if theyre serious about the second half of the acc they have the offensive capability to beat anyone in the conference hub misses the three its a fivepoint miami league to your point the only two turnovers in the ball game belong to the irish i mean they dropped 85 on ohio state you think theyre going to win that game they gave up 90 beverly knee baseline brooks and durham cleans it up that was pretty wide open so is this ryan had it rattle out on him well its catching shoot in this first half for the most part isnt it it is and you see miami they get the defensive board theyre going to walk it up theyre going to run their offense theyll play against his own defense theyll try to get some easy ones but they dont want this tempo to be up in the 80s ahead for ryan under eight to go in the first half miami has built a fivepoint advantage here goodwin trying to lock in on that and does that was from mountain goshen six for goodwin yeah his dad damon goodwin was a great player at the university of dayton played for the legend don donohue great freethrow shooter outstanding threepoint shooter now the head coach of capital ball bounces around and brooks the great save and heres wong trying to take advantage of it walker the rebound from behind durham blocked by goodwin it will stay with the keynes but we get a timeout well good one is powered by uhaul your move made easier Music twopoint lead from miami seven minutes and change to go in the first half fisting with jim laranega palm weve talked about the trying circumstances miamis played with this year heres his ideal lineup and hes got no games with that obviously with sam wardenberg missing the whole year and he only had likes for a couple games and chris and street closed after being able to practice a little bit this week that lineup was picked preseason number five in the acc and you can see why jim laranega said the team that weve recruited the last two years we have not seen that group that unit on the court together at the same time and theres a certain point in time when it gets disheartening but the positivity that hes coached with and keeping his team together has has just been amazing ball got batted away on the miss by walker and here is jojo running the floor and draws the foul at the rim i think that will be on walker as well itll be his first so joe go to the line where he is perfect on the ear ive probably done damage to that nope survive that acc softball makes its debut coming up this week thursday 11 am number 12 florida state and georgia tech they kind of got softball into some pods this year well have great coverage for you lonnie almeida and aileen morales hook up this week double header right here on acc network and then friday coverage starts at one as well also available on the espn app tied at 25 after the free throws of the senior from ontario canada nikola jojo notre dames sitting down in their stance a lot better right now sliding their feet block reiki yep mike bray must have lit into them at that time out he says if we can sit and slide and stay in front we can be a really good team goodwin backing in on wong fall away tapped out ryan with a fresh shot clock wurtz attacks floater falls in for trey works trey wurtz is a proven outside shooter he gives the irish another offensive weapon and we get a time out nothing run miamis missed their last 11 shots on the floor paul remember earlier they had uh hit eight of 10 in this contest and now a little bit of a drought for jim larry and his team and notre dames regained the lead well miami has had a lot of experience in scoring droughts this season they dont shoot it well behind the arc they struggle at times to attack the zone early in the season much better now in february but they can get cold as a unit walker on a kick out with eight to shoot heres beverly trying to find something hell settle for a three walker the rebound and missed on the stick back and goodwin in walker battle for it walker tried to make the save but did so to joe gum that was great effort by anthony walker bounce pass in traffic layup joe go no good he got the rebound hey notre dame will reset with 505 to go and jogo really runs well rim to rim hes gotten a few layups just by running the court turned over by hub heres beverly right to the rim and it got knocked out last touched i believe by prentiss huh harlem beverly from detroit apprentice hub from upper marlborough maryland weve got a lot of bwi guys on the floor tonight a lot of mike bray i95 on the floor even some i95 for jim lara naked too that i95 goes all the way down from the dmv to miami theres mcgusty left it on the front rim and recovered by the irish who lead by two interesting half notre dame started sluggish heres ryan to catch and shoot three that misses notre dame was really sluggish against duke the other night they had a great second half Applause walker with a spin draws the foul Music trey words is first the sixth on notre dame i believe and a couple of free throws coming here for the canes to try and tie it coach bray always fun to talk to we covered a lot of ground in our visit earlier today free throw by walker no good he talked about they had to kind of prepare two scouting reports paul because they had heard that jim laranega had talked about chris likes practicing this week and so when you factor likes in that lineup no matter where he is you know hes a playmaker i think every coach yeah every coach that plays miami is holding their breath saying i hope its not going to be me that likes comes back against that is a dynamic young man playmaker shot maker and when he gets back on the court for the hurricanes hes going to give them a shot of confidence and points has not played since december the 4th when he sprained his ankle against the hatters of stetson and theres a travel by wurtz trying to beat beverly off the bounce and heres the note for you paul four turnovers for notre dame none for miami in this first frame and notre dame one of the best in the country in the low turnover game so theyre great in low turnovers one of the best and fewest fouls they have six fouls they have four turnovers not a typical notre dame first half yeah they had 16 though in the first meeting against miami lost the turnover margin by six and yet won the game partially because of their threepoint proficiency theres the drive and bucket for wong his first twopoint goal and miamis first twopoint goal in a long time notre dame thought that ball was in those 16 turnovers a lot of those turnovers nice shot by wong those turnovers west came late for notre dame because miami had a press to get back into the game notre dame looked shaky down the stretch but they closed wong hits a three hes now got 11 in this first half and we get a timeout miami now who went over five minutes without a made field goal has gotten five in a row by isaiah wong and the irish trail by four at home when we continue fourpoint lead from miami 3127 get ready for a full wednesday of acc basketball here on the network well start at noon boston college and georgia tech presented by geico then nc state in pittsburgh at 4 30 but wait being cardi thats not all because theyre two more that night 6 30 syracuse louisville 830 duke and wake forest right here on acc network and streaming live on the espn app and weve put isaiah long out there because youll get a chance to see some of the other most improved players in the acc were getting a look at the best scoring improvement from one year to the next year tonight isaiah wong has had 15 points 13 times this year he only did it six times last year 10 points a game different from last year hes been sensational hes my vote right now for the most improved player nate nashewski as well i mean hes rebounding better scoring better and hes shooting the ball behind the threepoint line from the field gold at a high high clip david johnson hes had a lot of doubledouble games this year and justin champagne i know he could be on this list or he could be on the mvp list as well for the big east im sorry the acc pit was in the big east at one time yep but uh youre right about championing panthers lost a tough one in atlanta by six moses right he might be on that list too he had 24 points tonight for josh pastners team who picked up the victory their 10th on the year and theyre level in the acc dallin and luke hancock more on that coming up at the half georgia tech i mean josh pastor must be taking heart medicine twopoint win against notre dame loses at the buzzer against clemson and now today in a close game against pitt hes too young for heart trouble iris got a hand in the pass lane trey woods will check in and cormac ryan goes out for the irish Music wes you look at that ball game paul weve had eight lead changes nobodys left by more than five here seems like each teams giving giving it back to each other you know theyre letting each other score theyre letting each other shoot and notre dame probably a little timid right now because they have six fouls and theyre a low foul team they only average 11 fouls per game miamis had a couple of scoring droughts in this game hub misses a wide open three for the lead goodwin runs it down in the deep corner it doesnt seem like either team wants to take it right now notre dame has been great in the second half this year wurtz misses the three jogo gives the irish a third chance and if youre miami you you got a chance to to win another acc game and and build some momentum and confidence jogo nice pass durham short jumper rolls in so the third time the charm juwan durhams got seven nice feed from jogo were tied at 31 jogos giving notre dame some nice minutes nine points two assists tend to shoot on the drive mcgusty kicks back walker three and joe go the rebound notre dame want to turn the tempo up or hole for the last one you got to hold that for the last one you go in tied or you go up you dont let miami touch the ball Music heres hub with six seconds good one step in two at the horn and we will go to the locker rooms tied at 31 biggest lead for either side was five and eight lead changes paul in the opening 20 minutes hopefully the second half will have a little more defensive intensity but offensively both teams played very well stay tuned dallin come luke hancock coming up halftime at south bend tied at 31 they only had one turnover which was a really bright spot they had 10 offensive rebounds 14 point paints they just couldnt shoot the ball from the outside but notre dame was no better i think i think each coach is probably happy right now to be tied in this game theres durham got pushed away from the basket by brooks and thats what ted valentine whistles the foul on the senior from philadelphia his first first of the half of miami by the way nate liszeski kind of handcuffed in the uh first half with foul trouble remember he picked up that third with 909 to go so hes back on the floor for the first time since then as juwan durham goes to the line if youre mike brain you see youre shooting percentages you see one of your stars mashevsky only with three points you probably feel pretty good about your team at halftime theres a lot of things he had to clean up just like miami but notre dames been great in the second half this year especially in the last two games they shot 65 against miami the last time these two teams played thats how they pulled away and against duke they put up 48 points in the second half so lets see ninth lead change of the ball game on the free throw by durham and now le chesky the block of the drive and here comes cormac ryan on the hustle for the irish see ola knee dig in on leski durham a long two for juwan durham third field goal 10 points now five straight double figure games for the 611 durham well hes been giving it to the irish on both ends of the floor blocking shots low post game and a short little face up that was beautiful the long three on the front rim and i like the way notre dame goes to durham beginning of games beginning of the half they play off of him through touches or he can score oneonone skip across for hub and a quick check on le chesky at the post here foul line now they go high low and lazzeski had it stripped tried to make the save did six to shoot hub tried to bounce it to durham back for prentiss off a deflection who missed the three looking goodwin fight through irish are going to get another chance here paul fire away if durham threw that ball a little bit higher to leshesky that would have been a dunk he had position on the small defender two minutes in change gone in the second half and mcgusty draws the foul on the driver and the foul on cormac ryan first of the half on the irish couple of free throws coming for the oklahoma transfer cam magusti who a year ago against the acc averaged 11 points and finished strong he was double figures in six of the last eight in conference play dont forget weve got womens basketball matinee for you at noon eastern on tuesday right here on acc network and the espn app miami and georgia tech from mccamus pavilion in atlanta georgia tech third right now behind louisville and nc state in the standings on the womens basketball side youre talking about camp augustine free throw yeah hes the guy who has to score in double figures for miami you know what youre going to get from wong hes been giving you 17 points a game brooks not a really a big scorer mcgusty is a guy a proven scorer hes getting 12 a game he came from oklahoma he played with trey young so he learned how to score the ball at least he learned how to shoot it a knee uncontested drive to the rack hes got six tied at 34 feeds durham for the dunk notre dame reads each other so well offensively not a lot of set plays great spacing they know how to read the defender cut to the basket move without the ball and they really do a good job of catching and seeing making the pass that time the drive got denied heres the irish on the run ryan a three from the corner of the rebound boy how many second chance opportunities has notre dame got tonight in the second half theyve gotten a few you can feel the explosion coming right now from notre dame offensively hub missed the three and it hit the line last touch by miami it will stay with the irish with the new 20 Music beautiful cut by lazewski just such a quick give up its an excellent passing team that time defensively there was a a gap that you and i could have drove down and thats where you scratch your head a little bit youre in the middle of the acc standings youre trying to get a strong second half finish this season you cant have those kind of breakdowns yeah see some changes for the irish nicola jojo has come back to the floor paul talked about what a strong first half he offered now you see nasir brooks checkout for miami along the way that means anthony walker has come back on the floor for coach larinega that ball got knocked away mcgusty challenging the inbounds pass to dane goodwin keynes had won just once on the road in the league this year that was the fivepoint victory in raleigh against nc state high drops in second field goal for prentice hub not many playing better the last five or seven games than prentice hub Music its averaged 15 points and eight assists in his last five games think about the guards in this league carlee jones jose alvarado hub playing as well as them what a little flip by joko hes in double figures now paul with 11 he has been a great spot off the bench for notre dame just energy points and production sixpoint lead largest for either school early second half action at south bend continues its a big piece of the irish success tonight paul yeah lets give this young man a little bit of love on valentines he deserves it hes scoring hes rebounding yeah scoring rebounding assist his productivity level hes fit right in with the other guys at notre dame he knows hes not the primary option but he scores with opportunity and defends wong here off the timeout biggest lead of the night for either school and a half dozen weve had about nine lead changes as well heres walker a three and knocks it down seventh pointer of the year for baltimores anthony walker jim laranega says he shoots the ball so well in practice and sometimes in the game the percentages theyre not the same hes trying to get walker to shoot more inside the arc stand still threes hes pretty good but hes trying to get walker to go from threepoint shots to twopoint shots oh and jogo throws in another triple to give him a season high hes got 14 now and he has sparked notre dame he heard his name coming out of the break walker on the drive again Applause good one jogo is he feeling it good one of three bounds away notre dame has not played great in this game at all and theyre up six you feel like theyre just going to have an explosion offensively but their defense keeps letting them down olenne picks up his fourth field goal hes got eight we talked about this at the open west miami is a resilient group they dont go away in games they grind you out methodically and the drive from beverly and we get a whistle and a foul and a timeout foul on ola knee will send us to the benches 4339 notre dame by four when we continue from south bend well championship week starts march the third paul can you believe that a month from today is selection sunday its exciting to see the finish line isnt it oh you know january it might be a little bumpy and a little curvy but were going to get there i think its a little turbulence as we land but january was a grind for everybody and february is really separation time it starts to get exciting because you can see the standings start to take shape trey wurtz with a nice finish when notre dame continues to add to it its a six point advantage heres mcgusty a catch and shoot and durham had a shot at it to hit the inline out of bounds and it will stay with miami durhams got two hands on that ball hes got inside position you got to squeeze that ball with your hands pivot throw the outlet and lets go look at mcgusty weaving in kick out and the three from walker off line theres what blair negas talking about right paul exactly and that was a great contest by wurtz now notre dame right into their flow except for an unforced air apprentice hub trying to get it to trey works threw it behind him iris turn it over seven in the ball game now for notre dame analyst jinx right there praising a team and then they make a mistake but you see mike bray you see mike gray showing his hands its okay relax calm down you know he doesnt show his frustration and i think that the kids really respond to that well he knows how to turn the page quickly after a bad play or a bad game not a lot of coaches can do that good point notre dame doesnt turn over much and then miami who only committed one turnover in the first half their lowest turnover total since about a year ago against wake forest now gives it away a second time you know the pace of this game keeps changing one minute its notre dame scoring in flow making some stops next thing you know they turn it over miami has to push they get right back in it weve had three turnovers in a row two by the irish one by the keynes miami misses the layup there but second chance opportunity coming yeah its been a sloppy game yes it is and its been a poor game i think defensively backdoor live now thats a big time play when youre on the road sometimes you need momentum changing plays to get your team a little bit more excited get a little juice going up quickly to jogo whos working on a season high tonight from a scoring perspective but hes done a lot for mike brays team including a crossover and layup at the iron 16 for jogo its been notre dames best player back to a six point irish lead yep they sure are wong in the miss of the three both teams under 40 tonight from the floor heres wurtz again off the bounce skip for goodwins three so wes you have two teams that are not shooting the ball well so whats going to win the game your defense and there is wong fouled on the drive well nikola jogo having a ball game hes got 16 points and six rebounds in 18 minutes of play well you got nate liszeski and prentice hub averaging almost 30 a game tonight theyve combined for six so somebodys gotta pick up the slack coach b and cardi jogo is picking it up and putting it down what a great example of coming off the bench and being ready to play a lot of guys come off the bench and they have to get ready and jogo just dived right into the action made threes made his free throws rebounding at a high clip and hes made this notre dame offense productive in this game because they are not shooting the ball well at all from the field or from the threepoint line right now yeah 38 bangs home a couple of free throws his first trip there tonight hes got 15 he and anthony walker the only double figure scorers tonight for jim laranega fourpoint game leshesky its been a quiet night and one coming on the brooks foul second field goal for nate leschewski nasir brooks commits his second third on miami well mike brave made a little isolation play out of the timeout put meschewski at the wing and let him operate this guy has improved by leaps and bounds from last season hes gotten stronger so you see it on that possession the ability to finish in traffic over bigger defenders his jump shot is just pure from the outside highly skilled at 6 10 reminds me of a former notre dame great nba player pat garrity oh yeah garrity scored a ton of points at notre dame seven point lead mcgusty quick feed to walker tried to go back door and instead squeezes it up and in walker did a great job of catching it composing himself didnt rush didnt bring the ball down and just finished with his length hes almost doubled his scoring a year ago against the league by the way hes got to be youll be excited about where his future might be heres a notre dame turnover as we reach the midway point of the second half and works will slow down the mcgusty transition chance with a reach third on the irish second on charlottes trey works miami gets a lot of deflections you know they dont know if a play but they anticipate well and im telling you this guy can go for 20 in any acc game camera mcgusty its a couple of free throws here and dane goodwin and juwan durham going to return as Music miami doesnt beat you with the threepoint shot worse than the acc but they hang around in games they play good defense they get deflections they protect the rim well early in the season wes miami was scoring a lot in transition up to 17 18 points a game that slowed down as the acc season has went on but they get their fair share of points in the fast break and inside the arc goodwin misses on the curl from 18 heres wong a spot three ryan leshesky has no problem pulling the trigger we know that apprentice hub has been quiet in this game yes sir miami is long and athletic nasir brooks anthony walker 69 plus with great wingspan and they dont leave the paint and heres miami slowing it down again right paul they want to take as much time as they can off the clock if they cant score right away wong got it to go and thats why wes they want to reset their offense and they want to make sure wong touches it one thing about this miami team they have great role identity jim laranega has put their has put his guys in position to be scorers screeners or distributors and they know long as the goto guy to the slashing durham who gets fouled brent hampton calls the foul on wong itll be his first well miami wakes they get along the basketball he has the uncanny ability to split two defenders great body control when he gets into the paint hes 65 hes got great bounce and he is playing with a high level of confidence skips for ryan and the irish tried to keep it alive could not miami can take the lead with a basket here inside of eight and a half and they will run set play action notre dame changing back and forth between man and zone that ball got turned over here is goodwin with pauline to beat and he will lay it in notre dame eight for dane goodwin tonight paul yeah hes been quiet but he gets his points and he gets his rebounds notre dame seems like when they play me on a man theyre a little more aggressive now that works to miamis favor though because they are really best with their drive game they love to drive first and shoot second walker and off the miss somehow ends out in the mid court here where ryan gathers it and then turns it over on an unforced air and mcgusty is fouled by ryan thatll get us to a timeout cam mcgustys going to shoot free throws on the fourth notre dame foul 7 24 to go and its still relatively close in south bend with paul b and carty west durham uh jared coleman our producer tonight cormac ryan ticketing for flagrant one here paul uh during the timeout yeah he went right to the intentional foul i mean he didnt make a play on the ball at all until the end but as soon as you reach and grab they put that offensive player in a compromising situation thats not a legitimate play on the ball at all easy call excessive and or unnecessary not a legitimate play on the ball so a couple of free throws here from augustine and a real opportunity to get miami back to a chance to take the lead again and the bounce around magustis now hit five in a row after missing his first two tonight and miami gets the ball here time these two teams played i know notre dame won by double digits but it it just wasnt that easy they had to pull away in the second half and in this game they theyve never never pulled away they havent gotten a lead bigger than a couple of points heres wall joe go the rebound spot up hub that was partially blocked and last touched by the irish and thats what notre dame has done all night really bad decisions they throw the ball to the other team when you get your jump shot blocked that is a clear sign that you realize that you werent open and you still shot it anyway bad decision a lot of bad decisions tonight by notre dame and it could cost them this game miami in front Music first time the keynes had pushed to the front here in the second half the young man from stony brook gives the hurricane some energy and some scoring good one jogo having a big night nice pass leski scores jogos been the scoring forward hes been the point forward hes got on the glass and he did all this coming off the bench hes having a great game tied at 54 now Music heres beverly as we go inside of six minutes and an easy drive missed the layup that was point blank works the other way hubs been quiet nice dump for leski the catch and score and the foul on wall great pass by hub and he put it nice and high little screen and roll action no weak side help they switched it wong had no shot a little energy a little emotion by the irish seven and a half nine in the ball game for lazzewski yeah they like to post him up a lot in a highlow situation hes got great hands strong hands to catch it and soft hands to score it anytime theres a switch mike bray likes to post him up so the irish back to a threepoint advantage heres beverly tend to shoot mcgusty working with it step back and rebounded by goodwin notre dame needs to make miami miss miamis missed a few on their own but the irish really has to get into miami and make them miss down the stretch fairball to three and mccains trying to create an advantage in transition had nothing notre dame good job getting back but will they get into miami in the half court if not miami is going to drive the ball and get to the freethrow line wong fights through and now works with the rebound and a reach will be called on harlan beverly and thatll be the 16 foul first on the sophomore from detroit and the irish are going to use the timeout here with 4 33 to play a quick reminder to you following our coverage tonight youll go to our acc network studios for another edition of nothing but net dallin cup luke hancock muffet mcgraw will be there all to recap the day in the acc kelsey riggs as well weve had plenty of action on both the womens and the mens side theyll theyll cover all that for you and uh its a local call for coach mcgraw of course in a smith memorial hall of famer in 2017 the womens basketball hall of fame in 2011 and its been a real pleasure to have muffin mcgraw on our acc network crew this year what an awesome addition to nothing but net huh oh yeah is she looking were in this game as a defensive coach or an offensive coach well i want to get her a take after this game and luke hancock too i dont think hancock likes this game not enough good threepoint shooting not enough good threepoint shooting im gonna im gonna wonder if muffin wants to get the telestrator out to draw up some defensive plans right heres leski oh nice Music you see notre dame going to leszewski a little bit more here in the last six or eight minutes and hes delivered fivepoint lead for the irish who get clemson in this building on wednesday night and theres an offensive foul on anthony walker for the drive sophomore second that is seven on miami now with 406 to play in the game coach great job by the 610 junior to sit down slide his feet hold his spot take the hit thats the defense mike bray wants to see he said if we can get defensive intensity and defensive efficiency we can be hard to beat leskian air ball goodwin went over the back trying for the rebound thatll get us to a timeout under four to go at south bend irish in five or less are overtime this year in conference play miamis playing their 14th league game tonight paul they played six games five or lesser overtime in acc play including the heartbreaker eight days ago against virginia tech thats hunter coutures three to send it to overtime nahima lean a runner hokies win a tight fit 8076 the board for jim larrinega same song different verse right it is but they dont go away in games they can get down in games but they continue to fight back you look at those three acc losses virginia tech clemson and north carolina all one possession games this team has a big heart jim larinagar and his staff have done a great job of keeping the fight with the hurricanes a dozen from augusta as he backs down for the bucket there to cut it to three that stopped the miami drought by the way of about two and a half minutes you know miamis been crushed with injuries all season long but the guys who are playing know theyre going to play and they know theyre going to play a lot of minutes theres a great chemistry with this miami team just not a lot of depth and not a lot of shooting good hard drive to the basket for charlottes trey works Music works known as a shooter that time an aggressive drive to the basket young man played as high school basketball and providence day right charlotte you got to respect the three he got nice and low on the drive clean finish well when you play providence state you play typically thats a pretty good program now in the state of north carolina right theres a state championship right there 2016 trey wurtz devon dodson were sophomores grant williams in the back was a senior for brian field how about having those three guys on your team you better win a state title and the thing about those guys wes not only are they talented basketball players but high character kids great students highly competitive those are the type of guys that go on to be very successful in college and in life yeah well brians done a great job with the with the chargers for sure at providence day dont forget more college basketball coming your way a full wednesday and i mean full how about high noon in atlanta presented by geico boston college georgia tech then off to the peterson events center nc state pittsburgh will both be scrappys in a 4 30 start there and then at night we send you to the yum center louisville back on the floor to host syracuse who just beat boston college yesterday and then the nightcap is duke and wake for round two at the joel in winstonsalem all right here on acc network streaming live on the espn app it looks like a preview to the acc tournament right you tip at noon and you play for about 10 oclock at night its great to see louisville back its been about three weeks four weeks for the cardinals feels like it and virginia tech announcing uh yesterday paul theyre gonna miss they they now have a positive so the postponement yesterday in blacksburg was because of the cards and their return now virginia techs announced theyre on pause for a positive on the drive mcgusty cant finish and brent hampton nice piece of officiating here notre dame got it but i think wurtz was on the in line coaches have to not only manage their team and their injuries but now looking for 25 negative tests every day and fivepoint lead here and brent hampton made the call now well see if uh i think matt potter is going to go toward the monitor and have a look you get a look here first though at home works looks out of bounds and comes back in to make the play he does on that angle he does yep now theres two pieces to this equation not only the possession confirming what the call on the floor was the second part is do they need to do anything with the shot clock with the clock or anything like that correct so 13 to shoot 250 to play in a fivepoint game yeah they didnt move the clock on the shot clock made the right call possession for miami almost into a double team seven to shoot against jogo boy good heart will you get into the irish yeah they converge on wrong in the paint Music i think one gets that deep and all that defensive coverage its time to kick it out feels like a big possession of the game here paul does notre dame hasnt been in a very good offensive rhythm Music tell you what he just he can really knock it down from the catch spot transfer from santa clara hes got nine in the ball game seven in the second half but what i love about trey wurtz is that when he catches it he knows hes open hes quick to fire it and leski blocks it out of bounds with under two to play and 11 to shoot from miami you know west theres a lot of guys that are shooters trey wurtz is a shot maker Music nice block by the chefski the great shot blockers they jump second they wait on it and that ball got lost in the dribble by walker now last time these two teams met miami put on some pressure down the stretch and they turned over notre dame thats why the irish had 16 turnovers fifth turnover from miami heres goodwin theres leski whos had a really big last eight and a half minutes yeah im not trying to be funny but that was one of the best offensive possessions for the irish tonight the ball moved up the floor they got a layup walker the dunk and a hurricane time out here 14 for the sophomore seven in the second half and jim laranega is going to huddle his group but weve got our zaxbys player of the game paul and this ones easy tonight isnt it mr jogo started it from the outside knocking down some triples beautiful runs to the basket that was his lu play hes got that euro step yep got a nice clean outside shot but i love the way he contributed not only scoring but rebounding and assistwise made his free throws productive efficient and he was ready to play when his number was called boy wasnt he tremendous effort tonight by nicola jogo the senior from ontario who picks up a double figure game tonight for just the fifth time in his career in his 95th career game by the way an example high 21 he had on d in february of 2019 paul was on groundhog day so groundhog day and valentines day jogos your guy he loves the month of february doesnt he but hes a great example of being ready to play so if you notre dame you better be ready with your press offense youll see the drive here and the miss clock reset to 30 before the dunk the question here is the timeout punched by jim laranega is the game clock not as much the shot clock after the walker finish so ted valentine talking to jim laranega so a couple of segments a couple of seconds will be tagged back on here but but its an eight point game nothing so now nothing oh now we got 12 minutes to go i got to get it reset obviously well they do put 21 on okay so here we go good one on the inbounds oh nice play knocked away by wong magusti foul now youre coming back to the basketball but you have to cut to the ball you cant cut to the deep corner in fact thats the worst place to catch the basketball to notre dame the deep corner you got the baseline the sideline as defenders bad pass bad cut miami with a chance for two yep and six in a row from mcgusty at the line when you feel heat and youre trying to get open as an offensive player you have to make a second and sometimes a third cut its not about your speed you have to change your speed missed the free throw so it stays at three possession games oh if youre jim larry youre gonna look at the free throw column and be disappointed under 60 percent heres words for goodwin tend to shoot play it out here yeah dont fall now good one a shot fake step back three bottom how about dane goodwin three big threes tonight he has an unbelievable shot fake game start right there on display recognize the closeout put the defender out of the way and put the nail in the coffin harlem beverlys first points of the game and now an outlet and heres jojo driving to the basket i thought miami was going to follow that possession not trapped well ten point game notre dame is going to win for the fourth time in the last five and for the sixth time in the last eight coach very impressive victory for mike brays team but they had to fight for this tonight it was not pretty and it wasnt easy at times no but february is separation time in college basketball mike bray will take that win notre dame playing with a high level of confidence even though they didnt play well theyre gonna feel good after this game six and seven now in conference play nine and ten overall with clemson visiting on wednesday jim laranegas team loses for the sixth time in the last seven games and theyre off till next saturday with georgia tech
