at the Ville well hes taking on a very good Clemson team that returns a couple of significant players from the elite eight run a year ago including Ian shefflin as Louisville wins the tip in the home whites and Clemson in the road purple Ian sheflin number four in purple one of two guys in the league that averages a double double we have one of the best guard matchups in the league with Chucky heern and Chase Hunter for Clemson five to shoot for the cards got to go James Scott to Edwards and the floer goes I think theres a couple of important things for both teams here today Matt they both have to be on the glass and get extra possessions thats going to be one thing the second is great D without fouling you cant put the other team in the bonus early and then you have to defend the threepoint line if youre Clemson there is Ian sheflin on the roll to the bucket Im pointing at Brad Brownell right now that is exactly the way he designed it up at shoter around this morning for his team on the first possession scripted perfectly by his Club well this starting five for Louisville six and0 this season including winners of the last four as Hadley gets to the cup Terrence Edwards has been that additional piece rain Smith now coming off the bench Edwards in the starting five its been his defense that has kept him in the starting five Music kick to the corner Wiggins Off the Mark for three youll watch Louisville not make the outlet theyll get into their transition game quickly try to get matchups like this nice leave at the front of the rim and thats what James Scott does hes a dunking machine for Louisville theres Chase Hunter and the leading score for Clemson is on the board hes had a career year to this point 95 wins in his six years at Clemson more than anyone in the history of their program hes been a winner for Brad Brownell and a big part of the culture shift here at Clemson in his sixth year under Brad Brownell sort of a rarity in todays college sports landscape under 10 to shoot Edwards a step back Waterman the tap out and Victor lockin with a rebound playing a bit healthier today than he did all of last week dealing with flu and coldlike symptoms when Louisville pushes they get immediate mismatch heres James Scott with a nice naked side transition quick hitter which is a lob at The Rim beautifully executed both teams on their first possession Applause Chucky heurn running the point for Louisville his coach Pat Kelce regularly calling him a top five guard in the country and hes played like it to this point I think were seeing two of the better guards here tonight in Chase Hunter and Chucky heern and then Pits got a couple of really good guards as well sheflin and Waterman the rebound after excellent defense on Victor Applause lockin Edwards doubled and Trav our officiating crew tonight Doug Surman Tim clery Brooks Wells and Brad Brownell told us listen weve won all four of our games in the ACC by the way all four wins by double digits theyve done it in different ways though Debbie last two games it was the defense against Stanford against Cal it was the offense tonight you feel like theyre going to need both I think they need both but no question about it in front of this tough crowd here this is a quad one opportunity for Clemson on the road this is a quad 2 opportunity for Louisville at home Applause right now Joe lardy has both these teams seated in the NCAA tournament theres Hunter with six Zachary Zachary not a great threepoint shooter better off the bounce but he does lead the team in assists and Steals and hes got the matchup on Chucky heer and he gets a nice deflection right there Applause early lead for Louisville neither team shooting it particularly well from Applause downtown andar IND 2 Applause years thats right 111 for our V lucky all SE one row in section 111 for our is going to go home with the luy prize tonight is theal Music and see what the lucky road is our lucky Road villain R going home with the CH each and every one of you great job get up the villains lucky Ro Music he 2 Music welcome back to the Yum Center an early 64 lead for the Louisville cards Matt Schumacher Debbie Antonelli with you and as Debbie mentioned before he went to the last break quad one opportunity for Clemson at the moment a Q2 opportunity for Louisville though it could end up being q1 for both by the end of the year massive early January game for both programs well the quads are important its a measuring tool that the NCAA uses as a part of the net and they also have um wins against the bubble which is a new piece of criteria where you take a look at teams that are in the net 1 through 45 that are on the bubble and so if you can get wins against the bubble thats another small piece of criteria theyll be using but they added that this year well the interesting thing is about a week ago Louisville was on the bubble and then two wins one against UNC and then on the road against Virginia in the last week theyve moved squarely into the conversation as trior wins it back to the cars to finish that point they jumped 21 spots since the North Carolina win at home and the Virginia went on the road first time since 1990 the cars winning in Applause Charlottesville five to shoot for heper into trior thats rejected by lock but theyre going to count it and say that he interfered with the basketball in his fourth game since his broken left arm Kadir trayor gets the steel on one end and a great post up in the late clock at the front of the rim on the offensive end you mentioned Terren Edward Jr his defense hes had to guard some really tough people in this league hes got the chase Hunter assignment early I think Chase Hunter is playing like an all ACC first team guard for Brad Brownell well it was interesting because you asked Pat Kelce you know how do you get Terence Edwards going offensively just four for his last 21 and Pat said you know we havent even thought about it because hes been that good defensively as Louisville wins it back on the offensive foul by Clemson I think there are situations in the game where Pat Kelsey would consider putting Terrence Edward in certain situations to try to get him an easy look but teren Edwards Jr doesnt need to half plays run for him he is good on the glass he gets some Steals on his defensive side and he and he you know he drives the ball to the basket so he can put some fouls on the defense actually his four years at JMU he made more free throws than threes in his career there at JMU this year hes made more hes taken more threes than free throws its the opposite its going to be a foul on Victor lockin no check that its going to go against Dylan Hunter and send heer into the line Applause Applause rare Miss from heern there tomorrow night over on ESPN 2 weve got a really good mens basketball double header starts at seven number 23 Old Miss in fville square and off against Arkansas and then Hunter Dickinson and number 11 Kansas host Bobby Hurley in Arizona State in Lawrence Allen field house a tough environment Bill self put Shaquille Moore in the starting lineup in the last game game theyre playing small put AJ store on the bench and AJ store responded by 15 points Off the Bench so they might have figured something out there t to shoot for Clemson Dylan Hunter tough Fade Away over the top of Edwards great shot by the brother of Chase Hunter theres bra Smith shooting 45 from downtown over the last two games Edwards a three great screen on the Baseline by trior he had made a three in the last two games thats a big bucket for Edwards and theyre going to count the bucket flipped up and in by Jaden Zachary as we get another look at this three by Edwards watch this great screen on the Baseline its that one dribble to the midline that helped set up the space for Terrence Edwards Jr to get into the rhythm of his shot and a great screen on the Baseline to take help away former Sun Belt Player of the Year at JMU you reference that he played four years for the Dukes helped them to the NCAA tournament a lot of NCAA tournament experience on this Louisville roster just hasnt happened here Pat Kelce put together winner out of the portal guys that have played in the tournament that have played in big games how about another one from Edwards close he got a lot of extra shots up today before the game he was the first guy out Applause here 7 Minutes gone fourpoint lead for Louisville heres Wiggins lot of cut contact no call five to shoot for Dylan Hunter and Louisville still scoreless from Beyond The Arc over for four check that Applause Clemson good F behind the penetration Wiggins count it in the foul he has played tougher over the last week and a half after being challenged by his head coach Brad Brown L well the last two games chony Wiggins has averaged 16 points hes been assertive hes scored in the midrange against Cal in the last game hes got size length hes got versatility he can play the three four or the five if they need he keeps getting better his defense has gotten better he played in high school with Ian shefflin but you mentioned the defensive part one of his assignments in the Stanford game with Victor lockin dealing with flu like symptoms was Maxim Reno leading score and rebounder in the ACC he played very well in that game against Applause Stanford header deep three yes Applause H Hunter over the outstretched arm of Noah Waterman in the first three for the Tigers Smith Reese fighting for the rebound its a chump ball and the possession arrow points to Clemson its a onepoint Louisville lead behind the threepoint shooting Terren Edwards Jr from the deep Corner Chucky in a late clock Music theed by mhamed Ali interational

saying baset inter ball against Louisville at 1335 of the first half has been confirmed as well the gold 10 they called yeah Music Music Matt Schumacher Debbie Antonelli with you from the Yum Center where the cards have led a Revival this season no doubt about it its been coined as such by Pat Kelce and Debbie when you look at this teams resumee all five of their losses against quad 1 teams theyre undefeated past quad 1 2 3 and four two quad one wins no bad losses the West Virginia win keeps getting better with West Virginias upset in Allen Fieldhouse over Kansas they still have not played their best basketball in my estimation and theyre doing all of this without KAS PRI who at the time of his injury against Oklahoma in the battle for Atlantis was probably Pat Kels best player at that time you can make an argument Chucky is the best player play but at that time K PRI was leading the team in Applause scoring really impressive when you think about the storm that this Louisville team weathered playing really a rotation of seven men for a couple of weeks hiy breeder darting to the basket and lays it in 14 threes on the season that is his fifth two kyp know your personnel they close out hard on the threepoint line and he drives it gives Clemson its first lead Waterman quickly ends that with a drive to the cup ni really nice screen again by Hadley good flare screen and Noah Waterman makes a great choice on Applause that Victor lockin backing down the smaller Hadley and muscles it up to draw a foul its a great call Off the Bench off the timeout by both coaches to get the ball where they want it Victor lockin gets a clear out and just Barkleys Hadley to the Music block well loans a guy thats been battling illness did not even warm up with the team before the Stanford game they werent sure he was going to play until literally tip off wound up with 11 points seven boards five blocks and two assists did not start the cow game didnt even play the first half came in in the second half and was instrumental in that win but hes feeling much healthier and he changes this team de when hes playing well and its a great point that he played in the second half against Cal 14 minutes didnt score and changed the game they went up double digits at that time and they didnt really relinquish the lead Applause Clemson has won all four of its ACC contests by double digits coming into tonight he kick out Applause RS neither team with an offensive rebound to this point surprising to you well theyve been scoring so easily against the other we we expect two really good defensive teams but both these teams have a certain Cadence and Rhythm about the way they play offensively and it can change thats what makes him so good watch out see I dont like that shot at all and Terrence Edwards Jr hits one but thats hes better on a catch and shoot than he is trying to dribble to create space well Brad brownells team started 70 in ACC play a couple of years ago That season didnt quite end up the way they had hoped this year really picking up right where they left off last season of course they bring back chefin and Chase Hunter but three new faces in the starting lineup for Brad Brown L this season the winning his coach in Clemson basketball history deep three wagin puts it in from nearly the logo the top seven players for Brad Brownell have all made more than 10 threes this is an excellent threepoint shooting team second best by percentage in the league adley theres your offensive rebound got the switch little clear out for Chucky and Hadley pays it off draws enough help Hadley and Javon Hadley steps into one thats Chucky heer setting that up h Applause hper against Jones its sent Away by locking but a foul first and the Louisville point guard will be headed to the free throw line that when we return hot shooting to start for both teams Wiggins look at this from the logo got it and then the cards respond with a Javon Hadley three onepoint game in the Young Center Music radio 939 the th january9 Andel basketball radio january9 to roers join here in 105 conat areat Sal service is byov service joining our salute

ticket number since 2010 and lets hear it for US Army veteran Tod Applause with you put you on t well Clemson comes into this game having won three in a row after backto back overtime losses to Memphis and South Carolina and Debbie when you talk to Brad Brownell he feels like his teams getting better each week finding different ways to win oh I dont think theres any question uh if youve known anything about Brad Brownell and his culture around winning its defense first and then its Player Development second to me I mean the win against Kentucky is huge they dont have a bad loss right now Joe lardy and its never too early to talk Bracketology once we get to the New Year mhm has him seated as a nine right now be at the line shoot they got a few quad ones left on their schedule in the ACC thr they got Duke coming up theyll have they got to play pitn this is a big one here though for Clemson and for Louisville for both resumés and you got that sense with the attention to detail in both shoo rounds this morning no stone left unturned Zachary no third tap back no from lock him and finally scooped up by Hadley at bur thought about it good job by Zachary to get back in contest Chucky he burs ball fake he looked like he was ready to launch Chase hunter in the passing Lane and takes it to the cup Chase Hunter never changes his expression its all business bra Smith with a couple of Misses early he has not missed much over the last two games lets see if Clemson gets Ian sheflin going a little bit here they have not been able to get him going offensively yet Zachary hits a three nothing but the bottom of the cup shot that with a lot of confidence for a guy who hasnt shot the three well in conference play five early points for jayen Zachary Hadley misses out out on a threepoint play opportunity one of the things that chase Hunter is so good at is anticipating with great Instinct that lateral pass from one side of the floor to the other is a perfect time to jump the passing Lane and it results in an easy2 points for Chase Hunter battling a banged up Ankle wouldnt have known it by the way he jumped that pass hes averaging 20 points in the last five games hes been so consistent Brad Brownell knows exactly what hes going to get from Chase Hunter every Applause Music Applause day Javon Hadley to me was so impressive in the Virginia game Matt because when it became winning time is when he looked to assert himself insert himself offensively otherwise he does so many things well that impacts winning and it doesnt have to be scoring all the time loan on trior and he walks I mean loan has a huge Advantage Clemson goes to an ISO and does such a great job of feeding the post trior giving up quite a few inches in that matchup 61 against 65 heern saves it Hadley keeps it from going over the Timeline under 10 is Music shoot trior power dribble against shein and rejected good de by Ian sheflin inside lock in using the size that was pinned against the window by trior and thats why you run the floor hard in transition Shin makes the block keeps it in play locken runs right to the rim and gets a Applause mismatch no field goals for Louisville nearly the last 3 minutes theyve gotten to the line a couple of times what do you want to see from the cards here final six in the first half looking for them to get downhill and get to the free throw line Clemson has done an excellent job on rain Smith hide breeder on him right now chasing him around the floor Hadley a three got it stops the score of the stre Devon Hadley is having ay Music its whatever Louisville needs rebounding or defense tonight hes been able to score wagin Edwards at three and a foul on Kadir trior trying to get the offensive board against Applause shefflin thats number five on Music Applause Louisville as Noah Waterman checks back in for Terrence Edwards remember one of the things I talked about Matt was not putting either team in the bonus early right you knew this was going to be a possession for possession both teams are so talented and really good on the defensive end you cant give anything easy and you wont get anything easy tonight right there Tri proving that WIS it back for Louisville Louisvilles perimeter ball pressure all season has been outstanding they are there on the catch thats why trior is able to get that deflection fifth turnover for the Tigers they really push the quality of your catch out Hadley stolen away by Zachary he is a thief career steals leader pesky on the defensive side active career steals leader shein fighting in the paint with trior lots of physicality down there Zachary against heer musling it in hes just a tough competitor Zachary really good calls him a junkyard Music dog and itll be Louisville basketball when we return tightly contested physical game in the up Music Center than 50 from the floor right now and for Louis Javon Hadley who has not missed slot triples running ahead of the ball in transition off their defense late clock threes four for four couple of triples 11 first half points for Javon Music Hadley who had 11 points in the game against Virginia what a start and its now his fourth straight game in double figure scoring I know you said its not just the scoring that he brings but he has brought that during this Louisville cards four game win streak you mentioned winners for Pat Kelce 26 wins last year at Colorado lost in the sweet 16 to Marquette he played with two guys KJ Simpson and Cody Williams who are Pros now he wasnt the first or second option he was the third option last year and hes very good in his role here at Louisville see if rain Smith can get going thats knocked off of hi breeder and itll stay here with six on the to its really good D and very good scout Brad brownells staff knows Pat Kelsey trying to get a timeout right now knows how much coach Kels atos lead to rain Smith with a three well now you got another a chance we will see after this right back in Louisville Music back at the El Center where Clemson has made four of its last five shot attempt and theyve defended the ball really well forcing a timeout 6 seconds on the timer here for Louisville coming out of the atto we get to benefit a shoot around right in preparation yesterday I was at Louisvilles practice and in their film session its amazing how much data information analytics and then it comes down to Instinct from two really good teachers over there on the sideline lob to Waterman five to shoot three and shefflin cleans it off the glass Here Comes Hunter Zachary at three Wiggins right place right time with a put back five offensive rebounds for Applause Clemson oh yeah J Scott on the floater in the middle third of the floor Chucky hat burn throws the live as well as anyone James Scott is a lob catcher for the Cardinals ha bur WIS it back for the cards Here Comes Hadley counted in the Applause foulley if youre going to commit that foul you got to foul him hard this is a soft attempt by Wiggins and its an and one for Hadley whos had the hot hand in the first half for Louisville leads all scores for both teams with 13 and he continues to be perfect from the floor five for five in the first half for the Music Applause Edwards I like Edwards coming in the game right now for Pat Kelce for a defensive possession onepoint game 248 to go in the opening half Edwards on Chase Danel Hunter block him diving one in a Timeout and he got Applause it and Brad Brown now talking with Doug Surman maybe about some of the physicality we knew talk with both coaches today at shoot around Debbie they anticipated a highly physical game possession for possession its about your defensive habits short choppy steps High hands know your personnel so many things go into it and then you just got to be able to make plays and when youve got two teams that are as good defensively as these two you got to be able to break the play off at some time and be able to make plays both teams have enough shot makers off the bounce well tahina powpow and number two South Carolina highlight our next ESPN 2 featured womens college basketball match up they host Texas amm Thursday 5 Eastern from Columbia the Gamecock have won five straight and 12 of 13 against the agies send our best wishes out to Ashlin Watkins for da Staleys Club who suffered an ACL injury in their last game the one thing about South Carolina is theyve won the National Championship back to back and theyve got depth so while you dont like to see somebody get hurt and lose someone they have others and they can play a variety of ways to Music win Zachary under 10 on the timer hi breeder on the boun sent Away by Scott Hadley fouled by jayen Zachary look at this block from James Scott I love a shot blocker into their transition game look how quickly Louisville can convert from D to O when you have a shot blocker like James Scott that keeps it in play gives you numbers going the other way and thats why Zachary had to commit that foul that was going to be a dunk well and what did Brad Brown L tell us was so key particularly defensively with Clemson transition defense against the Louisville team that just knows how to get up and down Id say uh that one of the things Pat Kelce does spend time on cuz I saw him do this in September is he wants an elite inbounder so they can get the ball across midcourt 3 seconds to keep the pressure Applause on Hunter locking fighting for the rebound its Hunter and a whistle I believe on heper another offensive rebound another o board thats six for the Tigers 6 to one on the glass Clemson on the offensive end locken tries a three and another offensive rebound but it results in a turnover Id clear it out for Hatley right here season High 17 make it 18 for Hadley and locking Off the Mark with the left hand Scott the rebound Here Comes heer one minute and itll stay here with 22 on the shot clock under a minute to go in the first half look at Hadley right here he knows oneonone shein is backpedaling on his heels its a great take in the middle third in transition Shooters in the corner you cant pinch and help Hadley with a season High 18 and Louisville on a 90 run right now to close out the first half Hadley at A tiemp Smith at three Music bang two for one opportunity for Clemson he bur to breakway oh and a block at The Rim Chase Hunter with a massive Swap and he sent Hunter to the turf rather heper who gripping that right shoulder theyre going to take a look at this because heern is an Airborne shooter theyre going to upgrade this to an F1 its a breakaway look at the closing speed chase Hunter goes to make a play on the ball but because hes an Airborne shooter the call on the floor is a common foul against number one for Clemson the play is under review Applause so the call on the floor according to Doug Surman just a common foul but you believe this will get upgraded be surprised if they dont upgrade it just because of the Airborne shooter rule you can see Pat Kelsey talking with Tim clockery flagrant one excessive Andor unnecessary or contact to the head and an Airborne shooter is usually an F1 Applause certainly a a a play on the ball was made but as you referenced Airborne player contact with the head and maybe that excessive piece on the first aspect to flagrant one might be enough to upgrade this as they continue to review Music Applause heer being worked on thats the biggest thing here he got up slowly gripping that shooting arm shoulder as Doug Surman and Tim clockery continue to review Clemson led by as many as six at one point in this first half Louisvilles gone on a 120 run over the last 2 and A2 minutes they now lead by six Pat Kelce called that timeout with 6 seconds on the shot clock they didnt score but they came down and made a defensive play and then Hadley got going again and this place erupted the Revival is real yes it is its a fan base that has been so hungry for a return to not just competitiveness but National prominence now Tim clocker is going to walk over to the Clemson huddle here perhaps with some more information about a ruling for Brad Brownell the call on the floor has been upgraded to a flagrant one foul against number one for Music Clemson so its going to be two free throws and to the point of interruption after that it would be Louisvilles ball potentially a huge swing here two possession game Chucky heern has a chance to add to that plus the basketball and Chase Hunter didnt feel it was enough to upgrade but it really had all of the characteristics of an F1 so this is now 130 run and in this 130 run for Louisville Clemson has gone 0 for four and turned the ball over three times in the last 230 and Brad Brown now told us he was concerned about handling the ball in front of this crowd with Louisvilles pressure which youve mentioned over the last four games theyve done a great job pressuring the ball we certainly saw that against UNC in Applause Virginia chance to go up 10 or more heres Smith a three and now Zachary will lead Clemson up the floor trying to snap a 140 Louisville run under 10 to shoot lockin oh Hadley was tagged with a foul and lock in will go to the Applause Music line locking with that black eye he suffered in the Stanford game battling sickness the last couple of games what a tough competitor yes and the Run continues Saturday ACC Network mens basketball triple header coming your way Clemson host Florida State UNC and NC State in an inate Showdown then by Tech against Cal and lockin snaps a 140 Louisville run 77 to go in the first half Louisville basketball Applause look for rain Smith Le bur with three heurn step back and so Louisville ends the first half on a 141 run holding Clemson to zero field goals over the final three minutes and change halftime in Louisville cars up 4235 tend to shoot for Waterman Chucky does such a good job coming back to the ball on a late clock Waterman lasers it over the top of Wiggins for three and then a turnover gives it back to the Cs there is the second time that locken has tried to feed in transition in that high low game as you see Waterman step into one he would be the fifth Louisville Cardinal to make a three today tonight largest lead of the game for the cards at 10 against the Clemson team that has won all four of its ACC contests by 10 or more coming into the night lot of contact no call heper behind the play Hunter dish shefflin a jam and finally getting him involved well he had the first basket of the game for Clemson on a slip which was a scripted play that they worked on in shoot around hes got to assert himself right here just his third shot attempt he now has four points Edwards turnaround Waterman with the push and that is number two on the BYU transfer Chase Hunter so good gets a piece of the paint drops it off thats why you look to accelerate and push through transition because you can create mismatches when you run the floor hard and then youve got Chase Hunter who understands who to get the ball to when and Applause where shefflin off the bounce locking RS it away and left it off the Applause rim heper from downtown locking with his seventh rebound hes made 10 triples you got to respect it see Louisvilles not going to guard Zachary outside the threepoint Applause line did hit one in the first half has not been a great threepoint shooter this season heern spinning walled off by Wiggins three for Hadley give him 21y jaon Hadley go ahead and shoot till your arm falls off three for three outside the ark tonight good seal really nice high low feet excellent job by shein to do those his work early it seems to me that when Clemsons a bit more methodical on offense taking their time that allows shefin to get those easier looks we got a little Zone possession here Brad Brownell has only played eight possessions of Zone all season and an offensive foul its going to go against Waterman I believe for the moving screen and thats number Music Applause Music Applause three qu breathing youre blow the game so Waterman heads to the bench and Rain Smith out defending Wiggins James Scott back on the floor for the cards Wiggins against Smith see you got to punish that Applause switch rare Miss from Hadley and the bucket for James Scott Music James Scott Rim Runner lob catcher drop off and put back guy thats how he scores and how he impacts the game on the offensive end one of just two underclassmen in the regular rotation for Louisville and Pat Kelce said one of his favorite players that hes ever coached with an incredible upside and hes not a good free throw shooter but he makes the n one Applause there he gets a round of applause as he heads to the bench meanwhile trior back on largest lead of the night for the Cs and Louisville goes small you got to get lockin going here needed that from Chase Hunter he has 10 and heern sprinting right back up the floor Hyde breeder doing a really good job staying on R Smiths hip Shin with the foul Javon Hadley nearly 50 from the floor they lead it 5142 Matt Schumacher Debbie Antonelli with you and next week our esteemed colleague will be inducted into the NC State ring of Honor she went to two sweet 16s as a member of Ks wolf pack and since has spent the last 36 years growing the sport of college basketball with her coverage and

chair as long as theyll let me Chase Hunter with 10 points hit a big three to bring Clemson back to within Striking Distance they Trail by 10 Zachary Curley and a good rebound by Terrence Applause Edwards decision Applause making if youre just joining us massive March Madness implications in this game quad one opportunity for Clemson at the moment Q2 for Lille there was a whistle before the shot no theyre going to say the whistle before the release of the shot I wonder if they might look at that that was close certainly felt bang bang as it happened live meanwhile the third foul on Javon Hadley and it doesnt appear they are going to look got it I think coach Brownell is asking the question though but its too late theyre inbounding the ball good screen by Wiggins Hunter cans a three anyway backto back from downtown for Clemsons leading score the last five games hes averaged 20 points a game he can get hot and hurry and a whistle on shefflin chein picking up up a cheap one thats number three on the preseason second Team all ACC Applause selection I think shefflin looked at Coach Brown now and said Im good leave me in I think he was considering taking them out but you got to trust your veteran guys and as 10 you know where the game is right now sevenpoint game Applause oh great back door B and trior goes hard with two Applause hands wagin for three home run pass Bang from trior what a pass by Chucky trior just makes things happen time out cson Applause well the Louisville cards have just blown the roof up the Young Center with backto back dumps by Kadir trior in his fourth game back after missing 10 with a broken arm that required surgery what a story he is the transfer from Long Beach State originally from the Ivory Coast moved here as a young boy wheres number 25 because he had just 25 in his pocket when he left to come to the United States amazing one of of seven in his family three years at Long Beach State most outstanding player last year in the Big West Conference tournament he played in the Music NCAA he was Mr hustle in that League what a play by high breeder hes played well hes played very well hes hes done his job well hes had the rain Smith match up the only three that rign Smith has gotten off or that he made was off an offensive rebound R Smith takes nine threes a game both teams in the top 25 in the country in threepoint attempts Louisville has hit more of theirs seven for 19 and that ball is headed towards us and back to Clemson even with the big swings by Pat Kels team Clemson is still right there and they have a chance to cut into this deficit and make it a two possession game with this opportunity down the floor and a foul and if its against Waterman thats number Applause four it is really nice cut on the 45 angle 45° by Hyde breeder theres no question thats a foul and now Watermans going to come off as Javon Hadley comes back on Hadley with a season High 21 18 of those in the first half lock in well defended by Scott Zachary Cashes in on the offensive rebound and that might get sein going an offensive rebound the one of two guys in the league averaging a double double the other is Maxim Reno fivepoint lead for Louisville led by as many as 12 in this game Edwards Zachary the board Applause Music Applause Hunter ran into lockin and hes back behind the Applause Music play watch out for Smith trior wins it and the foul is on the floor thats what I mean about trior he just seems to have a knack for rebounding and hustle plays and heres shein on the glass the second triple of the game for Zack Applause and again youve been talking about it Louisvilles going to give him those shots more often than not because hes not been a consistent threepoint shooter its a great time for him to take it right catch and shoot in the corner off an offensive rebound Brad Brown nows not going to run any plays for him to shoot a three hes going to have to get him that Applause way Edwards good well defended two on two here Applause Hyer Zachary the board reload and two rare misses from Hy Applause Breer open three Edwards and Kai ruths lost it off his hands 60 Clemson run brought it back back to within five still run here for Clemson Clemson is just chipping away theyre offensive rebounding theyve made four triples here in the second half they only made three in the first half they averaged just under nine a game they put some game pressure on Louisville and on the other side while Louisville went on that 141 run to close the half in about 2 and 12 minutes the ne the last 2 and 12 minutes theyre 0 for Music four Noah Waterman on the bench for Louisville with four fouls Chase Hunter will watch the first portion of this out of timeout possession From the Bench so will Shon Christian Reeves on the floor lets see if maybe they go inside to him and see if he can score on the Block yeah theyre posting him up first possession they turn it over 10 tiger Applause Music turnover this is the third game

play their only loss of course to Duke in the ACC opener best start since the 2122 season be a fivegame win streak for Pat Kels team who told us that his defense has been totally ratcheted up since the Eastern Kentucky WI in a couple of weeks ago this is one connected group and Pat Kelce knows how to win two years ago at the College of Charleston he won 32 games and he won those 32 games Matt

feet most of this game here in Louisville Noah Waterman just checked back into the game for James Scott hes going to foul out with that foul on Victor locking I think he scored the first five points or five of the first seven for Louisville and he really hasnt scored since hes been battling foul trouble I think Pat Kelce was telling him to get back in the game and he said coach I fouled Applause out replay on the big board here you can hear how the Louisville faithful feel about it so Kadir trior comes back onto the floor shefflin still with just six points on three of four good d by Edwards

remain standing theres a foul on Music Clemson Pat Kelsey has been quoted repeatedly saying this is a Revival theres a belief in the program you mentioned connectedness togetherness you certainly feel that t talking with Pat Kelce being at the shoo around and it has manifested itself in what will soon be barring anything out of the ordinary their 11th win of the season debb they had 12 combined over the last two years and theyre pretty much right on their number 52 of the shots they take are outside the arc theyve taken 52 Shots tonight 25 outside the ark theyve made eight of them theyre

their first blemish Music on their ACC record came into the night with four straight double digit wins in ACC play they will be handed a double digit loss and remain defeated at the Young Center Louisville 9 and0 all time now against the Tigers in this building and make no mistake about it the played a big role tonight no question for the cars there was their finishing ability around the rim the way they recognize matchups on the offensive end Hadley with a career high so Clemson will turn their attention to Florida State meanwhile this sets up a massive opportunity for Louisville at pit potential quad one game on Saturday and the cards have won five in a row
