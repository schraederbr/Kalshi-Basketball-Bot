Ive known this guy since he was in high school and what a run hes been on starting at winr on to College of Charleston for three years backto back NCAA tournaments and now has it rolling in Louisville Cardinals control the opening tip this is Hepburn he is Mr Everything can score can dish it can steal it a threeyear player at Wisconsin before he transferred to Louisville this year Edwards spins into the lane and knocks it d Edwards is one of those guys that he can give him the ball like he can go get you a bucket were going to see hes a little bit of a threeway type of score put the ball in the four and knock down the three as well hes a reigning Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year in fact LED James Madison to backto back NCAA tournaments this is McCollum thought about pulling up on the Baseline shot clock at five the Yu go by right to the get go to Suare and thats what Georgia Tech going to do is theyre going to break that defense for us to help you got two guys in soray and also dongle that can finish at The Rim beautiful give and go there and then unable to handle the pass is James Scott Tom watch the turning the pick and roll you see George get over there realize as sways right on the back side of it throws it up for the big man and allows him to be able to get one to go early you know we talk so much and we will talk so much about heurn but lets not forget yeah Georgia Techs got one of the better point guards in his conference as well as that one drops in for by donga and donga is the guy that think thats really got to have a big afternoon because hes got a guy hes a guy thats a big can put the ball on the floor you saw a nice little tear drop right there to get it to the Lane this guy can light it up hes off the mark his first drive and Rain Smith among one of the best threepoint Shooters in the Applause country p up is Terry not there offensive glass and then taken away by the Music Cardinals Edwards for three and hell knock it in he has all five for Louisville but heres the thing I told you about about it was first of all we saw him go in the post up then get a three in transition this is a dude that can give you 30 if you dont get out and dont stop him from getting a rhythm early thats thing about both of these teams they have a number of different scoring options this one from the corner and thats an air ball but able to get his own rebound is gonga shot clock is at six I did not catch Applause rim and the three is knocked in by Nathan George he was the point guard were talking about this guys a good player yeah he is you know second in in league and off and and uh assist come off in that loss against Notre Dame with 20 points Damon start m is asking to pick his offense up a little bit Lille will shoot a ton of Threes And Arison over the backf against Edwards thatll be the first against him take a look at the mark of the fighter moment brought to you by Modello of the shot clock shot clocks running down Nathan George again gets the three to go and and again a lot of people cannot tell that there is a huge Louisville contingent here and for Georgia Tech you need to get this crowd in early because again you want to be able to feed off of that momentum in this first half but a good start for the yellow jackets leading by Applause two shot clock at five once again its Nathan George working on heurn little contact there and the tip goes in very active as D and thats what you want for if youre if youre Damon St M you want your bigs and S and Don going to be active on those offensive boards at last time good penetration by George so cleaning it up its amazing how many injuries have hit both of these teams go and the ALU Slam by who El Scott thats his 43rd dunk of the year and thats what youre going to see youre going to see he bur break down the paint and then Scott is going to be right there putting it on creating posters all afternoon he had 42 dunks a year ago and this year that is number 50 the second most in all of college basketball and then in the lane answering is Terry nice move nice step through by Lance Terry Georgia Tech coming out finding their offense being able to break the paint and get in some early opportunities I mean red hot shooting for Georgia Tech heres heurn Louisville shoots a ton of Threes I mean a ton they rank among the top five and most taken for a game in the country you dont see a lot of that but what a start for Edwards he has seven all the and all the offense has gone through Edwards weve seen him with the post up we saw him with a three and then a little jumper right there in the lane this is a guy again thats come out with his offense attack Moville four of its first six Georgia Tech five of its first Applause eight good head F and good defensive recovery shot clock at two and raing in the three is no to Jen mlla Tom what we seen is that Louisville with good defensive possessions Georgia Tech is being able to come up with good shots and get him to go late in the shot clock boy what about the start to this one and bang at the other end for Hadley Hadleys one of those guys again can do a little bit of everything he plays a lot bigger than his size you see him give a little bit of a taunt back over at the Georgia Tech bench hes a Swiss army knife type forward and into the lane and able to drop it home is George nice tear drop by Nathan George realizing at 65 he can get there shoot over the smaller heer dude I need a breath these guys are lighting it up Edwards again wow my God this is incredible Andy you can tell Edwards is feeling it hes got that swag we talked about him too this is a dude that can come out once he gets going you got to read The Scouting Report understanding he can give you points and bunches and you never know this games being played at Georgia Tech just from the volume of the fans for Louisville we said that Georgia Tech needed to come out and match the energy for Louisville if they were going to have a shot in this game and so far theyve come in and being able to knock down big shot after Big Shot Yellow Jack is up one early Music lights out shooting early on Georgia Tech six of eight three of five from three Louisville seven of 10 to of four from three my impressions for Georgia Tech all five starters have scored only one turnover 10 of their 16 are points in the paint and on the Louisville side Terence Edwards is just like you know what hey guys I get but as you see right the distribution this is what you want if youre Damon stardy you want everyone to be involved and I love the fact that theyve come on but on the other side with Louisville Terence Edwards is like hey you know what guys if youre a little late to the party let me go ahead and get it started hes already got 10 of their 15 how did you guys figure it out back in a Lethal Weapon three days you Scott and Kenny Anderson hey Bobby kmes just let us roll I had I had a point guard in Kenny Anderson thats similar to Chucky hurn a guy that tries to get everyone going first you see how he comes out and then once everyone else gets going then he starts to cook thats pretty much what you see with heurn yep Damon scottm just raved about heurn today said that you know hes one of those guys that he he wont score he wont attempt to score like you said hell get other guys involved the next thing you know bang bang bang he hits three baskets in a row and the phrase that he uses he gets lost in the game he he gets everyone going and you on point knocks that three down he does an amazing job of balancing out hell let everyone get rolling and like you see comes out and he hits you for like a quick three or four buckets this guy was a threeyear starter he started every game thats an offensive foul against Georgia Tech slant carry and this is what Georgia Tech has to stay away from is the these type of fouls and you see the hand off there ah that may be a little close for me the offensive foul on Terry on the handoff you know you talk about heurn a threeyear starter started every game and Wisconsin and DARS to take away and hebburn able to strip it away and then save it before falling out of bound well heres the thing is we always talk about he as far as the assists and also the the scoring but this is a guy thats already first in the league and steals as well get about two steals a game in his career Wisconsin he scored over 1100 points he had over 170 steals shot clock trying to fool him there as Edwards goes into the lane got bump no call and McCollin comes back the other way for the yellow jackets going coast to coast and swatted away from behind as Kai Roose checks into the game we talk about Chucky heurn watch him come back and swipe that ball from Lance and then has the wherewithal to be able to keep it there and then Louisville does a great job in transition defense this is a team thats long thats going to challenge you with the ring youre not going to get anything easy on the inbounds play there look to be contact there between Roose and Terry and no whistle ke gets it right back comes off a screen heres into the lane Hadley and this is a RedHot man right here and he stays hot well heres the thing is we talked about with that if youre Georgia Tech you got to understand what Louisville is going to do theyre going to break you down force you to help that last time you get it over to the hot hand in Edwards boy Edwards is absolutely rolling early on he has 13 of Louisvilles Applause 21 its a guy we talked about a minute ago whos been averaging 20 points per game over the last three in Duncan Powell he misses his first try and its Cardinal basketball when we come back Tom we got a dude thats loaded with a flamethrower Edwards said Im feeling it you know what the story is been Edwards three of three from downtown five of six overall heres the thing we talked about him and his ability be a three LEL type of score and his scoring abil on full display he can go down and take a smaller guard down you see him red hot hot by from behind the ark and this is what makes this Louisville team so good because theyve got so many guys they can get it done in the first half its been Terence Edwards you see his numbers on the season 13 and 12 points 39 from behind the arc already hes got that 13 and hes shooting the lights out of it you know Edwards was only one of nine players in the country a year ago to post better than 600 points over 150 rebounds and over 125 assists those are pretty good number one of nine guys aint too sha and when you hear Pat Kelsey talk about it he Raves about him because this is a guy as a competitor outside of just the the scoring he plays with a chip on his shoulder you can tell hes come out high octane this this afternoon heres heurn in the corner thought about taking it to the rack hell pull up for three after the screen and knock it down and heres the thing about him Tom is that you see that he allows Edwards to get his thing and then slowly he decides to start like serger he cuts you up a little bit You seen him knock down those threes hes playing his own pace and Louisville will put it up over and over and over and over again they shoot 31 threes per game and theyre not particularly good at it they only shoot 32 on the year but Pat Kelce doesnt mind and theres a finish at the basket by Dango and good pass by Suare to get the ball inside and get over to Dongo Georgia Tech is going to have to be able to get some stops the pace that Louisville plays at they have to be able to have high hand close out and not allow them to keep getting those three because SMI but thats the guy that we really have not had a chance to talk about because to to this point Georgia Tes did a good job of being a Defender now Smith has only taken two shots hes missed them both and you I mean you talking about a guy that can knock him down now he had 10 threepointers in one game against SMU about a week and a half ago and thats a and thats a guy that does not need much time to get it up to Tom but going back to Georgia Tech they have to continue to break that paint Georgia Tech primarily has been playing the last four games seven seven six and seven players because theyre so thin due to all of the injuries HB to the rack oh my is he suffered but heres the thing he realized he had a big isare on him and basically what he did is he shifted him one way got into his body and finished right at the rim and theres the Louisville takeaway here they come the other Music way but now hes got the bigger defender on him as they switch and heurn thought about it theyre going to get to the taller to kick it back out to heurn this is insane and and this is what makes Louisville so good because they score in bunches Georgia has to find a way to cover those mismatches you see the Louisville faithful here at mamage letting them hear it seven threepointer of the game for the Cardinals on a 172 Applause Music run and this is with Edwards sitting down for a minute or two Applause way out and thatll be an over theback call thatll go against Javon hadlin this Louisville team we talk about what makes them so good is that they understand that they can take advantage in a little bit of blender action by he put you in a blender and he says you know what if youre going to leave me out here on an island Im going make you pay for it man hebburn he has really I mean this guy is amazing talking about putting up a first team all AC performance in the last 10 definitely separating himself all right into the corner heres pal they need him to make those shots when hes making shots they are a much much better team and with the numbers where they are right now were only going to see about one or two other guys come into this game the rest of the way and heres the thing is that we saw earlier on Georgia Tech was able to to meet and match the offensive production of Louisville you got to be able to sustain that if youre Georgia Tech right now youre down by 11 you still got to try to find a way to break that paint try to get some lob action and try to create some mismatches and try to exploit Applause those and those shots now just not Applause falling the blocked by sare you saw Smith on that back Music cut Terry able to recover and then knocked out of bounds by Edwards whos just checked back in this see that back cutting in s comes over good help and again you know that Smith is one of those guys he wants to shoot threes at last time on the B back cut good help side defense by Georgia Tech Anum eBay has checked in for the first time for Louisville into the corner man this uh drought has been a while good offensive rebound it looked like hamay basically shoved Dongo out of bounds they need to get Dongo going uh again they need to get him some quick fact you see Georgia Tech was able to catch Louisville sleeping tier was not able to knock that one down Music Applause last Georgia Tech field goal came at the 11 minute Mark so theyre staring down the barrel at over 3 and 1 half minutes Applause almost carry along the Baseline thats a nice move but the left hand would not Applause fall and headed to the free throw line is Trey or whos just come in for the first time Louisville Rolland early Music on and he came in and he took his time and allowed the offense to come to him and once he got rolling thats exactly what he did he started going bucket after bucket after bucket weve talked about his ability to be able to let everyone else get rolling and then he takes his time to cook as of late he has been rolling already 11 points Georgia Tech has not been able to score zero of their last seven field goal attempts one of 11 but on the other hand Louisville off to a 70 172 run the last 6 44 minutes and you see the numbers for this dynamic duo it is a senior Laden Team all transfers Pat Kelce was sharing with us yesterday when he took this job leaving the College of Charleston he did not have a single player on his roster think about that for a minute not one outside of a fifthyear walk on as tayori hits a free throw youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands he set up a bed in the office an office set up originally by Rick patino when he was here had enough room for a bed in it his family had not moov from Charleston and just went to work and heres the thing we often hear about how teams try to use the portal to get better sometimes it works out sometimes it does not but he and his staff they vetted all of these guys they brought in as you see Edwards come up with a steal and McCullum come right back up with it in the corner man and pal cant get it going no for his first Applause three urn thought about it and now into the lane up against the glass too strong and pow rips away the rebound Tech needs a basket bad they do and and they have to make sure that the shot quality they keep the spacing because lville wants to keep it clamping locked down that lane into the corner mcum he can shoot and that ones just off the mark Id like to see Dongo take that ball and maybe shoot it up once he breaks the paint hes had a couple of those kick it back out for Applause three and knocked out of bounds it to belong to the yellow jackets I thought the beginning of the game for Georgia te they did a good job of being able to do a little pick and roll action and they get their bigs on the slips and the cuts right now Louisville is forcing them to go east and west and theyre depending too much on that three ball right now that has not been going as of late so now 0 for their last eight one for their last 12 is Georgia Tech gongo will get it right back shot clock at three hell go into the lane with a left hand a little bit short got his own rebound and hell go to the free throw line thats good work there by Dongo and good second effort by Dongo that last time he realized he had a smaller guy on him and thats what Georgia Tak has to do on the pick and pick and roll in the rotations if you got a big or a smaller guy put him in the basket that last time didnt get the first one came up with the second opportunity now he gets to the free throw line cono a 61 free throw shooter grew up in the sagol and then came to the United States played at the putham Science Academy had a really solid freshman year hes only a sophomore 12 points eight rebounds per game shot 56 and had the six most offensive rebounds in the ACC as a freshman coming up our halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru you see is Dongo goes for the last free throw to opportunity uh to cut this lead down to 12 Georgia Tech is only down 12 when they have not been really hitting hitting their shots you would imagine with Louisville as as much as theyve had heurn and Edwards rolling as you see Dono miss that second one they should be down more than what they really are now Louisville will go in spurts they shoot as weve said already they shoot a ton of Threes And thats what Pat Kelce wants him to do and theres a foul underneath going to go against mollen or did he kick it not quite sure what the call was there but its Louisville basketball and 15 on the shot clock shot clock at Music seven its got to go Applause up and a violation good stand there defensively for Georgia Tech a good defensive possession question by Georgia Tech again weve talked about the fact that theyve got to find a way to chip at this lead get some offense going fifth turnover by the Cardinals they average 11 per game both of these teams take good care of the Applause Applause basketball right hand fade away and finally this is second in the last 15 attempts good shot by Terry realize he can get to a point as you see that last one time foul by McCullum on on Smith that last time watch this last penetration see realize Scott comes over regards himself and understand hes got an advantage because he can jump over rain Applause Smith 25 on the shot clock were under five minutes to go in the opening half Louisville comes in having won 10 in a row but Georgia Techs been good at home theyve won nine of their 14 games in this building theyve not won a road game all season Applause long pitch it into the corner and now those shots are not falling and Georgia T doing a good job of being able to get those defensive rebounds I think that when you got pal on Edwards a bit more physical Edward is not being able to to bully some of the players you see R Smith on the foul on dungo correction that was on Music heer that is the fifth team foul against Louisville Georgia Tech only whistled for three as we close in on five5 to go in the opening half Tech needs a late run here and this is something to Damon STM talked about with us before the game of day the final four minutes of the half well you just saw Lance ter with the step back three thats the guy that as of late has picked up his offense Georgia Tech getting some stops cut this thing down to Applause eight Edwards bumped and thatll be a foul against the yellow jackets first see both in a while see Georgia Tech trying to call in Lance Terry with the three presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years and Tom what it was is Georgia Tech starting out the game on a 149 start being able to find their offense and then Terrence F Edwards came in and he got cooked with 13 points and it up for them and then on that run Chucky heer decided to join the show came in with 11 points three for five and then as of Blake Georgia Tech finding some way to be able to chip away at this thing we talked about the fact that Louisville will have their moments zero points in the last 3 minutes and 47 seconds I mean thats the thing as you know uh Brian olivan former Georgia Tech great that when you not going to say they live and die but they certainly shooting 31 threepointers a game they being loable youre going to go through spurts where yeah you can be hot but then it can get quiet well heres the thing and you realize that this is the team theyre going to have some runs where theyre going to shoot the lights out of it and then if you play solid defense then theyre going to have some lows Georgia Tech has been able to get some stops and they found a little bit of offense as of late the big thing with this last 3 minutes and 44 seconds can they continue to get stops and then get some scoring Le into the lane and its not there and and the rebound ripped out of there by Dango hes been very active on the glass both ends of the floor and hell get this one into the lane and all of a sudden that lead is down to six but heres the thing is if Georgia T is going back to getting into the paint that last time Mullen was able to force the help then Dongo gets it and finishes we saw them working on the bigs finishing at The Rim today in shooter Applause round Louisville has not scored in nearly 4 and a half minutes Applause heres Edwards he has 13 in the game Lost to handle and here comes maala for the yellow jackets the other way and then he loses it scramble for the ball and look at this a Breakout by hadle and a lot of that was Terence Edward Jr and you see 5050 balls are critical gives Hadley an easy one but looked like Georgia Tech had opportunity to fur the chip into this lead well thats something that Pat Kelce talked about with us last night for maybe longer than anything else as theres a bump by hurn and thats winning 5050 balls Pat Kelsey said that is what I want our team to find by and often times you see where coaches always talk about they want their team to have their personality watch Louisville and how they fight out for this and you see the guys hitting the ground realizing gives you an easy one Hadleys able to finish there Im sure that if I was I like that shot by McCullum coming out of that that possession Edwards pitches it out 43 not going to be there and a rebound ripped away by Suare important for Georgia Tech you got a little bit more than two minutes and I like to see the mismatch right there between Duncan pow having a smaller R Smith on him they come down to double team and a hack on the yard and heres the thing if youre pal you go right away you dont have to sit back and try to bump and Bully Smith as you see him come out of the game the more you put the ball on the floor youre allowing time for the defender to come over and double team you so that was just a clean strip no foul called there so Lille with six fouls and four charged to Georgia Tech 204 to go Georgia Tech could really use a basket right now down eight Music ban George checks back in he will take over for mallum watch this possible stagger out of bounds you see the ref is like oh that move by Terry how about Terry you saw him come off that little stagger goes right to the basket for the finish and in it offensive no they called a block down there on Terry boy how about that move by Lance Terry now watch these ups this is reminiscent of Tom Brenan back in his days at the why you see Lance Terry goes up and shows it and then on the other end you see T Terry not being able to get on tayori comes on the penetration is whistled for the foul well I dont know about that call that looked like he had his position there spin into the lane left hand will not fall and another rebound for Dongo well we talk about the fact that Louisville they came out and they were scoring early Georgia Tas found a little bit of a rhythm as of late you see Terry there with that aggression absorbing contact what theyve done theyve been able to chip away at this thing being physical and not settling for the offense on the threepoint line yeah I think thats a right word there Brian Oliver they have been more physical here over the last four or five minutes of this game then Louisville so Terry who has nine at the freeo line if youre looking for a Cable News Network that respects all Americans you have a new home with news Nation news Nation Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find news Nation go to newsnation nowcom so I I think that obviously Georgia has done a good job of being able to defend Louisville better since Duncan poell has come in the match up between he and Edwards thats cool Edwards off a little bit because thats somebody that can stay and and out physical him in the Music Applause sense Smith is not made a three until now but heres the thing is this how Louisville beats you you sit back and Smith kind of just hangs out you back off of him and then he gets one to go and thats a momentum killer brought up earlier he had three 10 threepointers in one game as theres an offensive foul on the screen set by Dongo watch this last time on the handoff watch heer try to get through this and they do a good job and you see Dongo moving he should have just stayed solid all right 59 seconds remain until halftime a very important final minute for Georgia Tech got it down to five a minute ago now it stands at eight about a 30se second differential between shot and game Applause clocks ke in the lane drains the footer but they run the pick and roll knowing that theyre going to switch a big he realizes that all he has to do is G gather himself get to a spot and get separation calm and cool understanding that he can get to a spot and make a shot 13 for heer 13 for Edward and a timeout by Damon scottm the 51yearold Portland Oregon native came to Georgia Tech after three seasons in assistant for the Boston Celtics 5 years he was a head coach of course at Pacific before going back to the NBA want to remind you next week CW courts side Saturday it is a triple header you and Ill be in South B Virginia Tech takes on Notre Dame then Boston College goes to Syracuse we end the day Georgia Tech goes to Charlottesville to take on Virginia full day of CW Courtside Saturday action next week one Eastern 10 Pacific only on the CW Tom I think that for for Georgia Tech if youre Damon stmy you got to make sure that you run a good play you dont necessarily need a three when you talk about momentum even if youre go in down eight or down seven you want to be able to break this 10 10point cushion so for me what theyve had success in running that pick and roll action trying to break the paint maybe get Dongo or one of their bigs on a slip and then if you can get the ball to Lance Terry he is shown that he can give you some offense but you got to get a good play out all right 20 seconds Applause Music Applause left swing it for three and still unable to connect in the corner was Duncan pal he missed all four of his threepoint attempts in the first half thats got to change in the second half it does but they got a shot begin the second half 3827 in favor of Louisville winners of 10 consecutive games coming into this one and thats a really nice play to start the second half Ive always thought thas the first four minutes are is critical for a team for Georgia Tech you got to be able to come in quickly and establish what you did the beginning of the game continue to attack we talk about the fact 18 of their 28 first half points were in the paint by dangos got a chance to have a really good career here at Georgia Tech he is only only a sophomore and getting better every single game shot clock at four this is Edwards and then an offensive rebound they love doing that getting an offensive rebound and kicking it back out for a potential three alyuk wasnt a dunk but able to put it in was Hadley and great pass by Herer realizing again get it to the paint this is a guy thats always going to look to try to pass and get his guys going early the lob over there the had Hadley had five in the first half left hand and the foul on Hadley and lets take a look at the mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Modello pretty slick right there yeah and again you saw hurn get to the paint understand they can get it up there for Hadley and youll see Louisville do a lot of that as you see right now Nathan George go to the free throw line for two on that last penetration and foul lets see third foul on Hadley by the way free throw is Up and Good by George youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands George another guy whos going to have an excellent career here for Georgia Tech hes only in his second year took over as a starting point guard a year ago as a freshman I mean you look at the skills set for him at 65 I mean this is the guy gu we talk about a percentage points behind herper and assists and then you look at his ability to pick up scoring we talked about the fact that last game and a loss against D Dame had 20 points open three ball bang on the other s by Hadley they leave him in there with three fouls havent we seen with Louisville its a matter of runs one minute you have Edwards going off then you have heern and then right now you see Hadley come in with five quick points to start off the second half and right back down to the other end look to be contact no whistle George going to the rack Edwards into the lane cant get it follow will not go by Applause Scott 4331 Louisville heres the guy they got to get going Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause re ball will go down and once again thats Terry whos having a nice game and Terry did a good job of being able to set up the defender fake like he was going to penetrate got that step back to go not an easy shot to get go down hes got 12 and theres a tip Ball by Terry Dongo leads the other way to Pal who will lay it in Georgia Tech with two consecutive stops being able to get some stop and again maybe that lay is the one that allow P to get rolling and Pat Kelce says hang on a minute quick run by Georgia Tech to get that lead down to seven 4336 17 17 to Golian on the campus of Georgia Tech right next to downtown Atlanta three Louisville players and double figures Edwards heurn and Hadley combined for 36 that is a point total for Georgia Tech but the yellow jackets with a nice little run here over the last minute and a half to get that lead down to seven and you see the second half Jamon not my opting to Star Duncan pow I thought that even though he hadnt scored up until now it was his defense I thought in that the end of the first half that allow him to match up with Edwards and give you somebody that can stay in front of him and be physical and not allow him to take Music advantage Al Loval after the timeout and a quick turnover by Hadley and back the other way they pitch it out to Terry and hell go to the basket lost a handle on the way Applause up nearly another Cardinals turnover but to the basket with a the left hand and nice move by Edwards realized that he had a big on him got it himself and was able to get downhill and finish and kind of slow down the little run it seemed like theres a little bit of a shift and momentum in Georgia Techs favor first bucket a long time by Edwards he did not score after the first eight minutes of the opening half way downtown is short and Louis comes away with the ball its Edwards and hes in some trouble and he got bailed out watch the last play about Terence Edwards realized that hes got a big on him and instead of shooting that three gives him a little bit of a hesi and gets to the basket and finishes is that is that what the people your age use for hesitation hesi is that what that means people your age yeah my people my age Im closer to you than the other genre but again hey you got to understand I got a 15y old Hooper so she she keeps me Rel and she keeps me cool she had a big win last night they did and she bowled out things getting a little sloppy for Louisville here over the last minute or two and I think thats going to be a foul against the Cardinals but Tom heres the thing is weve talked about this Louisville team and how they have gotten a 10 in a row they have basically outmatched out physical a lot of different teams Georgia Tech the way theyve been able to stay in this theyve been able to raise their level of physicality you see right now in this second half clawing back in here because theyre getting stops giving them an opportunity right now they got a chance to be able to cut this thing down to six mum is checked back first time weve seen him in the second half step back three and itll go in and the rim being really fil and again mullum is not a guy thats giving you a lot of points but he has come out with the energy and effort especially as galvanized his defense for Georgia Tech inside contact getting his own throwing it down is tror his first bucket of the game dror with the back down didnt get the first one to go it was the first guy goes up with a pogo stick to be able to finish that one transfer from Long Beach State where he played in last years NCAA Applause tournament he was a all big West performer Fade Away by McCollum not there and there is Applause trayor Hur spins into the lane against the glass had it Applause rejected oh what was that is that a goal T you see Louisville we go to break Trey or sits back and gets his offensive rebound and said up go go go gadget legs to extend that lead back up to 10 un this gold tending and you see right there on the replay he gets it right after it hits the the the backboard and in my mind thats got to be a goal 10 two points for Music he well no verdict from the Judiciary quite yet Music Tony Henderson Greg Evans and Isaac Barnett are officiating crew here today in Music Applause Music Applause Atlanta after aie the call on the floor stands gending so that will be the first basket of this second half by Chucky hman so he has 15 and so too does Terence Edwards Jr for the Cardinals you know the difference in the game the threepoint shot Louisville is 9 for 18 Georgia Tech is four for 16 well and you understand that for this Georgia Tech team that they come in theyre 10th at the ACC at three points made about 7 and A2 Louisville on on the side second in the league but almost 10 a game and I think that what you look at is that we we saw Georgia Tech being able to to stay in this thing with the points to the paint I think that that three ball will go but you got to keep trying to break the rim and hit the paint trying to get the mismatch and they have it down there Dongo working on Applause Tori bodies falling all over underneath the basket shot clock at three po to the basket had it rejected and Dongo again and lays it in man is he having a good game but heres the thing is that hes given them that level of energy that they were been theyve been missing that last time you saw trayi come over to help on the the penetration by pow dungo did a good job of being able to finish that at The Rim off the offensive glass hes got 10 in the game Edwards into the paint little spay Fade Away nope and now Tech with a chance to get even closer trailing by eight and maau he passed up the three goes to the rack and it is good its Terry hits his second three of the game and you see that Terry was able to freeze tayori with a little bit of a jab step to get that little separation Georgia Tech on a good run to be able to cut this thing down to five really good run and who wants the ball Edwards Music Applause heurn Edwards into the lane that was a tough shot and now Georgia Tech can cut it to three or two bow in and out thought that was down to the bottom you see good pass ahead by Nathan George mum saying what am I supposed to do but I like the fact that what they did is Hadley is one of those guys we talk about Louisville do a does a good job of being able to exploit the mismatches he realized he had to small or McCullum on him get the ball inside and if youre McCullum yeah you hate to give up a foul but you dont want to give up two points right now and break the momentum that you guys Music have and McCollum is in some pain he has two fouls so thats not an issue but uh hes reaching down around the groin area hopefully hes okay as Suare comes back into the game and Rain Smith comes back in and theres miscommunication there and back the other way its pal dont look now hell go to the free throw line and its a threepoint game but heres what weve seen is that Georgia Tech has been to turn up the intensity with their defense watch this last play and you see pal you see Smith comes over takes a swipe at it pal finishes flexes for the bench gives georia Tech an opportunity now to cut this thing down to two I dont know who saw that coming it was an 11 point point spread and it is counted to an8 nothing run over the last minute and 20 seconds for the Ramblin wck and you hear Pat Kelce over here motioning to his guys to keep their composure and again Georgia Tech has been able to climb back into this game with a level of intensity wide open three for Smith thats what they want he cant hit it now check a chance to tie or get within or actually or take the lead Applause and its a tie game at midrange jump out with with with Nathan George hes picked up his offense you see Georgia Tech faithful letting him hear it Georgia Tech on this Applause run and a bump underneath and headed to the free throw line iss a bubacar trior where he is nine of 12 from the line this season hell shoot two first tie since the opening minute of the game that last time you see Nathan George realizing that Hadley did not step out on him one of the things that he wanted to do is pick up his Music offense tror two of two from the line in the game two of three and a 10 nothing Georgia Tech run Louisville is not scored in almost three minutes but heres the thing is that you and I talked about this for Georgia Tech theyve done a much better job of being able to guard the man and not forc to break downs and then theyre locking up the possessions by getting the defensive rebounds with the steel and capitalizing on the other end tayori hits one of two and its a onepoint Cardinals lead 1226 to go tayori leaves Roose checks in again a reminder the last time a Louisville team won 10 in a row you got to go back to 2020 and that 10 game losing streak ended in this building against Georgia Applause Tech look at mum long three not there passed up a better look than that he did I thought that he had the first one and that last time it wasnt a real productive offensive possession wide open and in and out as Roose cant hit the three and see Georgia Tech getting out and heres the thing is that you got to continue to run your offense like to see them give Lance Terry an opportunity for maybe EXP that match up between he and Rain Smith George handling the basketball gets a screen from donga and that is another offensive foul on a screen by donga and Dongo you got to hold those screens hes got a good one right here going right before us you see Georgia te CLA back in Louisville still being able to hold on to it up by one Music look at todays key plays brought to you by Hilton Gard in Hilton for the state and our Hil key play has been the Yellow Jackets play in the second half they have been able to use a 10 to one run to be able to Chip Away of this thing and then tie it up the key play for me Tom is the fact that theyve used their defense to be able to get out there on the offense Georgia taking a nice little run to be able to get this thing cut down yeah its been uh 11point deficit at halftime with louu in front but Georgia Tech on a 22 12 run heres the thing weve talked about what Georgia Tech has been able to do on the other side for Louisville you got to get back to what what youve done before continue to run your offense move that ball and continue to be able to break that paint what Georgia Tech has done they raised their level of physicality and they forced them to have contested shots and theyre locking up those defensive Music Applause Music boards wide open three in the corner and theyre just missing open looks and heres the thing is that youre seeing that now Louisville has been regulated to going east and west rather than going downhill the last time Georgia Tech had a lead it was 16 to 15 and they lead now nice move by McCullen realizing he can get the blow by by rign Smith allows him to get down heeld Yellow Jack is a finally up by one and at the other end Lille answers on the drive by Hadley good move by Hadley realize he can get right by Dongo and at the other end a missed layup right there and able to hustle after missing the layup itll lead to a slam whoa what a play that play was started by the Chas down by Nathan George No One warned R Smith to let him know you get the deflection going to take up in their intensity oh doctor weve got 10 to 15 to go we got a gain R and he missed it dunp he jumped too early it looked like and underneath it was Hadley if thats on Hadley thats number four on him and that is a big big hit for Pat Kel team Tom if youre going to upset the number one 21 team in in the country you got to win the 5050 balls and this is what youve seen Georgia Tech do in this second half theyre coming up with the Steals and theyre being able to capitalize were generating easy offense Hadley has been their best score here in the second half by a long shot he has seven 10 minutes to go heres the thing too for Pat Kel that this is a game thats youre showing hey weve got a veteran group weve got a a team thats in a hostile environment our back is against the wall how do we respond thats the guy for Georgia Tech that youve been waiting all night we talked about Duncan pal is the dude that had been balling he has turned it up in his second half he has eight points in the second half he did not score in the first half and my oh my how things have changed but what you have seen active Hands by Georgia Tech they turned up their defense and right now Louisville has kind of sputtered a little bit you see the Cardinal they have to re regroup and they have to gain their composure right now Louisville just six of 16 from the field here in the second half they missed some great looks from three meanwhile Georgia Tech is 11 out of 19 man Nathan George with to pull up again that midrange jump shot tayori backed off of him Georgia take is riding his momentum and a time out by Pat Kelce the Cardinals are stunned Applause boy makes you wonder doesnt it sometimes uh you know Brian you you watch teams play and the difference between the the energy and spurts I mean Georgia Tech has been right there in their last couple of games decided by a single possession right or single digits uh after going a lot of games this year where thats not been the case get back here at home it looked like it was getting away from him then one burst and has turned it all around well heres the thing Tom we spoke with Damon St today we said he he mentioned that he thought this team was right there they were making the place they just needed to put it together we saw going into the the half they were down by 11 they come out the beginning of the game they punched Louisville in the mouth because they were able to get stopped they would get some momentum you got different guys that are scoring right now well Louisville needs they need to be able to regain their composure get back to what youre doing again break the paint Force Georgia Tech to have the guard R Smith is a guy that you need to try to see if you can get him rolling all righty there isolation for heurn and a tough shot against a taller Defender but an offensive rebound ripped out of there by Scott thats a nice move along the Baseline right there by Edwards and he draws a foul from Suarez he good move by Edwards because he realized anytime you get a big out there you want to try to sell him on the pump fake was able to dislodge him a little bit thats a guy again needs to pick up his offense because he carried them early in the first I well he scored 13 points in the first 8 minutes of the game he has one basket since and he misses a front end of two if you miss a sneak peek of the season premiere of allamerican last week well youre in for a tree because a special oncore presentation of the CW hit series is happening again Monday right here on the CW allamerican season 7 Prem 8 Eastern 7 Central and Edwards a 78 free throw shooter misses both of them tro T has done a good job in his second half of being able to run their offense and with the spacing and being able to break down again I keep talking about breaking the paint theres another one of those 5050 balls and pal able to tracking down shot clock at Music five I mean everything going in right now but Nathan George has been wearing Louisville out with that midrange jump shot you overheard me talk about the little hesitation there he was able to free himself with try Ori George to take it biggest lead of the afternoon at eight points Louisville LED this game by 11 at Music halftime Edwards in the paint and that ends at 213 run a nice move by Edwards cuz we talked about thats a guy that you can give the ball to and go get your a bucket wide open look there by Terry and couldnt get it the fall Louisville with a chance to cut this sixpoint lead trayi into the lane and he got tripped up hell go to the line for a pair going to be a wild 731 here Georgia Tech in front of Louisville by six in the second half look at these numbers with Georgia Tech in the second half the one thing you see is the 13 for 22 theyve up knocking down the three ball a scoring margin margin of plus 17 and only one turn over yeah I mean its just unbelievable uh theyve scored 33 points in the second half they had 27 total in the first half they scored 33 points in 13 not even 13 minutes Louisville after 38 in the first half a total of 16 here in the second and obviously we still got a little bit more to go as you see tror me missed the front end of that too when we spoke with Damon STM this morning that was one of the things he said is that hey we got to match the level of physicality we got to take care of the ball and we got to get good shots in the second half thats what you have seen as you see tayori Miss another one Georgia Tech shot quality has been driven by their defense and theyve been able to take care of the rock theyre shooting 59 in the second half three for six theres a turnover nearly a turnover and then a foul going to be called against Tu that should have been a takeaway for the Cardinals but tayori is just three of six from a line and one of four here in the second half louu has not lost since being defeated in a really good game against its instate rival the Kentucky Wildcats all the way back on the 14th of December heres where I will tell you weve watched this Louisville team a lot in that 10 game winning stre this is a team that can put up points and bunches really pass so if youre Georgia Tech you cannot take your foot off the gas shot clock at three little fade away and theres gongo again justs knocking on the door of a double double and a take away by the Cardinal and here they come the other way and on his way to the free throw line its hadling and thats how Louisville is going to get back in this game because we talk about this is a team with their level physicality they will use their defense to create opportunities we talked about Hadley being that guy that does a little bit of everything understand we still have just under 7even minutes left to go this Louisville team has shown that they can score points and bunches right heres Hadley at the line and man I mean Louisville who shoots 74 for the year cant throw one in hes a cop shes a kind unlikely Duo uses their skills to catch criminals its the hit series Wild Card season two starting w night and able to hit one of two at the free throw line is Hadley his first two free throw attempts today and it is a fivepoint game long way to Music Applause Music Applause go oh a take away nearly and it just its been that close for Louisville the last few times down the court shot clock under Applause 10 going to have to force it up there thats a good defensive effort right there by the Cardinals and here comes Louisville the other way and a lay in is good by tror and Tom I told you you see Georgia Tech call a timeout Louisville getting back into this game with their defense and thats what we talk about thats their Mantra they play hard and they make you pay on the other end I tell you what James Scott is very lucky he didnt just get teed up he got right in the face of Suare walking off the court at high after the timeout watch this Las Bay trayor is able to go it could have been easily a and one and you see Scott there the end of this play but again this Louisville team we talk about it the fact that youre Juggernaut and how they are able to be team theyre physical this is a team that plays with swag they get in your Music face this is right here where he gets right barking and then the two bump to one another didnt necessarily look like on second look there that he was barking in the face um of Suarez so no harm no foul I think Scott was just asking that hey bro you know what we may have a little time after this game where would you think I can get some really good hot wings thats been a good game you know the other thing about Louisville is theres so much experience on this team we talked about all the transfers in all the years of the college basketball from this group collectively in the corner nice wow Terry again a little guard on guard action between McCullum and then also uh George and then you get J you get Terry a wide open three thats his third three of the game threepoint lead goes back to six Edwards into the paint throws it up hell go to the Applause Music Applause line watch this last guard on guard action you see ends up getting you a wide open shot and three and you see the bench for Georgia Tech loving it with the celebration Applause Cardinals at the free throw line four out of 10 this a good free throw shooting Team Four of 11 and heres the thing for Louisville youre leaving points on the on the table right there Im talking about theyre getting the fouls and getting the opportuni theyve got to be able to capitalize and knock down these free throws this young man right here is a 78 free throw shooter and thats the first time hes made four attempts heres the thing that often when you see in plays is that if theres a play that works you keep running that play and you force the team to have to stop it from Georgia Tech I get back to that pick and roll Action Force Louisville to be able to show try to get downhill into the lane M they go to the free throw line and draws a foul against Smith and what youve seen in this second halftime for Georgia Tech their guards have been able to spread Louisville and he turn watch McCullum gets downhill forc the help does a little bit of Up and Under absorbs that contact and able to capitalize and does a little planking action to be able to Applause celebrate thats a third foul on Smith who really has been a nonf factor in this game here today and generally hes a huge factor for Louis sevenpoint game into the lane Edward trying to make it it happen himself Edward taking taking opportunity to realize he had Dongo on him gets him to one point and then absorbs the contact and finishes he has 20 Terry has 20 for Georgia Tech under five to go fivepoint lead for the home Music team bang they cant stop it well and heres the thing is that here you see thats a little bit of isolation gets that separation you see the blow by and then the lock up by Georgia Tech I mean to tell you Georgia Tech just wants it more right now and thats the thing is if youre going to knock off a team in Louisville thats rank 21 of the country youre going to have to have those actra plays because when you see for Georgia attack what theyve been able to do we talked about Lance Terry and his ability to be able to score watch this last play he freezes him gets a little bit of a step back SE knocks down that three and so if youre Georgia Tech what you have done is that you stepped up your level of intensity and we talked about the fact that theyve got to find play find ways to make baskets and they have done that in the second half you know we talked earlier about the difference in the game at onepoint was a threepoint ball when Louisville had nine threepointers and Georgia Tech only had four well now all of a sudden Georgia Tech has eight as theyve C six and 10 here in the second half but Tom its the quality of shots that theyre getting one of the thing that Damon star talked about talked about earlier we got to take care of the ball and we got to get good shots the shot quality that Georgia Tech has got in the second half has been totally different from what theyve gotten in the first half a lot of it is that theyre spreading Louisville out theyre breaking the paint forcing the help and theyre making the extra pass it doesnt hurt that you got a guy in Lance Terry that can shoot 39 from behind the AR look at these numbers I mean look this is all about Georgia Tech just executing those numbers are insane and heres the thing is that you have to stick to the script dont get outside of what youve been able to do you want to keep making passes like this and you see right now GL Terry proves that he is human but the guy has got the ball right now thats the one that if Im Louisville Im going to put the ball in his hands because hes proven he can go get you a bucket T Heburn has been very quiet here in the second Applause half Louisville with a Chance h on the basine and a foul called underneath and good move by tryi he was able to get past p and attack the rim hes giv them a huge boost of energy when hes come in watch this last play was able to rip by po gets besides him and then dong go late challenges him at The Rim Id like to see that one again it may have been a contact with the rim with the with the with the body like Dongo had all ball on that one and that is Dongo fourth personal foul he has a double double in this game already watch down go go up right there from that angle its hard to see maybe he got him with the off arm Georgia Tech though they have definitely turned up their energy Louisville has found himself in a dog fight long way to go 401 left but one thing that has to change for Louisville right now is making free throws because just its been tough in this one just this play again D go on the back side here ah you see that right arm y grabs right right around the shoulder area well tayori has had his issues at the line just three of six in the game three of seven and and heres the thing if youre Pat Kelsey what you want to do you got a veteran ball Club this is a team and this is going to come out and continue to attack the paint but you got to be able to get some stops if you see him be able to get one to go six of 14 from the free throw line is Louisville so I mean thats eight gimmies and the spread in this one is seven Applause Music Applause that an easy look there for Terry and couldnt knock it down now the Cardinals with a chance to get closer Edwards a step back three and its not there offensive rebound is lost and leading the other way mum on the take it upstairs dick fella D go with the Finish Wooh lead is nine up bur for three offensive rebound to Scott and now Edwards little floater not going to go stick back is good by Hadley and he was fouled and will go to the free throw line what you realize is that this Georgia Tech Team theyre coming if you want to bully bully this is how you do it you come up there you finish it and then you look at the Louisville fans in disbelief shes like oh my God what is going on Music Applause Applause w presented by pack Pacific light creating Financial Security for nearly 1760 years and Tom Jose in the first half it was all Louisville with points in the paint they had their way and doing their thing but Georgia Tech decided hey we want a little bit of that too and then they take the lead at 5150 and from there it was downhill in the sense Georgia te was able to create opportunities take advantage of turn around land Terry has been in his bag 23 points and again weve seen Georgia Tech be able to continue to hold on to this leap because they have been the aggressor in turning their defense into good offense 4325 the difference in points here in this second half and by the way huge on that plus one here attempt Now by Hadley that was Dongo fouled out of the game so that could be a huge Factor coming down the stretch cuz that young man has had a double double and has played an outstanding game and what hes done is hes anchored their defense and so Louisville has not been able to get to the basket as quickly but heres the thing if youre Georgia Tech youre up by six under 3 minutes the clock is your friend you dont have to play hesitant but you want to continue to have good shots and you know what thats a good way to get a shot if you McCullum get down absorb the contact and finish at the cup yeah it doesnt appear to be a good matchup as Smith is having a hard time defending him and heres the guy thats had a nice second half outside of the free throw line and thats Dre treor got away when I thought was a double dribble that last time dropped the ball and again for Georgia Tech Ur runson plot continue the spread them out little pick and roll action break the paint pay attention to Lance Terry if hes in the game he is in the game want to make sure you can try to give him a touch and now theyve Switched Off they put Smith on Terry lets see if they try to get the ball to Terry reach in fouled there by Hadley or was it on heurn but Nathan George did a good job of realizing again he could get downhill and then put themselves in a position where you see Chucky Hebron is called for that foul that is a 17 foul against the Cardinals so Georgia Tech will go to the free throw line they want to know who this foul was on was it on heurn or was it on Hadley and theyre going to go to the uh they want to make sure they got the right guy because previous play if its on Hadley hes fouled out of the game my initial Instinct was that I thought that it may have been on heer but then again its the last thing you want for for Pat Kelsey because Hatley is one of your glue guys you definitely do not want to lose him at this this juncture of the game watch this last play you see confirmed fouls on one penetration and watch hat watch hatleys left arm right in there he was the one that reached in to Nathan George that foul is going to be on Hadley its going to be his fifth Hadley will lead the game with 16 points 6 out of 10 shooting at a couple of threes and now a big part of this Louisville offense will go to the bench you know you look at this second half heurn who had 13 in the first half has one basket in the second half heres the thing for Georgia Tech you seen Louisville Le a lot of points on the table your Georgia Tech at this juncture you got to be able to capitalize on these free throws and the front end of the one and one is good by George hes three for three from the line 78 on the year Music Applause Music and he hits them both boy so many great Louisville basketball fans I mean they have traveled here to Atlanta and many of them are sitting right now in disbelief as to whats going on here not over yet and thats a silly foul right there on pow and that will send Edwards to the free throw line the double bonus and that shows the mood right there look at a lot of these Louisville fans you know what you scan this Georgia Tech Arena theyve got a pretty big sh showing and a lot of rejected fans up until this point we still got time yeah I mean you talk about you you got an opportunity to go and Edwards with two free throws youre only down eight Applause points I mean Louisville is one of the top three basketball cities in America as far as fan base is concerned they love the Cardinals in fact as far as TV ratings are concerned Louisvilles been number one in the country forever and you see finally Louisville able to get two consecutive free throws Edwards and right now theyre extending their pressure if youre Georgia Tech ball security is key because this Louisville team is good and you know that Chucky heurn leads the league and steals at almost to a game lot of dribbling out there they tried for the double team takeaway shot clock at eight and what a rejection right there the ball hit off of the foot of Terry itll belong to lisal so now all of a sudden a chance to cut it down even more and watch the play by tror we talked about how since hes come in he has given them a huge lift minute 15 to go I mean they cannot get a look for Smith heurn going to go to the rack and he will go to the free throw line where hes fouled by George so youre stopping a clock and you got a chance to knock a couple of more points off and a little misdirection by Chucky he that last time being able to get to the rim and then absorb that contact like you said now you get a chance to cut this lead down to four and then again you still got plenty of time see last 10 games 75 77 today 9 for 17 you see Chucky heer knocked down the first of the two shot foul first time hes been at the line 84 free throw shooter is he bur trying to get it down to a fourpoint game and he does with a minute nine to go four court pressure by Louisville you see theyve matched up Frei on Nathan George if youre Georgia Tech you do not play to lose you dont want to be car with the ball you want to run your offense again you see that R Smith is guarding Duncan Powell try to put him maybe in the pul well they dont they have him float around to three and now tries to go to the rack and Pat Kelce is beside himself at that whistle with one on the shot clock he wants to know who is it well watch this last play then you see pal go through and watch The Help by Scott hard to see whether he had all ball or not and watch this play here as he comes over its like yeah he got him on that left arm he did good play by pal not throwing up a shot be able to go to the line important two free throws and the first is good hes two of two from the line in the game 68 on the year lead is five 40 seconds remain and heres important because now what you have for your Georgia Tech Two possession gain 40 seconds on the clock youve got to have a good defensive possession all nine points by Powell have come here in the second half and now a timeout called by Pat Kelce 35 seconds remain in a fivepoint game I mean consider this Louisville has outscored its opponents on average by 12 per game in Conference playy during in this winning streak theyve outrebounded their opponents by almost seven a game they have been nearly Flawless during this 10 game win streak the last time a Louisville team won 11 games in a row youve got to go back to 2015 when they lost in the Elite 8 against Michigan State the last time they had a 10game winning streak was in 2020 and it ended right here against the yellow jackets in a sixpoint decision and and Ill go in both sides of the hle for Louisville if Im Pat Kelsey what am I going for were down five do I go for a three or do I go for a two if Im going for a three believe it or not I draw up something to see if I can get my best threepoint shooter and R Smith whos been quiet all afternoon give him an opportunity for a three if Im Georgia Tech what I say is we dont give him up an easy bucket because heres the thing sometimes KS get so caught up and trying to guard the three you give up a quick two and you did not want to give Louisville a quick two with only taking off a few seconds on the clock now youll notice no timeouts remaining for Louisville thats it and Georgia Tech has one what I want to do if Im Georgia Tech I force Louisville to throw the ball out as close to the to the half court line is easy pay attention to make sure that you dont get caught in any back screens and it gives Louisville an opportunity to get a quick score would only taken just seconds off the clock Smith is only one one of five from the field one of four from three in the game theyre going to get it right back in his hands well they tried to run a scen to get it for him time ticking away tryi Along the Baseline pitch it in the corner for three and its not there by Smith just not been his day well you saw the misdirection I love the play that they drew up they get the ball in to try Ori and then you get the backside screen for Smith good contest by McCollum you see right now looks like s watch this replay and you youre so worried about trayor right now you dont pay attention to the backside forar can say and I love the fact that mullum comes over and forces him to to shoot him a contested hand Louisville in the second half is only one of eight from threepoint land thats it heres the thing if youre sori and you see Louisville fans right now packing it up heading up by 75 but for for Georgia Tech opportunity right here you hit both of these and you basically seal it cuz you make it a three possession game Suare is only 5 for 18 this entire year from the line he is shooting a one and Applause one and Louisville still down five under 20 seconds to go Edwards had it Stripped Away or lost a handle and a fight for the basketball and Georgia Tech has it foul on Smith and thatll tie perhaps a ribbon around this one if pal can make one heres the thing that last play Edwards comes up and ball was a little slippery watch this last play he comes in good defense by by pal stay solid and come in and then looks like Chucky heer may have committed well excuse me rain Smith commits that foul but how about the afternoon for Georgia Tech we talked to Damon stman day and he says his yellow Jackson right there they just got to be able to capitalize and then finish out and close out games I Im just amazed at the difference between the first half and the second half of this game uh you know in the first half Louisvilles up by 11 here in the second half Pat Kels team has been outscored 48 32 but you had some really good individual performances again Lance ter comes up big as you see Duncan pow knocked down that first shot to extend the lead to six then I thought that for Georgia Tech and then when you look at the second half numbers look at how they shot the ball you talking 18 for 32 field goals and I thought they shot the lights out of behind the ark Louisvilles 10 game winning streak will come to an end their first loss since December the 14th against their ble rival Kentucky Applause and this is by far the biggest win of the season for Georgia Tech and we talked about it in the open that this Georgia Tech Team theyve had some real some ease some uh some injuries they have not had some games where theyve been able to close out this is a huge win for the Georgia Tech program and David STM because they showed up today and they played and they took this game they took this game because Louisville they are still one of the better teams in the ACC and remember Georgia Tech is still trying to find a way to get into the top 15 to qualify for the ACC tournament and weve got about half a season left of tournament games little less in half this would be their fourth win missed two and thats going to do it so Georgia Tech stops Louisvilles 10 game win streak with a 7770 win here at the cish Pavilion what an unbelievable second half of play
