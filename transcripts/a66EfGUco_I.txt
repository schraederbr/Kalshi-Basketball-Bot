Davis to jump Center against James Scott one of the many new faces for Louisvilles first year head coach Pat Kelsey and boy do they have things working right now 125 overall 5 one in the AC tied for second place behind Duke pass from Starling intended for Davis goes out of bounds there you see the starting five Lucas Taylors been playing so well lately Eddie lamin as well and Elijah morch still trying to get himself back on track getting another start tonight for Syracuse and Doug is is well as Louisvilles perimeter guards are I think theyre lacking size and inside and Syracuse needs to look to attack inside with Eddie Lin early on who do you see is going to be the team with the rebounding Advantage both these teams are good at crashing the glass well both teams are averaging almost 39 rebounds the game so theyve both been good rebounding the basketball I think just being aggressive to the glass early on and we talked about both teams really need to limit each other to one shot per possession well see who does the best tonight Lucas Taylor has been hunting his shots lately off of his block shot misses at the other end this is Terrence Edwards Jr number five in black and keep your eye on The Marked Man for Louisville number six in Black he is one of two focal points for the Syracuse defense at all times we were watching practice yesterday at Syracuse and they had the basketball Ops got Guy Peter cordini with the number six jersey on running around and if he got the shot off it counted as a basket and there was a few times where he did get the shot off but Syracuse really has to keep an eye on Smith as hes one of the best Shooters not only in the ACC but in college basketball yeah hes one of three players who followed Pat Kelce from the College of Charleston to play his final year of college basketball in the ACC and he has been Dynamite L being a little loose with the ball able to recover and find Moore whose three rattles out Davis puts it back in and the orange on the board first Doug this is another matchup to watch you see Davis or Hadley guard and Davis I think with Freeman being out obviously Davis needs to step up and and do more offensively but really defensively he has more than Freeman has been given the ore so its going to be interesting to see how Davis plays tonight well Chucky heern makes his first shot attempt of the night he was a day one starter at Wisconsin started every game with the Badgers for 3 years thats the kind of Veteran experience this put together Louisville team has lampin on the reverse we talked about going into lampin early I think just putting pressure on Scott putting pressure on the basket even if youre not making or finishing the basket youre putting him in foul trouble situation and you know Syracuse needs that early on from Eddie lampin Edwards he can heat up in a hurry last years Sun Bel conference Player of the Year at James Madison its funny they shoot a high volume percent of Threes And theyre not shooting the highest percentage but they have the guys that arent afraid to take and make those tough shots and Edwards Jr is just another one of those guys Edwards gives it up Hadley guarded by Davis now on the switch hes matched up with lampin former teammates at Colorado thats right last year both double figures scores for the Buffalo and what a lineup they had three teammates who were drafted last year including two in the first round yeah unbelievable Im sure they got some pretty good stories about last season but right now its its all out the window theyre competing against each other theyre trying to get these win Cardinals five orange four Edwards spotting up long rebound to Moore leaves it for starling he is now 0 for three to start the ball game tonight one of the leading scores in the ACC at Just a Touch under 20 points per Music game Lin Taylor the extra pass more will try from the right side and again it rattles out and and just giving the ball to Eddie lampin early not only scoring the basketall well but he has a high IQ hes able to make good passes and you see right there good opportunity from Syracuse Mo just not able to knock it down heurn able to get the pass to James Scott and he converts sophomore from fville North Carolina makes it 74 coach Pat Kelce talked about how much he loves Scott and just his energy and his ability to move and do a lot of things on both ends of the floor hes still young hes still maturing hes still getting better he has a Pro Prospect on this new Eagle team in Scott Edwards was fouled and we finally have a whistle and our first media timeout early on you see Chucky heurn knocking it down doing what he does best and we talked about the orange going early and often to Eddie lampin Music Music at vac say hello to tonight Federal cred upgrade winners they going to make their the 107a e Music Music Music Music Music welcome back to the Dome the Cardinals with the early threepoint lead over the orange match up up a couple of the better rebounding teams in the ACC Louisville third in rebound margin Syracuse is fifth so far tonight theyre even six and six well both teams want to be able to give theirself extra possessions and you want to limit giving the other team possession so defensive rebounding offensive rebounding is key for both teams tonight whoevers aggressive on the glass giving their themselves more possessions just G to give their themselves more of a chance to win this game and as weve talked about already the styles of play are so different between these two teams Louisville wants to get up and down and control the tempo tonight theyll put up 30 plus threepoint shots while Syracuse would much prefer to slow it down and historically its funny doug because Syracuse is known as a transition team right getting up and down alyo dunks you know exciting plays but this season has been a more methodical half court and theyre just happy to have JJ Starling back to be able to give a guy the ball in the half court to go ahead and create and make a play yeah how would a younger Eric devendorf have handled coach beheim slowing you down no hes not slowing me down no he he gave me the keys he told me to go out there and do what you do and I think that was the the beauty of Coach beheim he really gave his guys Freedom just to go ahead and play and and be theirselves we are here alongside Jim beheim Court as his Alma moer is hosting Louis Noah Waterman into the game and the upstate New York product throws it down from Savannah New York about 45 minutes from here and just like that its a sevenpoint Cardinals lead look how about yesterday he said as a young kid he was up in section 308 way way up there watching watching Syracuse play one of his favorite players MCW whos whos now with us at the ACC Network its awesome seeing him get a chance to play out here on the on the floor yeah Michael Carter William was his favorite orange player when Noah was not 611 he was just a kid coming with family members his older brother Seth would bring him annually is like a Christmas gift wonderful lob and finish Javon Hadley on the receiving end for his first two points great job by Heburn right there just probing probing being patient until open up and Hadley on the receiving end of the lob Syracuse has to be able to communicate on those pick and rolls and just in general defensively on the offensive end what does Syracuse need to do to end this drought here dvo well they have to be aggressive they cant settle for shots like that they have to try to get into Eddie lampin or get the ball to their best player JJ Starling and attack the rim and there is 1994 Syracuse graduate Adrien red ay coach red in his second year his team now has a net ranking of 144 not where theyd like to be of course meanwhile Louisville with a net ranking of 36 so this a big opportunity for a quad one win for the orange Jer Davis he was shot ready and buries the three and hes capable at making that threepoint shot what I think cuse would like him to do is be the Punisher inside but if youre going to make that okay then you get another chance another opportunity but hes more an inside presence a guy who can really punish you inside only his third made three of the Season theres a rebound on the defensive glass for the native of new ark Delaware he sets the screen Chris Bell into the game has the ball poked away Bell coming off again a rough stretch but I would think when he takes this floor and sees Louisville as the opponent he would have good thoughts because last year he put 30 on the Cardinals Doug anytime you take the floor in the dome its a chance to be able to represent yourself in Syracuse it should be a great opportunity to go out there and just play basketball you shouldnt have to worry about who is playing playing against Chris Bell is one of the best Shooters in the country I think right now hes just you know mentally inside his head a little bit he just needs to get out of that funket just play basketball get back to enjoying the game keer no Davis another rebound and Louisville head coach Pat Kelsey told us yesterday in spite of the numbers they are going to be keeping track of Chris Bell on the perimeter here tonight lanin cant control the basketball finally gets it off to Bell attack and he was fouled Waterman met him at the rim and picks up the personal and Doug one thing to do when youre not shooting the ball is attack the rim Louisvilles been doing a good job of just being active defensively Chris Bell doing a great job attacking the rim strong an opportunity to knock down two free throws I noticed Waterman after contesting that shot and getting the foul is reaching for that right thumb of his had a surgical procedure done earlier the season hes got three pins placed in that right thumb and theyre going to stay for the rest of the season but he says he is okay we saw him with a dunk earlier where hes okay and yesterday during practice he was stroking the threepoint shot like theres no problem it shows you what type of kid he is I think it starts with Coach Kelsey he wants to recruit those type of guys tough hardned kids and Noah Watermans one of those guys his three pins in his thumb but he said coach Im ready put me out there Im ready to help this team and theres his head coach who put together an incredible roster with his staff brought his staff with him from the College of Charleston and they have 11 new faces this year no scholarship returning players on the roster and its really something how much experience four of those 11 were 1000 Point scores in their previous stops how hard is it in this landscape of college basketball with the turnover these Team every single year you have to re recruit your players and if youre going to get new players in you better get ones who have experience and you know having four th Point scores that doesnt sound too bad and there you see Chris Bell right there getting back on track thats what really what cuse needs JJ Starlet back but they need Chris Bell to get back shooting the basketball well Davis pokes it away Starling comes up with it orange on the run down by three lowow Peter movich is coming to the game for the orange and that foul goes against the orange itll be Louisville ball when we come back see Jer Davis a good kick out to Bell and he says Im back knocking down to three point for Syracuse Music F please welcome to the court your Syracuse University dance team Lo how see for your Syracuse University team Chris Bell Off the Bench giving the orange an early spark here tonight two things I think Chris Bell he once he hit shots early on he gets back into his Groove he finds his confidence last year you saw Judah minz getting him the ball early and this year I think with JJ out it it really affected him but now with JJ back he can kind of set back into that role and JJ really helps him getting the ball and getting his shot off but Syracuse needs Chris Bell to be able to make shots for them to continue to win games and step up and get on another level so now he was one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC last year at 42 down to 26 is there anything mechanical that you have seen is it physical is it mental whats your theory on why hes not shot it so well this year hes one of the best Shooters in the country if anything it its mental you just have to see the ball go through the hoop and when you see the ball go through the hoop you get your confidence back you know sometimes with Shooters you just get into Funk and then you start to you know force it a little bit I think for Chris Bell once he sees that ball going early you know his confidence just continues to grow and grow rain Smith still looking for his first points tonight movich gets tied up with a bubacar trior and and the possession arrow will keep it down at this end of the floor with Louisville another guy for Syracuse Pistol Pete they call him hes just a guy who really brings that energy and that effort and you need a guy like that on your team a guy whos going to do all the Dirty Work of blue Louisville on the Baseline out of bounds gets a great look for Smith off a screen from Scott he just couldnt connect coach Kelsey is one of the best coaches in the country after timeouts and out of bounds play Sidelines out of bounds play he has so many little intricacies that he can do off of them its its one set but he has a lot of different things that you do off that one set B gives it back to Movic Starling has it taken away trii gives to heurn Chucky gets it back little runner in the lane no kept alive and tip tone by James Scott hes every bit of 61 220 well if youre Syracuse you have to know where James Scott is hes excels at being on the offensive Blass and theres just an example of it right there and defensively if you Louisville regardless of him shooting 26 youve got to know where Chris Bell is Doug regardless of him shooting 26 he is still able to knock down that shot we talked about him being one of the best Shooters in the conference and hes hit a few early on you see that confidence continues to grow all right that was weve got a stoppage because the net at the other end got caught up on the rim thats great feeling for Chris Bell as a shooter when you get the net stuck up there number five but that was the 37th dunk of the year for James Scott tops in the ACC well heres Saturdays ACC Network basketball triple header Virginia Tech Hast Wake Forest in blackburg to start us off at 2 Eastern then Notre Dame in Syracuse here at the Dome squaring off at 400 and then finally Cal takes on NC State it should be another great afternoon and evening of Hoops here on the ACC Network Doug if Im Syracuse Im continuing to look for Chris Bell and thats not a good shot byell right there but you know hes hit two early threes you want to continue to look for him and see if he can continue that streak jquan Carlos into the game trying to defend heer good ball Movement by Louisville to find trior for his first two points trior hes a hes a Swiss army knife type of guy a guy who does a little bit everything on that floor I know Pat Kelsey loves tough guys hes another one of those tough guys who just brings a lot on both ends how tough off the bounce no lanin always drawing attention on the block out to Movic lanin again I got it I got it his shooting percentage at The Rim is not as good as you would expect for someone his size right Eric well well those are point blank shots you have to be able to finish those opportunities especially off the second chance youre not going to get a third and fourth chance when you get close to that Rim you have to be able to finish and you know Eddie lampin we talked about early on hes an advantage that Syracuse has and I think Louisville lacks a little bit of size inside but he has to be able to finish those bunnies at The Rim now with that said Eddies been playing very well lately hes been in double digit rebounds five of the last six games his energy seems to be infectous for the orange but he has to have that energy when hes not playing well you know you cant just have the energy when youre knocking down shots and things are going well you have to have that energy all throughout the game good and bad he grabs the heern miss lville dominant points in the paint so far tonight 144 Advantage a little bit of a different lineup with Peter out there on the perer he needs to get inside tough thought about it good close out by heurn cuff gets past him Rises up and scores Doug how about Kyle cuff youre coming off a a great second half versus Boston College really without him in that Boston College game they they dont win a guy who comes off the bench always ready always prepared super aggressive high energy guy trior two more the lead is back to six for Louisville yeah C hit a couple of Threes late in that BC game with out them Syracuse might not have gotten the win lanin cant get the roll tipped up and in my stovic will get credit but I think Scott might have been the one who knocked it in well were going to give that to Pistol Pete hes just bringing that energy and just from him being active around the rim good things usually happen Smith fouled on the three by Carlos and hes going to go to the line for a chance at a fourpoint play the number one thing a coach does not want you to do follow a threepoint shooter see James Scott right here the handoff and one of the best Shooters in the country knocking it down an opportunity for a fourpoint play for tonights lucky restaurant seat from mtio restaurant and bar is in section 124 looking for our craziest and certificate to e e Bunton Rudy hacket at 28 for the Orangemen and yes Jim beheim was on staff with Roys runs he was the top assistant under Roy Danforth who the following year would wind up succeeding Danforth so people think about Coach having been at five final fource hes been to six final fours Doug I wish they would have showed what Cody he had on in that game he always came with the stylish Sports Co didnt he he did thank God for Music Julie heurn best time to take a three off the off the offensive rebound kick out Chucky heper continues to get better offensively known as a defensive guy you see him pressing up but offensively he just continues to get better 15 and almost 5 and a half assists per game for Louisville hes been outstanding he was so good at the battle for Atlantis when you got a sense maybe Louisvilles turned the corner here he got the ACC player of the week award following that performance T knocks down another three and if cuff continues to hit shots like that hes just going to see more and more minutes but good job by Eddie l seeing the defense come and just kicking out to a wide open Kyle cuff and he does the Rest by knocking it down offensive Applause Music Applause foul that goes against Waterman he and uh Eddie lamin having a conversation walking back up Court thats okay A little friendly comp competition you know competing and he got a tech last game for doing that with uh with venning from from BC so I guess he has to be a little bit careful even though it wasnt a tech that he should have got well that was the second foul on Waterman he stays in the game as coach Kelsey has confidence in his 25yearold Center lamp tough shot 45 25 hes been around hes been around Edwards buries the corner three the Cardinals love to shoot him they have not been shooting as many as we expected through the first 13 minutes and change and that doesnt matter I mean how many sh shots they get or how many shots they miss theyre going to continue to take them theyre a supreme confident team Supreme confident group and you see right there with Edwards knocking it down great goes up strong inside pass by Eddie l i mean thats one of his best attributes is is passing the basketball and Davis is a guy we talked about who really needs to step up for syacuse especially with Freeman being out ninepoint Cardinals lead whistling a foul off the ball itll go against the Applause Music Cardinals R Smith he is the uh first guy in Louisville uniform since the 1950s to wear a single digit higher than five with the rules change you can now wear 67 89 and serin Smith wanted to wear the number six in his one year with the Cardinals the Aussie coming from across the world and they are glad to have him in Louisville averaging 13 and a half points per game their number one shooting threat on the perimeter but hes on the bench well guy got a chance to live in Melbourne Australia for eight months a wonderful place one of the best places in the world well J Davis says dvo dont discount my threepoint shooting you know what ever since I said that he continues to knock him down so Im going to keep saying it he two for two tonight from three Trey or went right at The Rim but missed the dunk good contest by Davis Edwards into the lane movich walls up Edward puts it up it rattles off the rim Davis continues to be active on the glass Starling still scoreless into the lane dump it off movich lets the defender go by and lays it in and how about M storage right there setting the solid screen JJ coming off being patient rolling to the basket finishing at The Rim my storage bringing that energy and effort that Syracuse needs Waterman had it poked away Louisville keeps shot clock at 17 heurn shovel pass to Headley it goes out of bounds off of Syracuse and now weve got a substitute coming in James Scott will come back and the folks here in the dome appreciate the effort theyve seen from the home team I think this is really what the fans have been waiting for just giving energy and effort yes we know youre going to turn the ball over youre going to miss shots but continue to compete and continue to give high energy thats what this crowd in Syracuse really wants to see well not only are these two of the most stored programs in college basketball history their fan bases are second and nine and their expectations are high every single year which is expected theyre a passionate a bunch and when things are going good its its good when things are going bad its going bad Applause Davis again poked it away and again its off of Syracuse Louisville will have 8 seconds on the timer Davis doing it at both ends hes got his first multi threepoint game in an orange uniform and doing it on the glass and doing it defensively as well if youre going to knock down two threes then you might as well shoot a third one and again I think hes more effective inside but he is more than capable as you can see knocking down the threepoint shot heurn comes in only thir 30 on the year but he has found the range from outside Doug throw out the percentages with these guys hes a basketball player you know sometimes youre going to miss shots youre going to make shots but hes going to continue to play through those shots hes just going to continue to be confident and continue to be aggressive and see him right there knocking down the corner three Taylor turns the Music corner cuff little strong Hadley will bring it up himself stepping into another three is Chucky heper well if hes making those he is pretty much unguardable we talked about the confidence of these Louisville guards doesnt matter if its 30 Chucky heurn is going to continue to shoot that ball knocking down his second straight three for Louisville up 10 throw another opportunity at various prizes from Del Music lay Super upow Hees Music Applause the second seconds Applause courtes us El e e and yesterday that growing up in Savannah New York about 45 minutes from here he and his siblings would come here to the Dome to watch the orange and his mom and his eight siblings are here in the building tonight and theres his older brother Seth who was the one who apparently orchestrated the trips to the Dome to root for the orange and sitting next to him is his mom Kim and she homeschooled all nine of the kids and the place where Noah pointed to yesterday like we sat up there section 308 309 that is where we always sat now some what 10 plus years later hes in a Louisville uniform on the floor here at the Dome how awesome is that for his family to be able to come down here and and watch him play and and have success I mean hes hes been one of Louisvilles guys so for him to be able to have his family come down I know it it means a lot to him now I have family from that same part of New York State and Wayne County and so when I went and met his mom Kim before the game today as JJ darling puts it on the deck still looking for his first point I told Kim I said my cousins the Benning boys would have gone to high school at CL Savannah with you back in the day and she without batting an eyelash said I used to cheat off your cousin Dan during French class how about that in all my time that Ive been in Syracuse I have never heard of Savannah Clyde so I appreciate that its Clyde Savannah Clyde Savannah see there you go rain Smith with his second made three of the ball game thats one guy that Syracuse cannot forget about they have to be able to stick on him one of the best Shooters largest lead of the night for Louisville on that 90 run Taylor and Starling have been held in check offensively for Syracuse Taylors got to go in and out Scott with another rebound for Louisville and those are the type of shots that Louisville wants Syracuse to shoot theyre offensively theyre stagnant theyre not moving their bodies theyre not moving the ball and usually those are the type of shots that youre going to end up with a rare Miss for heurn he leads all scores with 12 Starling averaging nearly 20 per game is yet to score Davis first Miss from distance for him tonight oh Doug right there you see JJ still doing a good job coming off the screen but when youre getting downhill you have Pistol Pete right there on the wing and hes not really the best threepoint shooter you not need to give a option for JJ to be have a shooter out on that Wing so he can kick it right there Im just going to call him Pistol Pete the whole game if thats okay with you he really does have a similarity to the 1978 Pistol Pete mirovich the hair the goatee heern dumps it off scott had it poked away able to get it from his back to Chucky and heern has 15 points all on threepoint shots and Doug 30 it doesnt even matter shoot the ball supreme confidence when you see the ball go in the confidence just continues to grow bad luck for Syracuse right there and I like the fact that Scott gets an assist while lying down yeah those are the hustle plays I mean those are the plays that you see right here Scott just diving on the ground it really should have been Davis diving on the ground and then it just ends up into Chucky headb burs hand and he knocked down to three those hustle plays usually get rewarded and right there Louisville got rewarded great hustle play by Scott Davis out and were also going to get our first look at former orange Center Frank Anum eBay and he just went by Frank Anum a couple of years he backed up Jesse Edwards for Syracuse and uh so he has played in this building many many times many times and I know Frank pretty well you know not only a a good player but you know a even better person and he he kind of fits the bill for this Louisville team hes mobile hes athletic he can move and thats what most of these serious lisal guys bring to the table Starling with five on the shot clock he is 0 for four on the night gives it up to Taylor who tried to draw the foul puts up an airball and here comes Louisville Hein though couldnt track down the outlet pass and itll go back to Syracuse with 55 seconds remaining in the half I mean Doug Louisville is just so active defensively theyre moving around theyre scrambling they got hands up on the shots and I mean thats what this team is known for defensively being active and versatility on the defensive side of the ball and its just causing have it for Syracuse right now again Louisvilles won six straight games the last four have been against North Carolina at Virginia home against Clemson then a huge win on Saturday at Pittsburgh they are really coming into their own here in mid January and making life tough on Syracuse the orange turn it over once again Syracuse theyve been struggling All Season turning over the ball and thats the last thing you want to be able to do vers Louisville is give them extra possessions Music Louis 30 second timeout well be back in just a moment here at the JMA Wireless down Music Music what an ACC Network womens basketball double header we have for you Thursday night Hannah hadalo maybe in number three Notre Dame host number 17 Georgia Tech at 6 Eastern then 16th ranked Duke host number 18 Cal and Cameron indor should be another great night of Hoops and I say maybe because Hannah hadalo as we see Felicia legat Jack the head coach for the women woms team here at Syracuse former star player for the orange women uh Hannah Hado who is the front runner for the wooden award in womens basketball she rolled a ankor last time out so not 100 sure whether the Irish will have her rain Smith they got a good look and now two orange Defenders collided and are down and it looks like Taylor got the worst of it holding that left hip and here heres my thing for Syracuse thats three times in a row that youve lost rain Smith you see right here you know just late you cant be late on the shot versus rayan Smith they just lucky that he missed it and you know hopefully Taylors okay but yeah he was up there thats a its a hard Landing but Syracuse has to locate and stay on rain smth because hes not going to miss too many of those open Music Applause shots you know both those guys when they recognized Smith was open Im sure heard the yelling of the coaches yesterday at practice saying dont lose number six yeah and they lost him three times in a row and theyre lucky that he missed the last two but going forward if they lose him hes going to knock those open ones Music down so Taylor will go to the bench Carlos has come in shot clock is off with under 20 seconds remaining here in the first half at the Dome you give the ball to JJ Starling right now and you you let him attack downhill get into the basket and create a play for somebody Syracuse has missed its last six shots Carlos being pounded by one of the best defensive players in the nation Chucky heer Movic lamin back out to Carlos with 1 second did he beat the buzzer they will review it and see if those two points will stay on the board for jquan Carlos they have the 12th best strength of schedule this year and by and large especially late they have passed every test jquan Carlos gets the start in the second half instead of Elijah Moore who only played a couple of minutes in the first half as a starter and we havent seen him since rain Smith for three its the fourth time Syracuse has lost rain Smith and we talked about in the first half Doug hes going to eventually knock those shots down you see him right there top of the key one of the best Shooters in the country doing what he does best he is third in the ACC in threepoint accuracy and third in the country in threepointers made this year now with 64 made threes including the three tonight well coming into this game dou 61 of his 61 of his field goal makes right all have been threes and hes made 73 so I think hes going to shoot the three no doubt and he is a Marked Man and in spite of that he continues to produce coming off a marvelous game in Saturdays big win at Pittsburgh when he made seven threepointers went for 25 points Starling trying to get going with his first two points its good time for Syracuse early on get JJ Starling the ball let him feel it let him get downhill and get opportunities at The Rim thats good to see Lucas Taylor back out onto the floor he picks up the foul that will send Chucky heer to the line youll remember Taylor took a hard fall when he and Starling collided back in the later stages of the first half there is the foul committed by Taylor and Taylor was down for a while but glad to see he is seemingly no worse for where as heern an 83 foul shooter makes the first and during halftime Taylor actually came out well before his teammates now that brace around his midsection he wears all the time but he was out taking those shots for what five six minutes just to I guess loosen up yeah I mean you hope hes okay and he seems to be okay out here hes moving well but you dont typically see that coming out before his teammates you 8 minutes before the time is of halftime but uh he looks to be moving okay Carlos hits the open three Doug if Carlos is going to be out here on the basketball court he has to be able to shoot the basketball and be a threat knocking it down great job by Carlos taking and making the three he had a big three late in the win at Boston College on Saturday orange with a takeaway Here Comes Taylor out there with Davis Starling Carlos and Eddie lampin Carlos great shot fake Smith got a piece but the orange keep coming Carlos with five points in a starting roll here in the second half you have to continue to play through the mistakes can continue to play through the Miss shots great job by sakus not giving it up and getting the bucket off the offensive rebound Smith draws attention had left wide open and he Nails the three Doug Hadleys a guy that we havent talked about a lot tonight but uh hes a guy that can really do everything offensively defensively he had 32 points against Clemson so hes capable of scoring the basketball but coach Pat Kelce really loves him hes just a guy who can guard anyone and as we talked about hes a guy who can really score the basketball you see him knocking down a threepoint shot threepoint shot by Starling a little strong yeah those 32 by Hadley whos got the basketball now against Clemson earlier this month were the most in an ACC game this season until some guy named Cooper flag dropped 42 on Notre Dame the other day yeah who yeah Cooper flag hes hard hes a hes an okay player guess think hell be okay in this sport here is Hadley lobs it toward the rim Scott missed the layup right now Louisville has a mismatch offensively with Hadley out there Carlos keeps the dribble he Bur averaging nearly three steals per game is all over Applause him Taylor off the spin he is still scoreless after having come on on quite a heater last four games averaging nearly 13 per night Bradley spins into a double team and weve got a foul call or knocked out of bounds Thursday at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will be in Southbend Indiana at the University of Notre Dame to break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend weve got you covered all season right here on acc Network and the ESPN app no Waterman back into the game for Louisville hands it back to heurn heres Smith Carlos does a good job of staying attached good defense right there by Syracuse the mov do such a great job of continually moving without the ball giving their more opportunities to get open looks heurn doing it down low I tell you what Doug he he he doesnt have a a huge physical presence but hes a strong guard the biggest thing about heper is hes just super aggressive you know he hes looking to attack down hill to get into your body and that just creates easy opportunities for him you know at the rim and right there hitting a tough fadeaway jump shot yeah hes among the ACC leaders in a number of statistical categories scoring assist steals Carloss pass intended for movich goes out of bounds but hes just been terrific this year Pat Kelce has himself a good one one of 11 on the UFL roster whose teams reached last years NCAA tournament these cards are pretty good Music Li the official hardwood floor provider ofuse basketball basketball were going to go to the for the dun score Music contest duck us your first Applause Applause shotor e Music uh I I use this saying a lot because coach proster skip proster used say it all the time the seasons a lifetime uh so many things happen from the start to the end he always used to say babies are born people die theres ups theres Downs theres Goods theres bads I always say that Pat ksey the first year head coach at Louisville played three years as a backup point guard at his hometown Xavier University for skip proster who then hired a young Pat Kelsey in 2001 at Wake Forest where he spent eight years first six under skip the last two under Dino gudo and we asked coach Kelsey yesterday do you hear the words of your Mentor coming out of your mouth and he just laughed and started rattling off those things that he has beaten into his brain from what skip used to say and and his players and his staff back that up Edwards able to score inside he immediately turned to one of his assistant coaches who said oh yeah and rattled off a few more of the skit prer words of wisdom that are still around Doug usually thats how it is the coaches that coach you youre taking a lot of their philosophies and a lot of their words into your coaching philosophy hes learned from some of the greats and hes going to be one of the greats himself I I cant say enough about Pat Kelsey you know Ive watched numerous practices and his energy and his commitment and his purpose and his plan is just so on point I mean hes one of the best coaches in the country for a reason Pat Kel hes going to continue to build the culture at this Louisville program and theyre obviously back on the map already well they have uh in the Louisville notes that he is a program Builder a proven program Builder Chris Bell from the short Corner 42 and uh it is proven I mean Kelsey has done it at two stops last three years College of Charleston took him to a pair of NCA tournaments and he was the ca coach of the year last year before that he spent nine years as head coach at winr and four times was the Big South Conference coach of the year and hes off to a flying start in year number one at Louisville in coaching at at those conferences which be considered midlevel right the skill level isnt as high as it would be at Louisville so hes probably ecstatic to be able to be at Louisville and have this type of skill level because everywhere he goes hes going to get his guys to play hard to compete and now having this talent that He has at Louisville and and theyre playing hard at a high level sky is the limit for this program Bell second straight midrange shot Doug they need to have Chris Bell out on the basketball floor if they want to win basketball games hes just another guy besides JJ staring that can make shots Waterman is playing through three fouls right now misses on the drive yeah Bell now has 10 points after his back to back buckets now from his favorite spot on the floor left the three ball short if Im Chris Bell Im going continue to shoot the ball make or miss you got to continue to be aggressive in play basketball trior now with a half a dozen 5738 Louisville Doug trior is a guy whos just coming back off a broken arm yeah missed a bunch of time in November and December with that injury you know he only played three years at Long Beach State but he is among their programs alltime leaders in a number of categories he is an impact player for Louisville well Swiss army knife type of guy a guy who could score rebound and make plays for others and JJ he he just has to get downhill and be aggressive especially if you have Waterman on you a bigger guy you have to continue to be aggressive it doesnt matter if you havent scored a lot or if you havent got a lot of attempts for Syracuse to be able to win basketball games JJ Starling has to be aggressive to the rip and so Waterman will take a seat with his fourth foul mentioned in the first half hes 25 years old this is his fourth College stop which in this day and age is really not all that unusual he started his journey out of Savannah New York at Niagara University in the purple eagal did play a game here in this building when he was a freshman but he was hurt then so this is his first time as a local kid playing in this building and then Waterman played two years at Detroit Mercy kept moving up a couple of notches then moves to BYU the last two years put up really good numbers last year and he gets another opportunity in this extra Co year to go to Louisville well he fits what the the big man does now in todays game he hes a guy who can stretch the floor hes he can put it on the deck a little bit but you know what he brings to this team is really being able to shoot the basketball heern gets it back from Scott Hadley left alone two Defenders left him and that led to Scott laying it in and Syracuse is just lost right now defensively no communication theyre leaving Guys open Hadley just wide open and just making a good pass to Scott who finishes at The Rim well Syracuse has been drilled twice this year by Tennessee and Maryland theyve been competitive in most of their losses but uh coach Autreys team is seeing this one slip away against the bille well well heres my thing offensively for Syracuse you just saw right there on that possession J J Starling just running around nobodys hitting anybody on screens no ones giving him opportunity to get open and have an advantage as he comes off scott to heurn being chased by Starling off the hesitation keeps the dribble driving dish Hadley back to the basket with seven to shoot Davis reaches in and is going to be called for the foul and despite what the Syracuse fan base thinks about that foul Louisvilles guards just put so much pressure on you on the defensive side of the ball that youre almost forced to follow Music it points off turnover continue to favor Louisville theyve got a 10 five Edge in that department tonight Hadley again trying to muscle his way up and over Davis successful that time seven points for the fifth year senior from St Paul Minnesota Doug I really like Hadley he he hes a guy who can really do a lot on the floor hes versatile hes a big body he can guard bigs but he also can guard guards and you see his capabilities on the offensive side of the ball lamin soft touch near the Applause rim heern Rises up little Fade Away jumper nothing but net hes got the whole game working tonight now 21 points to lead all scores well hes just getting to his spots hes getting to his spots on the court where he can be effective and he can get opportunities at the rim and another opportunity in the paint and knocking down a tough shot pick and roll lamin gets back to the right hand and finishes Syracuse they can do that all night but they have to do it on the other side of the ball you see right now giving up another open three to heer Applause Carlos hesitation right around the defender and lays it in the Freshman unable to stay with him Kai Roots gives up the layup to Carlos and that delivers a timeout from Pat Kelce Louisville in control up by 17 on the road looking for their seven straight win as please welcome to court University Dan Applause Music Applause no Applause Applause Music Pizza Pizza Applause your Music Music when Chucky heurn gets rolling look out he put 32 on West Virginia back in November and hes on a heater again here tonight in Syracuse hes one of the best guards in the ACC for a reason hes just being aggressive he hes not being complicated about anything hes being aggressive hes getting to his spots and once you get to your spot you give yourself an opportunity to get a good look and hes got a lot of them and not only has he got a lot of good looks hes knocked him down hes having a great night tonight hes one of four on the roster Pat Kelce brought in from elsewhere who were already 1000 Point scorers in their careers Edward Smith and trior so even though this is a team just put together in the spring and summer theyve got a lot of guys who played a lot of winning basketball and they have meshed very well especially as weve gotten into the new year and Doug you got to credit coach Kel because bringing guys in that are thousand Point scores theyre used to having the ball in their hand and so for him to be able to put those have there put those egos to the side and play together and really mesh says a lot about what coach Kelce is really doing coach Kels team in control looking for their 13th win of the year we e e e Music for ACC mens basketball is presented by T roll price invest with confidence Chucky hurn certainly playing with confidence tonight here in inside the JMA Wireless Dome as he and the Louisville Cardinals have been handling red As Syracuse Orange to the tune of a 6346 score the orange have cut what was a 21o deficit back to seven or 17 and that has drawn the timeout from Pat Kelce but we were talking about before the break what he has put together and nationally theyre taking notice jool lardy has this Louisville team right now as a seven seed and the 28th overall team in his projected field of 68 and doing it with two of their top players out for the season K prior and and Johnson two of the top scorers that they would have thought coming into the season Anum eBay fouled by movich and so the former Syracuse Center will head to the free throw line again Louisville just being aggressive in the paint see Frank he wants to get back at his former team a little bit just being aggressive at the rim and thats what he does hes hes super athletic attacking the rim a chance to make two you know he did have some big moments in a Syracuse uniform nine points 15 rebounds and four assists in the 2022 ACC tournament against Florida State when he was filling in for Jesse Edwards also had four huge overtime free throws in the win over Indiana here at the dome in the old ACC Big 10 challenge so uh when he was known as Frank Anum he did have some moments well hes capable I mean he hes a guy who he has really good movement you know he he can guard he can move and block shots and then hes just playing his role finish around the rim and be active defensively out of bounds zuse will keep theyll have eight to shoot right on Q I appreciate you Frank well he was happy to see you when he got back to the Dome yesterday for practice I got to know Frank just from being at Syracuse and when he played on the team just a great guy he I mean he always has a positive attitude and even right here you see hes not getting a whole bunch of time for Louisville but always good energy always positive energy a great teammate and you want to have those guys on your team he spent the last two years at the University of Georgia after having left Syracuse cuff lost it Syracuse will keep with only 26 now on the timeout Doug he hes Franks hurt us right now I mean those last two possessions hes just being active his hands are are in there hes guarding on the pick and roll I mean thats what hes able to bring when hes out on the floor Applause C and here is Chucky heurn the senior from Omaha where he was a high school teammate and shot rejected by Eddie lanin he was a teammate of Wake Forest all ACC guard Hunter Salis good anticipation right there by Lampkin but Louisvilles just getting into the pain at will whenever they want I mean if they continue to get in there theyre going to get good opportunities at the rim and theyre going to take advantage of it thats been part of the formula all year why Syracuse is giving up the most points per game in the conference Edwards guarded by Bell uses the screen from anelay rising up like you said into the paint anytime they want well right there Edward did a good job of just keeping Bell on his hit but then lampin has to stay until Bell gets back in front you just gave him a wide open opportunity at the rim and those guys are going to make those cuff to lamin hes got two teammates over in that corner not sure who he intended it for Davis and Bell starling and its rain Smith with the rebound and thats how its been the whole game for Syracuse no movement offensively ended up taking a tough shot and youre not going to win basketball game playing like that Nel am with a pass to his coach I mean Pat Kelce was open Pat was a player back in his day for Xavier so he he was a tough guard himself he was a starting point guard for the Wyoming Cowboys as a freshman and then a backup point guard for three years at Xavier hes in great shape he looks like he could still go he looks like nice little nice little hop right there in the catch and Coach just has that uh unlimited energy he he reminds me of one of my former coaches at Syracuse Mike Hopkins who every time you see it didnt matter if it was four in the morning going into workouts he he looked like hes been up all night well in his hometown of Cincinnati Pat Kelce was a really good point guard at a couple of high schools Roger Bacon an elder and the now 49yearold looks like he can still play Cincinnati is one of those cities where tough hardnosed guy you know hes going to go out there and compete doesnt matter the skill level hes going to go out there and give everything he has Edwards Nails the three and Louisville just keeps pouring it on 70 46 the cards in front and another timeout from the orange bench Applause Chucky doing a good job just kicking and again throw out the percentages hes only a 26 threepoint shooter but hes knocking it down got to Music check for the award be number Z Kyle Music acpm with Mark Packer weekdays at 4 Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN with Eric dorf Im Doug Sherman back inside the JMA Wireless Dome here in Syracuse the orange down 7046 Louisville making another statement that they are here to stay in the ACC Chase they came into play today tied for second behind only Duke and if you look at it now middle of January Duke seems to be Head and Shoulders above everybody else in the league and then theres a scramble theres a a bunched up from like two to five and Louisvilles very much in that mix they might be the second best team right now in the league well tonight they look like the second best team theyre shooting 51 from the field 50 from three 100 from the free throw line and the really only blemish is those eight turnovers that they have and Im sure theyll hear about it from Pat Kelce tomorrow in film second foul on cuff the illegal screen another turnover against the orange well the win Saturday at Pittsburgh to me really caught my attention theyve had other good wins but if you go into the peak when they were packed the Oakland Zoo was rocking on Saturday and Louisville didnt seem to be phased at all and Doug if anyone knows I know what its like playing in the Oakland Zoo I remember going off going in early to shoot and the whole crowd was chanting my name just just giving me a whole bunch of stuff and I I mean thats one of the better Arenas in college basketball to play in Chris Bell rattles in a three well if we want to take any positives from Syracuse its that Chris Bell has been shooting the ball well tonight its not much we can really say positive but Bell making shots is is something positive for Syracuse now coming into the game Louisville was 5 and one in the ACC along with clemon Wake Forest in North Carolina both four and one Edwards with another two points hes putting together a big second half and how tough was that Edwards just probing keep keeping Bell on his backside and then when he sees the opening finishing with the inside hand on the left side he lose guards or something else and on Q Pat Kelce even with the big lead slams his right foot against the floor because again they lost track of Syracuses best perimeter shooter well thats why hes one of the best coaches in the country is because hes going to continue to coach if theyre up 20 or if theyre down 20 Lin clears the Miss from Edwards taken right back by Louisville Smith around and out those are the types of Threes hes been making this year though he does not need his feet set he doesnt need to be on balance they go in well Ive watched it on film and hes hitting him coming straight down in transition running full speed catching and shooting the ball and you see right right there most coaches will say hey thats a bad shot but not for Ry Smith hes knocking that down off the takeaway to the rim Scott goes down hard right it was a pass that was too short and made Scott adjust in midair and then left him vulnerable good to see back up see right there the lob and I dont think it was anything intentional cuff isnt that type of guy but James Scott took it the other way those plays are going to happen when youre Music competing but the officials will review it honestly Doug if Im Syracuse Im really not saying too much at all after any basket right now with you see right here Scott going up and cuff just I I dont think it was anything intentional he he just landed hard same kind of Landing that Taylor had in the first half Scott pop right up but again guys are competing at a high level and these type of plays are going to happen yeah I think cuff anticipated that the ball was going to be passed closer to the rim and was defended as such and he almost came in like it looked like he tried to wrap him up a little bit so the fall wouldnt be as bad but we shall see what Jeffrey Clark Matt Potter and Tony chazza come up with after further review flagrant One Two Shots ball at the spot of the foul well there you go they come up with a flagrant one it is the third foul on cuff and so the Cardinals will send James Scott to the Music line so we just heard from the official who said the uh the ball player Scott was in a vulnerable position and that was what led to being a flagrant foul and yeah it could have went either way but it it makes sense he was up in the air and you know C he had the contact while he was in the air so it makes Applause sense Scott makes a pair thats from a 40 foul shooter and now Louisville will keep possession and its funny you said hes 40 we were talking to coach Kelsey yesterday at practice and we were talking specifically about James Scott and he he said in practice he doesnt have trouble will knocking down all of his free throws right but in the game its definitely its a different atmosphere its a different feel but right there Scott knocking him down heern now watching tape you have just marveled the last few days about how good Louisville is on their out of bounds plays and and we talked about Coach Kelsey again he specializes in after timeout plays out of bounds plays sideline plays and you see right there but my thing is for S how do you forget about the best player on Louisville team a guy whos already hit five threes before that number six and you notice that out of what looks like the same out of bounds play they have a ton of different wrinkles so its the same set but they its almost like they have uh if you take this play away theyre going to slip if you take this way play they got a flare screen if you take away the flare they got another its so many options off of that one set and thats what makes Kel such a good coach hes given his players a whole bunch of different options when you take away one I have another for you were going to count that Chris Bell makes the front end Coach Kelsey said something else that I found interesting uh yesterday he said he doesnt ever know the names or use the names of the opponents he only uses their uniform numbers thought that was interesting and a lot of times coaches dont know the names and just refer to them by number but I dont think its purposeful as opposed to coach kelse really doesnt want to use the other teams names yeah I I did the Tennessee game earlier in the season and when he he started doing that I was like to you mean JJ Starling you know just its different but I like it hes a competitive Music guy well here is Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header Virginia Tech host Wake Forest in blackburg to start us off at 200 Eastern and then Notre Dame in Syracuse square off at 4 and finally Cal takes on North Carolina State should be another great afternoon and evening of ho on the ACC Network all right so I havent asked you after Duke assuming Duke is the best team in the league right now youve been around and seen most of the teams who do you think is the second best team in the ACC well right now it looks like Louisville is I I mean they theyve beat the formerly second team which was Pittsburgh and they beat Clemson which was high up I mean I mean Louisville is proven and they beat Carolina and they beat Carolina on and on the road you know Louisville is proven tonight and in previous games that they are the second best team in this ACC conference but Doug we talked about Duke theyre theyre just head and shoulders Above the Rest right now but thats not to say that Louisville when they play Duke wont compete and wont give him a test well Louisville is receiving votes not far from getting back into the AP Top 25 while Duke is the only conference member ranked moved up a spot to number three this week Louisville Clemson Wake and Carolina all one lost teams another two points for Javon Hadley Hadley hes just so versatile if you put a smaller guard on him hes just going to do back you down like he did there if you put a bigger guy on him hes going to take you off the dribble adds tremendous value to this Louis vtin lampin gets it over the rim for two more and even the score right there with with lampin I mean Hadley under siid hes battling right there hes B hes bodying up and it just shows you what type of player he is and how competitive he is yeah Hadleys giv up 50 lbs in that matchup uses the left hand to finesse it around my stovich Doug its 81 56 but Louisville guards are acting like its zero zero theyre theyre continually getting downhill being aggressive getting opportunities at the rim and theyve got great length all over the floor heern is the only guy under 66 along with rain Smith and their seems like everybody else is 66 or above chance for three for Edy lampin Syracuse should have been doing this in the first half getting the ball and early to lampin its a little bit late now but Eddie doing a good job of continuing to play and continue to give effort grad transfer from Houston played a Morton Ranch High School back in the day completes that threepoint play and its been a long night for JJ Starling and his orange teammates the Junior from Baldwinsville didnt have a point in the first half hes got just four points on one of seven shooting here tonight Louisville did a good job of keeping it in front and when he got by they had bodies right there for him in the paint and just making it tough at the rim for him and its its been a long night for JJ if if he has these type of nights its going to be a long rest of the season for Syracuse Orange Smith gets it into heern being chased by Applause cuff trior along the Baseline to find an open teammate in the corner long rebound goes off the foot of heurn back to Syracuse Doug I think a big thing right now for Syracuse is you know being down this much you want to continue to coach the guys you want to continue to get effort from these guys and anyone who can step up you know in in this next game going forward who can you know add value on the team cuz no one spot is solid right now through to form Louisville has continued to shoot the free ball 12 of 26 so far tonight that 12 match is the most given up by the orange this season all Cardinals tonight here in central New York 8159 Louisville Music Music not Music Music Music Music Music w back Applause Applause we Applause Terrence Edwards just one of five Louisville players in double figures tonight how about these Louisville guards you cant say enough about the guards the aggressiveness and Edwards this is another guy 16 points three rebounds not known as a shooter but hes knocked down two of them another one of those guys who just plays with Supreme confidence great job controlling his body finishing at The Rim Edwards has been playing exceptional T night for louiso all five starters Eric in double figures Chucky heurn leads the way 24 points seven assists 16 points for Edwards Scott has 10 points 11 points nine rebounds for Javon Hadley and Rain Smith has been held in relative check hes got 10 points this is a deep and versatile lineup they also have a double figure scorer who you mentioned a couple of times whos out for the season case prior or else theyd be even more loaded yeah and I think with the injuries that Louisvilles had its you know able guys guys were able to step up and really take a larger role talk about James Scott you know doing more offensively but I mean these guards of Louisville I mean they are some of the best guards in the country and they are tough to guard when you have four guards out there on the court that can all score 20 or more I mean thats tough right there Hadley up and over my stovic for two hes got 13 points 13 points seven assists I mean all these guys can do multiple things offensively they could pass the ball they could shoot the ball they could drive the ball when you have four guards who could do that I mean pick your Applause poison numbers of James Scott hurries Bell able to get back heurn pulls the trigger from deep Long rebound Applause saved they say Hadley reestablished his feet before taking that pass so Louisville keeps with 23 seven to go and regardless if he did or not theyre continuing to play I mean theyre up this amount of points and then theyre continuing to play theyre continuing to give themselves Second Chance opportunities and thats why Louisville is on the six game winning streak going going to be Music Applause Music seven Carlos I got I got it trior clears the glass Louisville looking at a six and one start to AC play who would have thought after what this program has been through the last few years especially the last couple that they would be in this position as we head towards late January and I mentioned doing the the game earlier when they played Tennessee and it was a big loss Tennessee overwhelmed them defensively and you could you know you could hear it from the fans its similar to the Syracuse fan base they expect Big Time wins they expect you know to do well and that didnt affect Coach Pat Kelce he he continued to coach his team up and and now theyre in a very good position standing second in the ACC Hadley dribbles it back out hes got a double double 13 points 10 rebounds this substitution is he called timeout to get some reserves into the game what an ACC Network womens basketball double header we have for you Thursday night number three Notre Dame hosting number 17 Georgia Tech beginning at 6 Eastern and then 16th ranked Duke will host number 18 Cal at Cameron Indoor Stadium another terrific night of Hoops here on the ACC Network and Patrick Antonelli has come into the game he is the son of our colleague Debbie Antonelli he had a really good run for four years at division 2 Emery and Henry but now Patrick with an opportunity to play in the dome for a minute and a half Bob there you go now his mom has had five Louisville games as their analyst on the ESPN networks this year and I had multiple people within the traveling party from Louisville say you know were 5 and0 with de Antonelli on the call they pay attention to such things as nahim McLoud is filed on his way to the bucket I thought it was really nice what Patrick put into his bio that he is most proud of his brother Frankie and Frankie is an inspirational person to a lot of folks his family has raised all sorts of money for charity on behalf of Frankies mom still can shoot it former North Carolina State standout and so she uh has a marathon shooting free throws at their house every year Well Debbies a he a hall of of Fame player a Hall of Fame broadcaster but a Hall of Fame person you know all the stuff that she does off the court you know it just

which announcers are on which game and lets see now as they go deeper into the bench Louisville will have three more of their reserves coming in Cole Sherman no relation will come in Spencer leg and the only hold over from last years roster Aiden MC so now you were a scholarship player thousand points score if you were still on the floor in a game like this when the WalkOns came in wouldnt you feed and defer to the WalkOns here well I probably wouldnt have been on the floor no but use your imagination yeah I I Im definitely trying to get one of these guys opportunity and if Im not in the game Im cheering hard as heck just like they cheer hard as heck for me every single game and you know all the stuff that they do in practice to get those guys prepared for the game they deserve this opportunity to be able to get on the field no doubt know by the way Antonelli and mol were high school teammates in the Charleston area at Bishop England High School Elijah Moore back into the game he started played just a couple of minutes and this is the first weve seen him since my stovich no wo and McLoud knocked it off of Anum eBay and so the orange will keep it with 20 on the shot Music clock McLoud throws it down the tallest player in Syracuse history makes it 8561 the Doug for Syracuse its a quick turnar around Saturday playing Notre Dame they have to be able to forget about this one watch the film and get ready for Notre Dame Im not sure why Patrick Antonelli isnt firing the shot come on get it up there Im Im getting one up Doug Im getting one up not if you dont want coach Kelsey after you and impressive performance another great Road Show by the Cardinals
