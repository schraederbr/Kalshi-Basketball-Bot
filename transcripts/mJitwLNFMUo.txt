two threes in their five losses and then transition defense they need to get back and get in front of fdu and then third attack the paint they have the size Advantage they need to go inside and look to vening early speaking of venning Chad venning wins the opening tap as Boston College wraps up the nonconference Slate here today against fair Le Dickinson theyve already played a couple of ACC games lost them both against Wake Forest and SMU heres vening gets inside and scores and Drew we talked about it right right away with the keys they need to go inside early defending they need to impose their will and start off the game attacking you look at the average height for fdu theyre outside the top 300 in the country on kenpom but you watched the tournament a couple years ago and they knocked off the one seed Perdue they didnt have the size advantage in that matchup either so they can win even if theyre smaller here is Terence Brown the kick to Joel Emanuel better than 40 from Deep on the year and thats a three coach Curry talked about Brown being an elite scorer but he needs to improve in his decision making and his playmaking ability you see right there him hitting the manual and Manu probably the second best player on this team in an improv threepoint shooter knocking it down and he is a super athlete had a double double at Minnesota and F use last time out it was a loss to the goer 7460 in Minneapolis but they LED that game at Halftime heres their top scorer Donald hand Jr Rises and scores we talked about DJ and thats what they call him here DJ hes a threepoint shooter but hes much improved at putting it on the deck getting to the rim and finishing you see right there finishing through the contact with a tough Applause finish Emanuel will try another one that one comes up short and Bing as he can and probably should in this matchup dominating the glass at 69270 this is Joshua Beetle the Clemson transfer tried to hook the pass to Def and its taken away Manuel is a high flyer great high jumper in high school in New York also a volleyball player has passed spattered away by vny and Drew we were talking to coach Grant yesterday at practice he was talking about the point guard position whos really going to step up at that position I think Beetle he you know he has it him to step up and be that leader and be that playmaker you see right there with the turnover but he has to continue to be aggressive and continue to look to make plays you got to look at Earl Grant year four at the of this Boston College program couple of nice postseason runs well try to get over that hump heres Dylan Jones the transfer from snow Community College in his home state of Utah he gives fdu the lead known as a threepoint shooter you see him putting on the floor right there a little bit improved putting it on the deck put him in a spin cycle and hitting a tough midrange jumper hes the top threepoint shooter in the Northeast conference part of an fdu team that can really fill it up almost forced another turnover Elijah strong the pump and go Deon Brown the kick H the three thats good Applause J theres Brown missed it from in tight the top scorer in the league and one of the top in the country Applause and welcome inside KY Forum here in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts Drew Carter and Eric dandorf thrilled to be with you for the nonconference finale for Boston College and Donald Han has his fingerprints all over this game with seven points Donald H junor doing what we talked about in the beginning attacking the paint playing off of two feet and finishing strong at The Rim Terence Brown leading scorer in the Northeast conference for this fairly Dickinson team starts out 0 for two got to find 13 here You think for Boston College venning backing down draws two Fade Away jumper smooth and Boston College will take it but I dont think they want to see a lot of those fade away from the rim from vening they want him to be aggressive strong and impose his will going towards the basket yeah 270 hes the biggest guy on the floor Eagles at seven and five overall 0 and2 in conference play its their last out of League game of the year Deion Brown the UNBC transfer gives it up to beetle with half the shot clock on more than four minutes into this game Austin College 11 to five strong Applause travel that takes us to our

eagles with 20 points and rebounds Eagles last outing against SMU turn the TV off turn TV off turn off turn T off e B best friends from division 2 Jefferson and Barbara Bay he he did a great job of singing as well hes multitalented but a guy that really sticks out to me out of those three is is Dylan Jones one of the best Shooters in the Northeast conference hitting three from 43 uh a clip and hes a guy that really needs to step up hit shots but also you seen in the beginning him being able to put it on the ground averaging 12 and 12 points per game hes going to be a key not only in this game but going forward for fdu they need to get Terence Brown going an 0 for three start for the top score in the Northeast conference he was just four of 22 against Minnesota and Donald Han keeps stroking it time out fairly Dickinson the Eagles have made six shots in a row to start this game Music Applause Donald Han a little bit of in and out and step back three hes been starting off aggressive knocking down to threepoint shot Music I dont know what Donalds middle name is but it should be hot Donald hotand Jr he is the leading scorer today with 10 points already he is doubling up fairly Dickson by himself 10 to5 in the score 14 to five as Boston College still hasnt missed a shot 6 for six dude theyre just starting off by being aggressive attacking the rim and when you attack the rim put the pressure on the defense that opens up the threepoint shot as you saw last possession hand Junior knocking it Applause Music down B Mariah one of those transfers from Jefferson finds Dylan Jones threes Off the Mark Brown the offensive rebound but lost it at 6 three he skyed to get it but BC turned him over fdu has to find a way in the half court to get their Shooters open you see Dylan Jones with the open shot right there just not knocking it down but they have to be able to take those open opportunities yeah Dylan Jones hes the guy to watch for for Jack castleberrys team from the perimeter were in number 20 in that burgundy in blue you mentioned it the top threepoint shooter in the north east conference the Drew with so much attention on Brown and rightfully so is one of the nations top scores but whos going to be these other guys thats going to step up for fdu and and help him in the half court is it going to be Barbara Bay is it going to be Jones are they going to have bismar step up and and get some points and some rebounds they need somebody else to help Brown making sure the clocks are all in order we got a loaded official crew today Roger AES Eric Lewis who spent 19 years in the NBA and Jeffrey Clark these are dudes who you recognize all of them if you watch a lot of Hoops that guy ride ham thought he was foul offensive rebound to Brown missed the layup rebound again McFarland no and its plucked out of the air by Joel Emanuel you see right there BC just using her size Advantage speaking of Deion Brown he hes a guy for me he was the xor for Boston College he averaged 20 points last season obviously slow start to this season but hes the guy that the Boston College staff is really looking to be a second scorer to h junor and a transfer from UNBC got a foul on the floor against Boston College its on Han e f number 13 his first person team first Applause second BR Payne checks in for Austin College yeah Drew Fred Payne another guy who brings energy and effort off of the bench and hes a guy whos going to get right up in you on the defensive side of the ball and offensively hes looking to attack heres brayen Reynolds one of three guys whos still at fdu from the team that beat Purdue a couple years ago three is on the way its no good for JAL Morris and here comes Roger McFarland South Eastern Louisiana transfer Chaz Kelly thei told me before the game hes feeling great he had been a little under the weather he spent 12 hours in bed yesterday and hes ready to go today tell you what Boston College has a lot of capable guards who can shoot and score the basketball and attack the basket and make plays they just need to be able to step up foul on the rebound is against Boston College and Jen Hastings first team is Applause second see a little bit of pressure from from BC right now the Press is really the specialty of Fairly Dickinson I mean they they press a lot crank up the tempo but BC applying some pressure today really just BC just trying to give them less time once they cross half court to you know get into their sets and make a play Music Applause Warren it up to Tyree Bara Bay now its Morris as picks him up Morris gets in the lane has to fire cant hit it off glass rebound to McFarland you know dvo both these teams coming back from their winner break both playing for the first time in a week how challenging is it to get back into game mindset oh I mean when I was playing I couldnt wait to get back to campus I mean I just love to play basketball I think its the same thing for these guys they cant wait to get back on the court and play and compete and I dont think its its that much of a difference if you have a week off you know these guys were in the gym they were working out whether they went home or whatever it may be theyre making sure their condition and their shape is you know staying on top of it Warren missed the three the big man offensive rebound to Applause Reynolds midrange jump shot Falls Hara Bay and thats another way that fdu is going to be able to score the basketball getting it off the offensive rebound is the best time to get those threepoint opportunities you see a good extra pass right there Barb Bay with the pump fake and hit a tough jump shot hand and one Donald Han with a Chance of three when we return and we want to take a moment to recognize the loss of a sports broadcasting Legend Greg Gumble a career spanning multiple networks more than 50 years including the March Madness selection show this guy exemplified what a broadcaster should be hell be

Christmas break Drew and get out here on the basketball court hes been starting by attacking to the rim playing off at two feet then You seen him getting into his bag step back hitting the three hes feeling really really good right now and he gets an early rest welld deserved sits down with 13 Applause points Boston College by 10 if youre wondering the season high for a Boston College player in a first half is 15 by Elijah strong versus Temple hand is already two away from that not even at the Midway Point Brown the shovel free from Bara Bay is good and hes got five quick ones and thats what has to happen for fdu other guys have to step up and make shots BC doing a good job Walling up and making brown SE jerseys everywhere he goes great job by Barbara Bay stepping up and knocking it down theres the pressure and a timeout by Earl Grant and Boston College thats the trademark for Fairley Dickinson applying the heat in the back court trying to knock off a giant forcing a timeout early by BC Music Applause let me let me see real quick hey starting this week we have four consecutive Sundays with womens basketball quadruple headers right here on acc Network first lineup has Hannah Hidalgo and number three Notre Dame hosting Virginia at noon Eastern that its Louisville Boston College followed by number 17 North Carolina in Miami and the day is capped off by number 22 NC State hosting Clemson Drew Carter and Eric dandorf back with you here at KY Forum in chess Nut Hill Boston College with a sevenpoint lead over fairly Dickinson and the way the knights can hang around in this game by pressing in the back court and trapping in the half cour and Boston College already down to six to shoot as Kelly gets fouled F fou number two BR Drew thats what theyre going to have to do we talked about them being able to make the threepoint shots theyre going to have to make threepoint shots but theyre also going to have to muck it up a little bit theyre going to have to trap in the half court full court press just give BC different looks different pressures and hopefully thatll force them to make bad decisions and Jack hasur says look we dont press as much as we used to but we still do it a lot defensive rebound for bismar nasiah br St from the Bronx heres Terence Brown hes got two assists already Messiah gets in the paint finds Bara Bay already hit a three Kelly defends him well BC doing a good job of getting back in transition transition defense one of the keys for Boston C and there you see Barbara Bay knocking down another three hes a guy thats more than capable ass a straight line driver but right now hes knocking it down for outside his second threepoint shot eight points for number eight Tyree Bara Bay fdu three of nine from downtown theyve cut it to four here does BC generate offense with Donald H on the bench Kelly says Ill take care of that Kelly its a good drive by Kelly but but I think really going in the half court set BC has to look for Chad vening they have the S Advantage they have to be able to play off that FD fdu looks to double team and then venny has to be able to see where the open man is Messiah makes his move venning stays with him Barb Bay again rebound McFarland halfway point of this first half Boston College by six its a BC team that has struggled a little bit in the nonconference with a loss to Dartmouth also fell to VCU South Carolina and then the two conference losses Wake Forest and SMU Ving Waits and scores nice patience from the big man yeah thats where needs go right now vening you talked about his size 270 he should be getting the ball every time right now down the floor and they should just look to play off it look at the big fella with the takeaway slows it down finds Fred pay I tell you what Drew for 270 lbs he thats some good Mobility pretty Nimble Nimble on his feet you play with any big men like that I I have I actually my roommate was a ren an aaku there is and he was as Nimble as they come on his feet hed get a steal and go coast to coast and finish at The Rim you know one of the best centers to do it at Syracuse thats an onuaku esque finish from venning there on the putb Chad venning has eight points Donald H has 13 foul before the shot on the Applause floor foul number 24 RS his first person team third returning to the line number one brown number with Han junor out of the game right now BC has to go into their big man venning Jun venning and he just has to impose his will if they double team he has to be able to look to kick it back out but right now just get it by the rim big fella and go strong yeah for Braden Reynolds its 61 190 thats a tough box out of s to say the least yeah McFarland cleans it up Roger Boston College dominating in the paint early they got outscored 523 by SMU in the paint last Saturday gave up 103 against the Mustangs and yes they are in the ACC Cameron Tweedy now Dylan Jones surrounded by white jerseys a nice five bar but Bay cant spin it in Jones the offensive rebound oh venning says get that out of here Knights retain possession Terrence Brown missed the three 0 for four start for Terence Brown that the yous getting good looks theyre just knocking it down but BC Earl Grant wants BC to be a defensive minded team and right now theyre doing a great job of creating walls against Brown and and just attacking the glass McFarland missed the tray good hustle from brown but thatll be fairly Dickson ball Boston College on top by 12 did aren anaka do stuff like this as well look at Chad venning fdu doing a good job attacking the room but

wish you all a very happy New Year speaking of Cooper flag whos from New England grew up in Maine see the number for him as a freshman projected number one overall pick do you think thats where he belongs dvo yeah I mean hes a generational talent I mean at that size being able to do all the things that he could do dribble pass shoot the ball and I mean hes above average athlete hes definitely in consideration for to be the number one pick next year NBA draft thats incredible he had no skill at all before Brian scalabrini started to mold him into the player he is today the white Mamba the white MAA big in the youth basketball scene the Boston Celtics color analyst as we get a foul against Boston College its on beetle Donald Han returns to the game and Evo he scored 13 points in just8 minutes to start well he hes hes just looked to be aggressive from the start I mean you see him right here playing off of two feet playing through the contact I mean hes been doing it all hes been hes a three level guy hes been doing it from the outside for him you just want to be aggressive you know look to get the cleanest shot you can but hes been doing a great job right now just getting to the rim and creating opportunities for himself and for his teammates fouls against Boston College as we had a wedgie as venning got the block Divo Ive never seen this if you look at the play byplay on a wedgie its actually called a lodge ball thats a good one lets lets call it a wedgie though wedgie much better the foul was on beetle its first Terence brown one of the best free throw shooters in the Northeast conference missed the free throw he is still on the schneid scoreless in 10 minutes well Jo Ill tell you one thing hes not going to stop attacking hes going to you know continue to attack regardless if hes two for 10 or if hes you know 6 for seven hes going to keep going and thats what makes him a great player great players dont worry about their makes and misses they just continue to be aggressive and then eventually things open up for them Applause and Fairley Dickinson with the Press they break it heres Beetle oh tried to it back and Rock The Rim rejected by bismar Messiah I love that name bismar bismar e little beat boxing just a friend oh threepointer from Tyreek Barb Bay who is feeling it early thats his third long ball tell you what Drew Barbara Bay came to play Christmas break and Im going to come back off shootting in the basketball this is third three of the half 11 points the gr St the transfer from D2 Jefferson Beetle got away with the carry right there he did 10 on the timer for Han BCS to continue to move the ball theyre playing right in fds hands if theyre stagnant great job by Brown getting low and finishing at The Rim Yeah ba him out on that possession his first bucket today trying to force Brown to the middle heres Bara Bay hell drive this time good cut from Brown and the finish on the Baseline Dre fdu is one of the best cutting teams in basketball and you dont hear a lot hey Im a great cutter but and and being a coach and you know having that coaching experience if you got guys who can cut to the hoop and know when to cut you can be a much better team offensively BS on Terence Brown great job by Barber Bay keeping his eyes up Terrence Brown caught beat him sleeping inside hand finishing at The Rim now something to watch that was the second foul on Terrence Brown just under six minutes to play in this first half and I bet you hes going to stay in the game Castlebury needs his his best player in the game Eliza strong gives it up Donald Han lost the rock Brown got a hand on it Manuel finds him straight line drive the basket denied by Kelly I guess hes not feeling sick anymore he got way up yeah great job by Kelly just not giving up on the play and running that down getting a great block first block of the day for Boston College second block Benning had one earlier hand was walled up by Jal Morris who flexed after that defense strong the dribble drive again good hands from fdu out of bounds off the knights 43 to shoot for Boston Applause College great chase down blocked by Chaz Kelly 65 using his athletic body to get up and deny Brown again Browns going to continue to apply pressure hes going to continue to try to get to the rim those blocks and those turnovers those Miss shots they arent going to face Brown got to go in a hurry here and they do and it leads to a foul as Hastings went up strong F fou number 13 fouled by amanel his first person team Drew Hastings is a guy that this Boston College staff has really raved about right here showing his athletic ability drawing the foul but hes a guy who has great Mobility hes versatile he can guard multiple positions and hes only a freshman he has plenty of room to grow and get better for this Boston College teams fourstar recruit out of IMG down in Florida Applause mfar McFarland back in replacing strong strong Strongs a guy that we havent really mentioned a lot today but hes averaging 11 points per game hes capable of knocking it down from the outside getting into the midrange finishing at The Rim as well hasnt even taken a shot in this first half and got 13 Benning has eight BC by 10 Brown cant Coral the pass BC ball Chaz Kelly defending thats what Chaz Kelly is really bringing to the table for this Boston College team defensively 65 hes long hes athletic he can move another guy that can guard multiple positions great defense in this first half by Boston College Applause and gets it across the timeline with a second to spare and then hes trapped right away on top of the BC logo and brown rips it from him Barb Bay the fancy finish hes got 13 yeah thats what they want to do we talked about Castleberry theyre not pressing as much as they they have been this year but you know when they get down they got to look to go to that pressing we talked about mucking it up a little bit and right there Terence Brown doing a great job getting the Steal Bay finishing at The Rim Kelly too strong on a three Bara Bays been the guy twoman game with his best friend the three is good Tyrie Bara Bay Catching Fire go ahead and go under me if you want to 43 the first half for Barbara Bay showing he can really shoot that ball yeah I dont know if thats in the Scout for Bara Bay 39 threepoint shooter on the year and he is sizzling to start four for five after that second make I tell you what its in the Scout Drew and if it wasnt then it is now exactly five to shoot hand tries to respond Emanuel fighting for the rebound ends up with hand he missed it more white jerseys in there Hastings goes down McFarland has The Rock gets it away to Hastings he drives and scores and it all started with the Hustle by BC you see HS just keeping the ball alive keeping the ball alive Brown gets it and he gets into McFarlin and then Hastings does a good job of controlling his body and finishing at The Rim I got under three minutes until halftime Morriss three is Off the Mark and Hastings collects another rebound Morris not really known as a threepoint shooter more of a driver and a Music Defender that fouls on Morris so were under three minutes left here in this first half Boston College by seven but Tyree barbar Bas keeping the kns in it defensively Terence Brown doing it for fdu barbar Bay finishing with the reverse at The Rim and also you see right here Hs doing a great job of controlling his body finishing at The Rim BC up seven Music last I get up on your feet Music Applause and all lets see what we doing Applause this here Applause Music Applause Applause Applause oh I dont know I dont know Applause got Music Applause Music you hey Thursday at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend we got you covered all season right here on acc Network and the ESPN Eric dandorf Tyree barab Bay is looking like you Circa 2006 or 2007 I appreciate that taking every shot and making most exactly yeah taking every shot yeah absolutely I mean Boston College has been doing a great job and everybody accept Barbara Bay but you know you got to give barbar Barbara Bay the credit hes been doing a great job of knocking down tough shots he has four threes in this first half and hes just been taking what Boston College has been giving him youre shooting like that you got permission to take the game over and thats what hes done 16 points for barab Bay 23 of Fairley Dickinsons total as Deion Brown gets in and the Lays at home hes a guy for BC that really needs to step up and hes more than capable you seeing right there straight line drive putting his shoulder into his chest playing off the two Fe finishing at The Rim Brown was first team All America East last J at UNBC average more than 21 in conference play Emanuel you see the athleticism as he goes right where he wants to two and the foul against Boston College its on Jaden Hastings Hasting just a little bit laid on that weak side help Manuel doing a good job of taking advantage of the size Advantage vers H Jun getting to the cup and getting to the line for an opportunity for Two Shots a second foul on Hastings looks like bennings getting set to check back in Manuel struggles at the free throw line this year sub 50 now 20 for Applause 42 Drew I really like what coach Earl Grant has with Hastings and venting he could give you a different look with Hastings and a little bit more mobile a little bit more athletic and then you can come back with vening and just want to punch you in the mouth and attack you inside vny has done a great job of just getting the ball and going right at the hoop Im pretty sure the fans get Burgers because he missed two free throws so thats why that Roar was so loud Im a burger guy I mean who is it fdu showing a little bit of Zone Action right here I know a little bit about the Zone drew a little bit and Bricks the three trying to shoot over the top of it one problem with the zone is you can be susceptible to offensive rebounding absolutely and also for Boston College you have to be careful with settling against the zone you have to look to the attack the gaps get in the paint defense collapse and then youre going to get those open opportunities out on the perimeter Donald H Jr has 15 points in the first half ties the most by a BC Eagle in any first half this year weave action up top for fdu trailing by 11 Brown is fouled looked like Dion Brown might have been in the restricted area for f which you know that weave action up top is just movement to get brown and there you see hand right here being aggressive on the board just finishing off of two feet hands just been a good job of just being active you know just being aggressive Terence Brown leads the NEC and points field goals made field goals attempted free throws made free throws attempted and steals as strong checks back in drew a lot of the movement that FD runs its just movement to get brown in position to where he can get that defense off balance and he has angle to attack the rim and get to the basket to the free throw line something that he does one of the best guys in the country that get to the basket and get to the free throw line its only one for six from the floor but three for four from the line makes it a single digit game again with under a minute to play in the first half it looked like Fu would be off in running but its a foul its on Joel Emanuel College got lucky right in there against this zone right here there theres two spots where you have to attack you see right here and he got his hand around his back em manual but Boston College has to be able to attack the high post and attack the short Corner once you get that ball in the high post the defense is going to collapse and youre going to have opportunity because the guy in the middle he has to make a decision hes going to take the ball or hes going to drop back a little bit and thats where BC will have that fou line jump shot but they have to be able to get into that high post or get to that short Corner area whats going on here thats a one and one seventh foul on fdu Bening hits the first hell get the second that high post can really be the The Zone Buster who is the best guy against a zone that you played against in Syracuse that I played against yeah um I dont know I was a great Zone Buster just I mean a guy that I played with Jerry mamary hes a guy who could shoot once he stepped across half court but a guy that was great against his own and against Syracuse it was a porter a guy that you want to put a guy who could really score and has the ability to make decisions in that free throw line area and he was one of the best at at doing that at just making decisions and you know making plays in that free throw line area that basket will count and a chance at an n one for Jacob Warren go 31 El Jacob Warren not really known as a offensive threat but just a little late right there he just a tad late he gave Warren the opportunity for the an one Warren will take Applause it strong got out of that restricted area but it looked like he was leaning call from Roger AES puts Warren at the line where hes four for six this year coach Grant and and Roger having a little back and forth right there lane violation against Applause fdu and Drew tell me I mean what you think but I think the charge call is probably the hardest call to make in basketball happening full speed like that absolutely it its a tough call to make and you know the some of these officials are some of the greatest to do in college Applause basketball PC going quickly there for a two for one hand miss the three game and shot clock split by about 3 Applause seconds Morris misses another three Ving the defensive rebound and Boston College can hold for one great action by fdu just wasnt able to knock it down 5 seconds left in the half and a foul unfairly Dickinson they didnt have one to give so free throws coming here for BC bad foul right there by fdu he did a great job hedging out hes just over Applause aggressive good job hedging out you just got to keep your hands up and then slide your feet make him go sideways Kelly line thats the Freshman Josiah Francis one and one for Chaz Kelly now nine for 13 on the season BCs lead is double digits and had it tried to save it Brown shot wont count and Boston College on top by 10 as we hit halftime here Tyree Bara Bay the D2 transfer from Jefferson in Philly 16 points in the first half and a foul early against the Eagles and Drew for fdu yes you want to have the ball in Browns hands but you got to get him some off of the ball movement you see right there you know him coming off the down screen into the handoff and then he can turn that corner and get into the paint and then you know make a decision from there fdu has to get his movement off of the ball fou was on hand his second gismar Messiah another transfer from Jefferson you talked about Brown projected by venning two swats for the big man Li you did the same thing on the other side down screen into the handoff brown was able to get into the paint just a good job by venning staying down and blocking the shot Josh beetles pass out to H he drives and kicks to strong strong balls popping around here on this possession Dion Brown some Nifty footwork talked about Brown being more than capable score for this Boston College team how how can he get himself going dont settle for jump shots do what you did right there get in the paint play off two feet use your pivot get your Defender up in the air finish at The Rim great job by Brown getting in there great Hands by Beetle and the elite eight last year with Clemson Applause Music its Elijah strong didnt even take a shot in the first half averages more than 11 points on the year doubled in the corner and a timeout taken by Boston College leading by 12 early in the second half trying to wrap up their nonconference slate with a win and Dion Brown trying to help Music spe Applause hey hey Junior hey Applause on Music Music the two stars of the first half fdu Barbara Bay and Boston College H H Jr did a great great job both of them in the first half you see right here we talked about H junor setting the tone early being aggressive he started off putting it on the deck which opened up his perimeter game and allowed him to knock down some open threepoint shots and on the other end Barbara Bay has really been doing a good job picking up the slack for brown hes just given what BC has taking him four for five from threepoint range and hes done a great job of just knocking down open shots Music and those two guys really the story of this game so far Bara Bay keeping the team in it coming off a season High 15 at Minnesota he already surpassed that in the first half remember Fairley Dickinson LED Minnesota by one 21 to 20 at halftime a week ago at the barn Elijah strong his first bucket of the game great short roll right there by strong strong catching it making a quick decision finishing at The Rim sophomore from Charlotte is on the board BC by Music 14 f is just too stagnant right now offensively Emanuel trying to change that fancy Euro Step looking like his high jumping days in high school I dont know if that footwork came from the volleyball or or the basketball but great job getting into the lane using the Euro Step finishing at The Rim you see the points in the paint number that is not going to cut it for Fairly Dickenson even if theyre making a bunch of outside shots just Applause 10 Beetle has to give it up Benning cant score and bismar Mah with the rebound Drew I think F you knew coming in that they were going to beat Boston College at points in the paint you see right there Terrace Brown knocking down to three thats really how they want to be able to stay in the game is making threes and playing fast getting easy opportunities in transition but Boston College has done a great job of the whole game of making fdu play in the half Music court single digits to shoot hand calls for the ball enters for venning draws two Manu shading over three on the timer Beetle has to Fire Hits the long one thats a bom to beat the buzzer thats just a back breaker for Fu they did a great job of making Ben catching it out away from the basket brought the double team right away and Beetle just hit a tough deep three and as a coach thats just shake your head thats a foul on beetle as Brown goes to the deck its just the seventh threepointer made this year by Joshua beetle great job kicking it out by Ven and see the

number four Duke hosting Virginia Tech at Cameron indor and a Happy New Year from all of us at ACC Network Cooper flag 16 and almost nine rebounds per game which is second most among freshman when you watch him play Deo who comes to mind like do you have a good comp for Cooper flag you know I I could go to a Christian leer type field but hes much more athletic than lner I think he has that skill set but hes just an incredible athlete and you know all the praise and attention that hes getting he deserves it hes a hes a generational talent and hes definitely going to be considered you know one of the guys up for the number one pick in next years NBA draft I heard someone about I think it was Drew good and he said maybe like Andre kolinko little little extra offensive game AK AK47 I like I think he hes more athletic I mean AK was a guy who could you know his skill set he could do everything but I think Cooper flag is honestly a little bit better than that well speaking of offense how about Tyree Barbara Bay 19 points hes got more than half the points for Fairley Dickinson keeping this team afloat Applause Donald and the top scorer for Boston College came up well short that time fdu ball we talked about whos whos the guy whos going to step up for fdu besides besides Brown and its Ben Barbara Bay hes just been taking what BC has given him theyre giving him open looks and hes hes taking the opportunities hes knocking it down seven of nine from Applause downtown seven of nine overall I should say five of six from distance for barab Bay thats a good move from Brown and he kisses it home back to a single digit game here comes the full court press just try to pick the tempo up for BC make him make Rush decisions but we talked about Brown hes going to continue to be aggressive hes going to continue to put pressure on the Boston College defense how about the excitement the heart fairly Dickinson is playing with right now forcing Boston College to call timeout because the shot clock was about to hit 20 got to clear it in 10 seconds Brown hes going to continue to get downhill be aggressive you see the footwork changing direction high off the glass finishing and you know hes a guy that we talked about make or Miss hes going to continue to be aggressive hes one of the top scorers in the country in averaging almost 22 points a game you see only has 10 points today but you know that doesnt phase Brown hes a guy whos super confident and hes put in the work in the off season we were talking to coach Castleberry Browns one of the hardest workers he he sets the tone and he leads by example and hes going to continue to create opportunities for himself and his teammates Terence Brown is from Minneapolis the same hometown by the way is BCs alltime leading scorer Troy Bell and they played at Minnesota last week and and Terren had two or 300 friends and family at that game and his his teammate Jal Morris whos from New Jersey the tristate area it was late at night they were in Minneapolis and he said there any Deli open right now and Terren said no this is a city that sleeps as much as I love Minneapolis it does sleep Drew being from the Midwest a Michigan guy neighboring with Minnesota that is true we we do go to sleep and youre not going to have any bagas or or any Deli open 247 so a bit different on the east coast in New York City you know what we do have that New Jersey and New York dont respectable NFL teams Vikings in Detroit Lions well finally I get to cheer for somebody i Ive been a Detroit Lions fan my whole life and these past two or three years I finally get something to cheer about thats all right my bikes are coming for that one dont worry this Chad venning lays it in as Boston College back to an 11point edge Bennys been doing a great job of just being around the rim you know using that size advantage and just going straight up and finishing five sixs Donald H hes got speed he can finish oo bit of an awkward fall as the whistle blows looks like hes okay brown right there with the Miss junor pushing he talked about his his Improvement putting the ball down on the ground and a little bit of Luca donic with the D acceleration and it did look like an awkward awkward fall good thing that hes not hurt and a chance for two at the line knock him down the first if IOU was on Bara Bay his first you mentioned Han looking a little bit like Luca we asked him at shoo around today whos your favorite NBA player to watch he said Shay gilis Alexander another guy whos Elite with that deceleration right I mean hes Elite in a lot of areas deceleration footwork creativity and hes the top five player in the NBA if you certainly in the conversation for MVP no question Donald said he he thinks he plays more like a CJ McCullum or a a Devon Booker more like a two guard yeah I I I could see that just getting to his spots raising up I mean he he has definitely improved at putting the ball down on the ground and there you see Barbara Bay he came to play today he he he was ready man he was Dam Unstoppable has to be his career high in points and threepointers made well for the division one level absolutely said a season high with 15 last week hes got 22 Benning missed it from Point Blank Range rebound to fairly Dickinson Emanuel pushing Tempo find the hot hand of Bara Bay as good as BC has been defensively fdu is just sticking around only down 10 and over 12 minutes left left in the game theyre still here thats what they do it was four and 10 on the season one win over a D1 team but theyve hung around in a bunch of these games as brown has it roll off the rim numbers for BC if they hurry with brown TR in the plate Fred Payne launches hits a three Dre Fred Fred pays another one of those guards that BC has coming off the bench bringing energy effort and again not known as a shooter but hes capable of knocking it down the drive first guy you see him right there taking advantage of going under the scen and the takeaway pay the follow five in a row for number five and Fairley Applause Dickinson needs a timeout Music H Junior get to the rim in pain going on a little bit of his 0

easy right lets make some noise for our one more time winning our shot contest you e the all right welcome back to kti Forum Tyree Barb Bay has been the story for Fairley Dickinson with 22 but Fred Paynes on a little 5 spur of his own here dvo well Boston College has a variety of guards who could do a bunch of different things but Fred Payne is a guy who brings energy and effort see him right here Morris going under the screen and Ill knock that down and then just hes just a hustle hustle guy hustling back and you saw him getting that offensive rebound put back Boston College has a lot of these guards who could do different things and its good when you got a guy coming off the bench bringing that energy and effort not losing much when he Subs in sophomore from Grambling Louisiana this is Boston Colleges largest lead of the day 15 points as we cross 12 minutes left Bren Reynolds picks up the dribble here comes bisar and a denied jayen Hastings got way up there that was a heck of a defensive play right there bismar did a good job of getting him off the ground but Hy is not giving up and getting the block shot great job by there just continuing to play thats a bouncing those New Balances but BC gives it away Kelly never bounce past it in the lane like that three ball from nah so I mean this is what we thought dvo if fdu had a chance to hang around in this game theyd have to make threes pressure the ball in the back court and Speed the game up and theyve been able to do some of that you talked about them being thats 10 seconds thats a turnover 10 second violation we talked about fdu being 4 and 10 but I dont think their record really shows how good they are you see right here Hastings not giving up on the play and blocking the shot starting transition on the other end Hastings is another one of those guys coming off the bench just bringing a lot of energy and effort and hes a red shirt freshman he has a lot of room to grow he talked about in the beginning hes a guy that Boston College is looking forward to seeing his Improvement Terence Brown never in Rhythm there just three for 13 shooting one for five from downtown top scor in the NEC second in the country in total points behind Eric Dixon of Villanova Marin lost the handle man fdu all over the leather we got a jump offall Applause folks acpm with Mark Packer and Taylor tabom weekdays at 4 Eastern right here on acc Network in the ESPN Music app Boston College with the arrow they will inbound with six to shoot P picked it up here comes hand three on the timer Reynolds fighting for the rebounds fouls on hand third and Drew Reynolds is another guy for FD that has a really good story a former walkon number one brown no well I mean you could have called it jump ball but just get back and play defense you dont need to follow that far away from the hoop anyway takes a seat with those three FS by the way acpm theyll have a lot to talk about with bowl games in the ACC gah drills another three back to a npoint game including for Boston College who lost to Nebraska in the pinstrike ball today thats a back violation its got to be it is another turnover oh theyre calling a foul oh no a foul on nah wow Im surprised it looked like he stepped into the back court on his own no that was I dont want to say it of but that was a Miss call right there drew it was a back court violation oh yeah hand on his back P tees it up theres a foul against barley Dickinson its on Braden Reynolds as Deon Brown only 6 three but an elite rebounder for his size forcing the issue do real quick fdu they just continue to play you know they get down but theyre always coming back at you see right here Fred pay with the shot yeah it was followed by Reynolds great job by Brown putting pressure on the rim anytime a guy looks at the ref hoping hes not going to blow the whistle hes probably going to blow away Kelly the inbound finds pay and hes fouled a foul on a threepoint shot oh no offensive F he kicked the leg out you dont see that call often now look Eric Lewis whos an NBA refer almost two decades thats a call you see in the NBA now thats the T same type of thing is when youre youre ripping and they got their hand in and theyre just trying to go up with your hand in the in in the pocket I guess the same type of same type of call yeah foul Applause baiting pay tried to jum jump the passing Lane guy called for an offensive foul for kicking his leg out Reggie Miller just shed a tear somewhere see right here out of the out of bounds play good job getting opening thats a good call thats the right call yeah I mean he stuck it out and he tripped over it so yeah thats that is the right call guess being an offensive guy I I dont like it but being an offensive guy cuz I wasnt a defensive guy thats for sure but I did hey I got some good stats on the steals Drew go the two3 Zone man you did your job we played manto man twice really yes that remember the game actually Holy Cross Fred Payne with seven points in hurry here lead back to 11 Barb Bay look out this guy cant miss confidence is Skyhigh right now Barbara Bay just stepping into it good job by Brown putting pressure on the D getting in the paint and we talked about him creating more for his teammates and Barbara Bay has stepped up in a huge wave for Fu and theres a foul on Reynolds as hes racking him up here in the second half thats his third foul fou number two ter pae has done a great job coming off the bench and being aggressive you see him right there finishing through the contact Barbara Bay hes having a career T night just stepping into it hand in his face it doesnt matter Im going to knock it down hes been shooting the ball at a high high level Tyrie Bara Bay now with 25 points its the most by an fdu night against an ACC team ever Terrence Greer had 23 against NC State back in 2010 Bara Bay has of their points today venning is fouled and drops it in well now for BC Drew fdu or fdu is making Boston College change up their plan a little bit they didnt expect barbar Bay to come in and hit 7 threes BC good job by they should have been doing this early and often and going back to their bread and butter vening is the biggest guy on the court by far just going into him and using that strong body finishing at The Rim offensive board to strong lost it out of bounds fdu ball and honestly surprised by strong tonight hasnt been aggressive at all hes always the second or third leading scorer on this team hasnt even got a lot of tempts up so Tyreek Barb Bay is 9 for 11 from the floor the rest of the team is 9 for 34 Applause under eight minutes to play under 10 seconds on the shot clock theiah has to pick up the dribble blocked again by Applause venning say thats bennings third block you would be correct sir hes averaging a block and a half a game hes not the most athletic guy but hes he uses his angles and hes he anticipates the shot well Kelly throws it set of bounds off of the knights and Chad venning whose athleticism just got roasted for no reason by Eric devendorf hes showing you the Hops today inventing I may not be an athlete but I got three blocks tonight be quiet Dorf Music Music and womens basketball returns to Forum tomorrow when they host Louisville at 2m right here atum SEC your seats at bagcom e e e this week dvo he is nuclear bar Bay is setting the tone he said the tone from the start in the first half but hes just being aggressive hes taking what BC has given him hes getting open shots and hes knocking it down hes seven and eight from three and hes only missed two shots the whole game Bay is having a career night for fdu these numbers are pretty staggering if I had told you that one guy for Fairley Dickinson would have as many field goals as the rest of the team combined youd probably guess its the guy whos leading the conference and scoring its not Terrence Brown Its Tyrie Barb Bay I think this is good for fdu because come conference play theyre going to have to have other guys step up besides Brown yes we know Brown is going to get his points hes going to get his attempts but to win basketball games you need more than brown Barb has matched his career high from when he was playing division two there goes Donald H right to the rack out of the timeout talk about being aggressive and staying aggressive hand Junior has been like that this entire game H got 21 and hes one away from his career high hands just staying aggressive hes playing through the contact strong body Strong finish inside hand getting into the lane for two a bad sign here for Fairley Dickinson Tyree Barb Bay just limped off the court and he hes not heading to the locker room yet but hes trying to walk it off as he gets some attention from the training staff and he has been their offense kind of see him in the background there theres Bara Bay playing the best basketball of his life right now season High 15 at Minnesota last week goes for 25 so far half of Fairly Dickinsons points and really besides him BCs done a great job defensively I mean fdu only has 50 points with seven minutes left and look Drew if you ask coach Grant no 25 points from Barbara Bay and 25 points from the rest of the team he probably would have said okay well I Ill take it yeah aside from the radioactive performance of number eight they have done a great job defensively here is brown the five on the timer he Scoops it home a nice reverse from Terence Brown hes just so crafty at The Rim you see the look off and Jones in the corner and kept Han Junior in the corner hes able to finish with the reverse with the right and thats another guy we really havent talked about a lot at all is Jones thats a good call Dylan Jones Just One for four shooting 0 for three from downtown best threepoint shooter in his conference coming in PC did a nice job to break the Press strong has to pick up the dribble tend to shoot heres Chaz Kelly the Junior from Houston Brown curl shoots offensive rebound to Brown venning scores nice left hand from the big man and thats what brown brings as well just effort strength continuing to play through it get Second Chance opportunities ven at The Rim Terrence Brown the rebound lays it in with the left now if he can get going Bara Bay by the way is at the scores table ready to check in as Fairley Dickinson refuses to wave the White Flag here BR has that long athletic wiry body and he gives his body up so one of my favorite players of all time alen Iverson same type of feel like he he was Fearless getting into Lane he was giving his body up and he wasnt worried about if he was make it or miss it he was just continuing to put pressure on the defense and thats what makes great players great they dont worry about their makes and misses they just continue to play the game and thats why Brown has continue to improve and hes going continue to be better as the season progresses he has blossomed this year boosted a scoring average by more than 13 points per game nasiah the pump the drive the Finish eightpoint game with five minutes left Drew I was at BC practice yesterday and Coach Earl Grant is not going to be happy about that one thing that he made that he specified for bismar was hes going to pump fake and then hes going to drive the lane venny didnt hear Earl Grant right there Jack Castleberry cannot believe that they called this foul Brown doing a great job playing through contact inside hand finish vening SE down Bismark or bis Mar great job finishing at The Rim Deion Brown draws the foul on Joel Emanuel heres the Third on Emanuel Brown hits the first free throw starting this week we got four consecutive Sundays with womens basketball quadruple headers not single double or triple headers quadruple headers right here on AC CC Network first lineup has the number three team in the country Hannah hialgo and Notre Dameon that kicks off the Slate Barb Bay back in the game top of your screen in the corner hes got 25 points Terrence Brown has 14 see the Off the Ball action by fdu double back cut opening that side for bismar he takes advantage goes glass big fundamental bismar Messiah tell you what hes hes got a good skill set for that size playing the five right now he has the advantage going at v hes got some game hes the third night in double figures 10 points for nsiah Boston College pushing the tempo heres the thing about the pressure though even when they break the press and score theyre doing it fast which which allows fdu to maybe come back in a hurry yeah well when youre playing fast its just all about decision making and making making quick decisions if you can make the right decision you know quickly and usually youll have the advantage Brown went up might have caught Kelly in the face with an elbow he checks on him and free throws coming for him when we return nah good stop in the spin cycle fade away yes sir Music Music e e e e some young sparkies enjoying the game as Boston College in a game here 68 58 as a score against this upstart fairly Dickinson Group which if you follow college basketball for the last couple years you know this fdu program theyve got a knack for Big Time upsets and when you got Tyrie Bara Bay and Terence Brown bismar nah all in double figures youre going to keep the game close Terence Brown the top scorer in his conference and hes kind of proving it here in the second half dvo well fds been picked third in conference in the in a North Eastern Conference so theyre going to be a team to reckon with in their 4 and 10 record doesnt really show what type of team they are theyve been playing against you know power five schools in their nonconference and talking about Terence Brown hes a guy who hasnt had the best shooting night but hes going to continue to put the pressure on the defense and continue to get to the free throw line and thats what makes great players great Two Shots weve talked about it all night theyre not worried about their makes or misses they find different ways to score and different opportunities to make things happen two shots for Terence Brown after he was fouled before the timeout hes above 80 on free throws this year thats a second Miss today now four for six theyre going to apply the pressure all 10 players in the back court right now Donald H will try to break it they might have to burn another timeout they called the foul of a foul on J Morris and that thats a bailout seventh foul on fdu in the second half free throws coming for Boston College great job by fdu just stay you see the hands right there thats where they got him the hands on the H but its not a foul you you play basketball basketballs a contact sport and you know Han junor just fell on the ground and good job selling it give me two at the Line Drew I think they called that a trip which Im Im not sure about that one and one hand hits the front end that ties his career high with 22 points Drew were in Boston they got a team coming from Jersey or New York I dont know if its that Boston New York Rob I dont know what it is but fdu is going to keep coming theyre going to keep playing theyre going to keep putting the pressure on Boston College Boston College has to do a better job of taking care of the basketball against fds press yeah Castle bes team will not quit Donald Andrew junor 23 points that is a new career high Bara Bay is fouled speaking of career highs hes got a chance to add to his with three free throws talked about earlier with the hand in the pocket and thats what Donald Han junr right there he got caught in the cookie jar good job by Barbara Bay recognized it in going up thats a fourth foul on Donald hand so Earl Grant will talk to him I hes going to leave him in the game with 325 to play and honestly Drew right now you know fdu is going to bring the pressure up Im subbing Josh beet in just to handle that pressure a little bit get down get hand off the ball and guess hes comfortable right now just with hand bringing the ball Applause up Bara Bay transferred in from D2 Jefferson in Philly it was him and bismar nah those two guys Inseparable thats what coach Castleberry told us before the game today not surprising their best friends and they both scored their 1000th Career College Point this year playing for fdu yeah he said ones loud and ones quiet bar Bay is the one whos loud he can also sing and hes being loud his game is being loud tonight it is you brain steam when they lose a lot of the time its because they give up threepointers in bunches and today Fairley Dickinson is 11 for 27 better than Applause 40 single digits to shoot three minutes to play Browns got to go strips out of bounds off of Terrence brown one point2 to shoot Mors doing a great job one of fds top Defenders hes physical hes strong great job just getting his hands in there making it tough for H junor you just love to see the hustle you basketball is about competing at a high level I mean guys can be highly skilled but if you compete and you bring energy youre going to give yourself a chance thats pretty good look all things considered but Brown missed it and heres Terrence Brown compete is what Fairley Dickinson does and its what theyve done today and they cut it to six as brown lays it in yeah you you look at the clock its 230 Brown looks up and see it he says its my time right now put pressure on the defense and doing what he does best finishing at The Rim all kinds of time hand splits the double team sitting on a career high 23 lost the handle out of bounds itll stay here its my time now and hes doing a great job of just using his body protecting the ball and finishing through contact hes hes not a huge guy but hes 65 he has that wiry strength hes one of the top finishers in the country going to that basket you talked about how he wouldnt get discouraged if he wasnt shooting the ball well he was 1 for six in the first half 5 for 10 in the second half with 12 points since halftime yeah that Miss shots doesnt bother great players hand in the lane rebound comes down to Morris Brown streaking fouled again Terrence Brown living in the restricted area here in the second half go number chis Kelly is third person team this is where fdu really thrives at playing fast getting up and down and brown loves to that inside hand right there you see him doing a good job drawing the foul and getting to the free throw line again one of the top free throw shooters in the NEC conference and one of the top getting attempts getting to the line just so tough to guard a guy like that who you know right hand left side inside hand finish wide finish playing off two playing off one he has all that in his game his third Miss free throw tonight that is rare for him 81 on the year five for eight today think about it if he makes all his free throws this is a twopoint game under two minutes to play Donald H oh he tried to rip the rim off and hes fouled by nsiah that was a meet me at the summit moment one thing I know if youre going to go to the rim go like this go right at his chest 90 of the time you are going to get the foul call great job by Han junr going up there and trying to finish strong and we talked about as an improvement off the dribble Han junr has been aggressive this whole game youre talking with with Jack Castleberry before the game he is from Virginia Beach the same Hometown as Donald Han Jr and Coach Castleberry told us that you know when When Donald Jr was really young his dad Donald senior who was a captain at the University of Virginia would call him when Castleberry was an assistant at the Citadel and say hey my son my son is really young but I think hes going to be good you think he can play at the Citadel and Jack would say thats not going to happen I knew even back then Donald H Jr was going to play at a big school like BC smart man let me not even waste my time recruiting and just thanks Dad but no thanks lead is seven Brown passes up the three three to shoot Brown streaking scoring 14 in the second half for Terrence Brown I thought Brown was going to shoot that but great job just continue to play Fu a great cutting team and brown doing a great job of cutting to the basket finishing with the inside head great job by Morris keeping his head up brown with that inside hand again finishing at The Rim a short change him hes actually got 15 in the second half after he really struggled in the first half just five points on one of six shooting Brown an example of what can happen when you have belief or maybe when you know how much your team needs you well that I tell you what just having confidence I when I played I was a guy who might have not been the most skilled but I believed I was better than anyone on the floor and you see that in in terce Browns eyes hes just he believes hes the best player on the floor and having a subpar first half but he continues to play he continues to go and you look up and he has 20 points its a pretty cool story of how he ended up at Fairley Dickinson to he just happened to be visiting New Jersey because some family on his dad side who he had never met live about 30 minutes from haac where fdu campuses and he happened to get a text from Tom Kylie an assistant coach right around that time and said hey do you want to come in for a visit loved it got a workout Jack Castleberry was a fan of his game and the rest is history now barely Dickinson is a name that has been pretty prominent in college basketball lately couple of years ago they knocked off Purdue just the second ever 16 over one that was a Purdue team with with Zach Edy right and and this small fairly Dickinson team beats him and then almost beats FAU who went to the final four I remember watching that game they had you could only have five guys on the court but it seemed like they had seven around Zack Ed in Purdue was just wasnt able to knock down any shots and they pull off another upset here trying to force turnovers Boston College playing the clock game leading by five going to go under a minute to play Its all about decision making right now for Boston College minute remaining heres Donald H vendings been solid in the perimeter or in the interior what a Applause shot clutch shot right there fading away off a one foot tough shot by B he said a couple of those today bar B Bay right back at you its a three fourpoint gain and Drew hes eight and nine from threepoint right now making string music get it across half court hand goes to the basket and lays it in J 27 for Donald H Jr a career high shot clock is off they leave nesiah cant make him pay Morris runs it down saves it right to hand he can wrap it up and get Applause fouled cant say enough about fdu in the fight that theyve had I mean they were down double digits for most of this game they continued to fight see Barbara Bay playing off the left hand and this is 83 of the game eight for nine what a game for Barbara Bay today if youre Tyreek Barbie Barb Bay you come in against an ACC team and you hang 31 on 12 shots thats cold man I tell you what Im Im going into conference play looking at these teams that Im playing I saying Im trying to get Laughter 40 Donald H got 29 Points last gas for fdu here go you got to go to go Brown changes Direction missed the layup rebound to McFarland fdu calls off the dogs and thats it Boston College hangs on against the pesky Fairley Dickinson team Donald H Jr with 29 and the Eagles head into ACC play at 8 and5 overall Music
