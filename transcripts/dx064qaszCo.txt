season overall this is sixth year as a head coach though he spent Five Seasons as the head coach its Charlotte Kevin ji and uh the Cavaliers Jacob Kofi get us started here in Charlottesville tonight the Irish wearing the navy blue get the football or the basketball first listen to me Im thinking of Monday night again oh thats okay heres Burton center of the floor Alo is the Princeton transfer Shrewsberry the coachs son Kev jot back for Braden Shrewsberry drive five to shoot for the Irish and AO fallway on the Baseline is short and the rebound scooped up roie tried to pitch it ahead and quite frankly Day Day Ames was not ready for it Virginia he alone Wes he was all alone youre running down the court Nobodys around you you got to be looking for the ball and heres the Irish starting lineup of course headline by Burton Dan mention Tay Davis keep an eye on Matt Alo as well hes a guy that if he plays well Notre Dame usually is in a pretty good spot to win the game Cavaliers as expected open and tight defense Kofi deflected tend to shoot heres Burton on the drive and they crash the glass and touched Last by Notre D West those were two outstanding defensive possessions for the University of Virginia and thats tough if you got to play du defensive possessions before you get the ball yep and front Court comes to Kansas State transferred DayDay a sophomore from Chicago he works with Elijah Saunders who transferred from San Diego State Jacob Kofi is a freshman from Seattle Andrew roie and Isaac mcne returners to the Virginia lineup of course RO with tend to shoot foul on area Kofi the catch and shoot and the rebound pulled away by Alo and boy nice save by J thats a break for the Irish yep that ball bounced a couple times uncontested Virginia had Saunders alone against Burton and they missed him Shrewsberry jump shot away last touched and Nathan frell will award it to the Irish a fresh 20 Nathan frell Ron gr Jerry heer on the whistle here tonight in Charlottesville Michael Shrewsberry only has two wins in his ACC coaching career at Notre name hes winless in four games the Irish have lost their last seven ACC Road games their last Road win a year ago last February at Louisville theres a rebound by ji and a foul whistled after the Miss itll stay with the Irish W both Ron Sanchez and Micah Shrewsberry told us earlier today that the extra possessions were going to be vitally important and Notre Dame has now created two extra possessions with offensive rebounds Virginias defense has been outstanding but you cant keep giving the other team the ball Blake Buchanan a quick entry into the lineup sophomore from cordelan and Idaho and Buchanan playing about 19 minutes a game against the league he will check in and meanwhile Burton and Ames renewing ties and Jerry heer steps in to make sure everybodys okay and the Irish almost two minutes in were still scoreless there goes Burton on the drive comes to a stop puts it up draws the foul from a thatll be the first on DayDay Ames second on Virginia and Marcus Burton who does some of his best work at the free throw line when you think tonights his 12th game Dan this will be his 50th free throw wow thats one of the things he does he gets by you and thats where Ames made the mistake once he gets his head and shoulders by you out on the perimeter then he gets down in the lane he can to shoot that little float of the pullup jump shot or as you mentioned hes excellent at drawing fouls yep 86 free throw shooter he is now 44 of 51 on the year hes hit 20 plus in his last three and four of his last five Saunders now MCN against shuberry double team there they tried to get it to banon stolen a locko three on two for the Irish and heres Tay Davis leaves it out front for Burtons three and its good Marcus Burtons got Notre Dames first foul offensive rebounds turnover numers that lead the basket they have been two of the bugaboos for Virginia all season long yanan for mcney hell try and fire for three and hit well Isaac mcne picking up from where he left off on Tuesday night against Boston College oh he was terrific in here against the Eagles by the way Bo he sure wasnt he was pretty wide open right there West that is not what Michael shrewsburys game plan is Burton back for AO heres Davis drive on Saunders and it rolls out Tay Davis is one of the most aggressive players on the offensive end in the ACC hes going to take the ball and attack out front Elijah Saunders against Davis roie off the switch now back to Saunders theres the double team boy noted aim chasing the double pretty quick now Ames with five to shoot step back three bounds away Alo does a nice job getting the rebound for the Irish Virginia has handled that double team very poorly two times now Applause Wes look how hard Burton has to work just to get the ball Dan at times against the Cavaliers right well thats that you want to keep the ball out of his hands cuz once he gets it he can really hurt you a loo would tend to drive or tend to shoot on the drive and the fall away and the rebound for Saunders theres coming in averaging 54 rebounds a game that leads the Cavaliers heres Buchanan against Kev Virginia one of their first three not to name one of their first seven from the floor Ro a step in two and J pulls it Applause away Canon tried to help ases Davis again a loo for Burton three ball away right of the circle good and a foul on AES Marcus Burton has got eight all eight of Notre names day Ames is just so good with the basketball he can get in now this time they defend him well he misses that but hes still able to get down into the lane and this is a situation where he gets down in there draws the foul then of course hes a decent threepoint shooter and particularly when he can step into it y heres the other thing hes raised his threepoint shooting Dan by a full 5 from a year ago well this is a kid who works hard on his game Wes and when hes able to shoot the three effectively that means you got to push out on him harder and when you do that he that just plays right into his hands because he can go right by you and out of the timeout hes got a chance to give Notre Dame the rare fourpoint play and post his ninth Point here in this first half W interestingly enough aims out of the game now they bring in tane Murray itll be interesting to see who draws the match up against Burton right Burton would have a quickness advantage over anybody whos in the game for the Cavaliers so hes got two threes and three of three line shooting and a ninepoint performance for Marcus Burton and a sixpoint noted a lead Saunders for Buchanan triple hand off for RO nice caught Buchanan and Alo able to strip it out of there Roper got the Kum and heres the Irish again on the attack after a turnover so how many extra possessions keep that thought in mind as we unfold here tonight because it may well very May well indicate who wins as matalo knocks down the Baseline jump shot and so far the Irish are getting those extra possessions and they are converting them Jr kesn has gone to the table for Notre a so DayDay Ames is on the Virginia because of fouls that brought Murray in heres Saunders at three and a front rim Miss cleaned up by Roper of course Virginia is not a very good offensive rebounding team they like to drop back and set their defense so if youre going to take those shots youre going to have to make a fairly high percentage of them and the Cavaliers are only one for five heres Davis kick out for Burt against Ro on the drive now Alo slashes through hell feed Jai Kev up strong cant get get the bucket Buchanan the backside Applause rebound Ro using the Buchanan Music screen heres Murray the young man from New Zealand now in his senior campaign here at Applause Virginia Irish have done a nice job switching in their manto man and Virginia hadnt been able to solve it mcneela bounc through roie now Murray open missed the three from the corner T is just eight of 24 this year Virginia one of their first seven I think if youre Virginia youll take that shot every time great ball movement but you got to put it in the goal look at Davis work hard in traffic against Saunders bounce through for Roper hell shove it to ji and now Roper along two is good Julian rooper a 31 threepoint shooter and knocks down the bucket that pushes is it back to 11 at 14 to3 Dan good Heavens so rer the jump shot his third three of the year for the Fighting Irish Music back with Dan boner West durman Charlottesville noted him off to a terrific start we noted the Marcus Burton missed seven ball games Dan theyve lost five their last six those onepoint losses at NC State and against Carolina and South Bend just pop off the pace dont they yeah they do and one of the things with Marcus Burton missing seven games its really hard for the Irish to evaluate this Irish team you know everybody knows that you got to make adjustments when a guy goes out but you got to make adjustments when a guy comes back and they lost those couple of onepoint games right after Burton returned Its just tough to get him back in the lineup and get everybody flowing again shrew Berrys gone to the bench as as AO Julian Ropers come in and we get our first look at Nikita constant owski off the and we get a whistle and a foul with 12 to shoot and the foul is going to be on Julian roer the senior from Detroit his first first on the Irish so the Irish have been very aggressive defensively its been hard for Virginia to get many open opportunities there three by MCN is good boy you dont want to leave the door cracked long for Isaac McNeely do you well Davis switched on on to mcne but then he dropped off and mcney doesnt need much room nope heres Davis and a nice job by Kofi to reach in and knock it out of bounds heres another look look how the window is very quick well its its wasnt all that quick Wes Davis had a chance to get out there but he hung back you dont worry about mely driving passes you get out and make him drive past you mcney now eight 11 in his last two ball games from behind the line pair of Threes already tonight heres kesn left side for Roper slides into traffic skip back for kesn back rim miss duanan the rebound and heres mcney front court for the Cavaliers to trail by eight to Canon for Applause Kofi Murray on the bounce pass roie skips to the corner mcne another three sure wow they all the Virginia points they really ought to consider guarding here a very Bon likee start for Isaac mcney by the way fivepoint lead for the Irish now Burton trying to see if he can respond for Notre Dame here thats a good job by Buchanan making him stop Burton clutched on the bounce Fall Away over Murray fell off the rim we get a whistle and a foul itll be on Notre Dame and send us to a timeout but the Cavaliers Trail by five and Isaac mcne is carrying Virginia hes got all their points and theyre all from behind the line the latest from the bonus spere game to make that five out of six but during that five game losing strength Ron Sanchezs guys shot 27 from Beyond The Arc and you if this is a Virginia team the way theyre built they just cant do that they have to make threes what did Michael Shrewsbury tell us this after this morning they make threes were in trouble we got to stop him from making threes Logan Imes is coming into the noted aame lineup didnt play in the ball game a week ago at Syracuse played 6 minutes at Georgia Tech no points in his last three appearances Ro an airball and and the Cavaliers trailing by five send it the other way so youve got Notre Dame into the bench here a little bit IMS is in the lineup so is Sir muhamed The Freshman from Myers Park High School in Charlotte along with Kev J mat Alo and Braden shrewsburys back in meanwhile Virginias got DayDay Ames back on the floor now playing with the two fouls with McNeely tane Murray Kofi and Blake Buchanan thats because Burton is out of the game Alo with 12 to shoot out front Kei now heres Mohamad for Imes on the drive against Ames Shrewsberry shot clock winding down AO spins out of three J will be called for the over the pack first on Kevin J itll be the second on the Irish W each of these teams has played really well on the defensive end that was another very good defens I possession by Virginia and they were able to secure the Applause rebound its almost like one guy moves a chest piece the other guy moves a chest piece absolutely yep so Ames by the way staying on the floor with the two fouls here remember DayDay ases is averaging about six a game theres Kofi in traffic a win against Imes if he could score it cannot follow good now Virginia made that basket but Kofi caught that ball inside there was three guys around him Isaac mcney was alone in the corner the ball has to go out of there and go to the corner first guy other than mcney to score for the Cavaliers heres Shrewsberry spinning in traffic missed badly on the jumper it hit the foot of J itll go to Virginia this is the Virginia basket both MCN and Murray are wide open out on the perimeter with three guys around you you dont necessarily need to force it up in that was a good play a strong play but it wasnt the right play eight nothing run by the C ears in the last three minutes so despite what is really poor shooting here early Virginia a three to tie here their defense has kept them in the game McNeely thought about it back for ases I think McNeely always thinks about it and dreams of it leaving his hand and here it goes for the tie spins out rebound J Logan ases front Court Imes rather front Court a o got it Mato mush as hes known as his 33rd three of the Year well hes a very good threepoint shooter Wes 1711 Irish by six Notre Dame has hit four threes they average just less than eight a game Kofi a triple back R Malo the rebound he can make a three West but hes only 32 or 23 from out there I dont think thats a good shot 20 to shoot Shrewsberry and three and mamad challenged the rebound got deflected out Notre Dame will get a second chance back for sir muhamad out of the corner and his struggle from threepoint territory now three of 15 is the Freshman this season on the Drive Ames thought about Applause it heres mcne working against mohamd T Murray with 12 to shoot now heres ases and he threw it out in the midcourt area three to shoot Murrays got it hell throw it toward the glass Saunders had it taken away by Applause Music Alo sixpoint lead for the Applause Irish Virginia of course has stayed in the manto man and theyve played pretty well for the most part yep Notre Dame is 28 Virginias 29 ja trying to beat Kofi to the point at the Baseline with the right hand and well get another foul nope touch out of bounds itll stay with not to D Buchanan and roie check in for the Cavaliers and here comes Burton and Tay Davis back for michah Shrewsberry you talk about extra possessions Wes and maybe you dont need extra possessions just possessions there were three Cavaliers around that basketball and they couldnt control it and so Notre Dame gets the extra possession we have seen Notre Dame played nine Dan 10 yes weve seen Virginia play eight here in the opening 12 minutes Shrewsberry back R Miss boy Davis almost tapped it in still gets the rebound and scores first go for Tay Davis Tay Davis we talked about his aggressiveness and was on display right there but Power had the ball in his hands and Davis just took it away lead is back to eight now for Virginia or for not to a the Virginia drought is better than 2 and 12 minutes old theres roie floats it up got to got his own rebound roie cant finish Davis the rebound that was not a good POS possession for the Cavaliers there goes Tay Davis and one on the Buchanan foul second field goal for Davis Buchanan his first foul W you have a bad possession on offense it almost invariably turns in to an easy transition opportunity on the other end Davis is really battled inside he knocks the ball away recovers it and scores for Notre Dame and then the last time he just hes got an opportunity in transition takes it Notre Dame with a 10point lead a great great g a game I hope Janai broom can play and I hope hes healthy yep well Tay Davis is playing hes got Notre names last two field goals and a chance to cap a threepoint play he is 77 at the free throw line and knocks down what is his 90th free throw made in 116 tries he get five for Davis I say hes very aggressive on the offensive end and he gets to the line he and Burton have got 14 of Notre Ds 22 Irish have brought Burke chaher into the lineup young man from marota Georgia who transferred from Lehi its going to be really hard for Virginia if the only guy really scoring is Isaac mcneel yep hes got 11 of the 13 points ninepoint deficit for Virginia chaher Baseline spins out he has not played the last five games seeing action here tonight Burton on the drive blocked from behind out of bounds by ro T to shoot for Notre now MCN is the guy who wants to shoot the three but hes capable of taking it to the basket and you know if youre Notre Dame thats okay just get him off the threepoint line make him shoot twos Alo tried to put it in bounce does Davis the catch and a foul ball Jerry heer calls the hell ball possession will go to Virginia here first turnover for the night on Notre Dame I thought Elijah sandre was behind that play West but a really nice recovery sure absolutely 6 and A2 to go heres Buchanan Saunders inside against Burton cant finish tap follow good first bucket for the Phoenix Jr Elijah Saunders and thats a m mismatch that has been available a couple of times and thats the first time Virginia really took advantage of it mcneels four for five the rest of the team two for 14 in this first half Burton chaher out front heres Roper a three back rim and the rebound for roie working off a Buchanan screen kick for mcneels three got it 14 for McNeely Micah sberry punches a timeout just like that the Cavaliers to within four when we come back to Charlottesville Music Applause Music well Dan was here on Tuesday night when McNeely was on the proverbial burner this is quite a this is quite an oncore to that Dan well McNeely I mean the keep in mind Wes that the Notre Dame game plan was to not let Isaac mcne shoot threes and so far that hadnt worked out particularly well hes made four from out there and in the last two games hes gotten very hot well Ill say he is tearing it up here tonight hes got 14 in this first half of Virginias 18 but again and the amazing thing about that is that Notre Dames defense their defensive game plan was to stop him from doing exactly that hes 10 of 14 from three in his last game and almost a half here is Davis nice spin against Saunders finish great help by Buchanan that time and Davis when he takes the ball to the basket hes not looking to pass it so nice job by Buchanan to leave ji and help out theres a bounce pass they quickly get it for Saunders out of the corner thats power left it on the rim TJ power into the lineup he played 11 minutes the other night and the win against Boston College quick look in J the catch in the flush now J is not doesnt really give you a lot of offense but you cant leave him alone because he can do Applause that back to a sixpoint Notre Dame Advantage under five we go in this first half Saunders missed and J the rebound AO in the Irish Shrewsberry nice ball screen to get it to break into traffic with a right hand and it rolls around and drops BR shrewsburys first points Dan he comes in averaging almost 15 a game hes the 13th best scorer in the ACC now Virginias done a nice job on him so far but hes been patient he hadnt forced things yep powers going to get a few more minutes today because Sharma is out with an illness yeah isan Sharma missing the lineup tonight you cant have miss battle a wide open shot right in the paint when you miss shots like that that allows the other team to get down and go Burton skips it quickly look at the ball movement here Shrewsberry back for loo and Davis with 15 to shoot Tay on the drive around Buchanan scores seven now for Tay Davis in this opening half Wes when you get ball movement like that youre going to move the defense around get the Defenders out of position and that creates a driving lane and we said Davis is a guy who really likes to go to the basket noted a at an 8 nothing Run Virginia seven nothing run now the Irish are back on a 60 run mcney to end the Run K misses the three and a locko the rebound 10point lead now for Notre Dame they hit their last three shots from the floor every time Virginia gets close Notre Dame spurts away again and Burton hits the fourth straight bucket for the Irish and its another three hes got a dozen now on three triples and three of three line shooting if hes going to make threes like that hes going to be impossible to guard biggest lead of the ball game now for Notre aame at 13 Baseline Buchanon the bucket nice pass by mcne this this is a real Danger Zone in this game for Virginia West they cannot let this thing get out of hand look at Bon inside of three to go and Tay Davis working with Saunders defending Burton with t to shoot launches another and hits Marcus Burton wow okay what he supposed to do if youre ring I mean that was pretty good defense just better offense 15 for Burton the lead its largest now again at Applause 14 Saunders now McNeely out Applause front Ro tries to help three ball from in front of the Notre Dame bench is for Andrew roie his first points of the game and roie can be a key player for Virginia Davis under two minutes to go fresh men wait at the table but were going to get a break before that and now the ball off Burtons foot hell ball itll belong to Notre Dame but thatll get us to a timeout both teams could use a break here under two to go and as of late Marcus Burton has been the fire starter for the Irish 30 423 in favor of Notre a when we continue from Charlottesville after Music this e e e e all Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music I dont know how you get your arms around all of it Kevin to be honest with you we start at noon well finish I guess around midnight tonight look forward to you and coach and Huck at the break Marcus Burtons been driving the bus here for michah Shrewsberry D hes got 15 Davis off the inbounds right back for Shrewsberry a path with the right hand floater good Micah Shrewsberry now with a couple of field goals and the Irish push it back to 13 with 95 seconds to go before the Applause break oh what a half for Marcus Burt and for that matter Isaac McNeely good thing we promote promoted him at the top of the broadcast tonight inside thats Robinson The Catch and score Anthony Robinson a freshman from Peach Tree City Georgia who Red Shed a year ago gave him four points and four rebounds Off the Bench the other night and gets a basket here thats twice now weve seen screens set for McNeely and they attack mcney off the screen and he makes the bounce pass for a basket that was a tough play by Robinson yep Kevin ji going to come out he went down under the basket took a bit of a spill Nixon Dilan heres the Notre Dame basketball trainer who looks at after the 610 Junior ji and heres kesn back on the floor for the Irish Shrewsberry catch and shoot three is short and mcney finally the Music rebound Ames out front Ro Baseline slips it for Robinson tap follow no good Shrewsberry finally collects but Robinson did a great job getting position inside west but when youre that size and you get that ball that close to the basket you got to put it in the goal yep Burton constant doski he didnt even look at the basket nope T to shoot under a half minute to go Burton on the drive kick out Shrewsberry three ball good seven for Shrewsberry and now the Irish open up a 14point lead again theyve hit seven of their last eight from the floor theyre getting great ball movement and great player movement really making the Virginia Defense work very hard Ames winding down the drive and bucket for DayDay Ames his first points and that will send us to the locker room but boy Micah Shrewsberry whos trying to since the loss at Syracuse last Saturday this feels like a really really really big 20 minutes of basketball for both schools Melia three to start the half a back rim Miss and ball one over the backboard yep Ron gr Johnny on the spot will award it to Notre Dame now that was a tough three you know thats the first one that hes taken today he hadnt made them all up until this point but thats the first one that hes taken that was really hotly contested if mcne was at the top of mic shry Scouting Report before the game where do you think he was at halftime on top of the Whiteboard at the very top maybe on the wall heres Shrewsberry an open three in the Irish start where they left off 11 now or 10 rather on his fourth field goal for Michael Shrewsberry they are really taking advantage of mismatches Wes Davis drives into the lane you got to guard him with a couple of guys that leaves somebody open and that time the open player was shrew bear Kofi freshman from Seattle High arcing jump shot good right over the top of kevi goes Jak Kofi I if youre Notre Dame thats okay you know that was a tough shot early in the shot clock Virginias got to get some turnovers they have to tighten up on the defensive end boy Al loo is not going to let him rest nope second three of the night for matako and now the largest lead of the night for Notre Dame we just talked about Virginia having to tighten up on the defensive end and theyre giving up threes here to start the second half and the danger for the Cavaliers C is they might dig a hole too big to dig out of yep heres Kofi squaring on keevi couple of spins and a fall away thats good back to back field goals for Jacob Kofi and thats fine West except you cant trade two for three he averaged 11 and2 points out on the west coast last week in games against kin Stanford hes a young man that has some skills Shrewsberry another three spins off off day day as the rebound and here comes Ro in Music Applause Virginia heres a pull up by Ames and alako the rebound Alo trying to fight for space in transition in the corner Shrewsberry back for Burton another three bounces away McNeely the rebound now remember Notre Dame has lived and died a little bit this year with threes and they turned it over that time does Virginia and Davis has it for the Irish well Notre Dame was fabulous in the first 15 minutes of their last game against Syracuse and then not so much later on and Virginia has to find a little magic here to get back in this game theres a loo with tend to shoot now backing down on ases revers is Pivot now in traffic tries to squeeze it and a hell ball and it will stay at the Irish end of the floor thats really good individual defense by DayDay Ames nobody came to help her and it was very clear that a lock was trying to get it down in there but again theres only 35 left on the shot clock yep see how this possession resolves itself inbounds quickly now Burton slides through and they tried to bounce it out and it hit the foot and theres 11 on the shot Applause clock wow theres going to be 20 now yep on the kick that is a big break for Dame yep but thats sort of the way the game is gone for the Cavaliers up to this point feels that way right Alo Notre Dame just looks very comfortable on this end of the court now the ball movement still pretty crisp heres Davis skips out kevi High arching three good how about Kevin ji knocking down his fifth three of the year and thats 10 now for Notre Dame in the fifth time theyve done that this year hit ten or more the lead has gone to 17 and Kofi cant answer well ji doesnt shoot a lot of Threes but he makes a pretty high percentage theres Davis a shot fake draws the foul and were going to get free throws for Tay Davis great foul will be on Jacob Kofi itll be his second the First on Virginia and the Freshman from Seattle sends Tate Davis to the line where he had seven in the first half well after that last Virginia Miss Notre Dame was able to get out in transition and Davis with his attacking Tendencies is really hard to guard in transition quick reminder ESPN 2 Monday night big big womens basketball match up TOA powpow number two South Carolina theyre on Rocky Top to see 17th ranked Tennessee coverage starts at 700 eastern on ESPN 2 and again like most every Arena bacon is the reward for another Tay Davis Miss nope they dont give bacon away everywhere some place they give cookies away here is bacon here its bacon yes it is and some people even come dressed as bacon well disappointed you didnt do that tonight Dan well Im sorry youre going to have to live with your disappointment mcney thought about it back for roie 18point lead for Notre Dame trying to win on the road for the first time in 11 months Ro a triple and constant ski pulls it off Nikita the grad transfer from the Ukraine and played last year in Monmouth hell take the pass and travel so thatll get us to a timeout Irish with the big lead we out of threepoint shots well they sure did West theyre getting great movement without the basketball theyre getting the ball inside causing the defense to collapse guys are open from three you see the first and second half numbers thats right 50 from three they are 10 of 20 from behind the line W theyre shooting 50 from behind the line 36 from inside the line so they I mean theyre doing anything they want on the offensive end yep and Virginias only consistent answer tonight has been Isaac McNeely and he has not scored in the second half yeah and the Cavaliers only have four points here in the second half both jump shots by Kofi br ger helping us do a little housekeeping here at the table very kind of him and front Court comes Day Day Ames against Marcus Burton Nikita constant owski stays in the ball game to play the post hell get a foul off the ball on Matt Alo the grad transfer from Princeton who by the way I mean interesting to hear michah Shrewsberry talk about the fit in the transfer portal that Alo is yes does everything they expected of him and has been a key contributor especially during Burtons absence sir Mohamed wears jersey number four for the Irish The Freshman is back on the floor a first time in the second half Baseline RO with four to shoot Fall Away on loo and constant owski pulls away the rebound theres Nikita strength right around the rack defense in rebounding H Dames defense has done a nice job keeping Virginia out of the lane for the most part mohamd rolls into the lane against Buchanan and scores sir muhamed on the board and for the seventh time this year Virginia faces a 20point deficit well thats a tough defensive matchup for Buchanan roie skips it across from mcney now Ro slashes through mcne tes up a three and it rattled out Robinson tried to battle constant owski and it will stay with Virginia but lets go back to the Freshman sir Muhammad Dan well Muhammad is Hes listed as a guard Wes and he is a kid with some skills and they were looking to him to maybe help be one of their point guards and so thats a really hard matchup for the 610 Buchanan but Michael shrewbury probably smiling a little bit cuz mohammd put it on the deck and looked to score yeah said hes got he playing games and he share the ball maybe unnecessarily at times if you ever believe that in college basketball heres Robinson inside hell draw the foul and Mohamad late on the rotation defensively Wes and one of the reasons that Notre Dames defense has been so good is theyve kept Virginia out of the lane and these are Virginias first free throws of the game yep and they belong to Anthony Robinson and this red shirt freshman from Peach Tree City at the free throw line and the first one drops in for Robinson dont forget tomorrow three ladies games on the card on the ACC Network North Carolina host Florida State at noon BC Wake Forest at two theres a gymnastics break for the meet between Stanford and pit well wrap it up with number 20 NC State Virginia Tech at 6 on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app one of two at the line for Robinson if youre Virginia you need some stops y here is Davis on the drive into traffic against Buchanan tend to shoot for a lock up and going to get a hand check and a foul I think thats McNeely and it will be thatll be just the second foul of the half on Virginia and the first on the Junior from Poco West Virginia the former dott if you will Isaac mcney yes his high school nickname was dots POA Applause Music dots Alo waiting on Shrewsberry to round off the screen six to shoot Robinson helping out at distance heres Davis three to shoot floater with a right hand too strong and Anthony Robinson clears the rebound okay you got your stop Wes now you got to start climbing back in youve got to be able to score ases flashes cant get through reroutes heres Robinson turning with the right hand he lost it on the way up and noted a the other way with a 19point lead s minutes gone in this second half at jpj tonight in Charlottesville Cavaliers they have won 38 of their last 44 theyre two and2 in home ACC play losses to Louisville and Applause SMU Alo rolling into traffic back rim Miss constant owski slapped it out a loo will give Notre Dame another opportunity thats really tough on your defense West you play really hard for almost the entire shot clock and now you give him 20 more AO against Robinson bounce pass Nikita the catching layup constant tonski who didnt have any points in 12 minutes the other day at Syracuse is on the board and the lead is 21 and well take a break in charlotsville Notre Dame has not seen Virginia hit from the floor in the last 6 minutes Music 21point lead for Notre Dame boy after a week off Michael shrewsburys got to feel pretty good about the way his teams played here in the first 28 minutes of the ball game tonight I hate having a week off after you lose and so to come out and play like this after that week off certainly makes you feel a lot better and again this is Notre Dame and Virginia sort of teams in the same position in the standings this is a very important game its not like its going to determine the ACC Championship but it might determine who doesnt make the ACC tournament yeah this is uh youre going to hear a a current theme about the bottom of the ACC well talk about it next when we Music continue e e e e chicken Applause well this is the first year of 18 teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference and of course the tournament in Charlotte at Spectrum Center will only feature 15 of the 18 so were going to spend part of the month of February looking at the bottom nine of the ACC and Dan you dont want to say anybodys out but BC on overtime loss today in Chapel Hill that hurt a little bit Miami later tonight in Berkeley against the Golden Bears NC State fell today Notre name in Virginia theyre trying to get north tonight thats why this ball game in some ways they feel a little momentum certainly the Cavaliers did after the win against BC Micah shrewbury coming off a week long break its interesting to see how all of this is going to be played out until we get to Charlotte well right at the moment Virginia has the tiebreaker over NC State at two and six because theyve beaten NC State Applause and of course that is the only meeting this year between the Wolfpack and the Cavaliers so head tohead by the way Jacob kofis knocked down the free throw hes now got eight in the ball game and McNeil he still hadnt scored in the second half yep Irish have tried to take the Cavaliers number 11 out of play here after a RedHot first half Davis in traffic with a right hand and got the roll Tay Davis fourth field goal of the night double figures for Davis now Virginias missed their last six shots they havent had a field goal in the last seven minutes lead 21 for Notre Dame yanan heres Saunders whos been very quiet pull up jumper rolled off thats one of the reasons for Virginias offensive struggles is Saunders is a guy who has to produce for them and he only has two points tonight Jr kesn who had a really good game against the Cavaliers a year ago into the ball game Shrewsberry and down the lane goes Burton floater good for Marcus Burton with 17 those are his first points of the second half now hes made some threes today but thats I think the best part of his game and look at that Virginia now they came into the game with 17 scoring droughts of 330 or more so two in this game yep Notre Dame with another run double figures Wise Its hard to win if you cant score Wes yeah that part hadnt change much and theres a bump and a foul on Burton second on the sophomore from Muka and the fourth on the Irish DayDay Ames comes back tamee Murray going to get in the lineup yanan and Ry sit down for Ron Sanchez and michah shury told us earlier today when they went back to work during their week off they spent the first couple of days working on nothing but their defense and I think that has really paid off for them long three by mcney bounding high and Davis with the rebound start looking at Tate Daviss numbers you can see why hes a candidate for the accs most improved player hes really done a good job there goes Burton on the drive we going to get a foul on ases J baby thatll be his third third on the Cavaliers here at half two I thats ams first foul since early in the game where he picked up two early fouls and I think that sort of hurt the Virginia Defense they werent able to be quite as aggressive and boy but Davis you talk about aggressive hes a guy who really likes to get the ball and go to the basket Burton out front working against ases now Shrewsberry pushes a three away and Neely the long rebound for the Cavaliers n and a half to play Kofi thought about it Virginia needs buckets Saunders for Kofi oh dumped on the three tried to drive for the two Saunders will follow the Miss second field goal for Elijah Saunders well the problem for the Cavaliers Wes is not only do they need stops and baskets but they need stops and baskets quickly yep you this is not a defense thats designed to force a lot of turnovers but they could use some turnovers right now Burt back into the traffic for J knocked away Murray couldnt get to it itll stay with the Applause Irish three three on the shot Applause clock kesn on the spot throw in lob and were going to get a foul on Kofi and its going to be a flagrant foul yeah Jerry heers already whistled the flagrant foul on Kofi itll be his third thatll be the fourth on Virginia so keev ji will shoot a pair of free throws here well this is a situation where ji goes up for the basket and and Kofi just grabs him by the arm and pulls him down I mean this is really an easy one I mean hes not making any sort of a play on the ball at all free throw good and remember the playr foul penalty its two shots and the ball yeah Kevin Josh started his college career with Michael Shrewsberry Penn State came over in the portal when Shrewsberry took the job in South B and one of my favorite quotes a year ago Michael shrewbury said kevi one of his most important jobs with our team at Notre Dame is to spread the Laughter gospel and and you know what in todays college basketball Dan hes got a really good point well keep in mind that last year uh Notre Dame returned what was it 16 of their points thats correct yeah so they were all new this year they returned 85 theyre number one in the ACC and production return theres Davis a nice floater for the bucket Tay Davis now five and a half a dozen in the ball game and the Burton injury quite honestly sidetracked them y you you know nobody talks about the fact that they say oh Notre Dame lost these games and they dont get any credit if you will for losing the games with Burton out of there yeah but it did derail them heres Burton on a steel McNeely to beat Marcus Burton will take it down and lay it in easily 19 now for Burton Virginia really doesnt have anybody who take the ball and beat you off the dribble like Burton they dont have a burton on their team and that has really affected them ahead of 8 minutes to go tonight in Charlottesville and Notre Dame in front by Music 27 e e e e e Music Music all right big night at Neville Arena down at Auburn and of course uh Brian kuster and Richard Hendrick standing by tonight in fville for the Sooners and the Hogs as Saunders scores for the Cavaliers here tonight in Charlottesville and draws the foul on kevi second on ji and the fifth on the Irish here in the second half thats a pretty good inbound pass and we mentioned that Saunders has been very very quiet tonight he tried to dunk that one in and nice job not panicking but to recover and lay it in and now missed the opportunity for the threepoint play so sers who averaged 14 half and eight in his last two ball games has but four here tonight and a pretty steep climb here for Virginia and were going to get an offensive foul on ji trying to set the ball screen on the pass toward kesn won would be a pretty steep climb for anybody at this point in the game but remember this is a Virginia team that traditionally does not play quickly Y and thats kind of where Virginia was in Tony Bennetts Administration and that and that pillar hasnt changed much at all Dan with Ron Sanchez heres what were talking about the the right there at the top that 353 in Pace of play that team won the National Championship so this is traditional Virginia basketball but it works very well when youre ahead its really hard when youre behind by 25 yep with s and a half to go its where the Cavaliers find themselves now as we see Notre Dame with Julian rooper the second back on the floor here for the first time Alo tried to skip it to the corner for Davis turned over by the Irish and here is roie they quickly move it for Saunders a three ball and good Elijah Saunders its his 23rd three of the year hes got seven in the ball game he actually is a very high percentage threepoint shooter didnt shoot many of them yeah for 68 240 transfer from San Diego State here goes rooper trying to squeeze inside thatll be an offensive foul on roer his first itll be the seventh on Notre Dame but no free throws fifth turnover on the Irish dont forget big Monday coming up womens basketball number two South Carolina number 17 Tennessee from Knoxville tip time at 700 eastern on ESPN 2 and always available for you on the ESPN app tahena powpow Don Staleys team the only marker the lost to UCLA Kofi at the foul line and he rolls in for it Jacob Kofi in double figures Applause now freshman from Seattle Constantin noski sir muhamd now loo back on the floor heres Marcus Burton eight to shoot for the Irish Michael Shrewsbury tells three to go to work oh he pivoted at the foul line almost lost it got deflected and blocked with the shot clock going down thatll be a shot clock violation on the Cavalier or on the Irish thanks to Virginias good defense its not often you have two shots blocked on the same guy has two shots blocked on the same possession yeah last year they had 25 of those theyre average since 2018 its been 27 Dan thats just eight this year for the Cavaliers now this is a Cavalier team that still plays very good defense but theyre not Elite defensively as they have been Burton limps over to the sideline well keep an eye on Marcus Burton with Nixon dilion at the noted aim pitch out front heres Kofi a high arching three thats good Jacob Kofi leads Virginia scoring its a 10 nothing run by the Cavaliers to cut it down to 17 and with 541 to go a timeout Tak it here after Kofi drops home another threepointer now Kofi comes in shooting 23 from out there on the season and so I think if youre Notre Dame youre comfortable with him taking that shot from out there but I think Michel Shrewsberry was upset with the fact that nobody came to pressure him at all yeah even a 23 free throw threepoint shooter you give him that much time and room hes going to shoot a little higher percentage and Marcus Burton going to the locker room is headed toward the Notre Dame locker room here and remember now he missed seven games earlier in the year he was uh injured in the ruter game November 26th and did not come back for about 5 weeks reappearing against North Carolina in South Bend on January 4th fourth wow now this looks like its going to be a big win for Notre Dame but that would be thatd be a really tough way to get it if you lose Burton yep the Irish play Tuesday night by the way at prel Pavilion against Georgia Tech who is going to have had a SixDay break in their calendar since the win against Virginia Tech Wednesday night in Atlanta and Georgia Tech another one of those teams thats sort of in the same position as Notre Dame in Virginia Shrewsberry with five lost the handle on it now for Davis strong to the basket missed the shot Ro the rebound for Virginia 17point game Cavaliers got a hurry here goes Murray to the basket missed the layup and Braden Shrewsberry brings it quickly front court and loo now will direct this offense if youre Notre Dame you you want to keep moving the ball you want to keep moving the players you you dont need to move as quickly as you did before but you dont want to lose your momentum by taking the air out of it now heres mohamd who is a pretty good ball handler and that time Davis got it knocked away and here goes Day Day Ames over dribbled maybe once gets it to Saunders back for the trailing Kofi McNeely waiting at the table lob Kofi cant finish constan owski the rebound Virginia got a steal West and had an advantage in transition but Notre Dame got back and so what could have been a possible layup for Virginia ends up a contested shot Irish have gone four minutes without a field goal here Dan but still a 17point lead Shrewsberry constant owski second field goal good hes not going to hurt you from anywhere except close to the basket but he catches the ball nicely in there yep that was a nice little lofted shot out front heres DayDay Ames teeing up a lefty three the rattles in 13th three of the year for Darren Sylvester Ames Applause Jr Burton is on his way back from the locker room and actually into a little soft jog behind the scores table which is good to see theres Marcus and thatll get us to a time out we get a front Court stoppage of play Irish by 16 when we continue from Music Charlottesville e e e e e Music Music Music Applause absolutely from fville thank you Kevin those two teams also trying to make a move in the SEC Dan Oklahoma at Arkansas Marcus Burton has returned to the lineup and Micah Shrewsberry needs a quick timeout thats next with Brian kuster and Richard Henrick from Bud Walton Arena on a night where Virginia has seen Notre Dame come off a bye if you will in their ACC schedule and the Irish have knocked down 10 threes and 21 tries and noted a on verge of winning on the road in the ACC for the first time since last February when they beat Louisville cards are a different cup of tea by the way this year than they were season ago but Dan as we said at the top both these teams are looking to continue momentum Notre Dame schedule weve already mentioned Tuesday night Damon STM brings the jackets to South Ben and then you see the four after that I I got to believe Notre Dame feels like they got a chance to make some ground here I think so too Wes these are teams that are all sort of on the same level as Notre Dame its not like you dont see Duke and Clemson and Louisville lined up there Applause that doesnt mean theyll win the games but yep if they play like this they got a shot in all those yeah Blue Devils by the way went to 9 and0 today with the win at Winston Salem against Wake Forest and a big game Tuesday night on acc Network in the ACC with weight visting Louisville those are two of the four top teams theres Shrewsberry a three thats good and I think that game is a much bigger game for Wake Forest than it is for Louisville with all these at projections you see Wake Forest has gotten themselves buried by the net measurement and a win against a Louisville team in Louisville who really help the Wake Forest Demon deons pretty encouraging second half for Jacob Kofi here Dan Kofi now has got 13 in the half and 15 in the ball game hes actually just taken the Virginia scoring lead from Isaac mcne i m Neely has yet to score in the second half and its possible that the Notre Dame defense has adjusted and they think okay we have we have a lead its much better if Kofi gets two at a time than McNeely starts getting three at a time so thats not to thats not to diminish anything Kofi has done mcney the foul six now on Virginia but the lead still 17 for the Irish and Davis on the drive and gets his own rebound cant score it and therell be a foul call from the perimeter and thats on the Cavaliers Elijah Saunders Wes that is a perfect example of the skill level of Tay Davis he went in there there was a lot of contact he missed the shot but he bounced back up before the other two Virginia guys were able to and got the ball again and draw drew the foul he has really developed into some kind of player you start looking at his numbers a year ago in the ACC free throw by Davis no good his numbers have improved marginally in each of the core categories especially on the offensive end coaches to be the one to have to tell you where hes grown defensively and the second one good to keep the bacon at Bay for the Cavalier faithful Wes he got that you know he was off balance when he landed after missing that shot but he was able to recover quicker than the Virginia guys Saunders off a behind the back pass from McNeely missed the three and we go up on two minutes now to play in the ball game and a comfortable 18point lead for Notre Applause Dame Isaac McNeely kept the game close for a while but then Notre Dame was just able to pull away I mean great ball movement great player movement they made threes yep Fall Away Burton no good mcney by the way was five of seven from the floor in the first half hes 0 for three here in the second half theres tame Mur Mur hell knock down a three thats just his ninth of the year and his first points of the night Murray a senior from Auckland in the north island of New Zealand scratching for Ron Sanchez dont forget coming up bottom of the hour here in just moments on the other side about 6 minutes away now over on ESPN its number one alurn welcoming number six Tennessee to Neville Arena tonight on the planes Jay bis Dan Schulman and Jess Sim standing by for coverage tonight over on ESPN well Marcus Burton ACC Rookie of the Year a season too thought about the draft and to be honest with you he came back and Dan hes making the rest of the ACC pay for it well he sure is Wes and what you see hes made threes today hes had that signature driving into Lan through the jump shot and then he just really good instincts on defense that was an easy one y so Burton who came in averaging nearly 19 points a game in the regular season he does not factor into the ACC scoring honors because hes not appeared in enough ball games where they average your field goals made per game if he were eligible hed be second in the league well you can see theyre four for six shooting threes tonight in an ACC play he came in as an almost 40 shooter from out there yep but in ACC games West he came in only having made nine threes so he made almost half of the number of Threes that he made in his previous five games tonight yep and hes a guy who when we get to the Midway Point midweek in the ACC hes going to be a guy youre going to look at and say hes one of the five best players in the league when hes on the floor well weson and that him making 43s tonight that is a danger signal to the rest of the ACC with as quick as he is and as hard as you have to work to keep him from getting by you if hes going to be able to shoot threes like that thats going to make him really tough to go D thats an 8 markup from where he was a year ago behind the line and he fouled by sand or Saunders in the back court so Marcus Burton will go to the line here and a chance to add a couple of free throws he had 28 last Saturday in loss at Syracuse and he spins out the front end of the one and one well West that Syracuse game was really weird he made 10 of his first 15 shots and then only two of his last 11 Notre Dame had a big lead and let it slip away mcney cant buy one in the second half Burton will bring it front Court Notre name trying to break 70 points in this building talk about joining an elite list only two other teams have done it in the last 65 games and the Irish on the verge of doing it here tonight Alo three to shoot here goes Burton kick out for Tay Davis a three ball good and Tay Davis puts the Irish over 70 Music points well Davis only shoots about 25 from out there but thats the way the game is gone for noted aame tonight final minute to go aims the left 53 eight now for DayDay ases 15point game at 7257 and michah Shrewsberry team could feel pretty good about getting their third ACC win here tonight well predict coming off that week off after a loss this really has to be a get better game for Notre Dame a Feelgood game and it really Applause was oh Burton on the Applause drive his 18th career 20 point game for Marcus Burton tonight hes now had 20 or more in four straight and five of his last six Kofi in the final five seconds and a nice second half for Jacob Kofi but its going to come in a losing effort because the Irish are going to win by a final of 74 59 and Dan in doing so Notre name is going to beat Virginia and John Paul Jones Arena
