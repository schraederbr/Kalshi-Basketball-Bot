man was he something to watch back in the early 70s yeah I watched him from a very close distance for two years yes you did TI controlled by the Tar Heels and here we go this is Elliot Kau the sophomore out of West Orange New Jersey tar Hills feel very good about where they are on the quote unquote Wings their guard play the one two and three positions but theyve got to start getting more offensively up front and and uh atypically though this team one of the shortest teams in the country the 300 in the 300s as you say the perimeter very good but uh you know very short along the front line number two the man to keep an eye on for the Explorers as that shot is Off the Mark that is Cory mckian he is their leading score hes off to a great start this year Lal has won six of its first 10 games and of course they legendary head coach boy did we enjoy our time with bran duny yesterday when I say 76 years young I mean 76 years young theres RJ D from downtown its too strong and the rebound ripped out of there by Andre morero the native of Venezuela couple of good looks at D for Davis in the first two offerings there and you know and we talked to Huber Davis about it and you know for you know last year you know Davis was at the top of the scouting report but there were a bunch of other guys there with him this year hes there by himself thats not to say there are other guys who are going to be joining him as thats Demetrius Lily you got to keep an eye on him he can shoot it from downtown their last game he had 12 points in the first half and a loss against St Joes and then he injured his wrist and did not play the rest of the game if he plays the second half they probably win the game hes the tallest guy on the floor for them so you know Carolina you probably want him shooting out there but that one stripped out of bounds out of the hands of Ben Allen Luben who is a transfer Junior from vanderbelt hes only averaging six points a game last year for the commodor he averaged almost 13 points and seven rebounds well and its you know with with the with the portal you know everybody thinks youre going to plug right in and you know pick up on where your numbers were from last year and then thats not always the case its different systems and you know different surroundings different players so it takes a little bit of time little floater by Davis is too short and Lily rips away the rebound an early three nothing Advantage for L its important for a visiting team in this building to get off to a big start and theres ly off the glass against a much smaller SE Trimble this the thing against this Carolina team you dont have to worry about a shot blocker visually it looks open inside so you can feel confident well youve known Fran duny a long time hes a graduate of Lal yep hes coached at uh you know three of the big five if you will in Philadelphia pen followed by Temple 17 NCAA tournament appearances for his teams through the years and now in his third season at his Alma moer 67 career wins thats 42nd on the alltime NCAA coaching wins list and thats the only reason he came back is his alamada you know he was out of the game thought he was retired you know he was going to watch High School basketball games and they called him and they said they needed help and uh he answered the call they you know they they gave him a shot as a a high school kid recruited him he had a great career there theres Lily again and this time its off the mark and pulled out of there by Drake po one of two very talented freshman for the Tar Heels getting a lot of playing time kadoo turns it over and unfortunately for him and Hubert Davis that has occurred frequently of late really out in force the error that time and theres a three by jalile white just his fourth in nine attempts on the year double figure score for them though just under 12 points a game and another Miss three by the Tar Heels how going to go to the rack hes got that body to get to the rack and hell draw the foul by white and he probably should do that more only six free throw attempts on the year for him and uh shooting you know five of six so its probably something he should look to do more get inside get to the line use that athletic body you know he made his first career start against Alabama uh a couple of games ago we had a big game against Michigan State 18 points for Hubert Daviss team but then you know he he comes back and does not score at all in the win Over Georgia Tech Hubert Davis of course a great player here in North Carolina played in the NBA for a long long time he played under Dean Smith was an assistant for 9 years under Roy Williams and pow hits both free Applause throws you know were going to have Alexander Julian on on in a little bit in the broadcast and Im going to give Huber props still wearing a sport coat a lot of the after Co a lot of of the uh a lot of the coaches went uh warmup suits never came back from that kudos to Hubert for wearing the sport coach absolutely coach dumpys got the code hes looking good I do too Im with you and yes Alexander Julian whos a uh atar heel born and Bre wide openen three missed this time by Jaylen Withers whos just checked into the game for North Carolina replacing pow and this is their best player the Kean pitches it out to White thought about pulling the trigger and now they got a mismatch underneath look like white got away with an elbow and theres a takeaway Davis to the rack and one and theres the speed up the floor for North Carolina in transition and thats exactly what Davis needed to get off the SCH big guys have been in this program and what theyre lacking this year that inside presence and um you know what theyre going to need in you know especially on the on the rebounding and the defensive side thats what Peter Davis was stressing to us today just some physicality inside Boy Sam Perkins after all these years is still fifth on that list well and and how about he was a stretch for before they knew what that was and what about the outside shooting that he brought in his pro career yeah he was such a great player you know your career and his career are very similar to one another you guys uh you know three years where youre an AllAmerican you both walked out of your respective schools you and Duke Kim and Carolina you guys are both in the top 10 all time in the ACC scoring as theres a nice lefthanded Drive by The Freshman Ian Johnson rebounds block shots you guys did it all and youre still in the top six in all of those categories in the history of Atlanta Coast Conference basketball well it just well now Tom its just nobodys staying right four years and uh nobodys staying in the same school for four years well and that when you saw that list a second ago all of those guys were fouryear players yeah y some of them 5e thats right thats right so were not at a eight Applause and kadoo will head back to the sideline well Ian Jacksons been on a pretty good run here lately hes a guy to keep an eye on at 23 10 for 17 in the game against al contact underneath no whistle and ripped out of there by desan sheeper well in uh North Carolina too they they havent been settling for the three theyve been attacking the basket great defensive play swatted out of there by Withers and it last touched and Applause Explorer Withers a transfer after three years at Louisville in his second year with North Carolina well and Washington took the body that time and that allowed Withers to come in as a secondary Defender and get the Applause block thats a nice bounce pass and the bucket is good by Washington on a nice pick roll right there the feed from RJ Davis yeah I just I love the the change in Attitude great easy simple bounce pass attack the rim no shot blocking there for the Explorers you know when youre not shooting the ball well from the perimeter time build build From the Inside Out build the confidence see the ball going through the rim then you can work out maybe you know the jump shot starts falling and Washington completes a threepoint play he got a good start to this season to D jayen Washington hes 610 I mean hes got some size to him now well you got to you have to rmle the Head fake the foul on morero that is an 110 Carolina run and you play against pressure that is you are dead you throw it in the corner like that right there you are you you cant see good big double team active like that um theres just nowhere to go great defense Music active and we get our first look Lal fans get their first look at number three right there in the bottom leftand corner of your screen Eric AO as a free throw is no good and an offensive rebound for North Carolina 13 Tarheels they step out and looking good feed again and just not ready for the pass was Washington that was a good pass by Davis but theres Eric Aker hes a transfer from Long Island University an all NEC uh rookie performer last year was a New York City MVP of the city championship game its the first game hes been eligible to play after transferring and they like his future well we talked to a friend dumpy yesterday and he said you know for the last five games theyve been got a great finish there hes been practicing like hes going to play that game practicing with the first unit in anticipation of this game today jayen Withers with the bucket and thats sa his first shot bump fade and a foul is going to go against white and that will be number two on Jalil white and they may have to send him to the bench with just under 13 minutes to go in the opening half yep coach dumpys going to bring in tunde volberg fasi a sophomore who grew up in Music Sweden and hell come in after the free throw Applause also a pair of changes for North Carolina Ty Claude well check in along with Kad next week Courtside Saturday double header chessnut Hill We Begin ACC newcomer of the Year SMU visits Boston College then Louisville goes down to Florida State all gets underway 12 Eastern 9 Pacific man thats a lane violation Withers Mo missed them both anyway how about uh how about lilles uh in their first his first uh introduction to Louisville Kentucky today thats exactly right Pat Kel Pat Kelce first trip to rup aren is the head coach I tell you that guy will get it going down there yes he will hell get it going hes an excellent coach yeah and I saw that when he was in assistant with skip crer Wake Forest years ago hes the winner ly in the paint and it wont go down he was making those and the started this this one and Jackson The Freshman keeps his dribble alive they need this guy to start making shots bang bang thats Kade Tyson they had high hopes for him after he transferred in from Belmont this year he has this year in another year and is really struggle theres Jones with a basket at the other end dece Jones hes a really good looking front well for Tyson you know when you make that transition up from a mid major same spot different result but uh great follow playing with a lot of confidence you know you see that first one go down did a nice job following his Miss Lily another three and Im not sure thats what they were looking for Coach duny screaming along the sideline his team is fall and behind by 10 and make it 12 this a good strong inside game to start this one for Carolina thats Tai BL hes another guy that really could pay benefits for them a big body again rebounder but he got great position inside this is a 202 run for the Tar Heels some of their best basketball early part of this season uniforms here time Ive had the great privilege of working with five different coaches here and its its been just a thrill Alexander Im going to have to talk with you about Hallowed Ground and maybe about 10 miles from here but uh well i Ive never quite been there well Im going to Im going to have to take you let me just say you look great in the Hornets un yeah and I was I was privileged to wear your design down there in a number of years ago with number 42 work very well in fact we have a shot of that of Mike jinsky Dawning the uh the Charlotte Hornets J there there he is in the background back there I was the size are two larger than Mugsy B Jr great team and they still we wear uh your stuff from time to time right no there theres a theres a a new day version it um I I would like to go back to the uh original myself but not up to me I hear you I hear you but youre I mean you show up to the basketball games and youre looking like a million bucks I mean I I Im just trying to you know just trying to put something together with the pullover its a labor alone so are you designing a bill bich hoodie um we are working on a new argal hoodie yes but but you know coach belich is known for that but he is evidently a man of true style and has great appreciation for fine tailoring and suits and jackets and uh I look forward to um working with it you know its funny you say that because I I was talking with somebody before the game today uh and they were surprised how sharp he looked the other day and I said hey look for people who have been around him at all he takes a lot of pride in that he knows what hes doing how how is the sleeveless look going to go and are you going to have a sleeveless line lets lets um cross that come to it all right and hopefully we dont come to it Carolina leading 221 what a run its been after L got off to a good start so pleased to see these guys looking so great looking for a foul the Tarheel fans and North Carolina has the basketball Kau up the other way Ian Jackson to the rack and its h in the rim well Mr Julian I dont want to take your time I know youre watching the ball game thank you so much for coming by sucess go Alexander Julian born right here in Chapel Hill and U still has a store here makes his home here went to college here and man he looks sharp I Im embarrassed sitting next to him with what Im wearing we got to get him to design CW Network po what do you think Im sure Im sure theyre listening so uh we take that under advisement I dont know if theyre listening listen well well see Im sure well find out Mac ATN the transfer junor gets his first bucket averages about 12 minutes per game thats to strong on the open look after hitting his first one hes missed two in a row now as Kade Tyson and look what I out and then miss the layup hell try it again and it rolls out thats Ty Claud transferred in from Georgia Applause Tech lot of Second Chance opportunities for North Carolina which is a a good sign that hasnt been a strength of their so far in the season and thats you know in general time and and Hubert Davis talked about this today at a shoot around they can score the ball that has not been an issue its been stopping people y I mean theyre theyre right at the top in offense but they are dead last in the league in in defense and in his one word today unacceptable every Tuesday this winter NXT bringing the heat to CW trick Williams defends his title this Tuesday against Eddie th catch all the action on WWE NXT Tuesday 8 Eastern 7 Central right here on Fox North Carolina ranks off defensively number one in the ACC and 19th overall at 86 points a game but as you mentioned where they are in the ACC how about 333rd in the country in defense thats not going to cut it rebound underneath by Claude slapped out of bounds still North Carolina ball well you brought up an old Carolina Alum today Doug Mo who was coach out of the out in Denver with the nuggets and their Mantra were going to score 130 if you can score 135 you can beat us right and that happened a lot unfortunately yeah and I know that Hubert doesnt want to play that way theres the takeaway two on one and lefthanded thats a nice move by duche Jones this guys going to be a good player yeah and you know its F Fran dumpy said today that you know sometimes the teams greatest strength could be a weakness and he wondered if if North Carolina could be run on and this this l team will play at Applause Tempo Hes a Philly guy I mean he is just straight Philly through and through you know you talked about the only reason hes back he told us he says you know in 1966 they gave me a chance as a player in 1979 they gave me a chance as a coach an assistant coach and he said when they called there was no way I was going to say no just got a new remake on their Arena lot of good things happening in uh at that school yeah thats the sparkling new John Blazer Arena theyre 4 and0 so far at home in that building stripped out of there and thats off the knee balberg pazi you we were talking about it yesterday this guy was a really good player now thats his career average okay his last two years he averaged over 18 points a game and they lost one game his senior year thats a nice move to the rack by Elliot Kau his first bucket and you know for him he was really getting to the free throw line his first few games I think he needs to get back to that attacking the basket not settling for jump shots thats a beautiful pass and then another one AER his first bucket as and explore thats nicely done he you know its one thing to practice its another thing to get out here on the court and find your way with your teammates in live Applause action RJ Davis left alone in the corner and rattles it in his first Applause three theres Jones trapped in the corner and a News Network to find newsnation on your television go to newsnation nowcom RJ Davis averages 18 per game he has five through almost the first 13 minutes nine different Carolina players have scored so far in this game a big lift From the Bench guys coming in giving them nice scoring there and nobody you know just really spread out pull up jumper is too strong the Kean is still sitting on the bench Im wondering if hes injured he is not scored and he averages 19 per game its been a big surprise for them too hes up the scoring average 10 points from last year thats a catch of moves got to make and then a turnover at the other end good pass for me and Jackson and laying it in as Withers his second basket Carolinas had good passing for most of this first Applause half we were laughing about that with Huber Davis before the game today so you know they they they rarely ever show the uh the assist and you made the comment and they rarely ever show plays from the team that lost the game yeah I mean you know the the highlights are are usually spectacular plays from the losses and uh you know everybody its the home runs the spectacular plays that are shown on Tik Tok or Instagram or what you know its its but its the good solid basic plays that win games make an easy pass to an open teammate desan Shepard is 74 free throw shooter and here comes their leading scorer the aforementioned Cory mck you know it it really is an easy game but we make we can make it very difficult some sometimes players can make it a lot more difficult than it is Shephard hits them both so McKean is coming back he got the two fouls early on we figured though that you know look youre playing with a little bit of house money here lets be honest Carolina might be off to a slow start theres a nice pass and Davis had it knocked away and then Jackson bangs it in from the 20 boy therere high on Ian Jackson yeah I mean the the Freshman have been really good for this team of course uh its right down the road in Durham where a couple of freshmen are getting a lot of pub and rightfully so especially flag with Huber Davis he loves his Duo especially of Jackson and pal Jackson has 52 points in the last three games and shepher loses a handle and thats a turnover really solid defensive possession that time the shot clock was winding down and forcing the Music Applause turnover so 3218 closing in on 5 minutes to go this is CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands Applause Carolina shooting 52 from the field only 30 from three and thats their sixth turnover here in the opening half yeah but that 30 time is an improvement over what theyve been in the last two games Applause here well youre not kidding I mean in fact you look at the last two and you brought up the numbers earli but some perhaps not with us 10 for 52 from Music three and this is a change of pace for North Carolina not falling behind and falling behind big in the first half they were down by eight against Georgia Tech theyve been down by eight or more this year well and theyve gotten a nice mix though theyve gotten out in the open floor and theyve run um theyve gotten offensive rebounds theyve gotten Second Chance opportunities theyve been pretty crisp in their halfcourt offense so its its been a its been a good balance you know each of their last five games they were down by 18 against Dayton and came back and one came back from 21 down to win that game they were down by 20 against Kansas 14 against Auburn well and lets make mention of the fact too that theyve got the seventh toughest strength to schedule in the you know theyre playing against some pretty stout competition not sure who they gave that bucket to they were both right there Luben and Withers and they gave it to Luben so now 10 different Carolina players have score heres white Carolina trying to blow this one wide open before we reach the intermission lead is 16 you know for for Fran dumpy credit you know they came down and played Duke last year he likes games like this to test his team find out where they are thats a nice pass Maka to Jones who lays it in good look ahead that time ATN picks up the foul his second we come back trible will go to the line well and thats the one thing I mean you know I I dont like to talk about whos not here and uh you know but they they dont have a guy that they can throw the ball into in the paint and for the first time and I dont know how many years that can do something with it so they have to create different things and you know whether its off the drive or uh you know however they manufacture things in the paint theyve got to do it a different way it will be interesting to see how some of these guys progress because like a lot of teams that uh you know we talked to their coaches already with a transfer portal uh and North Carolina certainly has a number of transfers here along with young players um you know a North Carolina team we see in mid December could look very different come midFebruary you know I think the nature of college basketball that most teams will look different season go you know I dont know that a coach any coach has a feel for how their team looks in November about Applause that well you know what did I say to you today I said a guy named Deuce hes got to have a great midrange game and uh what a terrific finish absorbing the contact this is you know Lal has not been to the free throw line in this game but uh well that was that was a great shot and Duce Jones has been the man hes got eight mentioned coming off a 19 performance against St Joes in a loss and now he has nine so his nine of their 23 Off the Bench yeah Lily kept them in it early but hes the one whos picking it up here late tell you if they can keep it under or at 10 heading in the half Im sure that Fran dumpy will be happy you know he went to the Zone there and you and I were talking about this uh you know just watching shoot around where where North Carolina was having a hard time making threepoint shots in practice and that you know you you just pack it in and if they start making shots for the first time really all year long then they start making shots and thatll be turnover on L well you know I I think especially for a team like Lal Im just going to challenge North Carolina to make jump shots Im going to rebound as a unit and uh try to you know theyve had had success on the offensive blast so Im going to try to pack it in challenge them to beat me over the Applause top you got some follow issues try to try to hide guys isolation play there thats a nice offensive move by Luben I think hes going to progress offensively as the year goes along well you cant average 13 points and six rebounds in the SEC and not have something going for you right yeah hes going to settle in I would think and he gets a big rejection right there hes got long arms I mean that you know there are things that he can bring oh look out down there and now that affected the play yeah it sure did thats a shame that young man went out there to clean off the floor and theres a laye at the other end thats just a bad break thats Kade Tyson he only averages three points a game he has seven and Lily another threo try off the mark one 11 to go until halftime and a 17point lead largest lead of the game for North Carolina moving screen on K Applause Tyson the manager gets the defensive play of the game Music yeah thats uh thats unfortunate that looked very different in real time then in slow motion yeah it Applause did the def is out of bucket here in the first half the leading scorer for the Explorers but dece Jones right there crossover dribble left hand rebound Lily and hell go to the line a foul on Tyson is second in the last 30 seconds we invite you to stick around for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Music Subaru 12 of 17 from the line and the uh the two big you know the two big guns in this game have been really quiet and Davis has gotten shots only five points from him hes scored in double figures in every game this year for North Carolina but um you know for uh McAn is only hes only taken one shot in the in the first half he had to sit down a lot because of the two fouls and theres a timeout going to be called by North Carolina with 32 on the game clock 24 on the shot clock until Music halftime Clemson lost earlier today what a wild game that was in overtime against Memphis you mentioned Louisville going to take on red Haw Kentucky later tonight and you know on a little bit different note we talked about coming through that tunnel and you cant help but think about the great players and the great coaches and the Great Moments you you said it did not hold true for you I see why you know I got to throw you in front of the bus I got to do look this place is fabulous and I have enjoyed kidding come and I have enjoyed I enjoy coming here and doing games and they treat me extraordinarily well here and I have the utmost utmost respect for this program and its a great rivalry and the people here are fabulous yeah and except for that little kid today who asked for your autograph well yeah and then you told him that I went to Duke and he turned away from he turned and walked away I couldnt believe it I was yelling at him Im like what are you doing oh that was funny you face Priceless I understood thats right it was priceless oh boy wide open its been a big time first half for a guy quite frankly who needed it Cade Tyson he has nine down to the final three2 and good and its been a big first half for that man I tell you what I I car you know how I feel about Carmichael uh oh I love that place an unbelievable Game Y and thats where you played in your days with the Blue Devils they not open this building four years yep and you know Reynolds Coliseum uh all just Classic Building yeah and of course the maybe the most memorable game of all time was the wer Davis shot yep and old car Michael wide open good feed underneath and thats L he has six hes had a nice game he averages six per game and and North Carolina has been doing a great job of that theyve been getting slips and and pick and rolls and things and dunks in this game that pass was was supposed to be to ATN and it hit Kone right in the face just a pick and uh you know little laps defensively he gets a wide open Applause look lot of minutes here for ATN in this one has had very good success down low and thats a nice move banked in by Jalil white he got off to a good start in this game and then got a couple fouls had to sit down he has five points you look at uh thes lineup everybodys had some really good games for Fran dumpy and they needed everybody to have a really good game in this one to be competitive A10 is going to be really good this year at the top see thats another interesting game tonight speaking of the A10 um arguably uh one of the not even arguably one of the top three college basketball venues in the country is the University of Dayton and uh Dayton will host Mark K tonight Dayton has won eight of its first 10 games thats a nice kiss off the glass in the first bucket by mck and Marquette of course ranked in the top five in the country and how about you know its interesting that in this climate Shaka smart has not used the portal he is he is going to do it the conventional way or what used to be the conventional way and is having a lot of Applause success and Ive uh when I was working CBS I actually I did the first four one year and Dayton is just its incredible basketball Community yes thats a way of put your spot on they sell out every game uh not just the first four they sell out every University of Dayton Flyers game Don Donna here they the head coach air forever Davis little fade away and was fouled behind the ark got bumped there by white his third now see if if youre really locked in on a scouting report and youve got a guy whos struggling from threee the last thing you do is foul him especially somebody whos shooting 88 from the free throw line youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by healthcaregov new law lower prices and roll today what a career it has been for RJ Davis last year the first Carolina player to be a first team allamerican since Justin Jackson back in the 201617 season first Carolina guard to be a consensus first team allamerican since the great Joseph Forte and thats 25 years ago H all three of them Music Music Applause Music Applause white picks up the dribble gets it to mck shot clock down to five trying to work on Trimble pull up jumper tough shot in and out well trimbles a nice cover for aan hes got good size good Music length with the quickness to stay in front of him Applause Applause great pass penetration by Pau and an easy lay in for RJ Davis US1 that was interesting I mean there was a lot of standing around on that possession it didnt look like it was going anywhere and Davis SW on up all alone underneath I me look it was just shot clock was winding down and then just a wide open Music layup gdo only one turnover in the game so far today and we talked about how mightily he had struggled the last five games he had 23 turnover and 22 assists so for your primary ball handler you minimum you want a 2 to1 ratio on assist turn minimum ATN now 8 of 14 at the free throw line mention its its a different crowd here today with the students gone they finished up exams a couple of days ago so while sold out not completely filled at the dean Dome today theres Davis way down and nothing but NE for RJ Davis what you know what happens son you get fou and you go to the free throw line you make three shots in a row and all of a sudden you get a little rhythm and now he took that from Asheville uh on the on the map on North Carolina weve mentioned earlier the brand new just open this year John Blazer Arena on the campus of Lal theyve sold out a couple of times already its the first time theyve had two sellouts in the month of November going all the way back to 2013 2014 and they havent lost here in four games yeah Rich history there Tom goola going way back great great player and uh Lionel Simmons actually has the record here visiting player 37 points which was tied last year by Dalton connect yep for Tennessee had a chance to tie it or break the record Tom but was hurt on the play and couldnt shoot the free throw to break the record how about that I bet that at the end of the day probably bummed him out its pretty cool building to have the alltime record as a visiting player yes sir 37 and mck drills the Applause jumper still having a hard time finding it from three and theres an easy one thats eight in the game for Applause Luben and we mentioned last here this guy LED vanderbild in field goal percentage offensive rebounding blocked block he was third in scoring in second and rebound this guy was a good player last year for vanderville Tom last four games coming into this game Luben was 12 of 15 today hes four of four he hadnt hurt that average no he is not no he is not shooting 77 coming in the game oh that check round by Withers no I you know I I think come January hes going to be a big part of what they what they do what a difference it would make if they could get some contribution you know getting clawed back right because hes been in and out um he did not play in their most recent game against Georgia Tech if they can get Luben if they can get him to be a 13 seven guy yeah consistently that would be huge Thursday night game night on the CW Raven Simone host an all new episode of the classic cross word game Scrabble followed by an all new Trivial Pursuit hosted by Lavar Burton Thats Thursday night game night all starts at 8 Eastern 7 Central only on the CW its been a the really the only brutal part of this game uh for North Carolina theyve not been good from three four of 17 but only 50 from the line and this is a team coming in that shoots 78 from the line on the year well and I think you know the the game they North Carolina is coming out of final or final exam for first semester and that game can always be a little dodgy from a concentration standpoint you know going forward youre going to be able to lock in and next week is going to be very critical not getting ahead of ourselves in this game well youre right though uh you know you look ahead to uh who theyre going to face and look theyve already played three top 10 teams this season and not only top 10 teams but teams that have a lot of experience Alabama and Auburn you know uh Michigan State wasnt ranked when they played him but Michigan States Michigan State right and then you got Kansas they lost at KU by three in overtime well and the thing is they havent beaten any of them right and you know were looking at postseason resume if the committee is looking back you know these two games against Florida and and Tennessee UCLA or UCLA Im sorry coming up are massive y both of those teams are ranked in fact UCLA has not lost yet uh the Bruins are playing against Arizona theyre all pack 10 Brethren this afternoon thats a reach in foul thatll go Applause against who they get for that one Jaylen Withers they got his second now that game against UCLA M cronins team thatll be played Madison Square Music Garden my favorite venue is a pro really uh is talk about Mecca yeah thats it brother yeah good offensive rebound and heres M and its not there and battle for the board and Ian Jackson comes away with it and hes fouled yeah its Lal cannot overcome a sixpoint game from mck today and theres a schedule we were talking about U and the next two coming up specifically number nine unbeaten Florida unbeaten UCLA then you play Campbell and then right into the ACC against Louisville and Notre Applause Music Dame well have two games from the dean coming up as G drops one in you and I will be here backto back weekends on January the 18th and the 25th Stanford comes here now of course part of the ACC and Boston College will be here on the Applause 25th and I you know SMU traveling they they were theyre coming from the AAC and theyre traveling thats uh thats the way that Lily started the game from the three and they need a lot of those in a hurry the travel from Dallas you know theyre used to uh pretty stout travel schedule Stanford and Cal are are facing a lot this year oh boy are they and thats going to be interesting to see how they fair you know with that I mean its one thing for a football team and you and I were talking about this last week um you know its one thing for a football team where you fly out on say you know Thursday uh and then youre flying back right after the game on a Saturday afternoon right but for a basketball team it means being on the road for a week cuz chances are you while youre back here youre not just coming for one game youre coming for two two maybe three games and if you have a midweek game you know its not like every games on a Saturday yep time out on the full court pressure 5936 coach dumy wants to see his Fe feed finish this game Music strong Frank Maguire was the head coach he preceded Dean Smith Frank Maguire recruited me to the University of South Carolina about that thats right he uh moved from North Carolina and went to South Carolina won a championship here at North Carolina 57 yeah had Lenny for that team nearly a monster undefeated that year beat beat beat Wilt Chamberlain in Kansas and this was a sweatshirt that he uh broke out that um was his dads from his coaching days his dad went on the coach of course at the Naval Academy and U dad actually apparently wore sleeves yes he did you know um that whole hire has been poked and prodded like a player at the NFL combine I I mean its been every angle you could conceivably imagine Coast to Coast good move bad moves I I dont know how anybody in their right mind could think its a bad move now you may not think that hes going to be able to adjust to the college game I get pH bich man only Don schula won more games than that guy at the very highest level the only way I could see it being construed at as a bad move is the NFL teams get missed no doubt Im picking up on he only got one interview last off seon that was with Atlanta its been a break game here today for Tyson I was going to say if there are a couple of things that came that come out of this game that are real positive one for that young man and uh Im going to say the other one for uh V Allen Luben yep too strong and this is Ian Jackson coming the other way for North Carolina closing in on 12 minutes to go the car heels that length of time away from improving to six and four on the year and theres Tyson again thats his third threp pointer this was a guy we told you that scored almost a th000 points in well theyve just done a nice job of uh finding Mr Tyson and uh hes seen some good looks good extra passes most of those threes coming from the corner having a little flashback to his Belmont days and I tell you its been great to see the reception coming off the court that last time all of his teammates extremely happy for him he was a freshman of the year in the Miami Missouri Valley Conference his first year and then second Team all conference performer last year hes a much bigger body than you think he is when you see him in person hes a broad strong kid and this is him again yeah you can see I mean hes not hes not thinking now hes just that hes playing and hes shooting which is a you know its a big hurtle for him you were talking about Carolina two games from now well their next game against Florida Florida has won again today undefeated uh UCLA has one loss and UCLA just went to Arizona beat Arizona 5754 today so mck cronins team off to a really good start in their first year in the Big 10 sounds so weird doesnt it well and you know what but I think its almost like big 10 is a better fit for Mick crony yeah you know the type of guy the guy type of guy that he is and the type of coach that he is its a good point 13 now for Duce Jones He is impressive looking thats you know I kind of wondered about when he went out there and took that job what kind of fit that would be yeah Im with you I thought the same thing James Brown gets his first bucket he comes on for North Carolina still a lot of the starters in the game but Brown this you know for what the game is these are going to be important minutes for AER to to get out there and and get acclimated to his his team and get some minutes on the floor I think same thing holds true for James Brown I mean this guys a big kid now 610 hes light as theres a three at the other end knocked down by Demetrius Lily James Brown is a 610 215b true freshman out of Aurora Illinois Applause Jackson behind the back step back three short and Lily with a rebound for the Explorers you know were talking about you know whats coming up for North Carolina and you were talking about the fast start by some of these teams out of the Atlantic 10 so far this year lyola Chicago remember them The Darlings of the tournament a couple of years ago 8 and0 Rhode Island and St Bonaventure at 9 And1 we talk about Dayton will host Marquette tonight the Flyers along with GW BCU all at 82 Davidson is at 72 its good Music Applause Music Applause League now Mike you know me I mean if theres ever a guy that when you think about Snoop do right the first guy that comes to mind has got to be Tom BR right right well Im going to be out there with Snoop Dogg and Doctor Dre and Martha Stewart for the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl on the 28th of December thatll be Miami of Ohio Chuck Martin their head coaching Colorado State under Jay norell playing in a bowl game for the first time since 2017 and yes Snoop is going to be with us in the booth I wanted I was going to ask you about the about your playlist get to work on that now yeah better I think you better consult your son on that one Max Brown Trevor scales our entire crew will be out there in Tucson Arizona hopefully hes recovered from France and his trip over to the Olympics now see Martha Stewart you know her a little closer to my age grp and this has just been the game they have waited for for K Tyson that is his fourth threepointer in the game and he has a North Carolina career best 18 points how about that making uh people forget about his brother yeah loves the corner threes great find Music Applause Music Applause and the first free throw is no good you know Tyson coming out of high school in Matthews North Carolina just down the road um he was a 2022 North Carolina Mr basketball scored over 2000 points his team only lost four games carmels Christian but he went to Belmont his career high if youre wondering at Belmont is 31 so hes got a little work to do but we got a lot of time Applause left thats been a good play for North Carolina in this game that pick and roll well you know and thats the thing without that dominant post player theyve had things open in the middle got things cleared out theyve run the high pick and roll and the roll guy has been open Trimble acrobatic in air lays it in yeah showing you the athleticism you know the thing thats been impressive about him it just the progression throughout his career really not utilized early on but just the steady growth as a player and then this year the big breakout year thought about leaving came back from the portal and has been War boy how about you know the inside and the outside for Tyson hes got 20 I think everybody you know everybody just kind of Lo had him locked in as a stand still shooter Demetrius Lily with his fourth threepointer of the game he has 16 to lead the way for the Explorers yeah I mean you know give me an idea about Tyson he started the year getting a lot of hits and and they have progressively gotten fewer and fewer and fewer hes just down to 8 minutes a game hes played more than that in this second half alone and a three knocked in first since being activated for the first time all year long for Eric AER Applause left hand in midair for Drake pal thats out of bounds thatll go the other way so time out on the floor Seth triple has been on quite a roll for Carolina coming into this one 160 years you know were talking about all the turnover problems for North Carolina coming into this game at 18 alone last week against Georgia Tech how about this second half area one yeah no I mean they had seven in the first half not great um but certainly clean things up here 10 assists no turnovers here in the second half and uh doing a great job converting on him and uh boy Kade Tyson having a career here he only had four field goals this entire season coming into this game four all year he has 43 pointers alone and has doubled his number of field goals in this game he has eight of them youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good Music hands going be hes got po four personal fouls he may not get he may not get near anybody defensively yeah hes going to play hide and seek from every Defender I mean every guy with the ball from now on yeah go ahead big fell you got it Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause 8051 closing in on 6 minutes to go theres a takeway by tremble and an easy one throws it down he has 10 points in the game its double figures again in fact hes been in double figures every game except for one this season know you were talking about a guy whos come along his freshman year very rarely got into a game then last year he was a six man had a good year as a sixth man got the third most votes for the accs Third Man of the Year award his AER hits another three thats a good side for the South but now Trimble expected to deliver and hes delivering yeah 18 points his first year 52 last year and now here he is sitting at 16 a game I mean thats you know what you like to Applause see see he didnt finish right there but a really like what I see from deche Jones theres a lot to be excited with that young man hes from Trenton New Jersey he was ranked as a 17th best player in the country coming out of high school last year he is the highest recruit in the history or modern history lets say the last 50 years signed by Lal just based on his high school reputation so Im not sure it comes as a surprise at all that this guy right here with the basketball can do it oh boy a little strong that have been a nice finish heres Tyson its like the crowd is shocked now when he missed take away there and I would imagine pretty soon well see uh although who knows you know the way things have been going for North Carolina uh Hubert Davis may want his guys uh majority of regular players are still in the game so he may not clear that bench until about a minute or two left in the game heres a turnover by Powell well I would think too you know you want to reinforce some things going in the next Applause week morero not there you look at Trimble 10 points that was his eighth rebound and we got four assists so really solid stat line for him time out on the floor under four timeout 8254 Carolina what about that he came in averaging eight minutes a game he has almost 20 minutes today and 20 points yeah I I dont think a lot of people in the building saw that one coming but uh certainly a welcome surprise came Tyson having certainly the game of the year so far for him and theyre going to need well theyre not going to need that production going forward but theyre going to need some of that threepoint shooting for Applause Music sure talked about Louisville in Kentucky meeting tonight at Ru Arena and Pat Kels first tase to that rivalry backer and air ball say a couple of other really good games later tonight we mentioned Marquette is at Dayton Tennessee is playing at Illinois Carolina Alum Wes Miller he played here under Roy Williams got a win in a big rivalry game Cincinnati against Savor UCLA a winner NC State fell at Kansas today I remember I I did one of West Millers first games as a head coach at UNCC Greensboro was in Cameron Indoor Stadium and I remember going up to the locker room and they won the game well no oh okay of his first games coaching coaching yeah and he looked at me he goes I dont even know what Im doing and he he looked like he couldnt even get served in a bar you know still looks that still looks that way um but you know just doing a great job you know the the many believe that the the job here in North Carolina is a three by pal came down to Hubert Davis and West Miller MH and um Hubert got the job its now four years ago and Miller in His Four Season at Cincinnati and theres a three banged in by volberg Applause Music Applause fasi oh boy you know youre going good hes been wondering wheres that luck been all year well you know what if if Im him Im taking Im Im taking this game tape and Im watching it and Im watching it Im reinforcing it just from a confidence standpoint just to say you know what the ball does go in the hoop I can shoot I remember how to do this he came in from three into this game four of 15 he has five threepointers in the game and that one will bounce over the backo but Cade Tyson and hes going to get a now hes going to get a curtain call here thats right he should a standing overation good for him good for him is right I mean hes got his his buddy shoving him and hugging him and theyre excited for him they know what they know when a teammate right when a guys going through a tough time they dont want to even touch me so hot yeah thats exactly yeah they do they wanted to rub off on him were under two minutes to go and thats Ian Jackson batted outside and wide open oh boy Carolina has not made this number of Threes in a game in a long time the percentage isnt all that great from threepoint range in the game theyre 11 of 31 but I mean its 11 oh about that Ryan xan a sophomore from Princeton New Jersey and this is you know Tom this is a tough time of the year to navigate cuz youve gone through a really intense November and you come through exams youve got a really tough week coming up then youve got Christmas and then youve got to amp back up for the ACC season its its really tough to keep your concentration and then get geared up again that was Russell Hawkins sophomore guard out of Charlotte who had that bucket a second ago as Huber Davis EMP Applause Music defense s mother was a Tar Hill cheerleader hes had a mom a dad a sister all play athletic to participate in cheerleading here at North Carolina so good for him its nice that hes able to get a bucket his first of the year is there any way that we can swing like a tie or something from Alexander Julian well you know there was a time you and I used to have to dress up for these games yeah you know yeah but I mean part parting favor Applause something you know I was going to swing by there and spend my own money as that one knocked in by AER but theyre closed now after the Applause game aers had a nice debut here for the explor three Applause threepointers has 11 points in the game yeah you know under normal circumstances he would not be playing now but as I say these these minutes have been really valuable for him and thats him with a basketball he has four heel goals in the game three of them from cry and make it another that was nothing but lights out right there Bo gr dumpys got to be excited y he was wondering about the minutes he knew he was going to get playing time but was wondering about the minutes for this young man so North Carolina here um Will Come Away with its six wi of a season against four losses they beaten the teams theyre supposed to be and now coming up next a couple of teams they will be underdogs against the Florida Gators ranked number nine in UCLA will be in the top 178 after another win today theyve got to get some big time nonconference wins on their resume and both of those games
