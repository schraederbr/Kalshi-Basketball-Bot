BJ Hall and by Dongo need to contend with the Clemson mascot whos trying to steal the show before tip off as we are underway from Little John Coliseum Clemson starts with the ball in white Georgia Tech defending in blue our officials tonight Roger SS Lee Cel and Lamar Applause Simpson right to Hall this is where Clemson feels like they have the advantage tonight inside where PJ Hall like you just said Debbie has been terrific all SE SE him hes coming off a 26o 11 rebound performance and he got to the free throw line look at that play right there that is Rim body ball he protects the ball and gets to the free throw line with his strength at The Rim PJ Hall opens the score scoring from the foul line expected to be an all ACC first teamer I guess the question becomes Debbie when the expectation every night game in and game out is that youre going to keep delivering and youre at the top of that Scouting Report how do you keep performing like Hall has you put the work in youve have the Reps and youre confident PJ has not had a full off seon in a lot while because of some injury and I talked to him earlier today and he said he feels great hes playing a good solid amount of minutes for Brad Brownell but hes not impacted by fatigue or by any any anything else hes staying out of foul trouble too after fouling out early at three games by Dongo draws the foul one of the star freshman in the ACC to start this season I mean this is a really good Rim Runner roll to the rim hard roller hes not going to pop and when Dongo gets two feet in the paint hes got great length will put some pressure on that back row for Clemson with his Applause quickness Dongo eight straight games in double figures it was interesting speaking with first year head coach Damon stoutamire he said I didnt know Id have to rely on a freshman like he has with Dongo but he has certainly delivered in his first campaign with the yellow jackets and so has the Freshman Nate George hes been terrific didnt play the first three games number two in blue for Georgia Tech really a good decision maker at a high rate of Applause speed heres Dylan Hunter making his first start of the season and the floater Falls each time in each pass of the basketball through the middle third Clemson gets a little bit deeper in the paint thats a great shot by the by Dylan Hunter heres Kelly on a turnaround great defense by Chase Hunter and its cson Applause Music Applause Music Applause basketball J a three and hes fouled so three coming at the foul line for Joseph Gerard whos coming off a season High 26 points in the win against Boston College kaasi Reeves on his hip and Joe Gerard has great acceleration off that pin down action for Brad Brownell its important to get him going as well he had a really good game the last one 5 for 11 from the threepoint line for 26 points in the win over BC Applause now the good thing for Gerard coming over from Syracuse is you dont have to change your wardrobe got a lot of orange in that wardrobe right yeah but hes had to change his defensive mindset thats true thats one of the reasons why Joe Gerard came to Clemson and thats what he told me last week at Virginia Tech changed his body dropped some weight hes gotten in better shape and hes learning to play some mantoman defense and some different schemes that Brad Brownell will put in in in the system contested three Reeves nothing but the bottom of the net and Georgia Tech needed that triple I mean Kae Reeves is their best threepoint shooter by percentage hes the most confident threepoint shooter they have and you got to come with a longer close out on him clean block by danana poked away Dongo it falls to Hunter 10 on the Music timer Hunter pulls the trigger nothing but air chlin there cleans up the spill I mean I Id make a really good case for Ian sheflin being one of the top offensive rebounders in the ACCC in the last five games hes averaging five offensive rebounds he just reads it off the glass so well Dongo passes out of the double team 4 seconds on the shot clock George has to heave it missed it really strong start for Clemson on both ends of the floor that was a heck of an effort by PJ Hall he gets the double on the Baseline then he recovers with a deflection gets back out to the corner to double thats a lot of work for 610 on the Baseline Hall and hes fouled no call shefflin almost another offensive putback I thought Hall was hacked shooting that three George transition three that rims out no Applause good Applause Gerard splits two lost the handle though kept in Applause Music play George step back three hits it this time little separation with some foot fake maybe a little bump but I dont think he extended his arm you can give that bump to get open Music heck of a play by The Applause Music Freshman heres Chase Hunter pull up pop cant connect another offensive rebound Dylan Hunter Clemson really attacking that offensive glass swiped Away by Gerard fast tempo start here Debbie I love the pace playing a clean game both teams getting after it thats what you want to see in ACC has that really helps you now unfortunately tonight you put yourself in the danger zone Georgia Techs a really good team better than their 8 and8 record but a home loss to this yellow jackets team would be outside of quad one yeah that would be a tough one for Clemson because you you dont want to think that there can be a bad loss in conference play but as the season goes on those quad numbers change obviously offensive rebound Keeps The Possession alive for Georgia Tech youve really got to protect your home court in this league heres Miles Kelly missfires from three sheflin already with a couple of offensive Music rebounds Chase hunter in attack mode goes left all the way to the rim for two Clemsons acceleration in the quarter Court offensively has been really good Georgia Techs about a half a step late on some of those Applause curls heres sturred of vent from three this time nothing but the bottom of the net stur of it gives Damon stoutmire a veteran point guard on the top of the floor I think when he plays stur and George together thats a pretty good tandem as well but theyre very good decision makers with the ball theyre both very good defensively as well all Georgia Techs made shots tonight have been from three sturdivan been a bright spot Off the Bench for Damon Applause St and heres mil Applause Kelly kaac Reeves step back contested shot Off the Mark almost rimmed in on the rebound really good job by Wiggins not to help off the strong side corner just a little defensive stunt towards that penetration of miles and kaasi Reeves and makes him pick it up r j Godfrey terrific post move strong on the interior Jay ability to score left or right over both shoulders hes only getting better Georgia Tech has not gone inside often tonight Sturman tries another three from the logo off the Applause mark wide open in transition Clemson will usually make you pay from there Beetle couldnt finish it Tigers shooting 0 for four from three to start this game youre not going to get a better look than that its a quick trigger when you dont have a lot of sweat on you Applause yet Dongo in the post great defense by Applause Clemson hunter in attack mode missed in the midrange coach star doesnt like to call a lot of sets he really believes in them playing in Concepts and they went over it again today I think they rep their Concepts every day dangerous pass knocked around Hunter hustles for it and wins it for clebson and a foul call now the defense see him the student section got grit after dark so Im stealing it and going ACC after dark its pretty cool right were sitting right here the students are all over us its loud in here its a 900 tip in the South and people are excited about Clemson basketball in this building its cool well theyve got great reason to be 12 and four entering tonight one of the top teams in the ACC the four losses theyre all quality losses quad one losses you know they hit that threegame losing streak bounced back win on Saturday against Boston College at a good opportunity to make it back to back tonight well PJ Hall coming off a 26o 11 rebound game and Joe Gerard 5 for 11 from the threepoint line in a win over BC to to get 26 points as well so thats a pretty good combination for Clemson Inside Out been a great onew punch for the Tigers Coleman hits it coming off the bench straight into the box score Debo Coleman from Deep Clemson yet to hit a three while Georgia Tech has hit three already in the game and Techs going to switch to the zone right here off the timeout they had been playing manto man all the yellow jackets made shots tonight have come from three as PJ Hall answers immediately just a good job of working inside between the elbows in the middle of that Applause zone Nathan George draws the foul hes been a real bright spot a freshman from Toronto Canada coming off a careerhigh 17 points at Cameron indor Debo Coleman the 66 Jr lines it up 35 threepoint shooter he and kaasi Reeves are pretty good on the outside for Georgia Tech George takes it himself Miss fires I mean youre not going to get a much better look than that to the Elbow with a a nice looking jump shot you got to put those down splits the double everything but the Finish but Hall there to clean up the spill Georgia Tech who has been one of the top two offensive rebounding teams in the ACC is getting beat on that on the glass right now by Clemson Wiggins lost the handle no foul called so itll be Georgia Tech basketball we watched the crash right here by PJ Hall no one checks him out he has a lane to the rim thats four offensive rebounds already tonight for Applause Clemson yeah and Jack Clark entering the game for the Tigers hes missed the last nine games hasnt played since late November stent Way Off the Mark there so good to get Clark back the transfer from NC Applause State Big Boost to the front Applause Court thats a travel underneath the hoop what does Clark give Clemson length threepoint shooting hes got to shake off the rust of not having repped at game speed but I I think hes got experience and he helps their depth because without Alex hemway whos still out with an injury and Jack Clark being out so long its really affected Clemsons depth on the perimeter a lot of height on the court for the Tigers right now Hall Wiggins and Clark All Above 610 and then youve got Che at 68 but his numbers would tell you hes 7 foot as he grabs another rebound well PJ Hall got a piece of Applause that Georgia Tech has madees one of their last eight Gerard in attack mode great defense by George Hall there to keep it alive back to to Gerard drills the three Joe Gerard from Deep thats just good work by Gerard to exit cut off the block shot get his feet under his shoulders and for PJ Hall to find him first made three of the night for Clemson and no surprise its Joe Gerard Georgia Tech trying to answer with a triple George Cashes in on the second chance opportunity Nathan George is going to be an excellent player in this league we talked to him today at shoot around Jay whatd he say he got three D1 offers yep Seattle you Corpus Christie and Sam Houston State his uncle had a relationship with Damon and thats why hes here and wow putting himself in this position right here to test his skill set against the ACC guards has been hes really been outstanding the two freshman for Tech have been really good early on he has been a pleasant surprise for first year head coach Damon stom handling the ball here trying to dump it inside great ball movement finds George gari from three he cant connect a really good defensive possession by Applause Clemson you know we used to talk about Clemson through a defensive lens all the time but theyve been very good offensively and they were good last year offensively they won 14 games in the ACC last year and got snubbed by the NCAA tournament shot clock down to five Frost core pass finds Clark off to shefflin into two and it doesnt drop but Halls there to poke it home what a play by PJ Hall and Clemsons really showing some muscle on the front line right now they are really crashing the glass and Georgia Techs Team Speed hasnt been able hasnt hurt Clemson by going to the boards defense defense Dongo lines up the three Off the Mark and Clemson out rebounding Georgia Tech 208 in this game Applause already Gerard that was halfway down but rimmed out no good that roll replace action is really tough to guard with that combination for Applause Clemson another deep three all the yellow jackets made shots have been from three today Debbie yet to make a two I think the size for Clemson is having an impact right I mean PJ Halland theyve driven in there hes blocked shots hes altered shots and PJ already with eight rebounds in the first half for Clemson watch this Gerard shows pump fake and then relocates to the perimeter knocks down a triple smart play by veteran Savvy guard Saturdays triple header in the ACC tips off with Clemson and Tallahasse against Florida State at four Virginia at Georgia Tech at six and then the night cap Cameron indor at Duke triple header on Saturday right here on acc Network and then Clemsons number one fan Frankie anelli sportting the Clemson life shirt in the house here at Little John Coliseum having the time of his life here what a great Community theres his buddy Sam hes up there in the corner with the student section hanging out theyre having a blast uh this is a special place Clemson life has been a unique opportunity for families like ours life is an acronym learning is for everyone Frankie is a graduate of the program and uh he lives here independently with support holding down a couple of jobs at the shepher hotel in your pie and he absolutely loves it it is so awesome to watch him in his element with his buddies rooting on the Tigers it has been a good start for Frankie and all Clemson fans as Chase Hunter adds a bucket hes been ditching me all day you know Ive been trying to you know want to have breakfast no how about lunch no hes just hes got his own schedule hes trying to get rid of me oh man usually when Moms in town shes paying so youre eating with Applause Mom heres Nathan George Perfect Touch a breakout freshman Nathan George continues a strong season hes got eight of the yellow jackets Applause 18 he did not even play in the first three games and if youve watched the tendency of Coach statamire you got to earn it in practice and hes very much a matchup guy so depending on the opponent they have had multiple starting lineups but Nathan George has been in the lineup in the last 13 and hes been outstanding shot clck down to five Hunter Clemsons got to get rid of it they do so and thats a shot clock violation thats not the shot you want good defense from the yellow jackets damid sire will like that first year head coach enjoy our conversation with the longtime NBA veteran player and Coach he said were close to winning some of these games but at some point you just have to make winning plays and they were eight and3 with wins against Mississippi State and Duke and now a fivegame losing streak where theyve been in every game they could have won all five of them he had an interesting take on making plays and staying in the moment right and and part of that is generating enough opportunity situational offense and Reps to play the way he wants them to play he wants them to do it the right way and its not about running plays its about teaching how to Applause play dumped inside Hall great defense claw all over it for Georgia Tech Miles Kelly been quiet tonight leads Georgia Tech scoring has it here great pass wideopen three and Reeves delivers from the corner how about that pass I mean Miles Kelly was out of bounds and he throws that drift to the corner thats what Im talking about Concepts I I think Miles Kelly is one of if not the fastest player in the league with or without the ball into end hes got incredible acceleration in the the Open Applause Floor Chase Hunter Applause dispossessed transition three Kelly hits it its a 10 nothing Georgia Tech run and Kelly has fired the yellow jackets in front that speed played out in his Sprint to the corner to get his feet organized after the break on the threepoint line hall trying to answer and he does I mean who do you get the ball to when you need a bucket right its pretty simple for Clemson and honestly PJ Hall has delivered all year his entire career since he stepped foot on campus CI deep three missed it that Applause time oh good pass fake Dylan Hunter wide open misfired and a foul called on the rebound but Dylan Hunter making his first start of the Season joining his brother Chase of the starting lineup well tell you where the hunter Brothers get their basketball toughness when we come back part of a incredible recruiting class for Andy Landers and I I had a chance to talk to this morning and I said hey uh when did you guys start beating your mom in the driveway it wasnt until seventh grade i still bet on Mom hey I Im telling you what she could ball she had incredible toughness and grip and she was great on the glass she played with uh some legendary players at Georgia as well for the Hall of Famer Andy Landers both the hunter Brothers on the floor right now heres Chase fires the three cant connect theyve combined for six points starting for the first time together this Applause Music Applause Music season Nathan George has had the hot hand for the yellow jackets leads them with eight passing here Dongo didnt have the touch it almost rimmed in Dongo gets his own Miss and this time it does fall to tie it at 28 I mean coming off the timeout its a great clear out its twoman game and beautiful pocket pass to get that play started and another possession of Zone by Georgia Applause Tech remember PJ Hall hit a 15footer the last time that they showed a possession of Zone Brad Brown now the alltime winningest head coach for the Tigers in year number 14 had a great start to this season 9 and0 all the way way to 11 and one before that threegame losing streak bounced back over the weekend and a win against Boston College now trying to make it two in a row but Georgia Tech and Miles Kelly back in front we call that the 45 cut right there CU its on the 45 angle and that is the acceleration of Miles Kelly from the weak side to balls side heres Hall finds Hunter cant been his way Applause free Godfrey musling it home RJ Godfrey on a rack attack his upside is absolutely incredible you know he has great genes and hes an incredible athlete now the combination of skill continues to grow on that young man and he is going to be a heck of a player for Brad Brownell a confusion on on the floor a timeout was Applause called but damid sa says I didnt call it so in invert and whistle itll be Georgia Tech ball the yellow jackets have hit seven threes of this first half Clemson just two I mean you got to throw it in there theres a mismatch right here Dongo against Hunter PA intercepts it I mean its not going to show up in the stat sheet but that was a heck of a job on post defense by Dylan Hall soaring and scoring Clemson back in front PJ Hall almost has a first half double double 13 points nine rebounds timeout Georgia Tech with 20 left to the half well be right back this has been a really fun competitive first half a little ACC after dark after a chaotic finish in Raleigh before us NC State coming back to win that game against Wake Forest Jay alter Debbie Antonelli with you you cant ask for a closer more competitive game to this one and I think the Georgia Tech 10 run was in large part the playmaking ability of Miles Kelly 10 seconds left to this first Applause half heres George off to Kelly puts it up would have been good if it went rimmed out and Clemson clings to a twopoint halftime Applause Advantage PJ Hall like hes been all season the goto guy for the Tigers 13 points nine rebounds to lead the way klebson a twopoint lead at the break hes made it look so easy particularly on the glass Deb where Clemson outrebounded Georgia Tech 2313 in the first half obviously having that near 611 frame helps but his positioning hes always where he should be on the court I think he has excellent footwork I think his timing is terrific on the glass I think he loves the responsibility of leading this team and his offseason work because of injury in years past have really allowed his conditioning to be at this level at this time of the year Georgia Tech starts with the ball trailing by two trying to snap a five game losing streak on the road against one of the ACC top teams Im waiting for Miles Kelly to get going has it here turnaround jumper got it I think they have to play through him I think with the ball he is absolutely explosive and he doesnt need a lot of time or space he can occupy that off the bounce with his ability to get to the places he wants to go with the ball inside the hall stays with it doesnt drop another offensive rebound for Ian shefflin M sheflin just thrives in his role hes a star on the glass for Clemson five offensive rebounds for shefin tonight Cashes in for the two now diving for the ball George wins it keeps it alive for the yellow jackets 5 Seconds to shoot Kelly decides to give it up for Reeves rattled in and out no good that possession started with a ball screen with George and with Dongo and they got the switch then they rescreened and then they re they reswitched when you have that matchup thats the next level for a freshman point guard is recognizing that and taking advantage of it 11 watch Miles Kelly with a little fade away and then he and Joe Gerard just CL heads both holding their head back up the floor and you can see in the previous four games Jay miles was two for 25 thats 8 since then hes shooting the ball at a much better rate and I think he looks like hes adjusted to what Damon statamire wants him to do offensively yeah so thats a sample size of his last eight games the first four two of 25 the last for 14 of 31 but hes not just a threepoint threat too he can beat you in many ways I mean he can go from one end of the floor to the other in three and a half maybe four dribbles tend to lean towards three and a half for him hes so quick has it here theres a Applause switch lost his footing thats how quick he is great pass rejected but a foul called chefin and Hall collapsed underneath to deny TI on Applause Music Claude I mean this is just a good feed to the weak side wow Hall got it clean the foul was called on shefflin Sunday afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball double header tips off in Raleigh the number four wolf pack hosting Duke and then a top 25 match up Louisville at North Carolina thats Sunday right here on acc Network by Design the students in the second half are behind the visiting teams basket thats quite a sight right there shooting in shooting into that sight and this was a late tip on a Tuesday night but the students exell loud and proud all night long Gerard pull up pop missed it another offensive rebound for Music Clemson foul on the floor its really good flash by shefflin to the nail with PJ posting so hard he had a clean Lane but he picks up the foul and thats the third foul on Dongo you know I keep talking about how hard PJ posts up in a block it is so valuable to have that size and frame and that skill set to change the space for everyone else to be able to play off Music Applause it crosscourt pass tes up h Hunter drives the lane gets the foul and one opportunity coming for Chase Hunter thats an IQ play by sheflin because that Quicks One More You Go reverse and then you go swing back to the top that gives Hunter a driving lane give that assist to sheflin and he can completes the threepoint play seven points tonight for Chase Hunter and a fivepoint lead for Clemson and Coach Stout knows that Clemson is switching in in the middle third in these actions right here you can get the right matchup with Miles Kelly if you bring a big to him shot clock under 10 and PJ Hall has been stuck on this match up a couple of times George got him up in the air the floater but thats the first time that George has gotten by PJ Hall in the perimeter Hall has played very good perimeter defense keeping him in front 10 points for Nathan George he leads the yellow jackets Gerard deep three buries it Joe Gerard unlimited range great Twist of that screen by PJ Hall set a screen in one angle and then he twists it to the other angle to allow Joe Gerard to have that Applause separation George trying to create Miss fires from three Hall another rebound he already has a double double up ahead Hunter the scoop to the hoop time out Georgia Tech perfect two for two from three it was funny we were watching him earlier today as hes in the top five for ACC made Threes And I asked you how many threes do you think hes attempted in his life between the driveway between practice between shoot around between games I said an easy million a million threes I think so I mean thats what he does I mean look at that look what look at his presence on this graphic I me at the names hes with hes sitting at home right now watching this game going I hope he doesnt catch me tonight not against my guys right still a long way to go to JJ reic its interesting seeing Joseph Gerards name with a Clemson Tiger paw print shouldnt it be a dual logo there a split if you will yeah he returns to the Dome on February 10th to play his former team Coleman Corner three out of the timeout drills it exactly with the yellow jackets needed so in the first half Clemson went up nine Damon STM called timeout they went on a 10 run and took a onepoint lead now theyre showing another possession of Zone and dvo Coleman came off in that 10 run and hit a couple of Threes right Gerard missed it that time Coleman kept it in but gave it right back to Clemson down low chlin draws the foul that is muscle on musle on that one a big night in here last night it was a close one for a while but Clemson pulled away and uh we talk about the managers being just so valuable to the success of their respective programs no doubt about it and you mentioned how busy Little John Coliseum has been between basketball and manager games and how about gymnastics Clemson first year program they are hosting the meet this Sunday on acc Network at 4 and in the inaugural meet of this first year program the highest inaugural meet score in D1 history thats Lily lipet who was the ACC newcomer of the week and that takes newcomer to a whole new level when its your first year as a program you got to give a shout out to Jim Clemens the president and Graham nef the athletic director here in the last few years theyve added softball womens lacrosse and gymnastics wow its very impressive thats a actions speak louder than words by Clemson to support those womens sports and not only start them but give them the fabulous resources that they have the facilities here oh its incredible off the charts foul frustration foul against Godfrey there and in the last less than 10 years Little John is over you know on you go on a renovation the basketball practice facilities are outstanding the weight room is awesome and then we didnt even talk about Dabo world over there thats a whole other thing exactly now this has been a close competitive game throughout late night action in the ACC Georgia Tech trailing by five but within Striking Distance by Dongo back into the game has it here good recognition of the mismatch you see the help and then you see the backside Cutters Dongo has a chance right there to try to bury that guard that switch I think it was Dylan Hunter was on him was six in between those two back him down bury him inside and use your skill set in the paint shot clock at eight Dongo puts it up and in off the glass this young man is talented hes explosive hes got a great Cadence about his ability to read the defense especially looking on the weak side for Cutters very patient another offensive rebound shefflin puts it up and in thats 12 offensive rebounds and shefflin stays down grabbing his left Applause leg Im going to guess by his and were not supposed to assume but I think its a cramp I mean shefflin and Hall are just pounding the boards tonight their offensive rebounding has allowed Clemson to have some separation 12 offensive rebounds nine of them belong to sheflin and hall and sheflin walking off under his own power that is great to see hes all Applause Music smiles that was a really good read by you Debbie because I didnt know what happened I he immediately grabbed the back of his calf and you just thats painful whatever you land like that you worry that it could be that but I think you said cramp right away and hopefully thats all it is Bo you start drinking fluids pound the fluids and then roll it out get a little massage over there so nine rebounds on the night for jefin to go along with eight points Brad Crow the longtime athletic trainer for Clemson doing a terrific job keeping these guys in topnotch Applause Music form knocked away PJ Hall hes had a couple of takeaways already already a double double tonight Godfrey trying to spin his way free draws the foul I mean that were three whistles on that one I mean look how quick the spin is and Coleman just loses his balance a little bit there because the spin off of Godfrey thats a tough play right there now we were talking about athletic parents earlier giving props to Brandy Lewis the mother of Chase and Dylan Hunter about RJ Godfrey who his father Randall played 11 years in the NFL as a Applause Music Applause linebacker six points in a board tonight for the sophomore from Swani Georgia Lucas McKay on the staff for Brad Brownell gave me a great stat about Godfrey theyre six and0 when he scores in double figures so he can have an impact on the game hes been a big bright spot Off the Bench for this Tigers team Miles Kelly only seven points tonight he usually has double that 5 Seconds to shoot Kelly in trouble off to stur of it has to hoist it BS it in Kyle stur of it cuts the lead in half after seven threes in the first half thats their second in the second Music Applause half Wiggins Music Applause dumps it inside Hall with a big mismatch working on Kyle Stant 8 in separate those two see thats a mature offensive possession Stan looks at the clock on the other end he knows hes got to let it fly still counts as Applause three Music Godfrey slams it home RJ Godfrey hes had two Rim rockers tonight I mean it can be a wear down effect when Georgia Tech doesnt have the same depth on the front line that Clemson Applause has by Dongo passes out of the double team finds Kelly for three cant knock it down Dongo got the rebound couldnt put it home and a foul call I mean Clemson is really locked in and connected on the defensive end 10 eyes watching the ball not allowing any back cuts and contesting everything how about this at The Rim Godfrey making himself available hes got a lot of muscle on that frame and his skill set start to come along and you said it earlier Clemson 6 and0 when gone Frey scores 10 or more hes up to eight tonight two great dunks there which gets the student section and terrific crowd into the game and Clemsons needed them here at home Georgia Tech is given the Tigers everything they can handle I think its been a a really good defensive game plan by Brad Brownell because coming into the game I mean Georgia Techs a good threepoint shooting team they make seven a game but the switching manto man has been a little bit of a softer cover if you will right keeping Georgia Tech out of the paint not allowing them off the bounce to get inside and set up their threepoint shooting but you got to have a balance there but youre giving up something when youre when youre protecting inside out and youre giving up some threes now the counter for Clemson is theyve been able to get to the free throw line and and theyve been all over the offensive glass the extra pass finds Hunter cant connect and by Dongo called for the travel he just lost his balance there so ball stays with Clemson underneath their own hoop leading by Applause four hey Hall calling for it gets it muscles it home he has 17 points to go along with 12 rebounds tonight thats situational offense in those Baseline out of bounds you have to execute on those I think Brad Brown now usually scores on about eight out of 10 of Applause those St of it shot clock at eight Clemsons been difficult to break down defensively but Sturdivant does just that so thats what Im talking about the defense tonight for Clemson has been designed to keep them out of the paint Stan doing a nice job coming off the Applause bench heres Hall finds Gerard give go shot clock down to five Hall eyes on the timer turnaround missed it good weak side board by Music Applause Dongo Stan backto back Big Time makes Kyle stur of it has Tech back within one how many times did Damon St Meer talked to his team today about where they set their screens in the middle third that was a screen that was set inside the threepoint line that allowed him to come off that and knock it down Georgia attack made six of their last eight the last two to Ser event and thats a go Dongo was in the cylinder there so count the bucket for PJ Hall hes now up to 19 the next dead ball they will look at it this is what Im talking about look at Dongo sets that screen and if youre in P if youre PJ Hall and youre in a little bit of drop coverage right there thats hard to get out in the scoring range and not and contest that shot because the quality of that play right there was excellent by Georgia Tech quality of the shot the quality of the screen all of it one possession game Georgia Tech made 10 threes tonight and 11th would tie it at 55 nobody home miscommunication there Dongo and Claude on different wavelengths and thats a turnover and Clemson has mixed up when and if they bring the double to Dongo like I said before its hard to speed him up I mean he plays with a maturity Beyond a Music freshman Music Applause on Hall good fake kicks it out Gerard back to Hall under five on the shot clock Hall in attack mode draws the foul on the floor spaced out Shooters in the corner and Gerard and Hall working in the middle third you see the foul right there grabbing the arm PJ Hall going back to the free throw line and Clemson in the bonus the rest of the Applause Applause away and hall now up to 20 making the front end of the one and one Saturday terrific triple header right here on acc Network the Tigers are in Tallahasse to tip things off at 4 Georgia Tech hosting Virginia at six and then the night cap at Cameron indor Pittsburgh at Duke PJ Hall 21 points 12 rebounds tonight and theres still nine minutes left in this game the ninth time hes been over the 20po Mark the fourth double double of the Season 11th of his career and he has made it look easy tonight Georgia Tech still within Striking Distance Stan off the mark that time Don go couldnt quite put it home but itll stay with Georgia Applause Music Applause Tech now this is what its been for the yellow jackets in these last five games theyre right there in the second half but have nothing to show for it says their head coach Damon Stam on a fivegame losing streak and they could have won all five of them KY Applause rejected and a foul called Jack Clark with a hip check thats his first Clemson went through this set right here this concept over and over in shoot around today you see the foul by Clark which you get see the block by Hall Kelly been quiet in this second half finds Sturdivant whos been the Catalyst and he delivers again Kyle stent the spark plug Off the Bench you got a nice mix of point guards right you got the young freshman whos got explosiveness and some size on the top of the floor and then youve got the veteran player and Kyle Stant who can come in and give you a different Rhythm to your team back to a one possession game Hall calling for it well they missed him 5 Seconds to shoot Clark Off the Mark another offensive rebound and its sheflin his fifth offensive Board of the Night 10 rebounds total dumps it down to Hall fighting through gets it to go PJ Hall up to 23 tonight PJ never gave up on the post up in that possession that was a clinic on how to shape up to the ball sturdivan had the hot hand working on Clark gives it up Reeves hits it from three kaasi Reeves and Georgia Tech back within two he has money in the Deep Music Corner how about the fight in Georgia Tech Applause great hustle start of it grabbed the ball called the timeout Georgia Tech not playing like a team thats just 500 on the season and on a fivegame losing streak you want a win on the road you make plays like Kyle Sturman just made and then you find a way to try to keep PJ from Catching in the front of the paint front of the rim Reeves deep Corner couple of triples tonight twopoint game between Georgia Tech and Clemson and in the second half these two teams offensively have taken over because the defense really been dominant not just in the first half but all season long for Clemson and Georgia Tech and yet the offense has just exploded Debbie yeah I think Georgia Tech is sprinkled a little Zone um usually coming off a timeout should change the rhythm of the the game a little bit and then Clemson and they switching manto man here in the second half has kept Georgia Tech out of the paint again the difference for Brad Brownell is their ability to get to the free throw line whereas a team theyre 14 for 16 it is countered a little bit the 11 threepoint made baskets by Georgia Tech yeah Georgia Tech shooting 63 and now theyre changing their ball screen coverage again now theyre going look at a trap seran somehow f down Kelly shot clock at seven miles Kelly only has two points in the second half almost lost his pivot foot sturd ofan has to heave It Off the Mark good change by Brad Brown now we were talking about them switching this time they come with a trap on the ball screen I like the change lets see if that was a one possession thing if they stay in it Chins had a real impact on the glass tonight back into the game which is good to Applause Music see shot clock down to four both of these teams waiting to the end of the shot clock chard just peaves it thats not a quality Music look twoj DJ Hall back into the game for Clemson he has been the Catalyst tonight 23 points 12 rebounds Hall and sheflin have 10 offensive rebounds combined Georgia Tech whos number two in the ACC and offensive rebounding has eight Dongo Dongo really swipes look how he plays low hes low man wins in those situations but he turns it over Hunter fouled on his way to the rim 13 lost the handle a little bit in Applause transition third foul on Kelly so this is what its been for Georgia Tech since conference play began theyre in every single game but Damon St first year head coach told us weve got nothing to show for it they were eight and3 with wins against Mississippi State at Duke but in their last five games theyve lost them all all games that they were right there in the second half in in four of them they actually had second half leads but they havent been able to finish is it deja vu all over again for Damon satam tonight he talked about these moments inside the game I mean theyve done an excellent job putting some game pressure on Clemson at at home George back running the offense a little bit more size if Clemson elects to trap that that ball green action Kelly in attack mode tried to find George who couldnt handle it thats the Clemson defense youve come to expect under Brad Brown now well theyre coming off the last two games where they gave up 51 from the Florida Boston College and 54 from the Florida Virginia Tech you usually dont see Applause that Applause Gerard rejected Dongo got there Georgia Tech has numbers with Gerard trailing behind does well to hustle back Reeves travels another Georgia Tech turnover weve got two different whistles here weve got a travel and a foul the officials are coming together what did you see travel I saw travel I I prefer the violation before the foul every time why is that I dont want to put a foul on Aid another kid and let him you know have to go over and sit on the bench or if there be free throws lets keep the game Applause moving yeah travels the right call Georgia attack six turnovers this half they only had had two the entire first half so the Clemson defense is dialed in down the stretch here I thought it started in practice yesterday I was here for Clemsons practice and uh Brad Brownell was very intentional and demanding about what he expected and the game plan for Georgia Tech and I I think theyve executed well to this point now you got a close off game so now you cant have any game slippage and thats what Georgia Tech has had in these moments thats what we talked to Damon stoutmire about you know he its a its an angle its a rebound its a close out its its the detail inside the game you have to finish it off strong execution right here matters for both clubs fivepoint lead for Music Clemson they havent been able to deliver that knockout punch tonight my Kelly trying to get going Runner to the rim and its a onep possession Applause Music Applause Music game Kelly commits the Applause foul thats his fourth look at the explosive the quickness as weve been talking about in all game when he makes up his mind he wants to turn a corner I dont think anybody in the league can guard his quickness but hes got to be more assertive at times in the game I think he gets some switches and he defers a hunter shooting two here everyone on the court thought it was a one and one Clemson has not made a basket at three minutes and 26 seconds but as Debbie pointed out they have done an excellent job getting to the the foul line all game theyve taken 21 free throws 14 of which have come in this second half Hunter misses them both still a one possession game with four minutes left in regulation Clemson clinging to a threepoint Applause lead cerent working on Hall Dongo wants it and gets it the Freshman musling it doesnt drop and Gerard has it for Clemson a lot of activity on the Applause glass heres Hall righty hook beautiful PJ Hall 26 point tonight I mean he just buries Claud in the Applause rim George spinning his way free draws the Applause foul here in Clemson they call PJ Hall the hall American I mean two feet in the paint two points forget about it the hall American PJ Hall 26 and 12 hes been fantastic in the paint hes been all over the glass hes been able to work his way to the free throw line hes even buried a triple when are they going to name that sandwich and sulles after him on College J I ran into PJ at breakfast this morning he was knocking down a couple of sandwiches you know what he hes uh I had a nice conversation with him actually I asked PJ whats the first thing you look at on the stat sheet after the game he said the first thing I look at is turnovers well right now Clemsons only turned the ball over eight times the next thing he looks at is rebounds well Clemsons done a really good job they are plus nine on the boards and hes got 12 so hes got to be pleased with that when he looks at the stat sheet after this game should they get a win lot of game left here great defensive stand by Clemson coming out of the timeout under 3 minutes left now in regulation see thats where Miles has got to pull up off the glass maybe got one dribble too deep Hall calling for it sheflin instead to the rim lays it up and inan sheflin I mean theres been a couple of weight room buckets by shein and Hall tonight you know but heres whats happened coming off the timeout for Coach damer he has decided and so has mil Kelly that hes going to put the ball in the deck and attack the rim shot got blocked the last time this time hes going to shoot free Music Applause throws oh they called it on the floor I thought he was shooting I did too right back to Kelly everything working through Miles Kelly right now for Georgia Tech pulls up from three cant knock it down shein another rebound for Clemson 12 for him tonight I like the mentality of Miles Kelly though he wants the ball right now in the winning time the winning time might be slipping away under two minutes to go Clemson now a sevenpoint Music lead Paul count the bucket PJ Hall fired up PJ Hall is a pretty emotional guy but you you dont usually see this much out of them what a finish so the whistle was for a potential goal even though the ball ended up going in anyway no foul on the play Georgia Tech Now or Never time Yellow Jackets trying to avoid a sixgame losing streak Stir of in a three and hes fouled Hall commits the foul thats the last thing you can do cuz now Stans going to get three at the line maybe a little too pumped up PJ Hall he immediately looks at Coach Brown Allen my bad stent is the best free throw shooter for Georgia Applause Tech 84 well that ends a six nothing Clemson run over the last 2 minutes Thursday night at 10 Eastern womens basketball double header and then the nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC you dont want to miss it right here on acc Network this game was 6259 one possession game Georgia Tech within Striking Distance like theyve been in all five of their losses during this stretch and Clemson down the stretch has made winning plays up until that PJ Hall foul back to a twopossession game Chaplin takes the time out you got to get open both Chase Hunter and Joe Gerard were just staring at the ball well step aside for 30 Seconds J get Laughter open the first year head coach David Stout in the midst of a fr frustrating stretch his team was 8 and3 not too long ago with wins against Duke in Mississippi State now on a fivegame losing streak a minute 33 for making it a sixgame losing streak and its the same things down the stretch its not making winning plays size on the ball right here everybody guarding face guarding youre right probably switching here he cant let the ball come in that easily both teams in a bonus Georgia Tech does have one timeout Clemsons got two possession arrow is with the Tigers Kelly guarding Gerard he has four fouls shot clock down to seven chlin on the drive right to the rim missed it and theyre going to take a look at the monitor to see who it was off of last thats the first time weve seen that set where Clemsons gone one4 low bring the late ghost screen up from sheflin I think that was too slow developing play with the ball in Joe Gerards hands we watch the who touched it last hall or Dongo the call on the floor was Georgia Tech ball on the floor but they pretty immediately went to were going to Applause review I mean what an incredible crew We Have Tonight Roger SS Lee Cassel and Lamar Simpson this a veteran group I just dont know if theyll get a great look look at this and the Clemson fans have been terrific tonight ACC after dark late night on a Tuesday night student sections been loud and proud all night long and it is Georgia Tech ball Clemson a couple of stops away from backto back wins and improving to 13 and four on the year we continue whats been a really strong season for this Tigers team jardy as it stands ESPNs bracketologist has Clemson as a five Applause seed Georgia Tech no field goals in the last 3 minutes and 13 seconds down the stretch during this losing streak thats whats hurt them more of the same tonight can they find a miracle here in the final minute Reeves off the screen got a great look and drilled it kaasi Reeves cuts the lead in half 52 seconds left one possession game that was great execution got to have a really good stop here by Georgia Tech because all five players on the floor are excellent free throw shooters sheflin would be the least and hes at 74 but hes the furthest away from the ball I think you play hard defense right here yeah last thing you want to do if your damid stouty is foul one possession game need a stop you got to go inside the PJ Hall I think thats that would be an answer here and an option that high low game has definitely worked Halls got 28 points tonight they go right to him missed it gets his own Miss and Georgia Tech do you a foul here or not no you play good d decides to there was a 9sec separation from the shot clock and the game Applause clock offensive rebounding all game for the Tigers its been a problem for Georgia Tech and then you foul Joe Gerard I would have let the Trout play out a little bit longer Jay only 91 at the free throw Laughter Applause line now PJ Hall 28 points tonight but that 13th rebound which ties a career high might have been the biggest thing hes done Music tonight and weve used the phrase winning plays all night long that was a winning play there for Hall you got to know where Reeves is hes coming off that flare from Dongo George takes it himself and buries it I mean you substitute out Joe Gerard so you get a defensive player timeout Brad Brownell you put Clark in and hes in the game to not give up that three with some more length a bigger Defender handle the Tigers clinging to a twopoint lead 128 seconds left Tigers still have one timeout and the ball cut hard Georgia Tech trying to get a steal right away then then a foul foul comes in sends Chase Hunter to the foul line to shoot two and this is where Clemson should be good at closing out games because of what we said before their ability to put five good free throw shooters on the Music floor hunter three for three from the foul line tonight hes 87 on the season CH Music sh and now a chance to make it a twopossession game Miles Kelly comes back in for the yellow jackets regardless of this free throw you dont need a three right away I think you can extend the game by driving it quick Miles Kelly like I said in the first half he only needs three three and a half dribbles to go from one end to the other missed it one possession game Georgia Tech has life 7 Seconds left George for the tie got it Nathan George drills it time out Brad Brownell as the Freshman Phenom Fearless on the road ties it at 71 knowing time and score they put three more ticks back on the clock so two 26 to work with for Clemson what do you do here you you got time for two dribbles and then a shot and you you got to Shufflin can run the Baseline if you can inbound it towards midcourt if youre Georgia Tech you want to make Clemson come back to the basketball not a pass that goes over the top Chaplan runs the Baseline heaves it and its intercepted Dongo throws it up oh it almost went and we are headed to Applause overtime with a minute 33 to go and yet the Tigers have let it slip late and now have to go to overtime to try and win this at home you see PJ Hall trying to encourage the guys right here because I I thought they did have a little dip in their body language now the moment momentum is with Georgia Tech on the road and Miles Kelly I thought coming off that timeout Jay at that moment 6860 Miles Kelly decided three possession in a row he put his head down and tried to drive tried to make a Applause Music play rejump to start overtime Brad Brownell says no that was off Dongo should be Clemson basketball and it is so Clemson starts with the ball how do you mentally reset as a player quickly Debbie you got to get through your acceleration here on your sets you got to pound the glass you got to do all the things that you did to give yourself a a lead if youre Clemson there has to be a part of you thats disappointed you let an eightpoint lead slip with just a minute 30 left thats why I think their body language dipped you cant let that affect you here in overtime Applause Music though Gerard back to Dylan Hunter into PJ Hall spins his way in rolls doesnt drop and a foul on the offensive rebound that is now 15 offensive rebounds for exactly look at Damon sire just shaking his head they have not been able to keep Clemson off the glass its a great spin inside look at sheflin fighting for position and then from the perimeter its Chase hunter that gets the glass by Dongo commits his fourth foul so both CI and Dong go with four to play with in overtime Hunter makes them both hes up to 14 points Applause tonight George puts it up the slam Ties on Applause Claude thats a set from the bench its the first time weve seen them run Applause that saving Applause it Dylan Hunter leaves it for shefflin puts it up and in hes still battling through a cramp calls over to the bench left the game earlier with a cramp was able to work it out over on the sideline and now limping off for RJ Godfrey he has battled tonight Applause missed some big time finish right here pump fake and then immediately you see him grab the back of his calf what an effort 12 points 12 rebounds for sheflin the last bucket gives Clemson a twopoint lead foul called on the floor against Gerard I mean another play by George he just leaves it at the rim for Claude Applause Gerard got caught on the switch in a postup and thats a possession that Georgia Tech can win in that Applause Music matchup by dong go shooting one and one missed the front Applause Music Applause end inside the hall and thats a career high 30 for PJ Hall Dongo went right into Hall whos called for the foul PJ shaping up all game hes almost behind the backboard by the time he releases that they call him the hall American well tonight hes made his case for why he should be an all ACC first teamer and an allamerican at the end of the season 30 points 14 rebounds and knowing PJ Hall like we do he doesnt care about the numbers he just wants to walk out a Little John Coliseum with the Applause win Dongo made them both thats now nine straight games in double figures for the sagales sensation in his freshman season for Georgia Applause Music Applause Tech Gerard quick trigger missed Applause it and thats a double double for Bango 11 points 10 rebounds Georgia Tech continuing to B battle on the road in overtime 3 minutes to go trailing by Applause two theres that switch kick to the corner Reeves buries it kaasi Reeves fires Georgia Tech in front J hes money thats at least three triples in that deep Corner five threes on the night for Reeves the first lead since it was 3028 Applause Godfrey spinning his way free missed it tall he cant clean up the spill Balls loose Miles Kelly has Applause it Georgia Tech leading for the first time since the first half can they steal one on the road with two minutes to go here in overtime theyre just going Twan game with George and Dongo the two freshman 5 Seconds to shoot Dongo leaves it off for Claude and a foul Applause called how about the Poise and the trust that Damon Stout has is these two freshmen I mean hes gone to him the last couple of trips down the floor clears it out puts Reeves in the Deep Corner opposite the ball and for Clemson they commit that foul with two seconds on the shot clock Claud ratts at Applause home chlin comes back in hes been battling cramps in this second half in overtime Music Applause threepoint lead for Georgia Tech does Clemson have a punch back here in OT Hall a careerhigh 30 hands off Gerard Chaplin in attack mode through contact gets it to go same set different side of the floor Dongo the spin tees up Claude missed it a foul call so ties on Claude right back to the foul line where he just made two what a play what an incredible play I mean coach zamal is just going to the same thing over and over clear it out Twan game look for that 45 cut on the weak side PJ rotates over to help and Claude has a lane what an effort by Damon stto this Georgia Tech team they trailed the entire second half until Nathan George tied it with 23 to go now have the lead here in overtime can they finish thats the one thing that is escaped them in this fivegame losing streak theyve been in positions to win they have not finished big test Music Applause Music here one minute left in the extra session Hunter for the tie missed it Chaplin offensive rebound lays it up and in Ian shefin 16 points a double double for him 13 rebounds you see a sense of urgency now in Clemson crowds in it trying to will this team to the Finish Line right back to Dongo everything working through the freshman and he travels Big Time defensive stop Clemson with the basketball trailing by one do you run your sets here Jay and you look for PJ Hall on the inside and youve been dominating the offensive glass all game so youre going to take this shot with time to get to the offensive board youre not trying to go for to the end you just run your stuff right here and accelerate through and look for PJ oh calling for it and a foul called on the floor so PJ Hall an opportunity to take the lead from the foul Applause line he already has a careerhigh 30 points and 15 rebounds but seins really struggling through that y the cramps right now hes trying and that is the fifth foul on the Freshman by Dongo who has touched the ball every possession for Georgia Tech in overtime he has battled against one of the best bigs in the ACC and the entire country tonight Valiant effort for that young man now can his team hang on to this lead for the final 23 seconds PJ Hall trying to fire Clemson back in front from the foul line both teams with a timeout Applause remaining you better be ready to box out if youre Georgia Tech right Applause Music here Paul missed it so the best he can do is tie it at 82 and youre right about the box out Clemson 17 offensive rebounds Applause Music tonight Davis St just till Roger SS he wants a timeout and he gets it Hall ties it at 82 Damon statamire an opportunity here to draw up a winning play play on the road you have to expect Georgia TKA to hold for the last shot absolutely youre youre just changed Personnel Jack Clarks getting another chance right here on a defensive possession Clarks first action in nine games hes been out injured this is a big spot Brad branell trusting the transfer for medy State he gave up a three to George earlier here we go a fun finish coming already in overtime under 15 seconds to go I think Miles Kelly keeps it gives it off to George who hit the game tying three right to the rim loose ball underneath and Clemson forces the turnover Brad Brown now takes his final timeout and the Tigers a chance to win it here with two 25 left at overtime this is good defense right here by Music Applause Music Clemson I think thats Godfrey that gets a hand on it Kelly just cant handle it right there so while the ball itself never went out of bounds Kelly touched it while his hand was out of bounds I think theyre going to take a look at it if any part of your body is touching the ball and out of bounds Balls out of its out of bounds and I think thats exactly what happened underneath the hoop for Miles Kelly there is he out yes hes out yes that left hand M right there so assuming that it will stay Clemson ball Debbie what do you do here if your bra Brown out well you also are looking at the clock while youre over there to make sure the right time is on the clock uh they try to throw a direct Pass Christian Lake style from the Baseline to PJ Hall at the logo on the other end of the floor you might want to consider something like that but you do have two dribbles once again you you can you can get two dribbles in a shot off and the timeout allows PJ Hall to get back on the floor remember he was out on a defensive possession and Joe Gerard will Sub in as well you got to screen hard you got to cut hard you got to accelerate through your stuff right Music here the officials are still over at the monitor miles Kellys hand was out of bound but was he touching the ball the time his hand was out of bounds Im sure thats what theyre looking at plus the time okay so right here his hands inbounds now his hands out of bounds as he touching the ball right there yeah hes not touching the ball right there look at the bounce of it its not spinning is it is that off his foot foot underneath you have to look at the rotation of the ball Music too they did put 29 on the clock so and it is Clemson ball so you might have three dribbles the sheflin cannot run the Baseline thats right spot throwing Applause in I got it Applause chefin heaves it looking for Hall rips it away PJ for the win and we are headed to double overtime here in Applause Clemson what a game by Dongo on the court having fouled out for Georgia Tech Advantage again front line to Music Clemson Tigers win the T theyre going to show Zone here to start this second overtime and with d go out they just really dont have anybody to D up Hall you really got to communicate where Gerard is Hunter wide open missed it chlin another offensive rebound what a night Ian sheflin has had battling cramps for the entire second half at overtime he is now got his seventh offensive rebound 14 rebounds on the night I mean its one thing to understand angles and read the ball off the rim its another to have the incredible will that sheflin has to go to the glass every time he carves out space so nicely for himself with that big wide Applause frame missed them both Hall Taps the re rebound to Hunter possession stays Music alive thats now 20 offensive rebounds for Clemson in this game can they cash in Chaplan spinning his way through and a foul Applause call another offense of glass what a great effort by Applause Music Hall its a battle of wills right now Jay thats exactly what it is 18 points 14 rebounds for Chaplin can CL lson cling to this twopoint lead here in double Applause overtime George left it off for Claude couldnt handle it Hunter right to the R everything but the Finish brow Brown now is livid storming onto the floor wants this to be reviewed says it was off of Georgia Tech last Damon staty now at midcourt take another look who touched it last yeah thats off Georgia Tech and Roger SS comes over to tell us it cannot be revealed Applause they just showed it up on the video board this home crowd is tired its late and theyre unhappy and the so Club is probably Laughter Applause closing Kelly off the bounce into traffic missed it but Taps it home Miles Kelly thats a gutsy play I keep waiting for Miles Kelly this is his time right here Music Applause I heres Chase Hunter attacks the rim again draws the foul he has done well getting himself to the foul line tonight where hes six of Applause seven miles Kelly in the paint with an extra effort play and an offensive Applause rebound Chase with a good take right there drawing contact to get a trip to the line hes been very aggressive in the overtimes the last couple of possessions I mean the last trip down he basically missed a layup almost expected contact and it never came so he put too much on it flew right by the rim makes them both 16 points on the night for Chase Hunter Debo Coleman checks it to the game for Georgia Tech hes a threepoint Applause threat under three minutes left in double overtime Clemson a twopoint lead foul off the ball Applause the chase Hunter is trying to say that Miles Kelly was holding his arm but I think Hunter was Music holding Kelly Applause and you got to give him room to move theres got to be a freedom of movement there cant displace him Kelly shooting into the Clemson students Applause action makes one of two 12 points for Kelly on the Applause night Zone come on right here right now lets go heres PJ Hall missed it and Georgia Tech gets the rebound do you go back to Kelly here I Applause do Miles Kelly in attack mode right to the rim Miles Kelly fires the yellow jackets back in front explosive off the bounce with his first step all night staying in the zone PJ Hall working out of the short Corner heres Gerard deep three Off the Mark KY the rebound he thinks he was Applause hit and Lee Cel stops play Music Applause Damon statamire are pointing at the clock think theyre trying to decide if theyre going to look at it or not saying under two minutes review this they can obviously review it anytime if they think its an elbow okay well there right but there was no whistle and if they ask if you ask to review you couldnt lose a timeout now at this point in the game I think there be a professional courtesy though to go and look at Applause it tough to tell from that angle because sheflin doesnt hit him on the swipe Roger SS quickly looks at it says play Applause on so Georgia Tech ball onepoint lead on the road here in double overtime youre not going to call faking or flopping right here here either not at this point in the game good professional courtesy by the refs both ways George fading away hits it he is tough The Fearless freshman 18 points a career high and theyve been able to stay in this Zone with the Applause lead Chase Hunter puts it up Perfect Touch got to get a stop here Jay onepoint gain a minute left in double Applause overtime George step back money Nathan George you would never know hes a freshman ice in his veins are on the road he hit the game tying three to force overtime and he comes up up clutch again inot bask under basket is under review they called the long two on the floor what a step back Drive the defender Hunter down into the lane and then pull it back Music just 19 years old he reclassified to be in this freshman class only had three offers Seattle U Corpus Christie Sam Houston State here he is in the ACC making big time plays and thats as close as it gets because theres gold on the front of his toe on that shoe it looks like hes behind the line if it was black it might not look that way Im not kidding like Im talking about the color of his shoe I think its a three a two was the ruling on the floor so does Roger SS have indisputable evidence here to change it to a Music three Music and the rule is a two so it stays a one possession game Clemson basketball trailing by three and you dont need a three here well the clock did not start on the scoreboard there it goes well Gerard let it walk up into Hall rejected goes back up with it jump ball possession arrow with Georgia Applause Tech Yellow Jackets ball with a threepoint lead well everyone in the building knew the ball was going inside right here walled up at The Rim is Claude and then the digg in off the rebound by Deo Coleman Applause now do you foul here to extend the game if youre Brad Brown out you let this Im d right Applause here you got to really rely on your D to get a stop right here how good has Nathan George B tonight for Georgia Tech I might run two at him a career high 20 now trying to finish this road win and snap a fivegame losing streak 5 Seconds to shoot George hes kept it himself now kicks Reeves I dont think he got it off in time doesnt matter anyway cuz it didnt hit the rim so its a shot clock Applause violation got to check the time though empty possession for Georgia Tech they will go over to the monitor to make sure the clock is right here the Tigers do have one timeout that might have been uh maybe should have started that a little bit sooner than eight on the clock right I thought George was going to keep the ball and not give it up I actually think he might have gotten it off I think theres theres 125 on the clock right now but that looks like they might add some Applause time and they do 134 now Im not sure coach stay would consider fouling here because they they havent been a very good offensive rebounding team right so if you put Clemson to the line theyre a very good free throw shooting team you dont expect them to miss but they have missed some in overtime they havent been good on the glass and for Clemson I mean if you can take a quick two I think you take the quick two especially because they have been Dreadful from three just three of 19 tonight and 0 for five from three in overtime Kelly is on Gerard well the pace of this right here theyre going for three hall for the tie missed it but a rebound a foul on the rebound so itll stay with Clemson a cost whistle goes against Coleman which keeps Clemson alive in this game all he needed to do was not foul there and George Tech headed back to Atlanta with the win thats a deep three for PJ just a little bit short push off Music inside so 48 on the clock each team with one Applause Music timeout Georgia Tech had not led the entire second half Nathan George tied it with 23 seconds left to force overtime they have battled now here in double overtime trying to close out what would be a Herculean Road win well you got to make the first one to consider missing the second Chaplin rattles it home now what do you do Debbie well you have to practice this I think sheins going to going to miss it because they offensive rebounded so well 22 offensive rebounds on the night for Clemson can they get number 23 Chaplin made Applause it now you got a foul right Applause away timeout Damon stom uses his final timeout to talk things over onepoint lead youve got to get this inbounds cleanly you got a foul right away because weve seen Clemson try to execute with 25 or 26 on an a baseline out of bounds on the other end and they have not been able to get a good look yet right so you know what Im saying here Jays 48 you got to foul immediately so you have enough time that you have another dribble mhm or two more you dont have to just heave it like theyve done exactly Georgia Tech right here George money in the late game time and score on the step back big bucket after big bucket for the rookie wall up at the Rim by Claude and then the dig in and tie up by Coleman put somebody on the ball you cant get beat over the top you got to make Georgia Tech come back to the ball and you got to foul instantly Yellow Jackets out of timeouts you can run the Baseline Reeves is the inbounder youd think this ball would go to sturen or for George Reeves gets it in cleanly the foul comes quickly and Kyle cerent will head to the line for two once again their best free throw shooter s of an 84 on the season and thats the fifth foul against Dylan Hunter so his night is done made his first start of the Season tonight alongside side his brother Chase in the Clemson back court so Brad Brownell can use the time on the substitution for the foul its a its the right I mean its a good break for Clemson that this is the player that committed the fifth foul so you can use a little bit of that time Georgia Tech can use it as well so the best Georgia Tech can do here with Kyle sturdivan at the foul line is make it a threepoint game well the last time they needed a three Joe Gerard was a decoy P PJ Hall took a deep Applause one Clemson has struggled from three tonight three of 20 Joe Gerards warming up his shooting arm out Applause there heres St of Applause it Brad Brown now wants to ice the shooter calling Music timeout his final timeout and youre right Debbie at the end of regulation and the first overtime Clemson had the ball with two seconds and change how does the Playbook open up when you add two more seconds onto the clock because you know I was saying you had two dribbles now you have pot for dribbles if you can catch the ball on the move like not have to come back to the ball and then change direction if you can catch the ball on a swing or on a cut and you can move up the floor you put pressure instantly on Georgia Techs defense see Georgia Tech wants to play a little bit softer cover right you know like keep them from getting behind them make them come back to the ball that could affect one or two dribbles and improve your quality of shot if youre Clemson thats why the time mattered on fouling quickly you got to be clear with your team right here time and score if he misses you need a two or a three to win can you even get a two with 4 seconds absolutely St of it makes it the best Clemson can do is tie and force triple overtime here Kelly on Gerard actually Coleman on Gerard also Clemson just three of 20 from three they need one here to extend the game hall for the tie missed it Georgia Tech stuns Clemson in double overtime what a road win for d in sire to end a five game losing Music Applause streak goty effort Debbie what an incredible finish Georgia Tech made more plays late
