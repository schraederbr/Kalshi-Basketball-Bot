Ron Groover AJ Desai Anthony Eids are officials Staples matched up with Dorne The Hawks the Hokes first meeting in six years underway in Southwest Virginia Yeah the Hawks in the middle of a brutal road trip which well talk about a little bit later Coming off of a tough loss to North Carolina ENT on Friday Meanwhile the Hokes beat Western Carolina on Thursday Theres Dorne Quick work and a quick buckets set play to start the game Try to take advantage of that height Dorne is just bigger and stronger than anybody that the Hawks have Here is Teal the South Carolina State transfer Keep an eye on Jolandro down low for the Hawks He can step out and shoot it Score inside Speaking of people who can shoot it of Dallas COMING OFF THAT 30POINT OUTING PICKS UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF EXACTLY EXACTLY Talk about stepping up production He had the assist on the first play the basket on the second possession Worth noting that Jaylen Bedford not available today dealing with an illness Its Jaden shooting the starting five for Virginia Tech Yeah James been getting a lot of time anyway And theres Landro right on Q shooting 49 from distance Id say those are numbers that coach Hills happy with Yeah hes hes certainly their best player averaging 12 and four Got in a little foul trouble the other night against ENT Johnson lost the handle Cooper scored 20 against the Aggies Itll stay here And speaking of coach Cleo Hill Jr in his second year great work at Winston Salem State now the D1 ranks Maryland Eastern Shore Just a wonderful guy and uh realizes what a challenge he has and uh you know is very optimistic about this team He hes treating this this stretch of the schedule as a as a try out to get ready for MAK play A quick five points for the Hawks tied the game at five Dorian Staples with a little jumper right there Virginia native from Fredericksburg Massaponics High School This a battle tested team there You know this is not going to be anything thatll put them in shock but that might of Dallas Johnson baseline the dunk Ah great Just great communication Thats one thing thats really been fun to watch about Virginia Tech this year is how they share the basketball And most of it starts with Neil Abdales and his great vision Staples all the way to the rim able to get that to go Ah backed up the jump shot with the drive to the rim A Hokei struggled a little bit the other night against Western Carolina with the ball screen and roll and ball screen set that play up for the Hawks Shoot rise and fire Front rim wont drop Landro Great contest from Dorne to force that miss Yeah they like to shoot it in transition like that They dont shoot the three a ton Hansberrys been so good as of late Jaden shoot Runner wont fall He doesnt move inside that arc very often but usually hes efficient in there Not only has been shooting the ball better hes been playing really well on the defensive end for coach Young and their staff too Michael Teal started every game this year for the Hawks creating unselfishness and the three wont fall from Beckwith who shoots it well in practice trying to translate that to game action Yeah you can tell hes got a good looking shot but uh he hadnt had the game success that coach Hill would like or expect Shoot the runner in and out And a quick turnaround for this Maryland Eastern Shore team They played Friday night and here they are Sunday at noon Yeah had a big rivalry game a former MAK game with North Carolina ENT who has moved on to the CIA and and this game is at their pace right now They want to play this game The Hawks want to play this game in the 60s and Virginia Tech wants it up And it looks like maybe we have a double foul right here applause Our officials will take a look Well tell you what comes from it when we return to Castle Coliseum on this Sunday afternoon two fouls on that Uh you know and and we were talking during the break uh Virginia Tech can can withstand Dorne being on the bench Uh you know especially with Gerdo coming in Gerdock coming in but uh Maryland Eastern Shore if Landro is in foul trouble they they really struggled the other night against North Carolina ENT one of their top offensive options He stays on the floor Gerak came in Theres Teal off balance from the elbow Puts the Hawks in front Yeah Doesnt look to shoot a lot but uh but can jump up and make a critical shot Made a big one down the stretch against ENT on Friday night Maryland Eastern Shore against Virginia earlier in the week Played the Cavaliers tough early Opening 10 minutes Hanssbury no luck Pasha rebound for Teal the reigning CA rookie of the year getting some early minutes Yeah Posasha some early minutes and uh three subs on the floor for Mike Young early in this game Maryland Eastern Shore theyre not afraid to go deep into their bench 14 players have played in the last couple games Back the board off the miss from Staples Hanssbury with the left hand unable to bank it in Gets his own miss He wont miss that shot twice No he hes been playing so good and and hes such a hard matchup No matter you know whether youre playing a smaller team or a bigger team they they can find him and theyve done a great job in these last several games of of getting him the ball where he can score Landro That crosscourt pass deflected by Gerak Forces the turnover Turnovers was what coach coach Hill was afraid of and turning them into points on the other end They did a good job of getting back after that turnover though Hansberry Hes been such a great passer as of late He turns he fires Not that time Landro right into the hands of Thompson 10 seconds for Teal to work with The senior creating draws the foul on Hammond Virginia Tech Theres the head coach of Virginia Tech Mike Young So many championships at Wford and ACC title at Virginia Tech third longest tenur coach in the ACC at his current school Yeah hes done such a great job for a long time Longtime assistant to Richard Johnson at Wford Took over there and took that program not only into division one but took successfully into division one was uh was kind of a giant killer Had a lot of power four power five victories and has done such a good job here including an ACC tournament title at Virginia Tech What a run that was a couple of years ago They were playing highlights of that during the pregame The shot from Darius Maddox against Clemson That was a big one wasnt it Off the sideline The win against Duke in the ACC championship game Heres Michael Teal Mentioned earlier he played at South Carolina State transferred in conference to Maryland Eastern Shore Yeah Interesting Interesting They had seen him play and obviously he had seen them play felt like he might be a better fit there and hes done a good job Really a point guard kind of mentality Pass first for more on Teal Lets throw it over to Tamar I think my favorite part about learning more about Teal yesterday when we were with Coach Hill was talking about how he was a late addition to this team which made him late obviously to team conditioning but he still came in second place when they ran the mile Like I wish I could come straight off the couch as coach said and then come in second in the mile Like give me your workout plan Me too As Hammond gets downhill puts Virginia Tech back in front Another guy getting extended minutes more minutes with Toby Low out And he has certainly delivered Played great against South Carolina on the road in the big SEC ACC challenge Thompson Hall open on the wing Too strong Offensive rebound for Oanla You know Bonas playing really good basketball lately Super athletic Had a great game against ENT on Friday night Well talk more about that heartbreaking loss they had down the stretch Dallas and the board from Mond Well Eastern Shore has done a good job of not allowing too many second shots Hansbury got his back and scored but thats been about it on the offensive glass for Virginia Tech cheering Johnson with the deflection Got his hand on that entry PASS UP AHEAD ABDALES THE TWO HAND FLUSH Pasha is usually the one making that pass in transition This time its Pasha to Abdollis And thats one thing Pasha can really do Saw it a lot last year with Delaware Obama 18 points on Friday The jump hook turnarounds there He did So active Bouncy Number four rebounder in the MAK Dallas Hes been active early Gerak turns fires and hits with the left hand Nice play And another assist for Odales Gag has played productive minutes Just a freshman He led Virginia Tech in rebounds against Western Carolina on Thursday night with seven Back and forth Opening nine minutes High low pass of Dallas Read it perfectly Hammond will try the transition tray and a foul on Pasha Well were step aside When we come back a story youre incredible and u coachill was a good player himself but he wasnt nearly as good as his dad Second alltime leading scorer at Winston Salem State And how about that All those years later his son would get to coach there How special great basketball family And also as we mentioned talking with coach last night unbelievable human being Yeah he is enjoying this process even though its tough Speaking of enjoying the process Trey Hall shooting just 21 Yeah hes hes just started playing I think Friday was his first game Also have Trey Brown in the game of a big point guard that that uh the coaching staff really is high on Hammond searching for the triple You bet But again Abdales that you stay a little long on the double team on the ball screen and he finds that open guy Justin Mond transfer from Georgia Southwestern State early Lets go back to that Ben Hammond triple Yeah And youll see the see him drag the defenders So somebody is open and he found exactly the right guy Hammond could have made the next pass to Gerdock in low but Hammond caught it in rhythm Really nice decision by the point guard Feel like weve said that a lot this year The right decision by Neo of Dallas Yeah And thus you know Mike Youngs team taking better care of the basketball this season That was a big point of emphasis after last year where they struggled a little bit with that But Im sure well get into that more as the game goes on too And right back at you another three for the Hawks to tie the game at 18 Its Trey Brown again Exactly We talked about Trey Brown and his vision is a big point guard and uh something Hooks are used to with Avdales on this team Hammond picked up his second personal worth mentioning Still on the floor Johnson hand in his face Good defense that time especially by Obama cutting that drive off by Tyler Johnson Made him take a tough shot 11 Hawks have already played in the opening 11 minutes Yeah and Im pretty sure all 14 played against Virginia and against North Carolina ENT Tough shot from Landro Kurtak with the defense Crosscourt Shoot Gak What a great pass and a better finish Yeah youve got to run it Shoot He puts it on the floor creates an advantage You heard the entire bench over there for the Hawks screaming shooter laughter And rightfully so Jaden Shoot first time in his career five straight games in double figures today Drawing the start in place of Jaylen Bedford Long three on the way Not that time from Trey Hall whos been good early Yeah kind of a big stretch four Shoot Yes again Hammond made the right decision found the trailer and shoot does not need much space He is the only Hulky to knock down a triple in every game this year Obama looking for a shot Not there Johnson pestering with six Fires and hits What a shot Obama played with a lot of confidence and he has shown this year He has really scored in some big games 20 against Hampton 16 against Bingmpington 15 against Longwood and 18 points on Friday Honing by two under eight media timeouts foul against Maryland Eastern Shore The three ball Both teams taking care of the basketball I I did not have Maryland Eastern Shore uh out rebounding Virginia Tech on my bingo card for today And and I also didnt have both of them making the same number of threes three apiece early in this game And Maryland Eastern Shore has has bounced back nicely from that heartbreaking loss Teal slowed things down for a moment Landro left side of the rim Been important Hes been able to stay on the floor after picking up an early foul Yeah And um he has done a nice job of playing without fouling because its physical down there in the in the low post Shoot straight away again Oh it was amazing Little dribble handoff that time Creates just enough space Landro score inside and outside And late in the shot clock another J for Trey Brown transfer from Salt Lake Community College Yeah earlier in the week when I visited with uh Coach Hill up in Charlottesville he was just raving about this young man He said just he hadnt he hadnt gotten the time on the floor yet but hes going to be really good for us And you can see that Dallas looks to create to the rim at the front of it Teal surveying in transition Hokes by four And whats been a back and forth first half Staples puts it on the deck Landro Tough matchup down there Hall Landro the board Jones defending up and under The right hand reverse layup Yeah Jones didnt get the box out right there The freshman getting schooled by the uh fifth year guy out of Melbourne Australia Had quite the journey Barton Community College St Leo University Concordia University Irvine and now at Maryland Eastern Shore HANSSBERRY STEP BACK THREE HIGH ARCING and through Wow Can we say he was a mismatch He really is difficult You put a big guy on him and hes got to step out there and guard him from the perimeter He can put it on the floor but clearly he can knock down a three Also made some big threes this week against Western Carolina Maryland Eastern Shores had an answer all afternoon for Virginia Tech Its Teal intercepted of Dallas Read it perfectly Hanssberry applause and theres the whistle An offensive foul No it was a block It was definitely a block There you get the offensive rebound Leandro a little old school and then the nice pass right there Shot fake creates space and tickle the twine Little string music as Joe Dean used to say Great back in the SEC days Great verb usage from coach A lot of different ways you can describe a make Now coach Young said after the win against Western Carolina about Ammani Ansbury best connector Ive had in 24 years as a head coach Yeah you can really initiate the offense through him And of course they were doing more of that with uh Toby Lau in the in the lineup the Maryland Eastern Shore bench yelling shooter again on shoot He lost the handle Beck with the extra pass for Cooper trying to hang on to it Pasha behind the back dribble Posasha the whole way with the finger roll Hits every part of the iron and down Yeah the Delaware transfer getting extended minutes today Hadnt hadnt seen the floor an awful lot Still adjusting to this style and level of play if you will Guy who had 33 starts last year at Delaware An outstanding season for Martin Englesby up there with the Blue Hens Isaiah Pasha with the defensive play the behind the back a little ball handling talent saw the opening and got it all the way to the rim Uh theyve enjoyed uh enjoyed this journey even though its not good on the win loss record Our Tamara Brown heard the Virginia Tech huddle Tamara what did Coach Young have to say Well Coach Young told his group youve got to contest everything And of course you know as a dad does a parent does as a coach does they he repeated it three times Contest everything Lets get three stops in a row guys Hes going to like Tyler Johnson with a corner three to extend Virginia Techs lead to double digits Yeah nobody contested that one And Johnson scoreless against South Carolina Hes really played well the last couple games Solid defender Just theres a lot of stuff that doesnt show up on the stat sheet Good switcher be strong rebounds the basketball and occasionally steals one Skip pass Johnson wants another Kurtak unable to tip the ball to himself How critical the next two minutes of change here for Maryland Eastern Shore Yeah theyre in the danger zone the list You know theyre either going to close the half with a little bit of a run and and hang in here or theyre going to be on the verge of of being in trouble Another steal by Johnson The bounce PASS FROM ADA HAMMOND SOMEHOW THE layin Dallas what a decision maker I know you you pointed out we use that a lot but goodness gracious he found just the right guy Lets go to Tamar with more on Neo Abdales If you guys didnt know Neo is a unicorn That is what coach Cleo Hill said about him He said I was scrolling Tik Tok and I discovered Neil Abdales Looking at his highlights I had no idea that I was going to play him this year He is 69 a point guard who is that that tall that skilled that unselfish Fast or slow he can pick you apart either way Cooper able to lay that in before Dallas tracked it down Yeah sloppy pass by Ben Hammond that time led to an easy basket The Hawks staying within striking distance Quick 50 run and going the other way Offensive foul against the Hulks Backtoback turnovers And while we were talking the three by Dorian Staples Hes had a really nice first half Well going off of Coach Young what he said after the Western Carolina game he said there were two things rebounding and defense Yeah And you know that thats going to be the theme going forward as they get ready for ACC play and a big ACC opener against a very talented University of Virginia team here on New Years Eve I cant think of a better way to close 2025 Man this Tech team we could talk about a little bit later but theyre going to have a lot of opportunities to bolster the resume down the stretch because partially Mack Im sure you could talk about this The ACCs been much improved this year across the board Off to a good start Decent job in the ACC SEC challenge going seven4 a year ago Uh thatll give you some indication of the of the strength of the league A lot of teams have upgraded their rosters including this Virginia Tech team Posasha hesitation and the left hand Tyler Johnson layup good Yeah and thats the kind of play Posasha can make He uh hes got really good vision A big tall point guard too Just uh again adjusting to this level of play Just over 40 seconds left in the first half Abdales diving and hell be whistled for the foul Apparently in some pain too which is obviously a big concern Hell be helped up by shoot and Hansberry And great effort Yeah As he goes towards the Virginia Tech bench Take another look Trying to come up with that ball Contact checked out by the outstanding sports medicine staff at Virginia Tech Looked like maybe the the knee of Teal Its kind of an awkward play there Hooks by nine Teal all the way to the rim Too strong Tech can hold for the final shot if they want it Id say they will unless they get a layup in the meantime and I dont think thatll happen Little set play right here Mike Young calling out the instructions You got to think shoot or Hanssbury might be involved in this Hanssbury had a three right before the horn on Thursday in the first half Hes got a look with three Same spot different result partner Hokes led by as many as 12 up by nine at the break 30 all year and and it continues to be here this afternoon too Entry pass to Johnson Easy layin Oh gosh Baseline out of bounds I dont know if anybodys better than Mike Young at drawing those things up and finding the matchup that he wants Got a layup on the baseline out of bounds Really nice job of execution Largest lead of the game for Virginia Tech has been 12 Cooper 18 points on Friday Turnaround shot is true He really has been playing well Played well also earlier in the week at Virginia Plays with a lot of confidence I think hes going to be a um a scorer that coach Hill can count on going forward Geract draws the whistle and heads to the strike Durot gets the start here in the second half and pays dividends immediately Has a nice job contesting this A tough shot but a really good finish by Jaden Cooper And then Christian Gerach You mentioned Cooper also had 20 points against ENT on Friday A transfer from Colia 75 games there over four years no starts New role for him this year with the Hawks Yeah Cooper and uh a guy we havent seen a lot of is Justin Mondon Theyve been really scoring the ball well lately creating oneonone opportunities Hawks a little confused right here Three short from Landro Second chance Teal downhill goes to the line himself What a good play took on one of the better defenders for Virginia Tech Took the cont contact contact made the basket and goes to the free throw line What a nice play Shot fake Good defender coming over Went straight up but brought that arm down just a little bit and goes to the free throw line Is that a skill that guards have to work at being able to draw the contact in that spot 100 And and usually they need to initiate the contact They dont need to be the recipient of the contact and he did a good job of jumping into the body of Tyler Johnson Cooper trying to harass Abdollis turns the corner hesitates misfires Nice move Cooper space Levi Beck with the freshman Teal into the corner Strong rebound for Flippen The drop off Cooper the layin Yeah nice offensive rebound by Flipping Offensive rebounds havent been a big part of this game on either end of the floor but that was an important one right there Hawks hanging around Dallas right back at you to the rim he goes Weve seen him doing that more and more and of course he has such a height advantage You you talk about driving in there and taking the contact but also when youre looking down at the defender you got a pretty good chance Teal draws the whistle The foul going Yeah shoot a little bit handsy on that possession right there when they turn the corner Shoot got a little little too much contact Good veteran crew here this afternoon Ron Krueger AJ Desai Anthony Eats our officials And theres another Lets see I thought they were about to call a foul Looks like kick ball Chance for Coach Hill to draw up his baseline out of bounds The game clock issue is what were looking at right now Oh yeah 172 is probably not right laughter 1720 looks better Another corner three again Too strong Theres Flipping offensive end Flips it underneath Itll stay with the Hawks Slipping hadnt gotten as much time as uh he might have expected going in A preseason all meak choice He has yet to start after 27 starts last year Averaged just under 10 points per game Guy who didnt start playing basketball until he was a sophomore in high school Yeah amazing Nice play post up little jump hook Uh and of course his his minutes have been kind of taken by Landro and uh tough to play those two together apparently Very different players and skill sets very much so But both strong on that block A Dallas spins to the rack Will shoot free throws Yeah ball got tipped in but obviously goending offensive basket interference but Abdales get a couple free throws coming off a another really good performance Sorry to cut you off there Part of the MAK preseason first It was interesting 12 new players for Maryland Eastern Shore flipping one of those returners but as you mentioned his minutes not as what they were last year Yeah And and of course that can still change too Like you know coach uh Hill is obviously told us hey this is all a try out This whole nonconference thing is a try out to see who I can trust once we get into MAK play And of course they dont even get to go home They dont even get to go home in the month of December late November the last time that Maryland Eastern Shore played a home game Lot of travel especially this time of the year with the finals It could be a lot Yeah its a some some tough bus trips Obama finds flipping Theres Gak aggressive defensively Bala long rebound foul line jumper front rim No Cooper unable to pull that down Might have been over the back A lot of action right there Leading by 10 eight different scores Hanssberry goes to work Everybody gets a touch on this possession Shoot Handsberry and there on the second chance Yeah an important possession right there Got the stop after two or three offensive rebounds on the other end and score ironically on an offensive rebound on their possession graduate of TC Williams High School Michael Teal Hanssbury and Obama have been going after it in there Maryland Eastern Shore A lot of corner threes as of late None have fallen cheering Pasha has the height advantage Hanssbury stripped Itll stay here Itll be Virginia Tech basketball when we come back Hokes by 12 on a Sunday afternoon inside Castle Coliseum A Hall of Fame left tackle Some great history there And literally the last Jets franchise highlight Maxs been looking forward to giving me a hard time being a Jets fan all day There it is Yes And you are correct about that Its Super Bowl three They might be losing right now to the Jacksonville Jaguars as we speak There you go Our NFL talk today Dallas whos been active Hes got a careerh high in steals Teal comes from behind swipes that away Yeah you dont see that happen very often but Abdales not aware Oh Bona Thought he might go a little oneonone right there Cooper guarded by Abdales from the logo Teal swirls around the iron A good look at it again Not a big scoreer but can make those open shots Hanssbury kick to the corner Hammond unable to drop that in and Brown able to spin away with the rebound HERES THE LOB IN TRANSITION TWO HAND FLUSH ZION OBANLA YEAH Trey Brown with a nice look ahead and Oanler running the floor What a spark O Bonds been as of late for Maryland Eastern Shore He might come off the bench but hes one of their top scorers No question What a beautiful drop off Hammond to Hanssberry Ball loose of open three LATE IN THE SHOT CLOCK HE CONNECTS WOW AN UGLY possession turned into a thing of beauty with a little hustle and off Dallas with the finish Second triple of the game He leads all scores with 13 cheering Teal stepped out of bounds Lets go back Transition for the Hawks off of the turnover Oban running ahead and what a beautiful pass Okis OK fans are used to seeing that on the other end with ADA delivering the ball but this time the Hawks turn the favor Zion Obama the senior out of Houston Texas D2 transfer Hes going to be fun to watch in MAK play Yeah no question Hes getting better and playing with such confidence right now Dallas trying to find Johnson Itll stay with the Hokes Yeah a little miscommunication right there A Dallas thought his teammate was going one direction went the other and then fortunate for the Hokes to maintain possession 10 on the shot clock side out of bounds shoots Kurtak YES THROUGH CONTACT WHAT CONCENTRATION from the freshman Really good defense by Maryland Eastern Short to contest that shot Shoot Takes a difficult shot But how about the awareness of Gerdak to understand the shot clock did not reach that and he had to get the ball up immediately He reacts to it Had to finish that and did through the contact Big play by the freshman As we talked about Virginia Tech players stepping up without Toby Lau Christian Geraks involved in that conversation No question Gak and and Dorne in in the center spot Largest lead for the Hokes coming into this game Seven players averaging nine points or more A lot of times coaches talk about theyre willing to play a lot of players in the preseason Both of these coaches have shown early in the year they absolutely are And thats a foul on shoot his second Virginia Tech Maryland Eastern Shore first meeting since 2019 Coach Youngs first year And when he went through the handshake line he shook the hand of a Virginia Tech Hall of Famer Ace Custous who was an assistant at Maryland Eastern Shore That brought him on staff We We did a game with Maryland Eastern Shore where Ace was the assistant back in the day when you were like a sophomore or something Thats true His jersey hanging in the Raptors of course one of the alltime greats Thats out of bounds And itll be Hoke basketball when we come back Hulks by double figures inside a castle After review um shot music clock will be reset to 20 Uh Virginia Tech ball underneath The shot clock resets again a baseline out of bounds this time to post up AD Dallas on the backside and he finds Hansbury wide open active again and for more on the Hokes freshman we toss it over to Tamara Brown well Evan you called coach Cleo active coach Young was animated in that Hokes huddle just now talking about Gerak he said you look like a Tyrannosaurus Rex out there going after those rebounds Keep it up And he did right on Q Perfect timing Like a TRex The offensive rebound drew the contact again and goes to the free throw line You think about the last couple of games for Christian Gerdak Mentioned that he led Tech in rebounding against Western Carolina Just nine points over his last five games since scoring 15 against Bryant Hes now in a double figures with 11 Yeah And I would argue despite the not scoring hes played good basketball during this stretch and uh and today hes doing it and producing numbers Landro was one of the top scorers from Ali just with five Obama had the big dunk earlier unable to finish at the rim there of Dallas Stops pops misses the triple Theres Gerach again Hammond launches misfires from the left arc Apparently was paying attention during that huddle Huh Hawks have gone cold now Four for 24 from threepoint land after four for 14 in that first half They only averaged five made a game Hookies turn it over Hookies Johnson and Pasha coming back in Hooks now going with the small lineup with really only one post player in the game We talked so much about the height of Neo Abdollis right a 69 point guard but something youve talked about all year Mac when Isaiah Posh is on the floor hes tall for a point guard as well at 65 Yeah Same same kind of player with the vision and that kind of thing but obviously not as advanced as the with the international experience as Agdales Turn around off the mark from Mario Hansen Jr If you want a story listen to this Mario Hansens dad played for someone named M McCarthy at Chattanooga in the 90s Averaged a little over 15 points per game the 9495 season Mack how would you describe his dads game Yeah his dad was a good player 65 about 230 and uh could do anything with the basketball He he was really tough Won a couple championship rings and was an allconerence player uh built completely different than Junior but uh and hes here in attendance tonight Theyre from Charlotte and hes here watching Mario Jr play getting his first action of the game cheering and connects there That is Mario Hansen senior right there He had that same look when he played too He was ferocious How cool Small world Pasha pulls up Not that time Oh nice move Created the space but couldnt get the shot down I havent talked a lot about Justin De Mondon whos delivered in some of the big games for Maryland Eastern Shore this year from an offensive standpoint puts it on the deck and the right hand lay You bet for Thompson Yeah he posted shoot up shoot gambled on the entry pass and instead gave up Two easy ones Mac whats been the best thing Maryland Eastern Shore has done today to hang around the way they have I think theyve just executed their offense Theyve taken care of the basketball Dallas will go to the line Tough take Yeah and and theyve battled on the defensive end battled on the back board you know still hanging in there with a with a slight lead really in the rebound margin of Dallas on Thursday 30 plus points against Western Carolina He and Cam Boozer the only ACC freshman with a pair of 30 or more point games Yeah we got a technical foul here I think two maybe one on each team A little confusion I think from both benches And it looks like according to the stats that Thompson of Marian Short of Dallas and Coach Youngs wanted an explanation as well from Ron Groover I think So there it is Technical foul at least in the stats to Abdollis and Trey Hall of Maryland Eastern Shore All right Im sure our folks had are on top of this and can show us what was going on Youre spot on Little talking little jawing back and forth and Mr Groover says Thats enough of that Ill take care of that Thats a whistle on Johnson Six foul Well be shooting the bonus from here on in both directions Quickly wrapping up that point about Abdollis and Boozer Thats going to be fun to watch this year in league play Those two theyre a lot of good freshman Uh another international guy is Tess Ditter up at University of Virginia And of course thatll be the opening conference game for the Hokes Hansen too strong back iron Well Easter has also done a good job in defensive transition Coach was very concerned about that And of course there havent been a lot of live ball turnovers Pasha releases a corner triple Burries it Hes been putting in the time putting in the individual work and working on his game trying to get some time in this lineup and has has gotten rewarded with some playing time here this afternoon First three of his Virginia Tech career flipping fast ball to the corner Second effort for Hall Stripped on the way up and heres Tech in transition Have numbers Shoots Corner three He stepped out Yeah that that was well executed till they stepped out of bounds but they found the wide openen shooter in the corner Here in the middle of exam time Those will wrap up in a couple days You know the new thing the new trend partner not as many finals its projects Projects Okay Thats kind of the I think I was looked at as a project laughter Officials have decided uh were going to make sure this thing doesnt get out of control and it hadnt been a lot going on but uh you can you can tell by the whistles that are blowing that uh that they want to make sure it stays that way Tyler Johnson just music picked up his third and for Virginia Tech today Obviously no Toby LW Jaylen Bedford unavailable with an illness and then have not seen Antonio Dorne since he picked up an early foul in the first half Yeah little early foul and and hes uh he also has a a wrap on his body out there He he may have cheering he may have gotten banged up a little bit in that exchange with Landro Ansberry there off the miss Virginia Tech as Elon on Saturday and then as weve been mentioning that New Years Eve game against Virginia Hard to believe nonconference play almost coming to an end Hammond downhill high off the window Not that time Great defense from shoot Hes asking for that to be last touched off of Paul Gets the call His leading by 17 when we come back We talk about maybe the best mascot in college basketball More at at their home court What do you think Mac And he won the mascot madness Was that what that was Thats Thats what that was Thats amazing Weve had Weve had a lot of Hulk issues here in the in in the arena cheering Had no trouble right there with the Hawks but the We had the St Joes Hawk over in the corner flapping the wings And now weve got Harry the Hawk He didnt make an appearance though If only the the 9 foot inflatable Hawk was here Thatd be really cool at halftime And theres the right hand attempt My goodness from Thompson Wow That was impressive Even it didnt go in shoots and in his face right back to him Hell drive dish Pasha cheering Hanssberry fires drills straight away late in the shot clock Nearing a double double 12 and nine is second three of the game Back after these messages on the ACC Network Extra Mike Young Bear down Those were the two words from Coach Mike Young Bear down You guys are guarding your butts off Holding them to 29 is a big deal Keep contesting those shots guys Thanks for that Tamara Always love hearing what Coach Young has to say Yeah And and usually were were in tune with him Thats good Hammond on Corks left wing BOTTOM OF THE NET Stop and a score Thats what you want to do Close out the game in the right way Ben Hammond year one to year two These are the stats that are up for him Minutes per game points per game free throw percentage rebounds per game assists per game steals per game just about every stat trending up Really gotten better We talked about how he finished last year so strongly after having a good freshman year overall You see the returning production for Virginia Tech Yeah the thing I like most about that is just the balance Everybody sharing the wealth of Dallas back in the game Almost a chance for a threepoint play much more difficult to prepare for a team that has a lot of different ways to attack you on the offensive end Every player except Sincere Jones has scored for the Hokes and hes back in and probably going to get extended minutes down the stretch Looking for his point first points of his collegiate career I told you yesterday wed see him today You did Hes been really working hard playing well in practice trying to get more time Neo of Dallas had that big second half on Thursday Wow did he go off from everywhere taking it to the rim in transition from three His biggest performance since the 33 against Providence early in the year Lets go to Tamar with more I asked Neo about that Thursday performance I said What was working for you He was so quick to say everything A lot of it had to do with the pace I love playing fast and the this Virginia Tech team does that And he also said Shout out to my teammates Theyre always looking for me Thanks Tamara Every time we talk to Neo mentions his teammates every single time Very unselfish Long three Mond Here is of Dallas with a mismatch Cooper at 63 on him Yeah I think hes a mismatch all the time and Flipping comes out and puts him on the free throw line Youre saying there arent many 69 point guards out there Yeah And and even if even if a big guards him hes quicker than the bigs Hes taller than the guards He is a nice weapon for Mike Young and and I think Coach Young is still finding unique ways to use him Also what does it say too about you know Coach Young has some of the best sets Hes so creative offensively this year allowing this team to kind of play a little bit faster From a coachs perspective what have you seen from that Yeah the the two things that jump out at you more offensive rebounding and thats a lot to do with personnel Uh and the second thing more shooting in transition getting out in transition Uh and again you know what coach Young teams always do is they share the basketball And uh and thats going to be the case no matter what Hes having to tweak a lot of stuff on the move Like right now they had their offense with to with Toby Lewis Now theyre doing it with more of a true center and free throws on the other end One more thought about transition Mack when when Virginia Tech gets to the ACC conference part of play is that something that can still continue being able to push and get out in transition be a fabric of this team Itll itll still be a big part of what they do Uh whether theyll be able to create the uh turnovers and uh and and get out that way Thats a little bit different Theyre going to have to do a lot of stops rebounds and then get out in And occasionally theyll theyll still be able to force some turnovers But uh but yeah that Im sure as good as they are at it they will want to push the ball and might even see him push on on made baskets Uh you know something Coach Youngs team really havent done all that much in the past cheering And some junior misses gets his own miss and the turnaround wont fall 7146 late in the second half Evans Mac McCarthy Tamar Brown with you Great find from Gerak Jones the extra pass Pasha nearly lost it of Dallas trying to find Pasha Seven on the timer Yep And thatll be interesting to see what they dial up Ball in dead corner over there A little bit different angle than the normal baseline out of bounds set play Hansberry Lonnie Hanssbury back in one rebound shy of a double double inside to Johnson Its the play they ran to start the half and the block from Hansen Shot clock violation Good defense that time Maryland Eastern Sure They they had given up a layup on that same exact out of bounds play earlier in the half but this time Mario Hansen Jr with the block Now thats something his dad did not do laughter I mean the Mario Hansen Jr you know he played in just four games last year at Robert Moore Still a young player gaining experience Yeah pretty highly recruited U already in his second school but seems to have found a place here trying to get in that rotation for Coach Hill Theyll stay here Okis off for a week finish up those exams and take on the Elon Phoenix next Saturday Right Thats correct Staples in the big first half Cooper and Staples lost it Johnson right place right time finds Jones looking for his first CAREER POINT HE GETS it in a big way The possible threepoint play The freshman finish it through the contact What a nice pass by Tyler Johnson throwing ahead Unselfish play The freshman running the floor Little euro step You always You always remember your first collegiate points right Then theyll have all Jones a little too handsy down low arm around the waist Its like that defensive back in the pass interference right there What a great football reference on this NFL Sunday from you College football playoff start next week A great Army Navy game yesterday Go Navy Beat Army Huh Thats Thats right That was a great finish So what 1716 And the Jets continue their losing tradition Down 21 to7 Just for you who are obsessed with those folks laughter I havent seen the score but thank you Yes Yes Hey were still waiting for another highlight 40ome years later after Super Bowl three Oh my gosh Its very cool though that Maryland Eastern Shore had that many people in that in that iconic game Its incredible It was actually a record for a long time A school with the most players in a Super Bowl It was replaced I believe by LSU that LSU team from 2019 the Super Bowl a couple years I think it was the Rams and the Bengals and Art Shell one of the alltime NFL greats Emerson Boozer Johnny Sample was great player He put the Jets and the Colts Thats right WHAT A GREAT FIND WHAT A BETTER DUNK HELLO Sincere Jones I think hes going to remember that one better cheering One of the highlights of the afternoon cheering He better box out Coach Coach Young will will limit his opportunities Hes got to box out on that other end too Sincere Jones Stay pulls off the window and theres Johnson soaring high pulling down the board Dallas Big day for Pasha Same with Gerak in double figures Oh what a beautiful move AND THE LAYUP ON TOP OF IT Fake one way go the other lay it up on the other side The freshman Impressive Hes nearing a double double 13 and eight Milo drop off Flipping Yeah half with tons of snow Too many opportunities to be honest And even though there really wasnt snow today the temperatures are going to drop into what as we speak down near zero Certainly negative wind chill but its been cozy in Castle No doubts Oki shooting 55 from the floor 46 from three Theres Jones whos had a big couple of minutes as of late This Virginia Tech team I want to credit Tim Thomas of the Tech Lunch Pale He had a great point on Twitter Look at the upcoming schedule right now as it stands Techs going to have 10 quad one opportunities four quad 2 opportunities Yeah thats really nice Mason Jordan jumped in a little 131 Give it a different look Tyler Johnson said cheering No problem Ill just space this thing out Knocked down the three Hes shooting 40 from distance Yeah he hes really worked on his game You dont think of him as that guy but he he really been very consistent this season Thompson went for the big flush earlier bounce pass to Flip and able to bank it in Strong around that rim And from Maryland Eastern Shore theyve been on the road since late November all the way to early January In MAK play Im really excited to see how this team fares against some of the top teams Yeah they theyve theyve gone through some things and gotten better and discovering who can play and theyve got tremendous depth 14 Maryland Eastern Shore players have played 11 have scored this afternoon cheering Theres Pasha on the defensive end Johnson wants another triple Not that time Pasha was trying to tell him Look for the ball Look for the ball Got him a good wideopen shot Again you want to finish you want to finish the game on a positive note And thats through Maurice Vel of Brooklyn Hes right around that season average averaging 83 a game And looks like they might be right near that number again PASHA TO THE RIM WITH AUTHORITY And cheering Pasha having some highlights here today Maybe feeling a little better about himself a little more confidence 26 minutes 7 points six assists two steals cheering Johnson a rebound from Posasha And theyll run that clock out Coach Young pointing to the corner of the floor And the crowd on this chilly afternoon in Southwest Virginia rise to their feet Virginia Tech to 10 and two with one nonconference game left on Saturday against Elon A solid performance good on the defensive end
