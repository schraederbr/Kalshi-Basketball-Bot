Syracuse the finale in our first day of five here at the ACC tournament and the nlls look for a lob to Taylor B Bowen who catches it out of bounds its an FSU immediate turnover Syracuse starting five is the one that Adrian arre has thrown out the last few games jquan Carlos big minutes JJ Starling their leading scorer Lucas Taylors really played well of late jard Davis and lamp in The Bigs theyve just played with better balance and it allows everybody to understand their role and figure out how to maximize the potential of that role here is Starling Syracuses leading score 172 a game and Starling drives around you and cant finish knocked out of the hands of lamin down to B Bowen no dayquan Davis for Florida City missed the last game with a left knee injury theyre hoping itll be available Off the Bench so Justin Thomas moves into the lineup Watkins and honorable mention are second Team all ACC with B Bowen Chandler Jackson and Malik Yan and itll be Florida State ball with 11 to shoot told you about one head coach Adrien ay he will be returning next year John wildhack Syracuse athletic director confirmed that Thursday despite a year of real struggles for Syracuse hired a new GM in the off season which is something we have to talk about seemingly with every College basketball program now Alex Klein theyre hoping that a great recruiting class will boost this program which is on track have its worst record in more than six decades but hoping to finish the season strong we could have found a picture of him smiling maybe when we what the camera shows reality B Bowen had has the first bucket the sophomore for Florida State Florida state has that length that height advantage and theyre going to seek out those opportunities when they get switches to attack Carlos for a three rolls it home off the feed from Starling you watch how they help off certain guys and and if hes able to make shots hes going to get good looks K Kwan Carlos not much of a score to 63 per game youan and the lkin this battle The Bigs will be fascinating to watch Yuan spins it Justin Thomas a contested three wont go and Yuan out muscles lkin for the pack its not just out muscle its kind of the the better Mobility could really wear down Eddie lampin Yan really moves well he plays well off the bounce and that could be a challenge thats why I consider the foul trouble an issue Davis takes it at Yan J Davis a Delaware transfer with a bucket the other side of that you get a match up you like you have to be able to attack it sometimes patience can kill you if you get the matchup attack Davis an NCAA tournament participant the Delaware fighting Blue Hens AR State went off of 7po wi over SMU on Saturday snapped a four game losing streak as Jacksons three is grabbed by Applause Music Davis starling off the shot fake Davis set up for three and Syracuse with a couple of early triples good quick action I think thats where you get some of your best options where you put the defense behind the play for a couple steps and long close out you get a good look Watkins meanwhile its entangled with Taylor and hell be called for the foul Lucas Taylor watch the drive kick all the bodies converge everybody comes to the basketball turn your back to your man and youre beat and again even if he misses this shot its a good look right what do I call it clappable misses its like we hang out or something its the free space on crisen Bingo clappable misses theres a theres some interesting things on that Bingo thats very much so its seven by seven thats the strange part of it Kyle cuffs onto the floor for Syracuse for the first time replacing Taylor Music someone ows the 11 seed time for the second worst seed ever at the ACC tournament they get a nice Bucket from Thomas off the cut fifth year Junior academically transferred from UTSA his fifth School in five years getting line how many times have you said that this year youre going to start seeing when somebodys not a transfer yep the thirdyear player from Syracuse in the lkin good feed from C and the big man with a lefthanded finish in the last two possessions both teams not enough ball pressure are you able to pick out your pass and and then covering the backside option or the high low is just too difficult little ball pressure takes that away CC shoot four for five Florida State now three for six there Starling at of Baldwinsville Syracuse suburb second year with the Applause orange Syracuse just one win in the first two quadrants all year one and 15 this would register as their best win of the year if they get it and C is denied b b and the nos leading shot blocker down the floor for you and inside and a goal 10 taken off the rim by Davis both team shooting it well Leonard Hamilton hoping this

Hamilton began his coaching career Luke LS was 20 years away from being born the Old Guard meets the new guard but Luke la a player at Florida State under Leonard Hamilton from 2008 to 2012 his dad was a walkon on the football team his uncle younger sister attended Florida State his wife Stevie was a swimmer and Luke Florida State fans will remember was a critical part of their 2012 ACC tournament championship team as a starting point c yeah look I think the reality is the professions changing because the game is changing right and its still going to be different in two years than it is today he played overseas and when you play overseas you kind of deal with oneyear teams you get a group of guys you got to figure out how to put it together and win he also played coached in the NBA coach in the developmental League where you got a oneyear team you got to figure out how to coach him Coach him up get him together and win I think some of that experience is going to be important for a lot of young coaches coming up in college basketball today where the world is just different watching his soon to be Florida State team hopes it wont be for a while Trail by three JJ Starling split the free throw great fine by Yan and Jerry Deng maybe their best threepoint shooter is a little long Carlos for the orange a started four for six hit both three into the lampin from Davis a high low game for a fivepoint lead the passes have just come too easy and I think teams are able to get comfortable and develop a nice Rhythm just being able to move the basketball particularly if youre able to get it into scoring areas Eddie lampkins Four Points have matched his game total from the first beating pull up pop from Jackson rebounded by cuff Syracuse is better right I mean they they just have a better bounce in their game right now that the step is playing with a little more confidence and almost a fearlessness it makes you dangerous gotten much better offensively questions can they find defensive consistency this side of the ball no problem lamin again hes three for three thats on you and defensively I mean hes just kind of standing there simple Blow by it puts his defenders in a bad spot Watkins and cuff get tangled up cuff gets hit with a foul and AJ decides going to separate the two very frustrated Kyle cuff Ed Lins been great to start just putting himself in position to make something happens he understands on the screen hes going to get a switch holds his seal not enough ball pressure youre able to move it around and like I said you and just a little Olay defensively you put everybody else behind you in a bad spot Lins been able to influence this game early Eddie lamin major foul trouble in the first game had four fouls played Just 18 minutes four points player B AJ Desai and the officiating crew reviewing a potential flagrant here again Mark schner and Jerry heer are the other officials and by potential it should not be and you know I dont I cant stand these why because it just sucks the life and the Rhythm out of the game I mean both teams are trying to establish themselves in this game and it takes a while sometimes it takes four or five minutes sometimes it takes 15 to really establish the rhythm of the game and it might be a little know a little off arm but theres a whole ton of contact oh LeBron got Music hit too soon you think its a little Champions League football action there yes or NBA anyway look I dont mind it I I get like if youre going to review everything you might as well try to sell it at the same time it just sucks the Rhythm out of the game talk about it for a few minutes like look if this is a flagrant one good lord its also a good time for my fourth official Im just saying a replay official actually adds value to the game overall in the sense that it keeps us from having unnecessary stoppages we can kind of keep this thing flowing basketballs a fluid game the more we stop it were basically just interrupting what makes the game great so Adrien alry would probably not enjoy many stoppages right now the way his teams playing with fluidity 6 for eight they havent turns it over leading by seven Florida States getting a chance to reset here and were just about to get a decision I always have to agree when they come over and tell us what it is but I disagree Music Music Mark snner is giving us an explanation were going to hear from AJ to sign a moment after after review the contact does not meet the criteria for a playr foul white ball on the side Applause line thats a little different than explation we just got it looks like thats just been changed you got a pump fake does not meet the criteria sometimes the officials pump fake too just keep keep us in check Im Im glad they did because that to me is only caused by the physicality of the defense a lot of times it looks bad but the defender all up in your space so just a personal foul on cup no flagrant no technical nothing else I was good about not disagreeing with him though sure yep Boston Holt is on the floor for Florida State which can go 10 deep as most Leonard Hamilton teams can thats poked away from Thomas heres Sterling on the run out he missed the layup Syracuses leading score hasnt put one down yet still the orange leads by seven Watkins tried to draw another foul there he is master of finding contact and getting to the line among the nations leaders in free throw attempts Cubs doing a good job on I like the physicality on the on the bigger ball handler sixyear Boston Hol with a tough shot it will fall through just a threo per game score with a basket I think if youre Syracuse youre okay with that you you cant hang your head on that possession thats a good defensive possession just a tough made shot now you have to get back to working these switches and finding the matchups and there it is just be patient Carlos is switched on to the big man Yuan Carlos passes out of it for a second time lamin very good passer and a great find to Starling passes up a three and scores it from the paint beautiful beautiful offense CU missed him at first You got to go inside because even if it leads to a double it gives you an advantage were going to get that on Carlos ding for a foul right near midcourt three of those against Syracuse right now you give me all this look welcome the double bring a double if you could pass out of the double great Retreat dribble hold the ball high pass out long close out and attack thats just a tough made shot but its good offense punish the switches punish the double theyre going to help you get an advantage by doubling in the post youve got to be able to dribble and pass out them Eddie Lamy could do that over two assists a game NCAA tournament at TCU in Colorado Watkins feathers it inside to Yuan a little bit of a tough catch heres Carlos on the Syracuse takeaway Carlos trying to bounce for lamin and that ball was kicked you know might not mind a couple of extra stoppages is Eddie lampin because he does go hard he runs the floor hard he battles down low and theyre going to need him for 30 plus minutes at least cup gets around Watkins leans in lamin had it lost it lampkins on the deck along with Watkins and then H lost it slipped off his foot Carlos with numbers Carlos cut off Davis off the mark look at C on the offensive board couldnt haul it in but he is frustrating Watkins right now catch it shoot three no good for Den Carlos again off the high dribble into traffic into trouble Watkins rips it away for seminol steel AJ swin the very athletic freshman drives it at Starling and this game needs a little reset unplug the machine plug it back in 1710 the 14th seed Music get the p face the present fors the future this is Champ we Applause w e Music get the past face the present fors the future this is Champ we day one of five here at the ACC tournament the heavy favorite the top SE the top team in the country the Duke Blue Devils well see them Thursday at noon North Carolina the wild card team one of the first couple of teams out of Joel lardys projected field they get Notre Dame tomorrow Wake Forest with a win and great stories here on the bottom of the bracket Louisville 12 wins the last two years combined in the two seed Pat Kelce coach of the year and Clemson after that but Syracuse and Florida St to have the show to themselves right now and Eddie lampin and zy Davis outscoring the nolles as AJ swintons jumper is Misty gets it back Deng will drive it into Chris Bell no good fight on the boards pinballs to Carlos Bell the sharp shooter will drive it and rim it out Florida state has one field goal in the last four plus minutes and that continues swintons Miss popped up by air maluk mes are five for 15 right now AJ Swit is just putting up everything 28 per game score feel like Im just going to let you take this part of the game man oh man Id wish you would jump in swintons Old for three Off the Bench Denzel for three Off the Bench Carlos for three and hell get it back set up Bell and hell miss it wow and its starting to feel like the first two games of this tournament where pit Notre Dame Cal and Virginia Tech combined to go 177 for three yeah if Im Syracuse though I dont get sucked into that game because thats a game where Florida State can put together a nice little run without you even knowing about it whereas on the offensive end Hs done a good job if you operate a little bit play with the switches find the matchup that you like get get any lampin down low force a double you at least play with an advantage and youre going to get a good look just be patient on the offensive end heres dayquon Davis Florida States very good freshman point guard in for the first time missed last game with a left knee injury and Syracuse has the former seminal big 74 nem McLoud patrolling the paint hes Music huge maluke sets a screen McLoud comes up to defend and Malo finishes well over the top of Carlos just put McLoud in a bad spot got to get those both hands high so just disallow that pass snaps a one for n for Florida State Syracuse over for its last five no Starling or lampin on the floor right now no Davis side wheres the offense going to come Applause from a cloud into movich hes fouled thats against the freshman and swi its good stuff when you just run your action good hard screen got to communicate that out cuz mcclouds just left in a bad spot you have such leg you can pass over the top of giants thats pretty darn good I think he qualifies right giant 74 Taylor off the mark from three tough with s CU might stovic on the on the floor hes a great screener but against the switching defense he wont have the same impact D got a shot blocked by Bell fights to try to get it back and McLoud emerges from the prey Syracuse not scored and coming up on three and a half minutes and a foul Carlos was going up this foul will be on the floor its on Davis is first what we we underestimate or undervalue or dont appreciate is how long it takes for some guys to kind of find their spot find their role on a team and I think I think Carlos is one of those guys where throughout the course of the Year through some injuries hes hes figured out where he fits he understands his role thats an important one first year coming over from hobra the up transfer can be a hard thing hes playing 35 minutes a game now over the last six Bell and a foul called actually Lucas Taylor and thatll be a two shot foul its on watkinss first I think my stovich is one of the best guys to have on the floor when youre playing against a defense that doesnt want to switch hes a good screener hes a good cutter you can just see that with the switches hes not really able to find a spot maybe a slip here and there he can get something Taylor 83 at the line coming up after our game keeping here on acc Network the nothing but NE crew which has been here all day hard at work in between games before after full recap of whats been already a wild first day here at Charlotte get a shot of him over there I know theyre listening cuz Luke hanock just pumped his fist Lets do lets define hard at work anymore I mean I tried to act like to my wife that it was a grinder of a day cuz we had to watch practices and call a game meanwhile shes chasing the 43 and Oney old around so she had a lot of sympathy what youre saying yeah totally off the hands of Jackson keeps it into Davis good scramble defensively Sy has been really active in these first 11 minutes just 12 points allowed Bell poked away from him but this is a different level of Engagement that frankly weve seen most of the season from Syracuse theyve been one of the worst defensive teams in power conferences theyre communicating though and look if youre scrambling well the the way they have in the last few possessions its cuz youre talking it out youre playing with urgency and Force Five turnovers they havent scored off them but neither has Florida State on those possessions I also think my storic is that guy youre a better defensive team when hes there cuz he talks he points just having one guy loud and communicative it makes you a better defensive team freshman out of sambour Serbia thear movich Starling back in the game for Syracuse he scored three orange missed their last six Starling in that trout you gets lost at times defensively sometimes loses the ball just sometimes doesnt take the step towards the ball but hes good on this end yes and more two three Zone you and knifed into the middle of it hell shoot the first Florida State free throws of the game just pretty stuff I mean start likes the matchups hes got and look who takes you and out of the play whos heres my guy its like a rub screen in football its only a penalty if they call itj Starling with five and Malik euan with five to match him coming off a career highight 26 in the win over SMU Saturday and and how about that maximize the time off the floor for Eddie Lampton he got a nice break and they lost nothing in this game and if not youre able to now come back get back to some ball screen options roll with a guard covering lampin play through him again thats Applause worked no good analysis yep Jackson took it away from Music Starling you it against my St garage behind the back drop off and a nice finish Inside by Den typically more of a threepoint Marksman in on lkin hes got the size to elevate Just Hold Your Position a tough finish from under the basket 69 sophomore up from Hampton University rainbow three Miss from Taylor my storic is on the floor comes away with it Bell redirects to tayor and Starling will reset like this lineup for Syracuse but but you got to capitalize on this got a good look lamin rimmed it out heres Watkins who has not taken a shot second Team all e player and a foul against a furious movich his second its been hard fought Kev both teams really physical on the defensive end I cuse obviously has the advantage against the switching defense you fall asleep you was got a great offensive game hell find you if you cut Music Applause Music shoot a free throw after the free throw theyre going to shoot a fre Corner after that the first a half shot is our win now we have about 45 seconds on the so in 2 and go all Applause 2 and Music like one of the best things you can do against the switching defense is screen to get the matchup that you like once you get that match up Eddie Lins going to be able to seal if you can make the pass hes going to be open but youve got to be continue to be patient the more you dribble into contact the more you get lost the more you play into the hands of the FSU defense Eddie Lin has had a supreme impact on the early part of this game totally neutralized in that first game at Florida State a 16point loss hes the leading scorer right now with six you got to punish the switch he has been awesome for them in Copper played 14 double doubles in the last 19 games steps back here and Watkins first shot of the game is pure Florida state within four he also complemented our suits in Syracuse so thats why you like him I was going to say thats why you like him Im not as insecure as you well I just get more compliments on my suit so Im used to it true pocket squares make a difference John you know Applause that Carlos on the Flo with Starling Taylor Davis and Lampkin this is starting five for the orange five to shoot for lampin Lucas Taylor threepointer Syracuse has missed its last six from three but again you got to get Eddie lampin in screening action to find something that you like otherwise you just pass the ball around and do nothing Davis has a little bit of an opening and takes advantage freshman out of Baltimore Florida state with seven straight couple good possessions you find a little rhythm if youre Florida State youre going to be all right theres the screen with lamin back from Carlos didnt want to get the ball there screens for Taylor driving into you in a wild finish and lampin with a one hand push Music it Leonard Hamilton can only shake his head at the end of the Florida State bench an experienced ball guard point guard for Syracuse would just absolutely change this game and Eddie lamp would just go to work Starling off the Miss by uan orang like to run and the bouncer for Carlos Davis is denied Justin Thomas with a Florida State rejection leads to a three for Deng and the first three of the game for Florida State what a swing you had numbers you had a layup you end up getting blocked it goes down you get a three on the other end and fsus starting to find this gate off the hands of lamin theres a foul its against Deng who just hit that three it started with great numbers Carlos just didnt want to go up and get blocked so he gave it to somebody else to get blocked you just turned this into a threepoint opportunity again where youre starting to find Rhythm after getting a couple makes its amazing what happens right makes are infectious and at times misses can be contagious is that different from infectious its totally different Kevin now of bounds off Florida State good things are infectious right bad things are contagious you go makes sense in my thats also on crisen Bingo makes sense in my head not right be wrong theres a lot Syracuse is Led for almost all this first half last Florida State lead was 43 Davis spikes it into dayquon Davis the NS can take that first lead since score three they wont too hot for Thomas to handle just Poise right youve got to maintain Poise particularly when youre putting it together because you want to continue to find it right at times you got to establish it once you start to find it you need to maintain some poise so that you can continue to build upon it you dont want to just suck the air out of the game when youre starting to finally find it under five to play in this first half 14 in the 11 winner gets SMU tomorrow Taylor thatll be a hell ball Arrow stays with the r to shoot much better defense but a lot of its because Eddie Lins just a ball mover out top hes got to get involved D it in early screening action then go right to the block and feed it there you create the advantage with a mismatch thats going to bring a double and then trust Eddie lampin to play out of it and pass out of Applause it darling wild shot its blocked by daquin Davis and itll be a shot clock violation the third block for Florida State one of the nations Best Shot blocking teams you get the sense or the feel that the sense of urgency has picked up for Florida State defensively theyve really started to pick things up 32 timeout here taken by Adrien ay Music Music Music Eddie lampin the man of the middle is four for five the rest of his teammates are combined five for 20 and Syracuse has seen a npoint lead whittel down to one its not about the four for five though I think thats just what we seal the surface you say wow had a good impact on this game thats not what it is its the things you dont see that are most valuable its the fact that two have to come his way which make the game easier for everybody else its a long skip pass that leads to a long close out that you attack and play drive and kick basketball with an advantage and it all starts with Eddie lampin in this switching to Florida State Defense time out was taken by Adrien ay Florida state with the ball game theyve trailed just about from the jump camir Watkins second Team all ACC is one for one in the game and he misses his second shot knocked off the glass to Starling Watkins 18 and 1 Half Point per game score has been held in Applause check Syracuse is 9 for 25 from the field and Miss six straight threes Davis good look for Taylor another Miss three and lampin is fouled on the offensive glass its another issue with a switching defenses rebounding position Eddie lkin as that shot goes up hes got such a physical advantage that its hard to keep him off the glass second foul on Jerry Deng a onepoint Syracuse lead here in Charlotte Music Music lets come on Music Music yeah I like it I like it e e Music Music the 72nd annual ACC tournament 14th time in beautiful Charlotte North Carolina coming up at the halftime our national championship Studio crew Ill say Carlos Boozer Luke kok goldberry and Taylor tanon Bal leading the way I would love some popcorn at halftime Im just saying Boos got the big dog too hi Taylor how are you good to see you that was like a refill like you can get refills if you buy that one well theyre here for all three games you know the coolest all of them winners all national all winers man heres the bracket winner this game gets the ponies first year ACC ENT and SMU Stanford and Cal will meet as well really impressed by Golden Bears today Andre sto yakovich 29 Kyle cup Syracuse got to find something on offense and thats not going to be it 10 to2 Florida state run seols hoping this is not the final game for Leonard Hamilton who is stepping down after the year 23year head coach 54e college coach head man in Oklahoma State Miami an extraordinary extraordinary career and life Watkins on the line you and no and a foul its funny you say 54 years I think if you asked anyone how old is that man theyd probably say 60 like he looks terrific he hes got great energy but the thing is every time we talk to him its so much less about basketball we always put up all this stuff right what hes done in the game he would much rather you know about what hes done for the people that hes had to coach with in this game cuz thats what he cares most about he celebrates his graduation R he celebrates the guys that came back to be a part of his last game at Florida State CU its not just about basketball to them its about the people teammates from Gastonia high school that far back teammates from his college Years at University of Tennessee Martin about five dozen of his former players from Florida State Sam Buie great player of Kentucky who leard Hamilton recuited they were all out of hand to watch Florida State end the regular season with a win Saturday can they keep it going find a magical run in Charlotte Starling floats it up and Syracuse is back on top just to cap off the point about letter Hilton if anybodys worth a Google its him oh my gosh just do it Yan couldnt get around lampin big man has played Without fouling Carlos all the way sets up starling Starling rebound Eddie lampin patiently waiting and punching it home and hes the first man in the double figures just cant say enough about the ever effort hes putting in on both ends he gets the stop on one end with just great positioning he walls up and then he runs his butt down the floor gets himself in position to rebound on the offensive end hes really punishing Florida state Florida state with a 302 timeout four straight points for the orange Music you Music Music Eddie Lampkin likes to play basketball he has fun he flexes on you hell show you the two small there is a little Flex on him for Eddie whos got four offensive rebounds he was the ACC leader three and a half a game in the regular season and he has been the man in this first half and he comes up oh he almost come up with a steal he couldnt hang on to it it and it leads to a dunk Thomas finds Watkins that hurts a bit I mean everybodys take it off because they thought lampkins going to get the ball leads to an easy DK for Watkins amazing how just fragile this game is z Davis feeding lampin to the post one dribble double team lamkins still has it Lamkin somehow gets it to go yeah Flex you can Flex all you want after that he was quad teamed still got the ball up Eddie taking on the entire State of Florida a dozen for him the lead is four B Bowen three is deep 95 seconds and a half Starling no lamkins hanging in there its going to stay with Syracuse Eddie will make the call dont worry about it who needs a men in Stripes Eddies chatting up in the front row hes flexing on the seminal hes having the time of his life hes also going to need halftime cuz hes working yes he is Chris Bell that is just smothered by you and Watkins I just I just dont understand why you go anywhere else right now Eddie Lins been able to dominate this game and you have to understand and what that does to an opponent its demoralizing if you have somebody that just physically beasts you down low and is flexing two out of three times every time up and down the floor you got to keep going to it 136 game of his college career TCU Colorado this would be his final game PA Watkins trying to draw a shooting foul itll be a foul on the floor against Bell this first and thats does put Florida State into the one and one I sort of get why they they make that not a shooting foul but I dont really get it if you sweep through and go up into the shot its a shot used to practice that one one States I believe the Syracuse pep band is reciting the Pledge of Allegiance right now all right try the Declaration next Watkins eight in the country in free throw attempts fourth in Florida State history in a season in free throws and free throw attempts I think theyre going to have to pull out their iPhones if theyre going to go with a Applause declaration they teach that at new house so they teach the Declaration of Independence probably I miss class that day Watkins goes one for Applause two some real real intimidating uh shall we say nerdiness from the pet bands that they won today the cow pet band always has something yeah shall we say intelligently cutesy up their sleeve F cutesy you played against cow oh boy scarling just lost it the cow band The the bear that mosies around with his hands behind his back and then the the Stanford whatever it is the tree good how about the orange would you have like stared at Auto the orange when youre playing its a strange mascot Im not a fan of mascots Kev Watkins trying to draw contact again Jackson out of bounce off for Carlos 17 to shoot for Florida State in the closing seconds of the first half thats been controlled by Syracuse but Florida States been in arms late the whole time though theyve only LED for 32 seconds well I think Syracuse has missed a ton of opportunities to take more control of this game and be up 10 something theyve got to be talking about at halftime Thomas winding into a midrange jumper Yan got a hand to it grabbed by Bell the ARs can hold for the final shot they have both used a timeout these teams Adrian arrey motioning Eddie lanin around out they get a switch Starling into traffic hes fouled yes in a situation like that just space the floor theyre just going to switch and flatten you out you didnt get leave enough time for a roll so just space an attack its the right move by Starling JJ Starling 72 foul shooter honorable mention all ACC seventh in the league in scoring a strangest free throw right there for a good shooter the shoulder injury he suffered a couple years ago not physically but mentally hell go to the free throw line and sometimes this will happen hes got good Rhythm on his jump shot inbound to Jackson half court heave oh boy oh boy oh wedgie that feels like an appropriate ending sure coaching career fifth most wins all time for ACC coaches trying to pick up number 439 of his career but his Florida State team will need to come back to do it second half begins with Jay Jay Starling off the window and a fine allaround game for Starling whos into double figures just like the little exchange handoff where Starling turns the quarter goes hard against a soft switch youve got to switch up least slow him down four starters and Boston Holt out there for Chandler Jackson for FSU work it into youan driving on lampin couldnt finish its going to be a tough matchup for you and I think partially because of how much he has to work on the defensive end yes on Eddie lamin but also in switches where he gets picked up and he has to pick up a guard you just two for six jaer Davis with a drive and finish the length goes the way of Florida State but the physicality so far in this contest goes the way of Syracuse more urgency from the orange than from Florida State Watkins throws it right to Davis seventh seal turnover Starling theres a good look for three and Taylor ribs it Applause out first four of the half have belog to Syracuse B Bowen double clutch the shot got it back and he got fouled and thats the first foul on Eddie lampin you got the whole side of the floor for bbo and to attack but good defense forced a tough shot but although you contest you you have to stay in the possession bbo was able to get his own Miss no one took the shooter out statistically they are not not a great offensive team Florida state theyre the third worst threepoint shooting team in conference games in the ACC only wake farest makes fewer threes a game their big strength as they get to the free throw line a ton but theyve only shot eight free throws in this game five for eight jquan Carlos at an early three hes got four rebounds Starling has four rebounds the Syracuse guards have been great on the glass and theyre plus four as a Music team again against the second tallest team in division one in Florida State and thats all you can do down there if you get that mismatch Lin holds his seal and as the ball came towards the top of the key he just kept the defender on his high side he had the high low they all they had to do was foul all they could do was foul auson Holts first Davis backs down Thomas out of the double team Starling Taylor 0 for five from three another one missed Davis high points the rebound scores and gets fouled the physicality as you said John continues to belong to Syracuse physicality but but also putting the defense in a bit of a scramble situation where youre closing out to one you make the extra pass you get a good look theres two theres two guys going at the shooter which means youre going to have numbers on the offensive glass so physicality is one thing numbers are another also two guys trying to stop Eddie lamin from getting the rebound left Davis with an opening and an early timeout taken by Florida State Music Music Music go start right now Applause Music Music you Music and starts right Music Applause Music Applause Music now time to look at our Star Stories for

best two players this year have been their best two players tonight 14 seed orange leads by eight out of the Florida State timeout just to remind us Syracuse programs that dealt with injuries and kind of inconsistency all year Starling goes out eventually its Donnie Freeman they lose him for the season just just tough to find continuity when you dont have a full compliment of players there is Donnie Freeman very talented freshman whos just starting to really figure it out averaging 13 and8 lower leg inry theyre very hopeful hell be back next year but hes done for this season lead is six after the Chandler Jackson basket I like what coach alri said about Donnie Freeman that hes hes willing to be coached Starling pushes it up and in its one of those very few guys that could go east to west and still pull up on Ballance a lot of guys have to get those shoulders and hips turned to find balance he goes east to west and Rises up while the defender is off balance this is just this is hard to cover right you you know slight push off maybe but ultimately taller Defenders you have to Gap anyway you you utilize your length but in that situation starlings able to elevate maybe you should shoot a jump shot on his free throw do that look good Watkins slicing Watkins leads in gets the bucket just see why hes able to get to the free Pro Line all you can really do when he gets his body on you is Applause foul when are we going to start to see a little passion a little intensity from Florida State thats the question Syracuse has had a lot more life in this game and look we know its the last game possibly for Leonard Hamilton in Syracuse is still playing for its season theyre going to play with passion but this is the guy who can lead Florida State back yeah but its not going to be on the offensive end I think there are players that can make plays offensively but youve got to create energy with what you do defensively that aint it Starling Newan just fell Applause asleep is not the same level of Engagement from Malik Yan that we saw on Saturday Watkins trying to one man muscle his way back into the game theres a foul somewhere in there and Lucas Taylor so is not to argue hes going to run all the way to the studio desk as if thats okay so not an argument but a temper tantrums right and this is just an utter breakdown this is where communications everything I remember Jay Wright always saiding Comm just communicate even if what you say is wrong we can correct your messaging or your message but its really hard to just get guys to talk so just communicate even if youre Applause wrong also when you communicate as a as a defense I can tell you this as a former player like its disruptive when you hear the defense talking it makes you think about what theyre doing so the more you talk the more disruptive you are to the offense whos trying to operate by the way there have not been many teams over the past 23 years more disruptive than Florida State thats what Hamilton built the foundations program on this teams been up and down in that category theyre down by six off the Watkins free throws Carlos driving and the ball is stuffed for a goal 10 off the rim by bbo and that will be reviewed and its going to be reviewed after this 16minute media timeout well its been Syracuse in front for just about the whole way the lead is eight well see see if it stays that way ah what do you think Kev I thought it was go tending live but the more I watch it in slowmo Ill change my my mind o look good Music luck you know their school okay right here is your question lets check out the screen okay who was Syracuses leading points score during Music the going with C is he correct boom JJ with 17 points against the job thanks for playing the te rice Tri Music I Music Applause Music la Music the call on the floor of goal tending is confirmed as white number 10 touches the ball a second time while the balls in the cylinder Applause so its still 4234 the call has been confirmed though its really less goal tending more basket interference so a legal block here but then buoen touches the ball while its on the tongue while its on the rim so that becomes basket interference I mean were also getting like an anatomy lesson on the rim too I didnt know it had a tongue you didnt know the rim had a tongue I was just more concerned with it going through the net Kevin the Rims te right now actually oh God eight points is still the lead for Syracuse Carlos with five Syracuse getting every point in this game from its starters and jir Watkins continues to draw fouls way away from the basket that is the third on cup Taylor also has three and the fourth team foul on Syracuse its a smart play if youre a Syracuse fan its super annoying here Florida State fan its brilliant Watkins has now individually drawn six fouls and he steps back misses a jumper short Carlos ahead to Music Starling and almost nothing for either team in transition in this game in fact literally nothing there have been zero fast break points first meeting between the teams was 13 nothing Florida State in Fast Break points so credit Syracuse Starling driving it on Yuan and weve got another goal Applause tent going to swizzle stick this one for the next break I havent seen it but they could not much of an argument from the gard and gold side probably close oh I dont know about oh Watkins just got another foul blocking foul against cuff four with 1509 to go I dont I dont know I think thats good Applause defense thats good defense I mean theres nothing more you can do I dont even mind a no call in that one right I think no call is the best call half time why dont stop the music type of thing thats good defense theres a lot of bad defense being played theres a lot of handsy you know stuff happening and and thats good stuff Yan Watkins was going to back cut Yan took it himself missed in traic youan is two for seven lampin I think that was a pass Starling floats it no Lampkin no its Davis this time with the Syracuse stick back and this is the largest lead for the orange and now weve got another foul and finally its an offensive foul against Florida State its Carlos drawing the charge on Davis lying in wait to bait the Florida State freshman I think Davis for Syracuse has really B A force down there but but primarily because of the attention Eddie Lampkin gets down low shot goes up there are multiple bodies either on lampin or paying attention to him and Davis has just worked his way into the mix in terms of offensive rebounding and whos winning the energy battle right now its not even close there you go huses plus seven on the glass Starling switched on to Yuan whos had a very tough night defensively Starling Fades away over thats a tough shot and that is Syracuse ball there just all over the Applause glass I mean this is Ds just working his way in there what a force and then you set up Carlos really baited him into this one little dislodge Davis driving theres Lampkin again hes everywhere and hes going to the line 11th offensive rebound of the game for Syracuse I mean look at some point it becomes a battle of will right if youre Florida State youre getting pushed around theres really no transition opportunities so you got to have to be physical in the half court I dont like cliches like they want it more than they do like just just be tough be strong understand the situation Eddie lampin 64 much improved free throw shooter over the course of the Music Year were all to talk about how Florida state is playing for Leonard Hamilton for his career Syracuse is playing for its season maybe its not the end of a career but its the end of players careers its the last college game Freddy lamin Jr with a loss for Jake Clan Carlos for Jer Davis for Lucas Taylor and look at how meaningful this is to big ady and the Syracuse fans behind the bench are just loving this well any lampin goes out and thecloud comes in I mean go into Zone here kind of like this they like to do that with McLoud at the back also just disrupts the game when you do that thats what ultimately with great defenses do disrupt Rhythm of the game Florida state has not touched the paint yet now Watkins will and a good find and a Better Block Davis was the Invisible Man there and he took it away from ding at the last moment Just Energy C I mean theyre just playing with great energy one team has a certain sense of urgency the other teams lacking it Carlos from Davis up top for Applause Music McLoud in central New York right now theyre asking where the the heck has this been but better late than never maluk Watkins hoists it Starling knocks it to daquin Davis Swinton into McLoud and a foul my oh my this is just good stuff Davis its playing a great game ad is going to get a lot of the love starlings going to get a lot of the love but the energy when you feel it from the bench it has a far greater impact and then you get on the offensive end great find from Carlos to McLoud again body language on the bench means more than you Music know 16 points the largest lead for Syracuse three starters in a double figure Starling lamin Davis and Florida State has nobody in double figures but theres a reason why we said in the open that weve both have said that weve grown to really appreciate and like this Syracuse team theyve been much better as of late to me it was the Carolina game where they didnt defend very well but they scored and got up and down they competed they cared well the the stretch run for Syracuse could have looked a lot different they LED hit at the half or at in the second half by 11 they LED Virginia Tech by 13 SMU by 12 they lost all those games so if youre a Florida State fan thats thats the only solid you have Syracuse blown a double digit lead and its last three games away from home but they played really well for long stretches and then a complete beat down of Virginia on Saturday Starling elbow and Davis almost had another Watkins emerges down to daquin Davis into Bell he draws the foul second against Chris Bell and Florida States in the bonus the rest of the way its challeng you though in the game today where you know you get a team you try to figure out who they are how to use the pieces how to get the most out of them and eventually you got to learn how to win learning how to win at this level with a new group nearly every single year is more of a challenge that we really appreciate Music Applause they talking to Syracuse folks about this like if they if this was the the old days Im going put that in real air quotes y they could get jquan Carlos here as a transfer in the system for a year if he could sit out as a red shirt Lucas Taylor they think these guys have figured out the team the style late in the year as a lot of transfers do and they just wish they had another year with these guys thats not the reality in college basketball right now but the reality is sometimes you get to March and a team you thought you knew figures it out Davis Luke has it for Florida State needing energy needing urgency sting around McLoud good finish think about Clemson in this conference the experience that they have they have two guys that have played 2 95 games combined together at one school its like a superp power off timeout Syracuse are up by 13 well theyre up by 13 because theyre really lifting this building not just lifting this game their energy has been terrific the bench is loving it I think it all starts with Eddie Music Music lkin on your feet put your hand in the air who wants a tshirt for the Applause T theacher Music e e e Music the goal tending call by white 12 at 15 all ACC team was announced yesterday Cooper flag unanimous first teamer Player of the Year Rookie of the Year Chase Hunter representing an amazing Clemson team which won 182 same record as Louisville with Chucky heer Hunter Salis named the first teamer for Wake Forest this EAS at a maxim rol Stanfords first year in the league we are really excited to see Stanford tomorrow they get Cal for the third time this year Stanford Cal and charlot as we all dream its going to be a fun one uh Stanford and Cal first year members of the ACC SMU is as well the Mustang and the winner of game ask madg about some of the classic Stanford cow battles in the day holy smokes theres some real like intermingling between those two Mark Madson and calwin in double overtime and Syracuse has owned this game down low there paint point total nearly matching Florida States total total orange by 13 Bell no good on a three its the one area theyve struggled they missed their last 10 theyre total total huh total total heres Watkins rebound knocked out of the hands of Malo Syracuse is plus nine on the glass Bell is open another Miss three fla state with Watkins Davis Swinton Deng and Malo Davis with the floater see if the four reserves can spark something for Le Hamilton not like a b basket set up a little pressure just just show that youre going to defend its been part of the problem Syracuse has been able to move it where they want create a Chase get an offensive rebounding position it just dominated the game in every way Davis lost it on the way up D paon Davis to steal here come the nlls Watkins finishes and the lead is down to nine such good body control for a big guard thats its ultimately what it takes to get fouled the way he does you got to have body control he commits his second foul here but its a 7 nothing 70 run talk about transition opportunities have been hadnt been many good to get out and run good body control finish from Watkins those are the first fast break points of the game for either team movich and lampin will take over for Davis and McLoud L State brings in Thomas for Applause swin halfway through the second half winner gets SMU and tomorrows second round lampin turns it over Carlos turns it back Carlos sprinting ahead and Thomas got in there its off of Thomas is the call by Jerry heer Syracuse ball you had Eddie lampin being covered by Watkins and and he doesnt get the ball cuz they dont probe enough to get it to him and he gets it at the elbow where it can be stolen so easily Lampton patient try to find my storic and then threw it away these are the issues these are the issues that have led to the 13 conference losses turnovers as D misses a three Thomas puts it an easy one and 16 cut to seven in a blink playing with a little more urgency Kev its it its not complicated you dont have to out execute anybody you just have to start by applied effort and urgency how Florida States getting back in this game Leonard Hamilton has found something with this reserve unit thats going to be the third foul against Watkins and thatll put Syracuse at the line for a one and one this is just kind of a a blown coverage responsibility rebounding I mean no one really sees him no one calls it out communication is everything just talk if you get overloaded to one side communicate rare free throw for marovich he misses the front end Watkins was going to get away with that foul but he actually brought the attention on himself by throwing his hands up in the air so hes going to stay in there with three cant take him out at this point no middle of the Zone Malo theres Watkins and he got fouled and now the life has swiveled over to the bench on the left side of the floor Watkins to the line lamkins Second foul its a 9 nothing run that Florida State can extend Florida States defended with better energy they got a transition bucket and theyre moving the basketball you can create rhythm with ball movement doesnt mean youre going to make every shot but the game feels easier as a player if youre able to move the basketball happy birthday thats the Syracuse pepan I dont think its his birthday were not going to have to pay for that are we if we do itll come out of your game check dont worry its like we we mute out bad words and music that we dont want to buy Watkins by the way we talk about lonard Hamilton and what hes done off the court so many of his players graduate jir Watkins going to be the first person in his family to get a college degree hes going to graduate in May really special what Leonard Hamiltons done in the lives of these players he takes a lot of pride in that one fouryear player hasnt graduated in 23 years for him at Florida State just one thats incredible but ultimately what youre doing is youre developing problem solving skills in these guys and that makes them better in life Starling no Syracuse cannot hit a three they started two for two they missed 12 in a row that Balls booted into the seven throw itll be Flor State possession can I say that kind of jokingly like youre developing problems look when youre a student athlete Ill still call him that when youre a student athlete go into class while youre trying to be a basketball player and keep your body the way your body needs to be and then pass classes and do well enough like its a problem you need to learn how to solve and if you do it youre youre better because of it this is a league where that does really matter by the way see Stanford and Cal tomorrow among other great institutions in the ACC sixpoint game Syracuse has not scored in over five minutes trying not to let another second half lead Wilt Starling on the switch Starling on the crossover and a foul before the SWAT by maluk were at the 8minute timeout this was a 16point lead not too long ago but here come the Music NOS e e e Music he Music Applause well Kevin we were asking for a little bit of life from this Florida State team and just started to find it little bit on the defensive end got the ball out transition and moving the basketball a lot better playing with better energy on the defensive end attacking the offensive glass just starting to take some control of this game 10 run starting to feel like it its favoring Florida State particularly at a time when Syracuse cant make it outside Music shot Adrien atres team has blown a double digit second half lead in three straight Road games obviously this is a neutral side game Syracuse 2 and 12 away from the Dome this year and there is Malik Yan back on the Block for Florida State Le Hamiltons held him out for the last six plus minutes Florida State goes on the run with the reserves you surprised by that I am a little surprised so am I um thats something weve said during the break is is theyve been better when when hes been out that being said lard Hamilton has coaching for 54 years so Im not going to doubt his instincts well I also think you also get to a point where you say all right hes going to sit here until he shows he can go do it yeah and he can hes incredibly capable very skilled offensive player but hes just got to provide energy thats it maybe this is a pro a couple of possessions for him he comes up to set the screen Davis rolls through him heres Watkins first double double of the year for Watkins hell look to add to it too long didnt get the rim rebound Carlos good Box by Carlos hes got six rebounds yeah he hes been good hes been present a lot of that hes got offensive rebound being on the same side of Eddie lamin hes played 31 minutes the smallest guy on the floor one turnover in that stretch too seven to play first round in the ACC tournament in Charlotte Sterling wrapper out and that snaps a six minute scoring drout hes incredibly slithery with the basketball he he can change directions on the fly a lot of guys have to almost stop change directions he just does it with fluidity Yan Mis communicated on the handoff and Starling finishes again youan and Thomas just not in sync there Starling the steal and the score and hes got 20 Music Leonard Hamilton thats as animated as weve seen him all day screaming at his players to get in position Deng has a look Den has a Applause three just a second three tonight for FSU SMU to seed awaiting the winner of this game 930 tomorrow night ESPNU will it be a rematch Florida state from Saturday or a rematch with Syracuse from the game before that just really fluid off the bouts and the little hesitation gets gets the defense to freeze for a split second out in transition little breakdown on the offensive end Syracuse just theyre hanging in there with this lead but you just feel like the energy shifted Starling smart play draws Ds third foul gets two more at the line Saturday the top lacrosse teams in the nation highlight our ACC Network afternoon number one Boston College hose Louisville and number one Maryland visits Virginia great womens and Mens Lacrosse double headers on acc Network and streaming on the ESPN app cross is a good watch up there was softball softball terrific watch yes preaching of the choir right now time out Florida state that leaves the nll with one so kind of an oddity here for SMU the last two teams they played last week Tuesday they play Syracuse Saturday Florida state theyre going to get one of them tomorrow the other games tomorrow Georgia teken Virginia North Carolina and Notre Dame Stanford and Cal and then Duke movable Clemson and wake your top four in the quarterfinals Thursday I think a lot of people have their eyes on North Carolina understandably so theyre playing their best basketball as of late I think it took them a while to figure out how to be a a smaller lineup and play that way I think RJ Davis has been really good down the stretch I think there people secretly rooting for Carolina to figure it out almost helps that Duke is so dominant that you can root for Carolina again well its a uh a three bid league right now as you see the last time 14 of 15 seeds both one year you got to go back to 2009 19 the last time the tournament by the way was in Charlotte Joe says its a three bid league and thats Joe lardy hes on a first name basis with us uncs a couple of teams out they only have one quadrant one win the next two games would be quad 2 Notre Dame and Wake Forest and if they win those question is going to be can you make it as an at large team with a 1 and 12 qua one Mark can you make it if youre nine and0 in Quad two and its a soft bubble theyre going to have to face Duke if they want to get through this unless theres a seismic seismic upset but the first step is Notre Dame yes and remember earlier in the year they needed an Elliot kadoo fourpoint play in the closing seconds to beat Notre Dame so that is not a cakewalk tomorrow thats the second game of the day at 230 so think people dont understand you you play so many tough games early you never really have a chance to figure out who you are youre almost fighting for survival early in the season with all those quad One games dang got space at the end good stuff better space on the offensive end thats why the paints wide open good action creates open areas to attack Jerry d double figures just six of his first 25 games hes reached that four of the last five I think hes learned how to be a spacer theres nothing wrong with that when youre a good spacer everybody knows you can shoot youre going to get long Closeouts figure out how to attack those youan jumped on the pass that was good early activity but then hes called for a foul his second theyre going to run dang off the threepoint line because of his ability to shoot so theyre going to get up high yes thats what you do you Trail over the top no one really there on that ball screen good finish and how about Jerry Deng wearing number seven he wears number seven because his favorite player was Carmelo Anthony see that boy Syracuse is 7 for 15 at the line Jerry thought it was one in one so maybe a little extra motivation playing the orange one National Championship was led of course by their great number seven Carmelo might have been at his best in when they played the international ball olypic say he he was Unreal he played at his own pace too it was wild his son will be coming to Syracuse next year Ken Anthony fourstar recruit d on Davis short I say he was at his best when he played tbsa like he wasnt great in the NBA but I understand what you mean you level up in a sense well its not easy for everybody not not easy for everybody to adjust to the international game he was really good at it under four and a half to play Syracuse is Led basically the whole game all second half Starling turns it over watad boy a risky pass Thomas got it Davis is Applause fou and thats number three on Eddie lampin EDD this is what Florida state does well they dont typically come back by launching threes again they only hit six a game in League Play Thats 17th out of 18 they come back by drawing fouls by getting you in trouble by getting to the line but I think youve got to do that so it has a cumulative effect so you have to do it consistently and when you do it consistently you speed up your opponent you make them uncomfortable you make them think they they dont attack because theyre too worried about whos coming next and the inconsistency of effort could be their demise terms of Flor St Davis their best free throw shooter 83 hes got seven points to night heres some pressure from Florida State Starling hounded by The Freshman Davis four minutes to play SMU awaiting the winner this is day one of five and its been a day with three games that have gone right down to the wire hopefully a harbinger of a great week to come in Charlotte Carlos speeding in thats a tough layup fact that no one saw Eddie Lin had the advantages part of the problem Jerry Deng shot fake short rebound to lampin hes triple teamed here and he gets it to Sterling Syracuse had a threeonone for a moment and Sterling treding to lefthanded dunk oh Lord whoa thats a back court Carlos just couldnt get around you the Syracuse mistakes are piling up here Florida state has cut a 16point lead to five with 322 to go the T price ACC mens basketball tournament is brought to you by T price invest with confidence Music how long do I have before the okay 18 seconds before he talked okay remind me what the first thing is he says says lets just go no lets just well go okay okay we say goodbye at the end of a brilliant coaching career for Leonard Hamilton 54 years as a college coach a head coach at Oklahoma State at Miami and Florida State change the lives of dozens and dozens and he leaves a legacy of a lifetime I dont coach because I need or desire credit to me is more important the opportunity to help Young e Music oh Music Music lets take a look at tonights Dynamic play of the game its brought to you by T price oh daav is coming out of nowhere with the block and then you take that energy take it to the other side of the floor good execution draw multiple Defenders throw it up to McLoud let him throw it down Syracuse 38 points in the paint they had a 5034 lead its a 176 Florida state run since Eddie lamin with 149 JJ Starling Leading The Way with 21 points but the seminal have gotten a lot off their BAS dang and Davis have given them a spark Watkins with a double double Florida state which has not LED since 4 to3 is within two possessions with 320 to go winner gets SMU loser gets to wait till next year Watkins driving it on Taylor elevates no Jer Davis the Syracuse cila great defense by Taylor just keeping his hands up and wide wall up contest its a tough shot to make once again Davis there to rebound hes been really good Starling hes been really good too hes got 23 I just fluidity right hes just so smooth smooth is harder to cover than Music quick Thomas a lefthanded finish for Justin Thomas whos got six when Florida States had space now theyve had space with good movement you start moving you get the defense that kind of Chase the east to west you open up some driving Lanes they attack theyve been good when that happens just hasnt been consistent enough throughout Carlos looking to get lampin Yan comes over and hes called for a devastating foul put lamin at the line for two was much its just a second late and I get trying to get this steal he coming from behind there yeah a little on the arm L line for the lean has not scored since the 1549 Mark of the first half lampin Syracuse is 8 for 17 at the line I mean Malik Yan if he just plays with a motor hed be incredible he has great skill he can put the ball on the floor offensively face up play back to the basket but you just got to apply the motor another Miss free throw for Syracuse boy oh boy 8 for 18 at the line two for 14 from three they are hanging on by the skin of their teeth and Taylor just picked up his fourth foul all right after this game dont go anywhere cuz theres going to be a lot to wrap up for the first two games today from this one theres are nothing but Ned crew Joel Carlos Luke and Taylor so keep it here on acc Network a full recap of two insane endings already with Notre Dame pit and Cal Virginia Tech and some foul controversy at the end of both and lets hope theres no foul controversy at the end of this cuz good clean basketball Watkins makes it a fourpoint game think the free throw line could determine the rest of this game Syracuse struggling to make him and again when when you miss him like that it gets harder and harder your confidence is waiting Florida State could get to the free throw line and take control Watkins missed it and it was up in the air for a moment Davis has it under two to play FL States really trying to take the ball out of JJ starlings hands understandably so Carlos is on the floor but Starling with the ball in his hands hes been Applause dangerous switched on to Deng from Thomas Starling likes that match Applause up 23 for the honorable mention all accer at lead back to six Watkins slithering in found Davis driving on Starling hes fouled loock stops at a minute 23 hes just so hard to cover this is like an NBA play right here you just kind of run a ball screen here you get the match up you like just get the heck out of his way and let him go to work and you see Yan is more concerned about the rebound so hes not going to come up and take that shot away cuz you got Eddie Lin Jr just following that thing up so so no one there to stop that its a good decision by St hes got nine of the last 10 for Syracuse 17 of his 25 in the second half i keep going to the well if youre going to get a switch and a matchup that you like and then just trust his ability to make the right decision its not about making a shot make the right decision one more for Daquon Davis fourpoint game could be the last game of Leonard Hamiltons extraordinary career his team has not LED since 4 to three a get Thomas May be their best defender on Starling at least to start The Possession and Thomas is very physical with Applause him the screen they get darling on Deng again this was a match up he won last time he blows by him again punish the switch Kev punish the switch its what high level players do were into the final minute Florida State down six theyve only hit two threes in the game Watkins draws a foul and hes fouled Taylor out while shooting a three he is incredible about drawing those fouls and look kids watch pump fake ball fake you do all these different things you sell it with your eyeballs and your shoulders hes going to go up like hes going to shoot gets the defender into his arms and then youre Applause beat this is amazing because it really feels like Syracuse has had more control than this yet this thing has gotten tight and highly contested if not for JJ Starling Florida State might be up five they have figured out how to get the matchup that they like theyve cleared out and let JJ Starling go to work and that has really continued to give him this Applause lead so Lucas Taylor fouls out of the game Chris Bell returns wanted L get 12 at the half hes got 14 in the game and and that came on free throws Starling had eight at the half hes to the 27 which is a game high by far so three for Watkins 75 free throw Applause shooter second Team all ACC pick hes got his first double double of the Year senior from Trent New Jersey whos going to graduate in May has the first two next one makes it a onep possession game thats what leard Hamilton would say is a success story for him first member of his family to earn a degree deir Watkins he will accomplish that in two Applause months a deep breath for what he hopes is not his final free throw and he goes three for three substitution for Florida State went he will replace Jerry Ding and Syracuse took advantage of ding the last two trips now they Applause cant two timeouts for the orange one for the seminal Starling three of eight from the free throw line too so if he does get an advantage you cant let him get to the rim nows not really a bad option were going to play it out for Now Syracuse hoping that theyre going to make this the final half minute of Leonard Hamilton career Florida State hoping for a stop and a score JJ didnt want the screen he didnt want it he calls lampin off Starling gets switched on to Yan and he missed it deep lampin fighting for the ball its going to be reviewed you know it is in the final two minutes the call is Syracuse ball as lampkins rolled over on the deck with 188 seconds remaining well I think they got it right I think it was off Davis for Florida State mainly because of the effort of of Eddie lamin and I actually like Carloss presence of mind his presence of mind to say hey JJ you going to like this match up better he actually brought himself over and again I thought this was off Davis at first Im still going to say its off Davis he punched it out of lamins hand cly fingertips that came off because thats what it comes down to I I think its off Davis I think they got it right and and look I totally get it if Im a Florida State fan Im absolutely convincing myself that thats off of Eddie lamin Jr if from a Syracuse fan its a nobrainer yeah I I watch to follow through there the other thing Davis fingers last its not enough to overturn I mean there is no possible way I shouldnt say that there is no possible way literally theres no way that they could overturn this given what was called on the floor thats why like in the game today with no challenges I why challenge it right but the the call on the floor really matters and I I feel like with the slow motion replays whatever you CAU on the floor you could probably convince yourself youre right if this is Syracuse ball the shock block is going to be off and Florida State will have to foul unless they get a well the good thing for Florida state is Syracuse is 8 of 18 from the free throw line tonight and you know struggled from three two of 14 from three I hate to just read off statistics but times those tell tell the story if not for the 27 from JJ starle and their ability after review the call on the floor stands the game clock has been adjusted to 194 seconds you got that right good little timeout for each team too talk about all the situations what youre going to do maybe a quick trap you also you got to be careful with your switching here that you dont give up something an easy cut to the basket and a layup times you get overly aggressive in these situations defending under the basket and you lose sight of somebody who just slips to the basket particularly switching teams switching defenses Carlos is the inbounder Davis lampin Starling and Bell the Box on the floor Syracuse has two two timeouts and well use Applause one were going to talk about anybody but in this second half its going to be JJ Starling now as much as its JJ Starling I also think its the recognition of his teammates to get him the matchup that he wants to attack and let him go get out of his way good clear out from Davis let him make a play and he figured out he likes going after day and he just abused that match up up to the point where they had to take him out JJ starlings been terrific 27 points on the night 12 23 from the field he should probably shoot the ball 30 times the way he scored it you know Syracuse only has six assists on 26 made field goals yeah pass overated but thats usually you go thats a pretty low number a lot of oneonone not sustainable when you get the matchups they get with JJ I think part of it too is is youre playing against a switching defense so you got to be able to attack the match up right youve got to be able to beat your man if you have the right matchup Carlos try to get it into Davis hes double team oh he threw it away daquin Davis for Florida State he lost it here comes snon missed it Yan puts it back with 94 onepoint game in a Timeout taken Florida States final timeout wow I I I mean just the two possessions the out of bounds underneath that Syracuse had really not doing a lot to get open I mean really just cutting to the ball you put Davis in a terrible quarter hes got nothing there I mean no Cutters no help coming over and now Florida state has an opportunity here yeah One Missed opportunity and theres you to clean it up now with a timeout you get a chance to set up your defense flid of State just I mean I its hard to imagine theyre in this game honestly it hasnt felt like that they had that 10 run and it got back into it but throughout its just been done in pockets and Syracuse its been missed opportunities I think the the free throw shooting and the threepoint shooting is is kind of the most glaring thing on the stat sheet cus going to come back into the game you need ball handlers theres Leonard Hamiltons wife Claudette watching on as her husband operates what he hopes will not be the last of thousands and thousands and thousands of Puddles cant imagine I I I cant imagine like the the family what this feels like you know Leonard Hamilton play downplayed it a lot with us and I think part of it is is cuz he he truly cares about what matters most but I also think like if you listen to the things he talks about hes like you deal with whatever it is and kind of deal with it later right manage what is deal with it later I think hes in the moment there a kid about 23 m east of here in Gastonia North Carolina the corner of North Mor Street West Allison Avenue and here he is all these years and decades later 76 years young this team is down by one trying to launch an amazing comeback Syracuse going to run the uh all verts here everybodys out of bounds Davis will look for an outlet its cuff and cu is free has to be fouled a lot of time came off the clock there cuff fouled at 5 and a half as Syracuse burn about 4 seconds I tell you cuff really risked it there I mean he risked it by holding it if youre open enough theres nothing really wrong with advancing the ball and putting yourself in a position where you can make an outlet pass deep I mean worst case scenario theres three seconds left but but he kind of put himself in a tough spot by welcoming the triple team Kyle cuff Jr but a knee injury backto back years at Kansas suffered a broken hand the summary transferred to Syracuse has really come on in the second half of the year off the bench he is a good free throw shooter 77 and he calmly hits the first now Florida state does not have a timeout Syracuse if he hits it to you foul oh God what its whatever you practice its whatever youve committed to get lampin back in there you can get your rebounders in dang back in for Florida State as cuff hits it they need a three dengs going to inbound it could be the last seconds of Leonard Hamiltons career and Syracuse does foul Carlos fouls Davis with 26 to go I dont know what I would do as a coach I think a lot of people lean on the metrics I like the idea of fouling youve got to trust your rebounders you know Eddie Lins going to come back in well theyve got Cup on the bottom of the free throw line right now but Lins going to take over for him Davis obviously has to hit this first one I would even put my stovich back in there as well I mean maybe not on the bottom but you get him crashing down pinching down on you and its Yan and Watkins on the blocks for Florida State 26 to go daquin Davis at the line Florida State hoping for a miracle Davis misses it Shyer Davis grabs it and hes fouled with 710 of a second to go and it is all but over now we have had some tight ones today every game talk about the first two games some controversy on some calls really thought Virginia Tech had that one a tough call that did not go their way kind of shifted that one this one it really felt like Syracuse was in control most most of the game but Florida State found ways to fight back if not for JJ Starling this is Florida States game not much Leonard Hamilton can do now he can bring his team back in for the game clock for a game clock review with 710 of a second to go maybe a little bit more time to be added here it seemed like a couple extra ticks came Applause off lamin sealed off euan Davis came in there and I think well get a little more time on the clock probably although theres the foul the hand didnt get raised until about 810 of the second but well see well Leonard Hamilton he was selfless but reflective with us yes last night its been a reflective stretch for him to some degree he very much wanted to keep the focus on the next game has been adjusted to9 okay he said he was sick as walking into the locker room Saturday and seeing all his players wearing tshirts with his face on them his wife took home a tshirt he said you better not be wearing my face around the house you know what though I think thats how he always is selfless and reflective I mean because his mind and his perspective is always on the bigger picture and its almost as if basketballs The Vessel its the conduit its not the most important thing to him his impact is ultimately whats going to matter the most its what hes most proud of so we should honor Music that so Jer Davis for two 910 of a second to go and if he hits the next one its over if he misses Florida State needs a miraculous heave to tie it is March Kevin we have seen some very strange things at the end of games today well this is why you have Starling and Carlos up to at least deter a wide openen look Davis for the win he got it the 14 seed a team that had not won backto back okay
