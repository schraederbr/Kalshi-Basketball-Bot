and jayen Washington get us started Bill Covington Jr Tommy morresy and Eric Lewis on the whistle RJ Davis with the tap one by the Tar Heels and Carolina to work and immediately SMU drops back into a 131 Zone and theyll match up out of this Zone Miller plays at the front where they bring the long Yan trayor out to the wing on the far side eight to shoot and here goes kdo back for Washington you get toou on a kick out Kad three on the clock and a long triple rings in for Elliot kdo 12 of the Year well hes hit his last two from the floor from line two straight then one to end the game one to start it and a steel by Kau against cross layup bounces in thats any team that scores as many points as both of these teams do is likely to generate turnover and thats what North Carolina wants to do SMU has to be very careful and protect the ball yigu working against Washington the big freshman from Turkey leans in had it partially blocked recovered in the corner to Miller 10 to shoot for the Applause Mustangs Miller on the drive cant finish out of bounds 15 on the clock last touched by SMU itll go to Carolina that was an outstanding defensive effort by North Carolina and if if youre going to play a team like SMU that has a distinct size Advantage youve got to be willing to trap and do a little bit of things differently on defense and North Carolina did on that possession Washington pal Jackson Davis and kadoo on the floor for Hubert Davis and here is Drake pow in traffic B away bounces free cross the rebound for SMU he got to go and attack those big guys s yigu hell hand for cross against kadoo big in on the left tried to bounce it out on the perimeter and its recovered at distance this is BJ Edwards averaging just less than 10 for the Mustangs hell attack on the drop pivots throws it up wont go they crash the glass last touched by SMU says Bill Covington Jr West early we see one of the key matchups and that is Elliot Kad is matched up against Matt cross cross much taller much stronger but North Carolina again they did a nice job helping kdo out forcing cross to give up the ball heres RJ Davis and almost turned over Jackson runs it down and right back to Applause Davis foul line for kdo cross there back for Jackson Ian Jacksons been on quite a tear for Carolina a record setting tear in many ways hell fire for three bounces out cross the rebound SMU wants to run yigu on the back end the catch inside no question the big man tries to reset on Washington had it blocked and Jaylen recovers lead for Davis hell take it on the drive and draw the foul RJ Davis had Ian Jackson with him he goes to the rack and hell get two free throws as a result of the SMU foul it was a great catch by yigu but it took him too long to get himself centered up so he could take the ball up to the basket and thats two blocks Now by Washington weve talked about about the size Advantage for SMU but so far Washington really doing a nice job particularly on the defensive end inside RJ Davis free throw no good hes the eighth best free throw shooter in the ACC Dan a little bit of a struggle here in the last two though five and a half assists per game but just 10 points seven of 23 and only one of his last eight from behind the line hits the back end for his first point now when he had by the way a single digit game at Notre Dame on Saturday that stapped a streak of 17 straight double figure games Dan hes been double figures in 44 of his last 46 as a Tar Hill he can put the ball in the basket thats for sure three minutes gone were going to get a hand check foul out on the perimeter and its going to be against Elliot kadoo itll be his first its the first on Carolina and thats the matchup were talking about Matt cross is 6 7 kdo is 61 and cross is a guy who is a very effective inside outside player so when he sees kadoo matched up against him hes going to try to take take it to the goal Seth tremble back on the floor hes missed the last three had five straight double figure games prior to the injury that he suffered in practice and the F basket a moment ago to Edwards off the inbounds pass gets SMU on the Applause board heres Jackson going all the way through for Davis yigu trying to stay in front of Ian Jackson and doing a pretty good job now here comes the double team lob AC cross the floor Kad with three to shoot takes it on the drive going to scoop it up and the rebound for trayor Johan trayor Junior from France and a transfer from Cal State Baker field hell shoot at 17 ft and yatu somehow worked his way around Washington and tapped that home he just overpowered him West Davis a cross over and pull up and trayor another rebound those are the kind of shots that North Carolina is going to have to make West I think they want to play in transition and theyre going to get opportunities like that in transition foul will be on kadoo and thats two quick ones on Elliot kdo and that comes with just about four minutes G here first half Dan trying to guard the much bigger cross was a problem and then that time you know bopy Miller is so fast in transition kadoo foued him trying to stay in front so here are the Tar Heels now digging into the depth a little bit Vin Allen Luben onto the floor Drake Powell has return to join Trimble RJ Davis and Ian Jackson Jerel colar or Colbert by the way is on the floor he wears 20 for SMU as Miller has tied the game on his first field goal Carolina now without a field goal for about 3 minutes in change and they North Carolina seems to be a little bit tentative against this zone defense the reason you play a zone is to make a team stand around and thats what weve seen pow goes hard to the basket and off the glass thatll back in front on Drake pows first Applause basket Colbert Junior from Houston turns it over heres Davis with Jackson hell go to the glass and draw the foul I think theyre going to get cross Matt cross itll be his first second on SMU Carolina got off to a hot start Mustangs a tied tar Hills have gone back in front on the basket by the rookie Powell Music Music Applause chicken Jud weve been playing this game for a long time Music nor Carolina tells us that the last guy not freshman but the last guy for North Carolina to have 100 points over a 4 game span is Hubert Davis yeah so try that on for size challenging the coach RJ Davis at the line is only Point has come from the stripe and he misses the free throw so hes now just one of his first three at the line and Wes thats a really the stat you gave with his making only one of his last eight you know he is a tremendous free throw shooter yep and the second one good so Davis has two kadoo he going to sit on that Carolina bench for a while picking up his second foul a moment to go the 16003 mark so well see a lot of RJ Davis Seth Trimble I suspect here probably for about the next 8 to 10 minutes Miller against Trimble who might be the tar Hills best one ball defender on the drive and cobber couldnt follow it SMU now has suddenly gone a little bit smaller along their front Court yep they brought Cario aindo into the ball game wheres number eight for the Mustangs Edward stays on the floor theyve also got Chuck Harris Off the Bench hes a talented score averaging 114 for Coach Enfield three out of the corner by Powell is good Drake Powell with five you dont want to settle for those threes West but if youre going to take him you got to get the ball inside that zone Force the zone to collapse and then kick it out for the three and North Carolina perfectly executed on that possession Carolinas gone on a six nothing run to break a six all tie o quindo a triple from the left and a rebound for Jackson that was some rebound head for Davis tries to get on through a double team there into the corner heres Powell against Edwards to Vin Allen Luben it got knocked away and turned over and here is Chuck Harris one of the two R return E from that Squad a year ago that uh Rob laner had who was the coach at SMU and Harris is a threepoint guy thats what he wants to do out of the corner Edwards a three spins out tremble the rebound Hubert Davis really wants his guys to push and beat that defense down the court Mustangs pretty content to play this front Zone with the 131 and force the turnover did a good job there heres Miller with turnover number two of Carolina a quendo last Touch by the Tar Heels I think Powell slapped it off the in line before it got to Davis and with that yatu and cross want to get back in the lineup for SMU and thatll take Jerell Colbert and BJ Edwards out for Andy infield this is a very effective rotation for SMU yeah you can look at them statistically and see why they are 11 and three and two and one on the season theres cross and Jackson Another Applause rebound but when youre a little bit smaller some of your small guys have to really do the rebounding job and you need your best player to knock down shots like that like that thatll work RJ Daviss 31st three of the the year nine points the biggest lead for Carolina its a nine nothing run and the answer from Chuck Harris just what we were saying thats what he does he shoots threes yep he was scoreless on Saturday against Duke at Moody Coliseum on the board in his second shot here tonight Jackson to answer bounds away Ben Allen Luben couldnt control it heres Harrison SMU on the drive all the way down had it knocked away and a foul is called and its going to be on RJ Davis Ravis first on Davis its the third on Carolina in this first half North Carolina has taken a lot of Threes here early in the game but this is real good ball movement SMU when you play a Zone like that youve got to be very active what theyre trying to do is to push out on the North Carolina Shooters and that time they just werent very successful Harriss free throw spins out he transferred a year ago to Dallas from Butler Dan he played 84 games at Butler a year ago he averaged 13 and 1 12 points shot 41 from three and smus final campaign in the American wow this year hes shooting 47 from three now hes not exclusively a threepoint shooter but over half his shot attempts are Applause Music threes four in a row by SMU heres Davis again and working against Miller its an advantage to the Zone the more you dribble it out there tremble in the air pal te one up and hits but when youre going to dribble against the Zone thats what you do you beat the be people on the perimeter you get into the lane Force the defense to collapse as long as you keep hitting those threes youre in business heres yigu on the drive and an offensive foul called on the big fell from Turkey his first itll be the third on SMU thatll get us to a timeout in Chapel Hill Carolina who had a 9 nothing run has gotten a couple of Threes from Drake Powell to make it eight again in Chapel Music Hill on the arest Drake Pals got eight of Carolinas last 12 won keep in mind North Carolina only shoots 31 on the year from three they shoot 57 from two now manto man Washington clutched all three momentarily here is Davis a high arcing running onehander by RJ Davis hes got seven now hes really hard to guard and thats one of the reasons you play that zone defense as Davis is really tough to keep up with gone to 10 the lead for the tar Hills they biggest of the first half North Carolina with Washington and Withers in the game at the same time now a little bigger yeah cross a deep three rattles in boy Matt cross who shoots 38 from behind the line knocks down long three 203 heres a kick to the right wing Powell tees up another one sure Drake Powell had 12 threes on the year coming into the game hes got three in the first half well you see that first one go down and the basket just gets bigger and bigger oh boy a block at the iron as trayor went for the dunk Washington contested it and Eric Lewis is going to whistle a foul on Jaylen Washington itll be the first on Washington the fourth on Carolina and lets look at the uh dunk attempt by treor a moment ago that was rejected North Carolina particularly Washington doing a great job thats three blocks for him now but its really tough in there because this is SMU that is is the top offensive rebounding team in the conference heres Harris now to Miller 12 to shoot cross against Withers five to shoot now heres Miller whoa way outside for three and Jaylen Washington the rebound 10point Advantage for the Tar Heels tremble for Jaylen Withers out of the corner Mustangs tur and burn here M look at bopy Miller wow all the way to the rim couldnt finish Withers collects its really good job to get back on defense and force a tough Applause shot Dan you like the idea of the man after the zone for SMU well they wanted to change the tempo of the game a little bit West uh North Carolina was knocking down those threes they werent able to defend him but now you go to the manto man and its hard to guard things like that yeah tror with a great block got swatted out of bounds Carolina will have six to shoot dont forget ACC mens basketball this weekend of course Triple header starts at 200 its alumni weekend at tigertown for the nolles and tigers presented by food line Dan and Ill be at the Lenovo Center in Raleigh for State Carolina at 400 and then the hokes are in Berkeley at the hos Pavilion for 600 start Eastern time against the Golden Bears Powell the missed jump shot from the Applause Music Baseline and we get DJ Edwards handling the ball back for cross quindo left side Harris of three and hell get his own rebound at distance takeoff Baseline tried to give it inside U turned over heres Ian Jackson back for Powell Washington trying to help Jackson now Davis step in two U the rebound for SMU again these teams are going to get up and down West yep nobody waits around in this game do they I dont think were going to have any problem with shot clock violations on the drive Harris in traffic and I think Washington just picked up his second so thatll get VIN Allen Luben off Hubert Daviss bench so Kau and Washington have four of Carolinas five fouls with 851 to go well and both of these teams want to get the ball and go and both of these teams have guards who can really pressure you beating you out on the perimeter and when your guys get by somebody out on the perimeter that causes some problems for your inside guys and Washington whos played very well is going to have to sit down with those two fouls yep Washington off to very good start no points couple of rebounds some blocks and he and kdo have two and Elliot has come back with just under nine to go so hes sat over there about 7 Minutes second from Harris and now poopy Miller back for Chuck Harris and Andy infield T Im fascinated to watch Carolina get small here D we talked about it a little bit with Hubert Davis today see how it unfolds here kadoo for Powell whos been terrific early tend to shoot Withers yigu couldnt get there and he got blocked by cross terrific play by Matt cross Miller and the Mustangs in transition cross winding into the lane kick for Edwards Baseline Runner is is good BJ Edwards second field goal North Carolina did a good job making him stop there goes Ian Jackson for the dunk it got rejected by Endo going up and Bill Covington a foul and well double check the foul but heres a look at Withers Withers missed that three so he eles to drive to the basket and cross just takes it right out of his arms but this North Carolina team does a nice job getting back on defense but this is an experienced player in Edwards hes one of those returners you talked about Wes Cario oquindo the foul fourth on SMU Andy infield not pleased jayen Withers the free throw his first quter the Applause game W weve talked a great deal about the fact that North Carolina has had some trouble rebounding the ball this year but theyve really been scrapping and fighting tonight yeah against one of the best rebounding teams in the ACC yeah its interesting the the words you hear Hubert Davis used most often about his team is communicating and talking though Dan right and they wouldnt be doing this well if they werent doing some of that well I think so and every time you talk to him he says well the keys are always the same defense and rebounding and theyve done a pretty good job in both areas so far you toou against B Lu and a double team help forces the turnover five of them now for the Mustangs and Kad off the p pass thats perfectly executed Wes you wait till the big guy starts dribbling the ball then you attack him and they knock the ball away and get an easy one down on the other end 10point lead for Carolina Drake Powell you see the turnover off the double team nice delivery here good clean bounce pass Carolina by 10 in the ACC all played one another tonight and this is the last game in that and those teams they got to be very concerned about that as the season goes on one and one on the road the one road wi was at Boston College theres the drive o quendo couldnt finish that ball got knocked toward the Tar Hill bench and Bill Covington says last touch BYU well West nobody on either one of these teams is worried about an NC tournament resume right now theyre trying to win the game but you know the fans are all concerned about that yep I mean NC a tournament doesnt start until the middle of March early January we got some time we got a couple months heres Jackson Who so far tonight is scoreless with seven minutes to play in the first half and boy took a hard shot that time from PJ Edwards as he was trying to make the catch 7 to shoot for Kad cross drives to help Kad on the rerack scoop it with the right hand that got blocked out of bounds and last Touch by Miller with 21 to shoot Kad is slowly back to his feet L kadoo I think thats where he operates the best West taking the ball and driving it hard to the basket and weve seen him make some tough shots in there he is like a slot wide receiver across the middle when he takes it in the lane now La for Powell Carolina couldnt complete the alley heres SMU one of their last seven Miller tries to change that and Ben Allen Luben had a shot at the rebound it was knocked out of his hands and Jerel Colbert the junior transfer at 610 asking Eric Lewis about it and now turning to Tommy marsy as if to say a second opinion might go there did not I dont think anybodys going to change their mind now boy Miller does a lot of things very well but shoot threes is not among hes only a 30 threepoint shooter and Im not sure that Andy anfield wants him shooting the three that early in the shot CL Carolina by Music 10 Davis for pal T to shoot and RJ Davis to work against BJ Edwards Luben trying to help theres the double team now Ian Jackson with three to shoot deep three off a spin missed everything Miller the rebound of the air ball Mustangs in transition Harris will finish with the layup boy Miller can go cant he terrific turn and burn Harris has got eight to lead the Mustangs its an eightpoint Carolina Applause lead now Luben is setting screens in there ignoring him and cross thatll be his Applause second five on SMU Dan well Luben goes and sets those screens and SMU has been attacking the dribbler theyve basically been ignoring Luben but that time he was able to find his way to the basket on the roll so Matt cross I think will be replaced here in the SMU lineup after picking up his second with 554 to go remember now he averages not just 11 points hes their best rebounder at eight a game ven Allen Luben 21 of 29 at the free throw line this year after that conversion for his first point there is Johan trayor from tours in France back into the lineup for the Mustangs and the second one bouns away lead stays at nine well trayor is more of an inside operator for SMU Colbert tried to bounce it through traffic turned it over nice lead pass Davis will try and finish it got slapped off the glass and Van Allen Luben stuffed it back home third to 19 Miller fall away at the 16t Mark rebounded by tremble Powell for Jackson back for Drake Powell spot up jumper tried to follow his own Miss and Bill cumington said last touched by SMU but how about this a moment ago Dan but this is really a great defensive sequence and RJ Davis stumbles and hes not able to quite get his feet but great Hustle by Luben you think okay Davis is out of the head of the crowd hes going to score easily but he stumbled it was a block shot and Luben comes down and tips it home the 610 freshman James Brown has come on the floor for Carolina wheres jersey number two for the Tar Heels theres Brown at the foul line yigu and then he threw it away turnover by The Freshman fifth turnover on Carolina Brown is the screener that time has to find a way to get himself involved he cant just allow his man to go double team the ball handle y he is a young man who they see a very bright future for so the minutes come in small increments for 611 or 610 freshman James Brown well if you go in the game and turn the ball over theyre going to be even small smaller thats right heres Miller long three by trayor is Off the Mark he shoots him from out there but hes only about 30 Jackson leaping catch to Powell tremble Euro in traffic they try for the rebound knocked out Jackson a fresh 20 Davis standing three 10 in the first half for RJ Davis thats a great pass by Jackson 14point Carolina lead is their largest to this first half and Harris fouled on the drive or Edwards rather fouled on the drive and he was fouled by Powell so North Carolina had all those problems fallen behind by double digits in the first half and now weve had two games in a row where theyve gone up by double digits in the first half seven times prior to Saturday against Notre Dame they had fallen behind by double digits in the first half and now two straight of 10 plus I think theyre playing for the future man heres uh Edward hes got five for SMU he and Harris front line scoring and for the first time we get to see Tibet gorner a senior from Turkey this is his third School originally at Arizona couple of Seasons at San Jose State and now SMU one of the new faces in the lineup he averaged 11 points in four rebounds a year ago for San Jose State four minutes to go Miller cashes into the corner gors three C of his previous stops gorner made threes he struggled from three this year but thats what hes in the game to do is to try to make a three yeah four of 16 now after the Miss there here goes Powell Baseline the reverse and fouled is Drake Powell and I think thats going to be on yigu We will double check it when we come back to Chapel Hill it is yulu second RJ Davis has got double f in the first half Carolina by 13 Music Applause well we just had one of our own a few minutes but I can believe Cooper flag did something tonight he posted another double double tonight in the Duke win by the way all Justins got to do is pass the ball yeah MCW in studio now working for us at ACC Network foul was on CET yigu so it was his second as po goes to the line and the former Northwood charger spins out the free throw thats about the only thing North Carolina has done poorly tonight theyre now five of nine from the line but theyve held SMU to 26 shooting theyve made tar Hills have made six threes theyve out rebounded one of the best uh offensive rebounding teams in the conference y Pals got a dozen RJ Davis has got 10 two tar heals and double Applause figures gner handles it for SMU heres Edwards and Miller out front with 13 to shoot against RJ Davis goes bopy spot up at the elbow short Davis the run out and Applause rebound lar Hills really aggressively pushing the ball sure are tremble off the ball screen of Powell right back for Drakes three out of the corner too strong long rebound handled by Miller and SMU as we get to three minutes on the attack again thats the first one of those PES missed yigu is still on the floor Dan playing with the two fouls here and hes really fighting against Brown on the inside hes got to be careful he doesnt pick up an offensive foul theres the drive they lob it for the big man cant finish it slapped out of bounds and it belongs to Carolina samat is clearly frustrated with the events here in the opening half yeah he is North Carolinas scrambled on defense theyve made theyve pressured the ball so theyve made it difficult for SMU to find the big guy inside and with those those two fouls hes got to be careful he very nearly got one for going over the back on that rebound bopy Miller one for eight here in the first half you see yigu is one for four Carolina by 14 Powell trying to take cross off the bounce Fikes through and scores what a tough move and score for the Freshman Drake Applause Powell did a nice job hanging in the air that time and yigu had to be careful and go want to pick up that third foul Edwards driving through and a whistle and foul will be called Tommy morsy is going to tag I believe RJ Davis RJ Davis and Dav is complaining I dont know what hes complaining about seven on Carolina Davis just pushes up against him when an offensive player is dribbling in a straight line like that you just cant try to push him off the line thats fouls on Carolina so one and one here for Edwards Jaylen Withers into the tarhill lineup and here is BJ Edwards out of Knoxville who started his collegiate career Tennessee for the front end of the one and one hes been double figures twice in the last five for the Mustangs Applause and the second one good I think this is an important last two minutes and 15 seconds North Carolina has basically dominated the half right you dont want to turn the ball over and G give SMU some easy opportunities little two two1 here Dan again trying to change the tempo trying to change the pace of things cross is back in the game with two fouls quendo with Harris over here to the near side you got Edwards up top with cross and yigu protecting the rim Powell had it stripped from behind by Edwards Carolina turnover Mustangs on the Run Edwards flipped it up righthanded yigu the rebound big fell with two three fakes and then Vin Allen Ruben and cross battle inside and he saves it to Powell and Edwards trying to stay with pal through the back court hes going to get called for the reach Andy infield does not like Eric Lewiss Applause call itll be the first on Edwards seven on SMU so tarhill free throws with 137 to play IG to really struggling inside those were normally shots that he would make so heres Powell one for two and it bounds away got the rebound Jackson teas one up the C is on the board Ian Jackson pushes it to a 17point Caroline lead smus missed their last seven shots from the floor Jackson just looks like a basket waiting to happen yep thats what the kids call a bucket Dan hes a walking bucket cross Runner with a right hand good Matt cross has got five on his second field goal this West has been a really complete first half for the Tar Hill yeah Hubert Davis might twinge a little over the foul shooting but otherwise been pretty clean for the home team Withers for Powell back to Jaylen Withers Dives in on AO and cross out of there with it with 43 seconds to go North Carolinas done a great job pressuring the ball heres Harris trying to find room slashing as Edwards cross the three bounds away po another rebound Carolina can hold for the last shot if SMU will let him but boy tremble being harried there by BJ Edwards and a timeout is taken I Believe by Carolina here so Ian Jackson whos been on a tear for Carolina five straight with 20 or more gets on the board here in the final minute on a rebound of a Miss Drake Powell hits number 11 for the three Music Music well Hubert Davis in Carolina with 212 and the shot clock off here leading by 15 and you see Powell is four off his season High here in the half Davis has 10 kadu has seven and thear heels here with the final possession potentially to end the frame smus only eight of 32 from the floor Dan in the first half and this is a team that comes in shooting almost 50 as a team on the season well they were 32 in the second half on Saturday in the second half against Duke heres vanin Allen Luben thought about the bounce pass fall away from in front and doesnt get the roll Rebound with one from three quter cord it is offline for Harris Carol L of 39 and SMU 24 at the half floor with Jackson Powell Kau and RJ Davis for the tar here well Harris is in there because they need some offense he had eight points bopy Miller only scored two points in the first half and what has happened is now SMU has gone with a smaller lineup that they tried to overpower North Carolina in the first half and it didnt work so now theyre going with the smaller lineup and a map followed by cross and yigu and Carolina in the open floor and RJ Davis misses long from three to start for the Tar Heels I think if youre hubu Davis you take that shot every time sure poopy Miller Elliot Kad remember hes got two RJ Davis has two Jaylen Washington also with two Sam yo and Matt cross each with two for SMU as we start the second half and theres boy Millers second field goal and thats really the first time Millers been able to get loose in the half court you know treor is the guy whos out of the game theres a turnover and heres Miller and SMU in transition a lob and the catch Harris couldnt finish cross did four in a row for the Mustangs and heres Jackson trying to beat the break and does wow and thats North Carolina basketball just because you score West you cant relax for a second cuz the tar Hills are coming right after you great transition chance for Carolina lead back to 13 Harris a three misses and boy look at the double box out Washington had most of yigu and then Kad was trying to help and Davis lost it off the dribble so two turnovers and three trips offensively for Carolina here miss shot one turnover and three trips wow you get told it was big enough that they could use some help but North Carolina did a great job in the first half they outrebounded the taller Mustangs not only did they outrebound them overall but they had more offensive rebounds to the Tor Hills R weve seen a standing dribble yeah in this ball game cross the turn and the hook with the right hand slapped out by Washington recovered to cross Edwards in traffic against Washington scores we saw early in the first half that SMU was trying to go after that matross versus Elliot Kad matchup they didnt have much success much better that time for SMU so the lead 11 for Carolina if one thing you know if you look at smus work through these first 14 games Dan this is an explosive team they can roll points in a hurry well they they had what five times theyve scored at least 50 points in a half this year heres Davis back for Washington soft jumper rolled off the front rim cross the rebound Miller a pull up two and yatu tried to dunk it down ended up missing the dunk might have gotten away with a rim grab did I see that and the ball ended up out of Applause bounds Bill C he get away with a rim grab no its an ugly play well done K thats why youre one of the best in the business my man he he lost control of the ball going up now he put that ball on the rim and grabbed the rim then its a different story pow of three bounds Applause away North Carolina here early in the second half really trying to get back on defense y only sending two guys to the offensive boards cross oh had it picked by pow and then poell going to commit the foul as he lost control and then Edwards or Harris rather collected so itll be the second on pow the first of the half on Carolina well pal made the mistake Wes of trying to recover the ball by dribbling and he needed to grab that one so really nice job tipping the ball away from Cross but hes trying to dribble it now you just got to pick that thing up y Applause really good defensive play unfortunate foul yep so SMU with the ball 20 on the shot clock Harris to Applause work double team there now hell rerack around Jackson Edwards with six to shoot against Davis leans in put it up on the rim Yu couldnt control heres Ian Jackson against Harris all the way to the basket and scor Ian Jacksons got seven now quick look Miller had it blocked did Edwards now Davis on the run through traffic and Miller call for the block score the basket that was a heck of a sequence for North Carolina a great defensive play leads to this the ball bounces around a little bit pal not only blocked the ball he tipped it away and then RJ Davis is I mean hes just too fast Miller never could get his defensive position established so Davis a chance at the threepoint play to push the lead to 16 Paul has done about everything tonight hadnt he Bo hes been really impressive free throw good for Davis three of five at the line hes now got 13 and thats a great response by North Carolina SMU had a little bit of energy there early in the half Jerel cobbert on the drive he lost it off his shoe heres Jackson hes got help if he wants it tried to stride through and going to end up Bill Covington went out of bounds in the end zone and hell get to his feet and were going to have Eric Lewis check with his colleague here this is some move Jackson is trying to make you know good Heavens oh you see Bill Twisted oh boy hope hes okay like a slight ankle twist yeah as he stepped to the corner there stepped on one of the photographers over there yep ball actually went off Miller yep so heres Davis in the corner boy bopy Miller played over the top of the venile and Luben screen didnt he Davis in a double team heres all and Luben short jump of go well ifu does that well defensively and Luben still scores Dan thats a tough deal for Andy Enfield 7 nothing run by Carolina Colbert in traffic fouled by Powell thatll be his third hes the First tarhill with three second of the half Wes its really interesting the contrasting plays right there the little drop off pass to Luben results in the basket little drop off pass there trayor fumbles the ball now hes going to get to the free throw line yep but that should have been an easy basket couple of shots for Johan trayor from France he had 20 and 11 rebounds against Longwood only six against Duke those are his first points tonight and Wes just as importantly treor is a guy who gets to the free throw line yeah and this is his first trip there tonight well this his 55th free throw of the year right here and 15 games SMU has seven guys that score 87 or high higher points per game and treor is one of them and he gets a lot of them at the free throw line he just hadnt been able to get there theight I think Ian Jacksons found out tonight when you go five straight with 20 or more youre toward the top of the report defensively every time he catches it theres at least one and often times two Mustangs and there goes the captain down the lane couldnt finish the layup however he he appears undeterred that was against the zone that time mhm yep Miller on the drive and a foul reach across Tommy mors he will pick up the whistle and make the call here on Kad third on kadoo third on Carolina but the Tar Heels with a 17point lead 4831 a moment ago Vin Allen Luben in the Music paint4 and Im sure we gave JR Reed The Holly farms player of the game oh do you know how many people are happy you said that heres Miller in traffic and a foul on RJ Davis itll be his third its the fourth on Carolina in the half well Wes when JR Reed was a freshman and of course Dean Smith really tried hard to limit the recognition for freshman thanks to a conspiracy among the Raycom Jefferson pilot analyst organized by directed by and led by Billy Cunningham okay uh the analysts gave JR Reed the Hol Farms play of the game every time is that right okay now now we know at at Cunninghams Direction okay boy Miller at the line by the way these two teams played a year earlier in Dallas at Reunion Arena Carolina won a twopoint game 8886 the first meeting ever between the two was in January of 1985 in Greensboro so they played three consecutive years Dan essentially and in that first meeting it was four versus five John conak had 31 points for Dave blisss Mustangs Kenny Smith had 18 Steve Hail had 16 Carolina lost 8482 in Greensboro and then say Tournament game no no regular season game on a Sunday in Greensboro yeah before the Smith Center open heres Withers at the foul line hell knock down the jump shot boy North Carolina in the second half Luben with the basket Withers with a basket inside North Carolina has defeated SMU points in the paint transition points Second Chance points its North Carolina has dominated just about every phase of the game first on Jackson Five on Carolina just one foul on SMU here in the second half the Mustangs as much as theyre trying to get back in the game are three of 12 from the floor here in the second half well the 12 shots thats an encouraging sign but three of 12 is not yep poopy Miller with trayor providing the screen and and feeds it right back to the big man Johan tors first field goal hes how close did Jackson come to getting that one yep SM needs to do more of that heres Ben Allen Luben working against a Kendo with a right hand and scores just turns right over his left shoulder for his third field goal seven for Vin Allen Luben and the back to the basket power move isnt something you normally see and he forced the turnover there nice pass tremble for Davis the pass was a little bit behind him thats a heck of a catch by Davis on the run time out for Andy infield its 19 the Tar Hill lead with almost 6 minutes gone here in the second half back to Smith Center in a moment on the Atlantic Coast Conference television network Music still scoreless in the second half after 14 at the break RJ Davis though Dan hes got five here in the second half 15 tonight as impressive as North Carolina has been on offense West I think their defense has been much more impressive they have held SMU so far in this game for the game to 26 overall field goal shooting 15 from Beyond The Arc almost 6 minutes gone here in this second half half as the Mustangs go to work with BJ Edwards Cario oquindo and now yigu C trying to back down Ben Allen Luben off the block and a foul will be called on Luben Tom CA handling our stats tonight smus only made backto back field goals once tonight thats a struggle first team as he plays as well on the offensive end as SMU yep to have scored baskets on consecutive possessions only one time in this game yeah heres cross challenged by Luben missed the bunny and recovered by Davis RJ trying to get the transition game going here is Jackson around oh boy yigu took Jackson down hard and theyre going to look at this look at it Jackson landed right on his tailbone and Hubert is fired up and Eric Lewis talking to C yatu as bill cumington now will take a look at this and the previous play get under review that this is a hard hard foul yigu is trying to stop him and Jackson I mean just goes right into and brings his arm down and thats where thats what knock Jackson down and remember Wes hes making a play on the ball but that if even if you make a play on the ball if your contact is excessive that can very easily be a flagrant foul it could be a flagrant one if the officials decide that the contact is severe then it could actually be a flagrant too so here are the differentials in this well the first one there is what were looking at here excessive or unnecessary and even if youre making a play on the ball its can still be a flagrant foul if its excessive or unnecessary not a legitimate play on the ball is when you like wrap somebody up or a hold or push from behind there was no hold or push from behind there that was all from in front but it was a very hard foul so they continue to look here and Wes just because it was a very hard foul doesnt necessarily make it flagrant foul either right and heres what were talking about uh severe or extreme and that the severity of the contact whether it was to the head of the defender the injury potential if the player was vulnerable while Jackson certainly was right so take all that into account and now heres another look again Jackson is in the air and yigu just comes down brings his arms down and knocks him down to the ground hard I dont think he hit him that hard Wes but I think when he lowered his arms it knocked him so off balance that he landed very hard yeah so Tommy marsy has joined Bill Covington meanwhile Eric Lewis is visiting with samat yigu and I think theyve come to a resolve here and well hear from the have the referee here Bill Covington after review the previous foul has been upgraded to a flavor one 44 seconds on the shot clock two shot ball underneath to North Carolina okay so there you have it well they ruled it a flagrant one foul because of EX they felt the contact was successive because of number one the wind up and number two the fall through so he winds up here and then he follows all the way through and they considered that contact to be except so couple of free throws and the ball for North Carolina and Ian Jackson with two here and the first one good so Jacksons now got eight in the ball game he may have a sore tailbone tomorrow and second cly through may have a sore tailbone right now the lead has gone to 21 largest to the night for Carolina just beyond six and change gone here in the second half Davis spot up to is G fourpoint trip for Carolina well Davis is feeling it coming out here in the second half Applause yep 5835 Edwards skipped to the corner and a three ball is good and thats Chuck Harris 11 for Harris on his second three of the night thats only three as a team by the Mustangs yeah hes got two of them Jackson all the way through on the drive and hell draw the foul you get told he was going to get tired of Jackson driving into the lane well hes he might get tired of it and he might if he does it one more time hell be on the bench cuz thatll be five thats four on yigu now at the 1304 Mark and that is four fouls or three fouls I beg your pardon on SMU here in the second half Jackson at the line for a couple and the first one good dont forget Sunday we got an ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header you see Duke and Virginia get a start at noon and then North Carolina host Boston College at Carmichael at two Georgia Tekken Louisville at 4 from Derby City and then Miami Syracuse wraps it up at 600 all on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app Ian Jackson a couple of fre free throws Carolina by 22 cross and caught out of bounds and PJ Edwards stepped on the sideline Wes and I cant emphasize this enough this is an outstanding SMU team particularly on the offensive end and just everything is discombobulated tonight and you have to give credit to the North Carolina defense they have been very aggressive Mustangs are under 28 from the floor tonight remember they average over 85 points a game Jackson into the corner Withers the shot bait hell take off around trayor the scoop and score wow Johan tors foul his first four on SMU W this is really a heck of a move here by Withers watch how long he stays up in the air his feet almost hit the ground before he let go of the ball that is really something so seven now for Jaylen Applause Withers trayor plays with okendo Harris Edwards and cross pretty small lineup relatively speaking for SMU there goes Edwards into traffic and Carolina hoping for a hell ball not going to get get it Jaylen witherss going to pay for it its his first that is seven on Carolina with 1214 to go so Dan therell be free throws here for a while Wes coming into this game you look at each of these teams and given the size of SMU that was clearly an advantage for them in North Carolina they were a smaller team but they have guys who can score on the outside and they have a lot of speed so they had some advantages and what youve seen is North Carolina in this game has been able to get make their advantages an overmatch for SMU advantages that is 10 now for Edwards fourth free throw the tar Hills defense has just been so disruptive SMU cant really get into anything yep both free throws for BJ Edwards almost 8 minutes gone second half Kau lost it on the dribble here goes Cario aqu quendo to the basket and hell stuff it home with two hands first field goal for the Oregon Transfer and its 6342 now thats now nine turnovers in the game for North Carolina but for the most part theyve done a great job taking care of the ball Jackson skips it for Powell Drake slides to the basket in traffic two strong in the rebound and here comes BJ Edwards and SMU on the attack a quindo a kick back for an Edwards three and thatll bounce out of bounds and thatll get us to a timeout 1128 to play in Chapel Hill North Carolina tracking to pick up their third Conference win it be their 10th on the year other day against Duke they were 34 from the floor and five of 21 from three well it is two in a row and I dont know that thats anything for Andy Enfield to panic about because its against two really good teams and this is a North Carolina team I dont know Wes weve seen him in person a couple times now I dont know that Ive seen them play any more of complete game than this not only from an offensive standpoint but their rebounding their defense has really been good and I suspect were going to find out post game their communication wasnt bad well hbert Davis is very was very pleased with the way he felt his guys communicated with one another against Notre Dame and they had success in that game so you have success that generally means you keep doing it yeah I thought he said something interesting to us today too he said they have to know theyre a team not a group yes Kau for Jackson look at him on the drive and draws the foul I mean when he set sail down the lane I mean he is hard to stop yep foul is on Paris itll be his first five now on the Mustang and Wes its interesting to me he jumps so early he like floats through the air and given the way the rule is about the block charge on the inside that might have been uh a disadvantage a couple of years ago but the way that rule is written now theres no secondary Defender who has a chance to get in there before he plants that last foot and he missed the back end the free throw Carolinas first Miss of the second half they hit seven in a row before Jackson saw that one drop off the edge 22point lead under 11 to play now its Smith Center tonight rouy Miller he came in averaging almost 16 a game hes only scored six yeah four here in the half a quindo inside trayor up strong cross crash the glass and Carolina touch that last itll stay with SMU six to shoot and Wes prior to the game everybody was talking about thats where SMU had an advantage down on the inside and they tried to go in there again and they just werent successful North Carolina has defended the interior very well Miller Kau tried to help Withers tried to help finally they forced the shot and then cross took it from Withers gives it back to Miller and cadell blocked it out of there and were going to get a foul theres a kick ball kick ball so Eric Lewis with the kick ball and so 20 to shoot and SMU gets it on the Baseline here well again North Carolina really scrambling on the inside I think I think if the officials had to do that all over again they might have called a shot clock finally right Miller left corner heres Applause Harris and how about that Drake po reached in knocked it away for RJ Applause Davis how no points here in the second half he had 14 at the break hes two off his season high and offensive foul Applause hes on a quindo no its on Washington Washington okay yeah no its on Washington its his third and crowd doesnt like it Eric Lewis made the call and Bill Covington agreed with it third on Jaylen Washington so vanen Allen Luben reports back and we also get our look first look at Keon Ambrose Hilton 22 in the black shirt tonight for SMU well youve mentioned a couple times that the Mustangs have three returning players and Ambrose Hilton is one of them yeah Harrison what a pass Edwards the other there goes Davis on the blur and he had it knocked away one thing has followed last years Carolina team to this years Carolina team there are not many that are faster at 94 ft no they go and the interesting thing about it Wes they push the ball ahead with the pass theres a lot of teams that get up before really quickly with the dribble but they push the ball ahead with a pass very Music Applause effectively 940 to play Davis a three and boy the battle inside its going to be a push on SMU I think its going to be on Ambrose Hill 69 from Toronto his first six on the Mustangs well it was on somebody you saw Jaylen Withers jump up in the and suddenly he went flying out of there Music and live for Withers against Ambrose Hilton theres RJ Davis against Music Harris smus been pretty much man after what 10 minutes of Zone down 12 they did a little Zone here in the second half but wasnt very effective Davis missed the three youre just trying anything you can to try to change the tempo of the game yatu the rebound and Miller the transition one handed and thats really the first time weve seen boy Miller do that and thats one of the strongest parts of his game yep 9 minutes to play part of the problem is North Carolina has shot the ball so well there havent really been a lot of opportunities for SMU to get out in transition heres pal tried to save it to Withers and threw it away turnover on the Tar Heels Miller going to streak to the basket and draws the foul from Jaylen Withers thatll be his second nine against Carolina so a couple of free throws coming up and again North Carolina has protected the ball pretty well and that was a concern you dont want to give a team like SMU a lot of opportunities to get out and go and North Carolina basically has restricted that tonight so Chicagos poopy Miller to the line or hes two for two here in the second half course was at w Forest a year ago averaged 14 points and three and a half assists we got ACC guys all over the place tonight because former Maryland coach Mark turons here how about this his son Leo is a freshman at Carolina so former assistant under Roy Williams at Kansas head coach at Texas AM and Maryland in his career wi State wi State 10 NCAA tournaments we got ACC luminaries everywhere boners here Mark Turon Roy Williams loopy Miller well Mark Turon Not only was a really good basketball coach but what a great person yeah good guy sure was and good to see him here tonight and have a visit heres Davis trying to find a crease Carolina lead 19 kadoo look at Ambrose Hilton try to keep up and kadoo missed badly on the jumper Ambrose Hilton runs it down really good job by Ambrose BR Hilton to not let Kido get by or three here SMU going to pick up some momentum Miller on the drive and kdo bounc it off of boopy itll belong to the Tar Heels with 819 to play and Andy infield summons Chuck Harris off his bench and hes coming for bopy Music Miller so here is tremble to put it in play with kadoo Davis Powell and and Luben that was a dangerous pass and quickly kdo here in the front court against Cario a Applause quendo ball screen for Elliot kdo tremble with five to shoot Runner off the Baseline now Harris into the corner a quendo will fire and oh boy kadoo reaching for his eyes aindo went down in the corner and we get a break 746 to go the under eight media timeout in Chapel Hill Carolina by 19 on acc Network Music watch Music Applause Music oh Applause Music Applause Music back in Chapel Hill ACC basketball presented tonight by tro price invest with confidence with Dan Bonner West Durham Matt Krauss our producer Kyle Lang our director terrific ACC Network crew were at the dean E Smith Center tonight fourth meeting all time and first as ACC combatants between SMU and North Carolina and Cario aindo after the foul a moment ago on kadoo was his fourth Dan that was a threepoint shot yep so he gets three cracks at it so not only did kdo get his fourth foul but he got smacked in the face yeah hes come out and a quindo knocks down the free throw SMU on a 101 run now its a 16point game 745 to go and the Mustangs are lingering down not lingering thats thats a good way but uh you can tell the kind of hole they dug for themselves are on 10 one run and so still behind by 16 yep Powell for Vin Allen Luben and dont forget this is an excellent offensive team as SMU Davis out of the corner tremble missfires on the three and the backside rebound for Keon Ambrose Hilton 69 senior has done a nice job off of Andy infields bench here yes he has and again West more shots North Carolina misses the more opportunities there are for SMU to get out and go and North Car shooting a very high percentage denied them those opportunities earlier in the game Ian Jacksons come back on the floor hes with Drake pal V Allen lubben tremble and RJ Davis who just threw the reach on Keon Ambrose Hilton I think and Im still not quite sure why 69 Keon Ambrose Hilton paid for his second foul by trying to guard RJ Davis but nonetheless well somebodys got to guard him uh you know theres a switch out there this is North Carolina with their smaller with a smaller quicker lineup and Hubert Davis was talking about this earlier today with us Dan sure everybody understands the the big man situation but he may have found something here what do you see that this could potentially Blossom for well first of all when North Carolina plays defense like that when they scramble around and help one another particularly in the first half then it doesnt matter how many big guys you have its hard to find them the big guys have to handle the ball most big guys arent great ball handlers and passers right and so that has really helped and then in the second half the tar Hills have spread the court they forced switches and theres no way that uh you know Ambrose Hilton is going to be able to guard RJ Davis away from the Applause basket again if you take your advantage and you make them an overmatch for the other teams advantage and thats what North Carolina has done here tonight 5 and2 13 the ball game for Harris 66 50 to score 624 to go Powell at length against Ambrose Hilt now North Carolina just trying to run their half court offense yep Davis on a ball screen tried defeat Ben Luben turned over heres Edwards now on the break with Ian Jackson defending and scores the first turnovers you get transition baskets and suddenly the game looks a lot different although youre still way behind and theres a backourt foul on Cross who is trying to bait the pass on the inbounds and perhaps make the steal he pays for it with his third thats the eighth on SMU with 559 to go so free throws now for thear heels and Seth tremble going to the line tremble is scoreless remember hes missed the last three he had been double figures in five straight prior to his practice injury and missed the front of the one and one Carolina has gone 6 and2 minutes without a field goal K hadnt scored tonight but I thought his defensive effort particularly in the first half really helped the car Hill heres Harris another three and the rebound hit the ground and Davis Scoops it North Carolina with a great job blocking out thats an area where we said SMU came into this game as the leading offensive rebounding team in the Atlantic Coast Conference but North Carolina has really stopped that yep Luben for Davis tried to get it to Ian Jackson here he is in the corner pal tes up a three and a technical foul on who basket is good for Drake Powell oh wow oh my so Drake pal knocks down the three to make it a a 17point night for him and the foul is on technical foul on the SMU bench well given where it was called it had to be on Andy Applause Enfield and Eric Lewis and Bill Covington in conversation as you get a look at the first year Mustang leader 55yearold Andy infield so well take a timeout with them 17point lead again for Carolina after the pow triple and a technical foul called when we continue Music Applause so Bill cumington and Eric Lewis are at the monitor here and its announced as a technical foul on the SMU bench I think thats what Andy anfield got upset about you see the bench gets up and come they felt like that was a double dribble right and it wasnt called and so they got hit with a technical foul but that basket is going to count right side of your screen you see Andy Enfield out by half court yeah so RJ Davis had the ball and it certainly looked like he double dribbled yep so Bill Covington final four official in his own right one of the better officials in all of college basketball talking to Andy infield as RJ Davis shoots the first of the technical free throws and what they may have been trying to establish was whether the technical foul was called before North Carolina was in its shooting motion and he get both free throws and the Tar Hill is going to get the ball so no its picks up at the point of interruption thats right so blost you so it ends up being a fivepoint trip yep the three for pal the two free Applause throws the team foul heres Edwards all the way on the drive got trapped by VIN Allen Luben hell skip it across for cross they got a mismatch inside with yigu but they simply cant find it and cross forces it up and in nine for Matt cross and thats the right word Wes forces it up Jackson was battling against jigu inside and SMU never looked at 17point game we go inside of 5 minutes the Mustangs now coming with some pressure yep Carolina spreading the floor here theyre content to let their guards do the work now Davis working on BJ Edwards RJ with yiga skips for Powell five to shoot Drake a hanging two and cross Wes one of the things thats been going on here recently these skip passes by North Carolina have not been really well executed guys having to jump to catch the ball not really in shooting position Edwards rolls in his fifth field goal hes got eight and a half now 15 in the ball game for the Junior from Knoxville Applause Music Applause Tennessee and RJ Davis finally handles as we get toward four minutes here Dan lead is 15 for Carolina Applause well in this situation W if youre going to run the clock down youve got to to have some guys who can score at the end of the clock Davis five to shoot Ambrose Hilton in the air heres Jackson a three from the right check that box yeah you were looking for guys that can score score at the end of the clock I offer I offer you the Freshman jackon but that was great patience even though the clock was running down he faked to get himself an open shot Harris will fall away itll rattle in Chuck Harris with 15 in the game Ian Edwards now starting to heat up here a little bit for SMU with three and change to go Trimble for Davis RJ floater with a right hand tell you what he struggled the last two Dan looks like he might have recovered and found the groove here of course if youre Huber Davis thats exactly what youre hoping for thatll find the groove yigu his field goal just his second of the night gives him four points its a 16point game with three minutes to go Ian Jackson at the end of the shot clock a moment ago knocks down his second three of the night more from Chapel Hill in a moment Music Applause all right Justin thanks Justin appreciate it Carolina by 16 3 minutes to play here in Chapel Hill some of the partisans have headed for the Applause exit RJ Davis will walk it into the front court and Carolina will burn shot clock here what a game Davis has had 23 points five rebounds four assists two Steals and trying to add more to it Washington will set the screen you too tries to help out of bounds 3 point4 to shoot for Carolina again the tar Hills are very content to take their time take as much time off the clock as possible Washington Davis one on the clock over yigao and it goes oh were going to check I say Im not sure he got that one off they should count it just because the way of it way it looked and normally Wes they would review it at the next TV timeout but there arent any TV timeouts left clock at the top oh its off it is off there his hand tell you what I would go ahead and Mark that down thats that ought to live in sports Centers top 10 tonight yeah thats the way I thought about it too guys that was youre looking for Shooters at the end of the shot clock boner well I know Ian Jackson RJ Davis liely on him but that was over a 7 foot2 guy falling he was falling backwards yeah but certainly from the angles that we had that looked like he got it off before and yeah they just counted it yep Andy infield of the word for Bill Covington well thats the way its gone tonight for SMU yeah Applause look you got to be kidding what that shot that shot yeah well you know you hit a few of those in your driveway in Pittsburgh growing up as a kid with nobody around heres Miller blocked by Washington slapped out beyond the timeline Mustangs are run it down as were wor to two minutes thats four block shots for Washington second best G second good game too right because Hubert Davis was uh effusive about the way he played the other day and Matt cross I think just caught uh RJ Davis in the chops Applause here and Davis is down and Carolinas basketball trainer is Doug Halverson whos going to come out here and take a look at RJ Davis it looks like hes just bleeding nose bleed oh they just banged heads its a foul on Davis well Davis got the foul called because he reaches in and after that reach in they banged heads right and it looked like he took it right on the nose yep so Doug alerson out to check on RJ Davis who Dan just told you hes had a terrific night with 26 well when you get hit in the nose like that West the world spins yep after review common foul on white four two shots black 33 all right so Matt cross will get a couple of free throws RJ Davis will thats one of those unfortunate plays Wes where you know he reaches in and because he reached in he gets his head right on top of crosss head and they bang heads thats just an unfortunate play yep so theyre taking care of the uh housekeeping below the deck Doug Halverson will walk RJ Davis back to the Carolina locker room here at Smith Center so cross will go to the line to shoot a couple of free throws Matt cross is uh third ACC stop in his career Dan hell be 24 years old next month by the way will this young man from Beverly Mass started in Miami correct went to Louisville yes spent a couple years at UMass and now plays the co year at SMU and he knocks the free throw down to give him 10 on the night and make it 11 with the free throw averaged 15 points and shot 54 a year ago for the Minute Men well he hes a really versatile player has a nice mix of Threes And midrange game postup Game Y and they tried early in the game to get him mismatched inside against kdo but the North Carolina help defense really prevented him from doing any damage in there yeah he got a double double tonight though its his fourth of the year and the 14th of his career after knocking the free throws down there a moment ago here is kdo tried to flip it inside turn turn over to Ambrose Hilton well the turnover numbers are not going to look pretty for North Carolina tonight but most of them have been after the game was really decid yep spot up three Harris knocks it down he can shoot it yeah hes got 18 10 in the second half for Chuck Harris and its 7965 with a minute and change theres a skip back for kadoo and a hit for Ian Jackson thats a long three pal tried to keep it alive a Quin the rebound for the Mustangs minute to Applause go cross working against Elliot Kau wheels and scores and earlier in the game when he did that youd take one or two dribbles and he would get a double team yep and that time Jaylen Washington very slow getting over for the double team and gave cross the opportunity and Hubert Davis is just going to run the clock here keep the the ball moving and going to be about a 20 second differential shot clock the game clock here Kau handles it out front Carolina getting ready to go to 10 Six and 3 and one in the ACC Jackson a three got it Ian Jackson has 18 now on his third three of the night Carolinas double figures and threes what a performance from behind the line for the tar Hills 11 of them tonight and thatll do it with about 11 seconds left Jackson the rebound he stepped out of bounds he stepped out of bounds with 105 to go Chuck Harris is looking for a foul and but that sort of sums up the night for North Carolina not falling out of bounds but there were four white shirts after that rebound and North Carolina against a very good rebounding team has really done a nice job controlling the boards o quindo off the inbounds SMU by the way gets Georgia Tech Saturday at Moody Coliseum and Carolina will be in Raleigh to meet the Wolfpack 8267 the final tonight ch
