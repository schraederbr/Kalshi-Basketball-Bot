now for Louisville the mission is pretty simple yes they would love to get off to a great start in ACC play but they would also very much like to win a game well I think theyre one in the same I I think they can by winning the game they get off to a good start they have to handle the basketball no turnovers good shot selection and do a great job on the glass 20th meeting all time between these two teams off and running as we get a look at the Cardinals starting five James Ellis Huntley Hatfield Curry getting the start today and Jalen Withers rounding out the five for Kenny Paynes crew I think with the change in the starting lineup with curry theyre really trying to get the ball inside they think they can take advantage of Miami on the glass that has been a negative spot here for Miami despite their 71 start rebounding has been a bit of an issue and even in their win against Rutgers in the ACC Big Ten challenge they struggled against Rutgers the three ball missed and off the mark from L Ellis out of bounds last touchdown by the hurricanes and see thats what Kenny Payne is trying to do with Ellis is not have all the pressure on his back he doesnt have to come up with tough shots let the other four guys help you lets get easy shot opportunities so Louisville had a rough outing against Maryland in their last contest theres a lot play in here to try to beat the shot clock as unsuccessful back over to Miami they started out very slowly in that game and Perry when a team struggles to win games and in this case Louisville hasnt won a game this season the start of these games can be very important oh without question I mean you start off with the tough shot and then you come back with a turnover so thats not the way they really want to start the ball game Juan Miller omir keep an eye on him hes dealing with an injury well talk about later on pack and Poplar pack for three thats a little short in the rebound Corral by Mike James of Louisville Applause one minute in thanks for spending your Sunday with us along the ACC Network for the opener and ACC play between Miami and Louisville entry pass intercepted and stolen by North Chad OMeara the lob and the save to dip and the bucket picked up by Jordan Miller and thats what happens whenever you turn the ball over and thats been an Achilles heel for Louisville turning it over in an easy basket for Miami getting the bucket is Ellis to kick out open shooter for three so Jalen Withers pops a three to get Louisville a 32 inch Jalen Withers is an excellent basketball player highly recruited young man with a lot of talent Louisville shooting 29 from three thats a mark theyll obviously look to improve on here today one of the things Louisville wants to do is try to eliminate Miamis penetration look at Poplar off the mark on the jumper the rebound Corral Ellis and down low going off the glass and end Brandon Huntley Hatfield Applause thats why Louisvilles gone with the big lineup they really think they could take advantage of that their size inside against Miami so a good start for the Cardinals and off the glass and in on the attack its north Chad omir if folks havent seen omir he is really a talented player hes an undersized post guy that plays with angles and has really done a great job of scoring in the low post for Miami he can make things happen on both sides of the basketball in the lane Withers is tied up but check that Curry tied up itll go back over to Miami that time where Carrie got the ball received the ball you have to give him the ball in the place where he doesnt have to put the ball on the floor he can catch and finish Applause Curry had a great close to the season last year he hasnt been able to quite find that Rhythm this year and rolling to the Lane and a twohanded jam applied by omir so Omare off to a nice start well what they do with omir they put him at the high post and he they use him for ball screens and if you had she rolls and he gets easy baskets like he just got two on two for Poplar save count it and the foul for Jordan Miller able to get the basketball out of that strum yeah this is what we talked about earlier and this is whats gotten Louisville in trouble run out and you get run out because of your shot selection and your turnovers and thats where Louisville has to do a better job of eliminating those two things and making people go against their half court defense Kenny Payne looking on as the first foul picked up by Mike James seven possessions four turnovers so far for this Louisville team what Kenny Payne is telling his young guard is passing angles be patient and where you deliver the basketball thats extremely important Kenny being a post guy understands guards have to give you the ball where you can operate seven straight for the Hurricanes to lead it by four nine to five Percy Miller into the game for the Cardinals oh Isaiah long down on the floor with a shot missed by Miller and Wong is grabbing his left leg looked like he got caught up on the screen and maybe caught a knee up time is out on the floor they continue to look over Wong will step out for a quick break Miami up with Mark hacker Trey Boston and Taylor tannenbach theyll talk football but also will have the latest from around the conference weekdays at four Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app so right as we went to break there Isaiah Wong was in pain on the floor and Perry looked like he took a tough screen yes he did he got his knee right there in the thigh area and theyre probably taking him back just to loosen them up theyve got so many different machines that releases some of the muscle pains and spasms so well see Bensley Joseph into the game and rolling to the rim and scoring yet again is nor Channel Mir hes the active leader in the nation in rebounding per game but showing off the offensive game well Louisvilles gonna have to do something to handle that action we saw him in their practice to shoot around last night coach talked about that down low the hook shot is in for Brandon Huntley Hatfield so Huntley Hatfield using that big 610 frame to establish position and and that also goes at OMeara would put some defensive pressure on him but but when they put only a high like that and they send the guards off of him the big has to make a decision whether or not hes going to hedge or the guard has to go under so off to miss by Jordan Miller by the way JJ trainer whos into the game he started favoring his side right after that activity along the Baseline and hes going to head out of the game by the way Isaiah Wong is expected to return to the game well hes coming back hes the first guy you make sure is on the bus they just want to loosen it up and everything and these schools have such great medical staffs and equipment Miller brings it down Cardinals down by four 117 Miami put together a 70 run Joseph is one of the best defensive guards that Ive seen hes really greens a different levels of defensive intensity for Miami and when they play the three guards with long in there with him it really gives them a lot of perimeter pressure and they lose Charlie Moore obviously graduating and now an opportunity for different guys in the backcourt to step up lets go his coach was explaining uh hes different player than Moore was more was much more an offensive player where Joseph was much more defensive player lead to Joseph and one on cue that speed that Miami has they get it coming off a transition you know coach L has talked about we have to find another way to score and we use their defense to score offensively that was their straight last year hes trying to establish that same trait this year the foul picked up by L Ellis thats his first points off of turnovers already a big difference maker for the Hurricanes who lead it by seven and now they come with the full court pressure whenever Joseph was in the game he really tries to heat the ball up and this was obviously the concerns coming in among them for Louisville is the drive by Ellis to kick outside Miller lights up a three thats no good took the round and contained by Omer Poplar will try it and hit Poplar is not when other coaches talk about him they dont talk to him as a shooter but hes really a good catch and shoot guy and he gets a lot off the penetration of the guards 177 lead for the hurricanes only Hatfield trying to bang away down low smoke shot right hand good that young man does a really good job with angles the coaching staff is really high on him they felt like going big it allows him to get a better matchup especially in the post area because hes played by a four not a five transfer from Tennessee they hope he can be one of the difference makers on the floor against a little bit of an undersized Miami team and he comes up with a steal there Paul loose maintained though and now a traveler so the Hurricanes able to get control of it with omir but eventually leading to a travel yeah but the fact that they didnt come up with it clean when youre losing its just little things its not anything big loose balls turnovers just little things that you do that arent positive plays come up and really hurt you and thats the thing that I know coach Payne has worked hard with this Louisville team not just from that basketball standpoint but mentally stepping up and being able to come up with those types of plays and mentally theres no question theyve been challenged first three games of the year lost all at home all by one point Miller and a foul coming up that was the first time at least since it was able to be tracked by ESPN stats and info back to the 8081 season at least oh without question let me this little program is a proud program and theyre going to be back I mean they have had great players theyve had great fan support this is a city that leads lives and breathes basketball so they really follow their cards and so they certainly have the right man in coach Payne leading them and theyre going to be back Jalen Withers with a bucket following the foul charge two Nigel pack so Louisville trying to get a charge out of the crowd here four in a row Joseph with the swing inside losing the ball is Omare a turnover Ellis surrounded by three players and luckily Louisville able to maintained possession only Hatfield now hes double team breaks through misses a shot into the front court go to the hurricanes Wing three is in Anthony Walker hits the three and a timeout call by the Cardinals the spacing Miami gets really gets really good shots and Walker was able to follow with a great shot it was the night before Christmas went all through the house Jones and Perry Clark with you Miami up 20 to 11 and so far its a couple of things that stand out here Perry you look at the scoring Huntley Hatfield and Withers combined for 11 points the bad news not much from everyone else no and you have to have balance and with that Ellis has to contribute with those two guys now all of a sudden youve got a potent offensive attack Miami on the other hand has had really balance scoring and thats the difference being able to integrate your scores L Ellis is the leading scorer for this Louisville team averaging just a tick under 17 points per game he has not been a factor thus far offensively thats a big problem theyre passing the ball too far outside they got real bad angles trying to feed the post now lets catch the penetrate hes got to get the ball inside the top of the key and then make the pass into the post area or the low post area theyre starting their offense out around half court and thats too far and thats too extended Joseph is doing a really good job pressuring the ball and keeping the ball out there they struggle taking care of the basketball obviously theyre also one of the most inexperienced teams in college basketball how much does that play into it well it plays a lot but as the season goes on you pick up certain things and I mean the coaches are in the film room with these guys and theyre making them understand and understand this coaching staff you talk about Winners you talk about Kenny Payne you talk about Danny Manning uh you know you talk about guys that have won know the richest has really done a great job teaching these young guys how to play seven turnovers so far for the Cardinals that three Off the Mark by Kamari lands I was saying Nola Nolan Smith I meant to say but I mean all these guys that come from winning the situations they won national championships and so the teaching is there its an understanding of what they have to do to to be successful and a lot of it has to do offensively as far as getting into an offensive flow and getting easy shots and not turning the ball over so much success at every level on that bench Music you know theyre just itching to get this thing turned around for Louisville and they will Joseph trying to pick his way through the Cardinals defense down low shot on the way trickling in from Anthony Walker so Walkers given Jim larranega a little bit boost off the bench its an 11 point lead well one of the things my that coach leonega has done is starting to integrate his rotation and getting guys in the rotation that can help them as they go deeper into the ACC season the floater by L Ellis is in and hes on the board for the first time today thats the perfect shot for him the difference in that possession in the previous possession the ball that got into the paint and Ellis is quick enough and handles the ball well enough to be able to take the ball wherever he wants it to be on the floor three from the corner that missing out of the hands offensively Joseph and a rebound controlled by the Cardinals Ellis now Mike James going for the ride Ellis elbow J and a rebound take it away by AJ Casey of the hurricanes Applause Casey to make the bucket AJ Casey Off the Bench and again Miami coming up with different offensive answers so far in this first half so Casey has contributed Anthony Walker contributing as well leading to an 11 Point Advantage Ellis draws him in with the kick out the wing three that may have been deflected but missed everything nonetheless this Miami team will have a lot of weapons and the way they play they utilize their weapons real well because they pass the ball they all can put the ball on the floor theyre very skilled and the system that they run with the dribble we use the ball screens allowed them to get the spacing that they want so guys can be able to take advantage of their skill sets and whether or not its Casey or guys that come in off Joseph and guys Walker that come in Off the Bench theyre able to play in a flow to their abilities and potentials Isaiah Wong back in after leaving due to that injury earlier on in the game and the threepointer is in courtesy of Jalen Withers cuts it to an eightpoint game at 2416 lets see if Louisville can power through some adversity theyve faced a lot of that obviously and Owen seven this season Juan stumbling lost the ball and he went out of bounds Isaiah Wong is a model when he wants to get to the basket it doesnt matter whos there hes one of the best in the country of being able to penetrate the paint and get the ball to the basket and he does a great job of creating for the other guys because hes unselfish and he can kick it or he can finish eight and a half minutes left to go first half eight point lead for the hurricanes ACC opener for the Cardinals and the Hurricanes the flip by Ellis no good on a long board the big Poplar stripped out of bounds and it will stay with Miami so some quick hands there on the other end but again that was great action that time by Louisville uh Ellis had a really good look just missed the shot but then they didnt get back as well as they should have been transitioned Juan catch it shoot got it long long Isaiah Wong extending the lead back out to double figures at 10 one of four Miami players this season averaging double figures Applause into the corner Withers again short this time home here with a board Nigel pack trying to find omir down low at that ball knocked away from him a strong and another turnover committed by the Hurricanes fires out and a 10point lead to Louisville their offense creates easy opportunities for their opponents you see Miami right there on the run out off of Steel they get an easy basket the next time down they the ball around they get a steal run out and Miamis able to score without in transition the next time down again turn over they kick the ball out Miami pushes it and winds up getting a three out of it and so Louisvilles defense is not that bad but they dont get a chance to set it up because their offense puts them in a transition situation and they wind up giving up easy baskets and thats the difference in this ball game and underline that phrase easy baskets Miami in the first half so far shooting 68 percent from the field and another mistake pack ahead of the pack plays it in largest lead of the game for the Hurricanes at 12 you know its awful hard to come up with a game plan and to prepare when you have turnovers like that that just give teams easy opportunities Ellis tries to drive outside now the Baseline attack lost the ball the fans and the KFC Yum Center Restless and Wong gets fouled I mean how much of this is affecting the offensive side too because youre starting to press now that youre down by 12 well what it does is I think it affects you defensively because you give up easy baskets and people think your defense is not very good when the Louisville half court defense is really not bad I mean theyve done a really good job of eliminating penetration um but they have to do a better job in transition and then all of a sudden Miami gets into Rhythm and like I said Miami has a lot of skilled players and they space the floor real well and so they use their split spacing to get dribble drives and to get threepoint shots Fabio basili and he picked up that foul in the last Miami possession tries a three here short and Poplar with the loose ball as Miami will try to build upon a 70 run eight different hurricanes have scored in this game you know Ive mentioned something to coach leonaga before the game this Miami team they really like each other I mean and they really share the ball real well they like playing with each other and you can see it in their play Wong that time knocked down that three and hes such a complete guard Withers gets to the rim gets fouled and thats been one of the few areas Louisville has been able to thrive at and thats getting to the freethrow line on attacks and I think they have to increase that even more because when youre not scoring youre going the laws you have to find a way to manufacture points and whats a better way of doing that than going to the foul line a couple of times on drives theyve driven the ball got the ball in the paint and they kicked it and wound up with a three where I think maybe they can challenge because Miami really doesnt have a shot block weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social just might see it on acc Network Miami giving their fans plenty to be happy about so far with a 16 point lead here in the ACC open Logan gone to a Zone which they do sometimes its a 23 but the Wings come up high Poplar from Deep tipped outside by Omer it will go over to Louisville against that uh 23 Miamis just going to space it the way they do because really outside of Omar everybody else can shoot threes so theyll kind of space it and play it almost like a man and either take the three or look the driving Lanes drought continues for the Cardinals coaching four minutes without a field goal the silly now the feed to Huntley Hatfield Applause shot clock under 10 and another turnover Applause 10 turnovers for the Cardinals as Juan goes in lost the ball had it knocked away from him by Withers the silly wide open for three missed it Poplar with a loose ball this is a Louisville team that averages 16 turnovers per game its going to be tough against this Miami team if they dont take better care of the basketball down low and once again or Chad omear going glass for two omearas so tough in that low post and Miami utilizes him so well like I said this this group of Miami they play well together they like each other they share the ball they know where guys like to get the ball and they give them the ball in the areas in which they can score Premier inner the leading scorer and you guessed it another steal Applause in the lane Miller cant get it to go and the rebound controlled by Withers facility leaning in tough shot cant get it and Poplar battling for the loose ball and certainly Miami coming into this game we talked about maybe the rebounding situation being an issue for them not so far in this game well its mainly because of the shot selection of Louisville I dont know when Louisville has had a clean look at the basket long short on a three every shot that Louisville has taken so far has been challenged which means that its either a bad shot or a quick shot James will try it and lays it in so Mike James finally gets something going and hes another one of their top players offensively that has been quiet in this first half Applause James averaging seven points per game he along with L Ellis got to find a way to cut into this deficit Miller with a jumper off the mark of the silly board in the lane Withers the kick open three no good see that time I thought Withers could have got all the way to the rim when he kicked the ball back out because nobody actually challenged him at the basket Nigel pack rattles out the rebound for Round by James James with steam leans in and draws the foul popper one of the first hurricanes there 16 point lead for the Miami Hurricanes more from Kentucky stay tuned Im the captain of the peewee football team we may be small but we are stamped leading it by 16 Derek Jones and Perry Clark with you from the KFC Yum Center and the hurricane scoring very balanced to start eight different players at school thats Miamis Secret Sauce their balance and as long as they get that keep that balance and coach laronega has done a tremendous job with this chemistry there will be an awfully tough out because they can come at you a lot of different ways and the fact that chemistry is so good right now he can come off the bench but Joseph which gives them another dimension and they can go with the three guards uh their skill level their ability to space the floor and shoot makes them awful difficult foul picked up by wuga Poplar is James no good on the first freethrow attempt talking about the Hurricanes this is one of the few programs in the country that did not really have anyone transfer out of the program who leaves Miami Laughter thats two I mean but but I mean the school the culture uh the cochlear neighbor has created and give the staff a lot of credit because theyve identified guys because hes tired guys that know him and know his personality and they they put in guys that fit and thats why theyve been able to continue their success up by 15 here after one out of two heck they fired me I still stay four more years at the Duck Down Low by North Chad omir whos having himself a first half as the lead balloons of 17 and this unfortunately for Louisville has been a part of their DNA this season see theyre trying to feed the post from above the top of the key thats a bad angle to feed the post Ellis gets rejected by omir and another possession for the hurricanes with Elliss size he cant get too deep hes got to make a decision what hes going to do with the ball around the top for the key or the minute he gets into the paint Joseph Fade Away Jay short and right there on the spot is Jordan Miller to clean it up Miller is a really capable play he does a little bit of everything for Miami he can play all five positions because he had at some point in time and I think hes really one of the key plots to this Miami attack one minute left to go in the half James in the corner down low up with the righthanded shot Huntley Hatfield that doesnt go and Juan out of the pack with it for the hurricanes Music this has gone pretty much according to plan for Miami in the first 20 oh man will crash in hooks it with the right hand off the glass door Chad omir once again teams in the ACC better get used to this young man hes really crafty hes very deceptive because it doesnt look overpowering but his knowledge of the game and the veracity in which he plays makes him a real Force the Sun Belt Player of the Year absolutely having his way with Louisville in this first half and see that move right there was the first time a Louisville player packed the basket and actually tried to finish in the past when they have attacked they tried to kick it for a three when you attack you wind up getting an easy basket and that makes life easy being the best takes hard work in the world keep promises 4223 lead for the Hurricanes as Kenny Payne trying to do a lot of teaching so far through the first seven and a half games well let me tell you something KP is loved in the basketball world theyre going to get good players they will force this past year to have to deal with possible NCAA sanctions and everything so it was hard to get guys through the portal not knowing what would wind up happening the drop to pack three to shoot lets it go no good and that closes out the first half Miami dominating Louisville in the first 20 Jordan Miller of course no door Chad omir having a successful first half of the hurricanes yeah I mean this was typical Miami basketball sharing the basketball creating offense off their defense a great first half for Miami its really nice to be 21 I tell you what thats thats a big surprise thank you very very much but you know right now what Louisville really needs to do is I think go back to trying to get the ball inside they still have time they dont have to chase threes right now they can just move the ball really good shots and thats what it looks like theyre trying to do whether or not theyre posting up weathers or um Hunley or um whatever they really need to go and get the ball inside so a foul committed by Miami right off the bat Olga Poplar picking up his third foul yeah I thought they got a lot of good play off of Hatfield posting him inside trying to get the ball to Curry and a turnover as James steps out of bounds on the far Baseline 12 turnovers what do you think of this cake I mean its National it is National cookie day and it is a cookie cake so thats pretty impressive and you know the way I like sweets so I mean this is just like this is tough I dont know if this will make this back to South Carolina Laughter the jumper by Wong no good its the 21st birthday stay out of trouble Ellis and that ball sails out of bounds but there was a foul first committed by nor Chad omear number one on OMeara and I think thats what they have to try to do I think that was the game plan early try to get go Adam here get him in some foul trouble because if he never does get in foul trouble it really does change what Miami likes to do Withers with a drive the flipping will score Jalen Withers trying to get this Louisville offense going he was one of the few Cardinals who was able to contribute offensively in the first half hes got 12 omir a monster in the first half of the Hurricanes Poplar back to omir hook shot right hand short loose and omir keeps him alive the jumper by pack is good and that perhaps symbolic of Louisville season thus far without question but I told you uh omir is so much energy in that little pose hes so fierce in fighting for his position the ACC is going to learn very quickly that he is a force in that low post area James is able to draw the foul and thats number two on omir but at least now you can see a pattern what Kentuckys trying to do theyre really trying to get the ball to the front of the rim theyre really trying to throw the ball inside and I think if they can continue to work on that and thats one of the things coach Payne talked about continuing to work and get better in certain areas omir one of the key Acquisitions so to speak for Miami in the off season for scholarship athlete from Nicaragua and the way hes playing theres going to be a lot of scouts over there trying to kill somebody else oh yeah 17point lead here for the Hurricanes the object is by by about the 12minute mark getting to about 10 pack room for a three missed it and Withers with a rebound Ellis again Ellis has been very quiet in this game offensively but he picks his dribble up too high hes got to get deeper on the court to be able to make his entry patches to the post easier and to put more pressure on the defense thats number two against Sydney Curry off the offensive foul and another turnover for the Cardinals 13 turnovers today Miami capitalizing Again Louisville averaging 16 turnovers a game and that ball able to stay with Miami as it heads out of bounds the Louisville defense is pretty good their half court defense is not bad the problem is they dont get a chance to utilize it as much as they would like back now quick catch and score by Jordan Miller so good passing there by the Hurricanes whenever the ball goes into a mirror hes always has Cutters nobody just stands and watches oh a dunk attempt there by Huntley Hatfield but a wedgie forcing the jump ball and the Miami possession well Huntley Hadley had really been a Focus right now for This Global team trying to get him going I think thats why Currys in the starting lineup to allow them to utilize him more so in the low post scoop shot by pack missing slap to back outside by omir omir was one on four at that time and he still was able to control the offensive rebound Poplar with the fake and the flyby by Withers leading to a foul thats the first on Jalen Withers so Withers and Company still having a hard time here corralling this Miami offense as Poplar set to go to the freethrow line the Philadelphia native at the stripe Applause heres Wednesdays featured womens basketball game right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Elizabeth kitley in number nine Virginia Tech in Chestnut Hill taking on a very balanced Boston College team its the first ACC matchup for both teams our coverage begins at six Eastern lets go its Poplar able to extend the lead out to 19 at 4627 you see where Ellis is operating from hes too high yeah thats thats its you dont have passing Lanes you got a shorten passing Lanes you cant get the ball to the elbow and you force your coach to call the timeout because the you cant ever get into a offensive operating position where you can really score the Cardinals talking it over down by 19 hymns help Derek Jones and Perry Clark with you from Louisville Kentucky it is a 4827 lead for the Miami Hurricanes as he always enjoy seeing those mascots fire away those tshirts have you ever been able to fire off one of those things before if you ever used one no never I in fact even when Im in the stands when they start firing I I try to go the other way yeah I dont want any part of that thats I leave it to the pros Ellis in a lane the runner in airball but stays with Louisville because its last Touch by the Hurricanes 21 point lead for Miami ACC opener for Louisville and Miami and and talking to coach larenega Perry before the game he mentioned you know this is a new season for everybody so those first seven games for Louisville go out the window as the three by James leads to a new possession for Louisville he felt it was a new kind of season and thats kind of what weve seen at least on the side of his team well it is but you have to get away from the habits the bad habits and it gives you a chance to now start to do good habits and really take advantage of your players in your system Withers cant hit on the three the woes shooting a rock continue for Louisville thats been another problem for them this season coming in shooting just 38 percent from the field and as you can see there shooting the three today not great Miller for three rattles out Applause Louisville gets no easy baskets I dont remember them getting a run out all day today as far as a fast break Corner three thats no good from James the rebound taken once again by the hurricanes and Jordan Miller Wong is fouled along the Baseline and the Hurricanes will set up shop after the second foul by Jalen Withers in a moment Jim larenega part of the history of Miami basketball but weve got another person in here who also knows a thing or two about Miami basketball you guys keep pulling these surprises on me today this is the last one I promise this is it uh what do you remember about that time oh it was a very special time it was a transition uh we had a we had good teams I took over for Leonard Hamilton who just went for the Wizards uh it was a transitional period the Big East that we were in at that time was really good they were sending six teams to the NCAA tournament but uh the folks at Miami um just tremendous people and uh you know James Jones one of my players then is now president of the Phoenix Suns and so um it was a good it was a good time in my life he had a very notable NBA career for sure as Miller and the Hurricanes back to it shot clock under 10 pack will try it from deep and hit this Miami team offensively I mean they really execute extremely well and now they put Joseph in the game and when hes in the game its full court pressure he only knows one speed in which to play and hes gonna really get after you and if Ellis has had a tough day so far its just gotten tougher because Joseph is really going to work in bringing the ball up the court so Joseph picks up the infraction there thats his first foul in the lane blocked at The Rim tipped around and grabbed eventually by Miami good defensive stop there by AJ Casey on Huntley Hatfield and that was great offensive execution that time by Louisville thats exactly what they need to play to do they got a seal they had an easy shot they just missed it I think when you look at a team like Louisville and theyre talented players on this roster theres no question about that but the confidence as as coach Payne tries to sift through this season how do you keep these guys confident and attacking that thats a tough thing for coaching staff to do coach Payne was just looking at LSU shot and if you see in the face he just made uh you know because you dont realize youve got to build them up youve got to try to help them through and so thats been really really difficult there you see Wong and he does what he does really well he attacks the basket and hes able to finish hes got such a strong upper body and it may not look at it physically but he really always is able to get the ball to the rim he plays with such a pace and a passion where hes always in control threepoint play for Isaiah Wong another run by the Hurricanes 10 straight long with eight the Cardinals getting doubled up by the hurricanes but you know you were talking back about Coach Payne hes the right guy for the job hes won every place hes been and hes the guy that has the emotional and the knowledge to be able to help them through this period long after the turnover for three no good and knocked out of bounds itll stay with Miami but you see a couple of things in that last possession Miamis so good at help defense and then trying to transition that into offense yeah you know this Miami team may not be the type of team thats good for Louisville to play right now because of their pressure because of their transition offense and the skill level in which they play with they can take advantage of a lot of mistakes and theyve got veteran guys handling the basketball and as I say that they just turn it over uh it looked like pack for the knee there but I mean this Miami team is so skilled with that and right now the things that hurt Louisville is pressure transition offense and so those are the things that Miami really thrives on first foul against Anthony Walker as Jim lernega has to be pretty pleased with what hes seen from his team so far up 27 you know and see this is what happened Ellis is struggling so they take him out and Coach Manning is talking to him on the bench trying to clean up some things but they really dont have anybody to take his place and so youre kind of forced with trying to teach as you play and thats a very difficult thing any coach will tell you to be able to do Walker tried to keep it alive after a good flurry of activity from him its basily though for the Cardinals and a turnover once again for Louisville but silly is a young man that a lot of people are very high on the coaching staff is very high on but they dont think hes there yet and they dont they arent trying to put him in the situation where he may lose some confidence and so they want to bring him along slowly but they dont have that luxury right now to be able to do that you know its its a really a balance as a coach to be able to get on players to motivate the players and yet not take away their confidence because once you lose your confidence and stop believing in your abilities in in yourself you got all these other people trying to attack you its awful hard to perform Applause one corner three no good nearly kept Alive by Casey back over to Louisville and in this game they have not been able to really sustain any runs to kind of cut into this deficit no you know when I came to Georgia Tech Bobby crimmage in his first year at Georgia Tech won three conference games you know and I came there they had bags over their heads and and it was tough but by the time we left by the time I left we were preseason number one in the country and so what Im saying to you is I know with Coach Payne and his staff are capable of doing this city of Louisville is a basketball Haven uh many nights I walk in here and had to face Denny krom and his two policemen that always used to walk around with them all the time and uh and this Louisville program is in good hands and with this fan base theyre going to be back shot clock to five and a steal off the silly its Juan Off to the Races and throws it down Applause 12 straight for the Hurricanes largest lead of the night turnaround shot Off the Mark once again a rebound by the Hurricanes but Vasily steps in to make the Steal three on two floating in and scoring is Kamari Lance these fans are just waiting for something to cheer about you know this place is explosive and Im just telling you theres no City that loves basketball more than Louisville Kentucky first points for Louisville since the 1835 Mark flipped up in hand on the other side by AJ Casey once again the Cardinals looking to sustain some kind of run as Roosevelt wheeler getting some Run for the first time today cant hit that shot Joseph back down the floor arches went off the glass A little bit too strong Applause James flying in James looked like that shot may have caught the support underneath three on one the lob and the Throwdown by AJ Casey will Usher us into a timeout Miami up big and guys here game day is every day our uh its V week at ESPN when we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is game changing research that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research and Jim Valvano an iconic figure in college basketball his brother Bob is working radio for Louisville here today what a great basketball family it was and Bob would tell you he was always the better looking one of the family but uh yeah I coasted to Matha high school and had Sydney Lowe and Derek Wittenberg who won the National Championship with Coach V and so I got the I knew coach V before but his passion and his belief of life and how he just made everybody around him better and feel better is very very special and thats why the V week has become so special for those that have known him and remember those times offensive foul will go the other way after the drive by AJ Casey again to donate vorg donate you know Dad he was so unselfish I mean you know nobody you couldnt just you know dislike him I mean you know it was competitiveness in the ACC and trying to beat people and recruiting and everything but V made everything light and funny and it was never personal and his care about the game and people was the thing that made it so special you know I still talked to Derek Wittenberg and uh you know and so its just the vweek is just a very special time and of course its the 40th anniversary of that National Championship team that shocked Houston he is only Hatfield able to drop that one in cut it to a 6031 game as we approach the Midway point here in this second half the layup is in from Harlan Beverly so Beverly on the move and hell get a chance at a threepoint play this is one of the things that they like with Beverly whos ability to put the ball down and really attack it and he fits in with how Miami plays because with the spacing he normally has room to be able to attack the basket straight in second block so Beverly out of Detroit Michigan getting an opportunity here and converting upon the threepoint play 6331 lead for Miami and when you look at the numbers of this game so far Miami has been pretty much on schedule averaging 73 points per game theyre 63 theyre going to get you would have to think very close to that number and then some Huntley Hatfield cant convert kept alive to Ellis and a foul committed there by Beverly thats his first but again I think thats a good sign for Louisville attacking the offensive glass and I think thats something that they can continue to work on that will help them win games in the future oneonone situation after the foul committed by Beverly so Ellis at the strike knocks down the first free throw just the third point for Ellis and Ellis coming in averaging just under 17 points per game but today it has been a rough outing off the miss The Possession for the Hurricanes leading at 6332 and the ACC opener fed down low Baseline and a turnover committed there is Christian Watson stepping out of bounds and now limping he makes his way back down the floor you know the history of this league successful teams have always had good guard play good point guard play I learned that at Georgia Tech I talked about being there with Bobby he went and got Mark Price and all of a sudden life changed then he went and got stuff on Marlboro life changed then he got Kenny Anderson life changed again so the guard play really is important in the success in the ACC Applause Ellis with six to shoot Ellis trying to wheel and deal misses the jumper rebound grab by Walker but a foul against the hurricanes and favor iray whos into the game for the first time thats his first you know its nice to be able to get playing time for guys in meaningful situations so that you can get your bench better because as you go through this tough stretch which is the ACC schedule youre going to need guys to come in Off the Bench and really help well no question about that you look at the upcoming schedule for Miami and theyre going to dip in and out of of nonacc games but youve got Virginia on the horizon youve got back to back road games against Notre Dame and Georgia Tech so no question depth always a big piece in being able to survive the Perils of the ACC oh so Brandon Huntley hatchfield the Tennessee transfer with 10 hes been out hes been about the only bright spot right now for Louisville today I think hes stepped up I think that theyve tried to go to him and hes responded shot clock to five for Joseph hell launch a three that catches the front of the rim gets back his own Miss thats frustrating Applause certainly coach Payne wearing that frustration here today watching his team struggle Watson three is in Christian Watson hits a threepointer in the lead at 6634 feed and eventually goes back over to Withers but he steps out of bounds there you see penetrate kick winds up getting a wide open three I you know thats Miami offense I mean they just do a really good job of spacing I dont think people remember coach laronega was an assistant at Virginia with Ralph Sampson and all those great Ralph Sampson years and teams so he learned a lot about this league he learned a lot about how to play with staging and good players and hes just carried that over as a head coach still by lands and lands will go to the line Applause and a double bonus situation from here on out for Louisville s half court defense is not that bad I mean but again if they can just limit the opponent and make them have to go against their half court defense every possession of a high percentage of time they will be successful a lot of Miamis points have come off of runouts and transition type baskets and that makes it awful hard to defend 30point lead for the Hurricanes that scoring balance 10 of the 11 available players have scored near stale but maintain now it is stolen the feed Miller blocked at the rim and thats going to be a goaltending call and the Cardinals get a bucket more in a moment thats why I tell you coach Payne hey I know this has been a tough start but there have been some other guys that have had made a tremendous impact in this league that came off their first year with tough starts Bobby crimmins Leonard Hamilton in the great Coach K you know and so The Best Is Yet To Come indeed in coach Payne has the ability to put this program back on the map and just like these guys have done in those respective schools you know hes sitting right next to a legend one of the alltime winners of college in college basketball and Danny Manning uh you talk about Nolan Smith so you know the best of Louisville basketball is ahead of them in this environment there is just so special and these fans here love the basketball so much that they want the cards to be right back in the mainstream of college basketball Ira beautifully done and its a good point you know you look at some of those names and obviously historical names takes time get a program back on track and the one thing about having this fan base is youre sure fans are going to want to win but it is going to take some time well and heres the other thing environment here Louisville has always been the fans have always made the Louisville players play well because when they dont they hear about it yes you know and so they hear about it in the grocery store they hear about it at the super at at the shopping center they hear about it in the clubs they hear about it and so one of the things coach Payne has tried to do is be positive with these guys because I know he knows that theyre hearing about it out in the community and so hes trying to nurture that and show how much he loves them and and bring them along and so thats part of the growing process oh I rate bumps James and thats going to be number two on Iraq and after a game like this shooting 29 they might uh they might hear a word or two I saw the great Jerry Eaves back in the media room and uh you talk about some of the names that have come out of here uh Daryl Griffin who was an unbelievable player I mean he was a showstopper he dropped the mic when Daryl Griffin walked in the roof I mean and you know purpose Ellison I mean and it goes on and on and on and so you know the names and the people that have played here and the success of this program you know Danny Crum and I coached against him was amazing I mean he just go to the Statue and he would never be philosophical he said well if we only shoot 30 were going to lose every game if we can only get uh 15 rebounds we dont lose every game and so you know this this institution in this area has produced so many really outstanding players and this fan base has been so great for college basketball I so favor iray draws the foul from Brandon Huntley Hatfield and hell go to the stripe to try to finish off the threepoint play and they really like Ira I mean they think his size they talk about the rebounding that concerns them some if this young man can come on you know it just presents a whole different Dynamic and look theres no doubt theres a lot of pressure on norchad omir to produce in terms of rebounding which is what he was brought in to do without a doubt is Huntley Hatfield gets stripped on the way up track down by Poplar Miami youd have to thank for them to have thoughts of getting back to where they were last year and Poplar under duress gives it up Miller he gets raked and hes you know you no calls sister let him play and Ill stay with Louisville and we have a great officiating crew these are final four officials but one of the things that I know coach larneck is he goes over and hes talking to his bench you know is about handling pressure and and even though they walk out of here with a win today hes really going to go over that because teams are going to see the film and theyre going to all of a sudden feel like maybe we can put some more pressure on them lands missing the three the run out for Pat pack lobs it up and a turnover Ellis trying to run they lob it the other way to throw it down but JJ trainer just to kind of clean up that point about omir youd have to think theyre going to need some low post presence besides omir to really put a dent in potentially some issues in rebounding yes but again I I think Miller and popular are athletic enough and in the spacing of the floor they can Rebound in space and so I think that that will negate us some there you see in transition thats the easy basket that might be the easiest basket Louisvilles been able to score today and you know if youre going to be successful being able to manufacture easy baskets is a major part of that easy baskets we havent mentioned that in Louisville a lot today theyve struggled really picking those up yes and again um coaching staff theyll get back theyll break down film they start doing drills I know I talked to Coach Payne about a drill that they talk about doing where you have to make eight passes without a turnover and then you have to try to execute your offense and theyre starting to do that and work on that again hes got some answers he understands the problem hes got some answers for some of the problems that this team faces bucket for Poplar to extend the lead to 7244 lands throws it up and throws it in Kamari lands a high degree of difficulty in that shot a difficult shot into the corner the runner by Watson is in Christian Watson the Maryland native hes a young man that they hope can really step up and again help them hes another young man that plays well in space ball handles the ball extremely well attacks the basket off the dribble they think hes got a chance to be a pretty good perimeter Defender for this team as James off to miss able to retrieve Ellis the kick open three by trainer missed it Ellis gets it back layup is no good trainer down low battling lost the ball the flip thats no good from wheeler oh boy thats bad for Louisville but its bad for Miami to give up all those offensive rebounds because that goes to what we talked about earlier their inability to rebound the basketball they gave up 19 offensive rebounds in the win against Rutgers but here up by 30 against Louisville Music annual selection Day special a onehour show thatll include breakdowns and Analysis of the accs pole bound teams and their matchups our coverage starts at nine Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app lots to be excited about regarding bull season whos you for uh well obviously Georgia Michigan I cant leave TCU out oh so the four have been named so it is going to be Georgia Michigan Ohio State and TCU Ellis with the drive and a foul thats what they were looking for Ellis to do earlier in the game and not settle you know early in the game he was playing around half court and defensively thats where you try to get your point guards to play and try to initiate often hes got to get the ball deeper if they pressure him hes got to have the ability to blow by people under control make the next pass or finish at The Rim free throw by Ellis is in Miami looking to hold Louisville under 30 percent for the game and its if theyre able to do that be a little bit of a historical Mark for Miami they havent held an opposition under 30 percent shooting in over five years Joseph to the post dry Ray irate hook shot right hand lift out rebound taken by homely Hatfield under three minutes left to go from Louisville and that ball goes out of bounds again another turnover number 19 for the Cardinals average 16 coming in you know if the big guy is going to come over and do what we call trap the box then whoever he is God he needs to go to the front of the rim so the guard can drop the ball off to him and he will wind up getting the layup foreign Joseph setting up shop here with nearly two and a half minutes left to go Watson down low missed the layup Ira battling gets an offensive rebound lost it though Devin re into the game for the Cardinals lands firing away from the wing knocks down the threepointer 7651 without a good shot put a tough shot Applause Watson on the attack Baseline Drive missed the layup tipped by Ira out of bounds Louisville ball Ray did a really good job of sealing the big so Watson had a wide open drive that time just missed it Zan Payne will toss in the basketball here hes the son of Louisville head coach Kenny Payne transferred from Kentucky I can tell you no one wants to get this Louisville team back and get them to win than the coaches I mean theyre thinking about what to do how to do it 24 7 it just its constantly on your mind can we make that of what group should we play more what defense we should run What offense we should go and its just a constant thing the process to kind of refresh and reset will begin again as Joseph tries a three missed it tipped around in irate with a loose ball and iray gets fouled so irate again you can kind of see that that game potentially being able to help the Hurricanes down the line here oh without question his size and hes got offensive moves around the basket uses his body well um he posts up deep which is a really big thing for a big guy to be able to get deep post position hi Ray sinks the free throw number four wheeler back here philippos gogos into the game for the first time today for the hurricanes as irae will try another one here and knocks it down 7853 lead for the Hurricanes as we approach one minute left to go from Louisville hook shot right hand trickles out from wheeler and a rebound by the hurricanes worst start for Louisville since 1941 itll be a ninth straight loss tailing back to last season as Watson tries a three the silly on the move 35 seconds left as Lance will try it missed it and a Watson board for Miami Watson this Miami team is very is really good theyre going to challenge in the ACC this year preseason number four in the ACC well see one of the teams above them coming up on the ACC Network at the top of the hour with North Carolina taking on a team you and I saw in Virginia Tech thats going to be a heck of a ball game you talk about really good guard play that Virginia Tech team has a lot of swagger I mean theyve got a lot of confidence and Coach young does a tremendous job in his preparation thats going to be a heck of a game you know its one of those games thats really going to matter in March and theyre playing it in December and so but its really going to be a significant game in the in the ACC race Jay alter and Randolph Childress on the call for that one as Carolina tries to turn things around the slide for them has caused some stress in Carolina Country theyll be fine Miami
