people talk about when they play that zone of theirs but theyve become a very good mantoman team Applause theyve done a lot more of it recently as well as we check out the starters for the yellow jackets and man how many times did we hear josh pastner say the word guards when we spoke with him this morning when you get two of the best around youre going to talk about your guards theyre hoping to get mike devoe going here he is zero in blue working on hemingway with the shot clock winding down thats a tough one for devoe and a good start for him and thats a really good sign for georgia tech devoe he shoots the ball very well from three but i think he can be really good in that lane area theres that ability to fall away and shoot that little jump shot junior from orlando who averages 13 and a half points per game for the yellow jackets honor throws it down low for sims who got the roll he got the roll to bounce everything else i thought honor waited a little bit too long but sims with a nice catch and finish heres the always well caffeinated jordan usher who spun away and couldnt hit it and each of these teams is going to be looking to get back on defense you do not want to give up any easy baskets oh good recovery by usher and then alex hemingway had a hard ball still feeling it he wasnt able to break that fall at all and you talked about jordan usher he is definitely an energy guy he is go go go this is really a nice play he really tracks his man really effectively you know lots of times you commit a foul there but he tracks him and you know hemingway actually hung on the rim thats what his problem was glad hes okay though yeah he reached out for something there to break the fall as sims misses the shot slow start offensively for clemson here is jose alvarado with it one of the best point guards in the entire country Applause good denial by clemson defensively on the back door bid traffic is an outstanding defender and he knocked that one away when you talk about it standing defenders alvarado is all over honor honor got by him though to the cup to tie us up at four Applause well honor you can just look at him hes five feet ten but he weighs 205 pounds and he just used his physical presence to get past alvarado that wasnt quickness that was just physical power farm looking for somewhere to go jordan ushers got to get back in bounds yeah whats huncher doing ushers spinning and scoring as he did get back in bounds well he stood there on the c for the longest time and parhams looking at him telling him hey get back in bounds so i can throw you the ball theres chatting up the officials devoe took it away from hunter tyson Applause Music and a foul on the floor on the devoe Applause drivers sean thank you we welcome you to littlejohn coliseum we are four minutes into an excellent game a special edition some friday night hoops here in south carolina georgia tech and clemson two teams in the top half of the acc a really important game dan bonner mike monaco our entire crew with you slow offensive start in this one dan as both teams feeling each other out well not really surprising clemsons an outstanding defensive team but theres michael devoe thats two tough baskets early and that is a great sign for georgia tech he really struggled offensively against virginia yeah he only had two points hes got four already that was an eight point loss on wednesday for georgia tech to the number nine team in the country as amir sims had it pried away and the ball belongs to georgia tech snow down here last weekend made for some beautiful sights as we welcome you back to littlejohn coliseum second meeting between these teams in the last month this was the first dan bonder georgia tech hit 16 threes in that ball game yeah he hit 16 threes youre generally going to have success each team shot the ball pretty well but the clemson tigers they turned it over 20 time and josh pastners guys were able to turn those 20 turnovers into 30 points and that was decisive now josh there i really think that thats classic hes wearing that face shield and thank heavens that its labeled face shield so we know what it is you know had that it not that label not been on there i thought it would have been you know like a pair of vice grips or something so thank goodness we know its a face shield its kind of like the the john belushi college sweatshirt in animal house like its just aptly labeled for josh pastner rocking that all season for georgia tech theyre up by four here on the road in the first five minutes at clemson Applause dan i know you were looking to key in on this matchup that was moses wright spinning against amir sims and now its devoe on the drive and right on the follow of the things that clemson has to do is to keep georgia tech out of the lane because when they can get penetration sims has to come and help and moses wright does a great job following the ball and tracking it to the basket for an offensive rebound Music sims trying to stretch right out and sims knocks it down the senior from virginia who averages 12 and a half a game and hit 1 000 for his career in the win saturday against syracuse thats a big basket for clemson in fact in acc play theres only three people on the team that are shooting better than 30 percent from beyond the threepoint arc and sims isnt one of them Applause and thats it hes walled up yeah moses wright in the paint you mentioned the threepoint shooting for clemson the last two games coming in theyve looked a lot like the team they were earlier this season as they turn it over there but theyve shot it well the last two games in the wins against north carolina and then the syracuse victory last weekend Applause sims picks up the foul and heres what happens when right down when devoe drives to the baskets hes surrounded by white shirts but nobodys paying any tension any attention to moses wright who slips in and gets the easy follow bubba parham off the baseline out of bounds from jordan usher Music yeah parham is generously listed at 5 ft 10 but he slipped inside he only had one point in the first meeting that we showed you between these two teams but he took about four or five charges he kept taking him in the second half he had a really big impact on that game even without scoring thats good hands by moses wright he knocked the ball away and four sims another four feet from the basket and he paid for that four feet thats great defense poked it away then he got the block and causing trouble for amir sims early on this is what youre talking about mike that clemson started the season very very well and then they had that threegame losing streak where they that was coming out of their covid paws where they got blasted but there you can see in three of the last four games theyve won and theyve done it with their defense and brad brown now knows that his team is no offensive juggernaut but they can guard the heck out of here and thats what they need to do and right away and on cue they force a jose alvarado turnover Applause georgia tech would like to push it because they dont want to let that clemson defense get set were talking about the clemson defense coming into the weekend they ranked 12th in the country according to kenpom an adjusted defensive efficiency just one of the very best defensive groups in the entire country Applause trap gave it up and theres another one from the outside that drops and this time its olivier maxsense prosper just his third three of the season for the freshman from montreal yeah and coming into the game he was one for nine in acc play from beyond the three point on and then trap foul the threepoint shooter and parham at the other end of the floor hey tomorrow to eastern its boston college in syracuse right here on accn and the espn app syracuse coming off a tuesday victory over nc state got 22 from alan griffin in that one then we said it right when we came on the air this is a matchup between two teams in the top half of the acc and a really big one for georgia tech because this would be a quad one victory for the yellow jackets as they sit at five and five in the acc and then for clemson they want to continue the success that they had last week against carolina and queues matt clemson theyre sitting a little bit better because they have some big early season wins and georgia tech doesnt have that georgia tech lost those two games early in the season one to georgia state and the other to mercer and so that has really hurt them so again you said theyre looking for a quad one win and this would be that would be such a win and that would be very very beneficial to the yellow jackets on the outside looking in right now in the ncaa tournament picture according to joey brackets whos got clemson as of his latest update today as an eight seed taken away from alamere dawes and heres devoe with the handle and nearly the finish as well he will go to the free throw line its much harder to play defense when youre chasing the guys and youre looking at the names on the back of their jerseys rather than the team name on the front of the jerseys and that was the problem for the clemson tigers in the first game we said they had 20 turnovers already in tonights game they have six Applause and so what would you like to see from them dan against georgia tech theres so much talk about georgia techs changing defenses and sometimes how hard it is to to figure out exactly what defense the yellow jackets are in well theyve been in mantoman this entire game so there hasnt been any mystery clemson needs to do a better job moving the ball and moving personnel the ball the ball is sticking in peoples hands and theres another turnover and in transition devoe left it short Music he has been very active early on for georgia tech feeling good in the early going alvarado cant get it to go and a good battle on the boards and then last touched by clyde trap good effort from rodney howard getting some first half minutes georgia tech leading by seven on the road Music that was jose alvarado on packer and durham earlier this week talking about his defense and yeah everyone does know who he is defensively hes top three in the country in steals per game and thats what he did last time when these teams met in january well he might not steal the ball every time but certainly that thoughts in your mind this guy is a tremendous competitor he just gets after you and he gets after it on the offensive end of the court as well Music his pressure and georgia techs pressure overall has forced clemson into eight turnovers already mike devoe himself has three steals of clemson shot clocks winding down and bubba parham did get it off but left it short in a shot clock violation on the offensive end clemson needs better ball movement and better player movement theres a little too much dribbling and unless youre taking the ball and driving it to the basket when youre dribbling youre pretty easy to guard there newman takes the ball and attacks the basket Music theres the resume for josh pastner in his fifth season at the helm and we told you nine and seven overall five and five in the acc and at the start of the weekend in a threeway tie for seventh in the conference and right now on the outside looking in according to the bracketology projections lets see if theres some better movement here from clemson on this possession they got it to alamir dawes curling into the key and thats exactly what were talking about really good movement off the ball now you got to dig in defensively chase hunter is up on bubba parham parham beat him off the bounce extra pass for alvarado hes missed a couple early on and interestingly enough after making 16 threes in that first game georgia tech hadnt made any here in the first 10 minutes of this one yeah those 16 were one off a program record were kind of dissecting them this morning with brad brownell and he said they got him in a lot of different scenarios but they got a few in transition and i know thats a spot then where you think georgia tech as they get out and run here indeed thats where theyre dangerous Applause stays with georgia tech its really a nice job by hunter 11th year for brad brownell and he had this group as high as 12th in the country and the nonconference resume is so impressive and its gotten more impressive because of how good alabamas been as the season has gone on and purdue is also a ranked team right now as well and anymore that thats what you have to do you can you can do a great favor to yourself if you have success early in the season in the nonconference part of the season and if you dont then youre fighting uphill the rest of the year and these two are two contrasting teams clemson had that success georgia tech did not moses wright turns it over middle of february so yeah bracketology time the overall record 12 and five and such a great start to the season nine wins in the first ten games and some of those big wins that we talked about shown at the bottom there well 60 in nonconference play that win over alabama alabama is rated number 10 in the ncaa evaluation tool the net theres a foul against moses right purdue is 24 so those are wins that are looking very very big right now in addition to that clemson beat a maryland team that a lot of people joey brackets included are talking about being just very close to making the ncaa tournament and because of all that clemson has a net of 48 right now so as we look at georgia techs resume this for them on the road would be a quad one victory as things stand right now Music sims got blocked by moses right underneath sims was a little too slow with that move he had right off balance to start but he gave right time to recover well moses right then just went over the back so on consecutive possessions he just picked up two fouls after this block he did a nice job recovering there sims had a little bit of room sims thought that was a goal 10 but youre right then down on the other end moses wright a little bit excited goes over the back and picks up his second foul and that is uh that can be a huge factor for georgia tech yeah for as deep as clemson is we know georgia tech does not go deep into the bench although josh pastner very willing to let guys stay in in the first half with two fouls he leads the country in that regard year in and year out john newman with the bucket inside the paint quickly back the other way it is jordan usher with the slam thats really a nice job by georgia tech to take the ball out of the basket and push it down the court quick first step from sims who gets the roll plus the foul and a chance it three and it is three fouls on moses right well that is one heck of a move by amir sims sims is a guy he can shoot the three and he can take you outside and moses right just does not react very quickly you know i think if amir sims has the ball out there you play off of him and you make him beat you by shooting a three dan that was 60 seconds of game action during which moses wright just picked up all three of his fouls georgia tech had been playing a small lineup and now they get even smaller Applause usher and khalid moore the biggest guys out there for the jackets clemson is not a team with a lot of size either Applause sims is the biggest guy hes there on moore shot clock is winding down alvarado jackson and hits it Applause thats the first basket for jose alvarado but how many times have you seen him make a shot like that he is a big shot maker you saw 17 and a half points per game top three in the acc as newman misses and here comes georgia tech ahead by five seven and a half to go here in the first half at clemson Applause Music Applause offensive foul on moore excellent defense from john newman the third but its georgia tech leading by five on the road and running jordan usher let it burn starts at noon with wake forest and clemson we saw amanda butlers team out here on the floor earlier this afternoon then in tallahassee its miami and florida state so just over seven to go here in the first half and moses wright with three fouls that he picked up all of them in a oneminute span and dan we were talking about this earlier the first time these teams met moses wright had 17 in the first half and got off to such a great start well he had four dunks in that first half he made two threes but i can tell you from experience its hard to score from the place hes sitting now as nick otter comes out of the timeout with an elbow jumper and hed been quiet so far because hes seeing a lot of jose alvarado alvarados really getting after him that is a very interesting matchup but nick honors not trying to force anything so far got to pick your spots when youre playing against the defender as good as alvarado and honor to his credits done a very nice job sticking with alvarado at this end of the floor newman clears the miss from moore and moores a guy i think clemson is comfortable shooting that three alvarados in some pain for georgia tech up top as well get a held ball the arrow does keep it at this end with clemson and alvarado much like the first game between these teams when he rolled his right ankle hes gonna head off to the sideline here lets see if we can see what happened to alvarado hes coming around that screen oh i think he just got hit he caught a knee in the thigh as he was trying to come over that screen Music Applause so moses wright in foul trouble and whos spicing his left knee and yeah alvarado went right out toward the tunnel mark it down at the the 6 18 mark here with clemson with it down by three clyde trap on the drive missed it from a tough angle usher nice step through boy usher particularly in transition has the ability to just wiggle around people on the inside that was a really really crafty little move there because sims was waiting trying to draw the charge and while that was happening alvarado just got ready to check back into this ball game nice spin by sims and then he missed it as he turned away from rodney howard nice job by howard just to maintain his position and another nice job by howard setting the screen allowing devoe that was the slowest fast break ive ever seen but devoe converts and hes got eight points now and then brad brownell before his team even got over half court was walking on the court thinking to keep jose alvarado off the court because this is what he did against virginia last time out and in four of the last five games for georgia tech he has played all 40 minutes the only reason he didnt play all 40 minutes the first time these two teams met is because as you said he rolled that ankle Music after the brad brownell timeout oh they hadnt turned it over in six minutes but they gave it away there and now kyle sturdivant on the drive in transition with two more for tech getting out and running thats really good body control by sturdivant right there Music Applause trap cant answer its a 60 run in the last minute or so for the jackets devos had a nice first half howard kept it alive and sims rescues it on the baseline great job by sims to not throw that ball back in bounds until he was sure he was throwing it to his own guy usher blocks honor on the drive at this end thats twice now weve seen usher block shots coming from behind he doesnt panic when somebody beats him but he tracks him and just swats it away that is a really good play he was actually trying to control that but the ball slipped out of his hands georgia techs been very active defensively here in the first half sturdivant pushing again with alvarado still on the sideline parham a deep one hunter tyson the rebound we talked about the fact that clemson sometimes struggles offensively and mike they havent scored in three minutes and shot it well from three the last couple of games 18 combined threes the last two games but just two of seven after that chase hunter missed from deep here in the first half well an awful lot of it has to do with the guys who are shooting the threes georgia techs done a nice job making sure its the low percentage guys who are hoisting most of the threepoint attempts Applause parham off the bounce on the scoop missed it and hemingway clears it for clemson taking it himself to the basket and a blocking foul is called on tech to send hemingway to the line on the other side georgia tech leads by a couple of things theyve blocked three shots already in the here in the first half and in addition to those three blocks they have five steals and so georgia tech theyve created some turnovers theyve scored points off the turnovers and even though moses wright is on the bench with three personal fouls and jose alvarado went out with an injury georgia tech maintains its lead and has actually stretched the lead out but alvarado i just saw him get up off the bench hes coming back in Applause the eagle eyes of dan bonner there alvarado had gotten up once earlier we thought he was coming back in after looked like he might have gotten kneed at that end of the floor defensively right around there took a knee and the thigh was one of those kneetoknee things that yeah that can be very painful and he looks like hes limping a little bit mike yeah low gimpy heading off to that corner as he lets sturdivant handle it at the point for georgia tech howard had it knocked away it stays with the yellow jackets i think sturdivant surprised everybody that he didnt shoot that ball he needed to shoot it one thing you dont want to do is throw it into trouble and thats what he did georgia tech fortunate to keep it Music alvarado wide right a bit and it belongs to clemson Applause nick connor looks like he jammed one of those fingers on his left hand fortunately thats not his shooting hand see its been a cold stretch offensively for clemson really good mantoman defense this entire half by georgia tech Applause too strong second chance for clemson as hunter pulls it out now dawgs is one of the better threepoint shooters but that was a really really tough shot now its sims working on howard hes done a nice job coming in for right and he forced sims into a miss and all he did was maintain his ground and makes him shoot a fourfoot shot instead of a twofoot shot devoe draws a foul Applause hey tonight 10 eastern after the game well have our next bald men not on campus jay villis lefonso coach seth greenberg theyll preview the acc slate of weekend games and the latest news from around the conference only here on accn and the espn app weve got four games tomorrow in the conference including duke at nc state and the north carolina team thats been playing well recently at number nine virginia thats two fouls now on amir sims got to be careful here that he doesnt pick up a foul with an offensive foul he and howard are battling pretty hard inside yeah and howard someone though he hasnt had consistent minutes throughout the year he is not afraid of physicality in the post and he commits a foul on sims backing him down thats just uh you know howard picked up the foul right there but youre youre correct mike and saying hes just trying to be physical with the mere sims because anytime theres that banging in there sims runs the risk of picking up an offensive foul sims with eight points now nine so far to lead clemson the senior who was on the preseason all first team in the acc had 18 and 11 last time out against syracuse and reached a thousand points for his career splits at the line Applause Applause usher walks with it and a turnover for georgia tech Applause Music Applause pj hall the freshman enters for clemson its been five and a half minutes since clemson scored a field goal so they have to feel pretty fortunate theyre only down by eight points their defense is keeping him in it yeah their last bucket was that nick honor elbow jumper hes got it again here Applause and a push is called against georgia tech as hall was going for the loose ball and hall obviously is in there for the last minute of the first half so sims doesnt pick up that foul get on the first for hall paul doesnt get to the line very much but hes pretty good free throw shooter hes now made six of his seven opportunities in conference play thanks both so a two possession game coming up on this final minute first half and its a really important final minute i think for each of these teams usher back iron good battle by moore but its daz who secures it with 50 seconds to go Applause that is great patience by dawes to not panic when he was triple teamed weve got a feature on a couple of the biggest supporters of the clemson program coming up at the half as prosper drew some contact underneath the rim clemson hadnt been able to score from the field but theyre really attacking georgia tech getting themselves to the freethrow line and here its omax prosper this guy is a turbo shot of energy when he comes into the ball game had nine points and five rebounds off the bench on saturday against syracuse as hall exits and jonathan bear replaces him down to four clemson pushes the defense out to the full court and georgia tech will take its use it or lose it time out here with about 22 seconds left in a first half that has been physical it has had the good defense dan bonner that we would expect from both of these teams in a game that is crucial a couple of top half of the acc squads going at it here on this friday night and i think its its even more crucial for georgia tech because they had an opportunity during the week against virginia and they lost that game for a big win and now here they are playing clemson you can see clemson a couple of spots above him in the acc standings but you pointed it out clemson theyre number 48 in the net so if georgia tech could get this win that would be one of those allimportant quad one wins you know we used to talk all the time about the rpi and now we got the quads and its just it gives you a headache sometimes trying to talk about what these teams are how theyre positioning themselves for the ncaa tournament ill tell you what thats a guy right there josh pastner hes locked in on all of that he knows the permutations quite well and hes obviously intimidated by something that starts with algorithm as i am of course he coaches at the georgia institute of technology so he shouldnt be yeah you did not go to the institute as alvarado missed it final six seconds does kept it alive and now some trouble with the handle dawes into the front court good if it goes and he left it short to close out the first 20 minutes its a halftime lead for georgia tech on the road Music oh fun first 20 minutes here at little john coliseum 30 to 26 is the yellow jacket lee cc hoops with some friday night action georgia tech on the road here in south carolina squaring off with clemson well there are so many folks around the college basketball program that make it go behind the scenes and all and heres a story about two people you might not know who i know shes proud of me whether i score a lot or i dont or i play bad or i dont every time i get off the bus i have like the smile from here to here of his 1 000 points in his clemson career lets give it up for amir sims a very nice pregame presentation to amir sims the senior you saw the numbers you heard the announcement reaching 1 000 career points in an 18point performance a doubledouble that he had on saturday against syracuse and danbot hes a really impressive young man and and hes had quite the career here at clemson well you could see by those numbers that he has progressed as he has been here at clemson and he has made himself one of the toughest matchups in the atlantic coast conference and lets take a look at our first half stats it was an odd game clemson cut a nine point lead without scoring into a nine point lead without scoring a field goal for the last six minutes of the half so defense has been at a premium here and the tigers they turned it over eight times early but they got control of the basketball there in the last seven or eight minutes and a half and that really helped him cut into that lead yeah because the lead was as large as nine for georgia tech and to your point dan even though clemson wasnt scoring you made this point as we went along in the first half they were attacking the rim and they did a lot of damage at the free throw line and then the protection in terms of ball security offensively it was about eight turnovers the first eight minutes and then they had just won the final 10 or 11 minutes there that first half keep in mind the last time these two teams played as we look at the threepoint field goal numbers look at georgia tech theyre one for eight the last time they played georgia tech was 16 of 27 shooting threes and so clemsons defense much better tonight moses wright was in some foul trouble he had 3 000 a oneminute span in the first half sat the rest of the first half on the bench but rodney howard gave some good minutes he was tasked with matching up with amir sims and mike devoe with 10 points for georgia tech and thats been important because jose alvarado who was out for a few minutes when he got nicked up hes been relatively quiet offensively in this game as well so far well he has been and its very interesting hes only one he only has three points one for five overall one for four from beyond the arc and hes got no assists in the game so jose alvarado simply has not been a factor offensively but amir sims for the clemson tigers has been a factor offensively he leads the tigers with nine points and he made one three early but hes operated fairly effectively on the inside despite some heavy pressure has one blocked shot and hunsons defense is what has kept him in the game this is early in the game when he made that so hes got three for clemson yeah and then dan on the other side mike devoe with 10 points and he was aggressive early on coming off a game in which he only scored two points against virginia on wednesday and shot one of ten from the floor in that one yeah but remember what we said before the game that georgia techs success is really tied into both devoe and jose alvarado scoring in double figures and devoe was very successful early as you mentioned very aggressive getting himself into the lane creating some opportunities making some tough shots he cooled off toward the end of the half but his defensive play was significant too as he got three steals in that first half and that really helped get georgia tech going and he did not come off the floor either in that first half for georgia tech theyve got the lead at the break after the first 20 minutes from littlejohn coliseum its georgia tech 30 clemson 26 weve got the second half when we come back right after this jackets by four in meeting number 140 between these teams that have met going all the way back to the 19121913 season when john heisman was coaching georgia tech of course he had coached a couple of sports at clemson before that now these themes locking horns here again in 2021 dan bonner mike monica with you michael devoe we told you did not come off the floor in that first half and he was really important for georgia tech in the first half because jose alvarado was quiet jose alvarado was quiet in fact michael devos scored eight of those 10 points early in the game and so for the most part he was quiet throughout the first the second half of the first half and so georgia tech very fortunate to be in the lead with right in foul trouble and alvarado really not being a factor offensively alvarado back out there so too is moses wright five in the blue he picked up his third foul at the 8 23 mark and bubba parham starts the scoring coming out of halftime and dont forget that bubba parham when he was at vmi he scored 30 or more points nine times so hes a guy that can put the ball in the basket yeah he hit a thousand points in two years there playing for vmi as amir sims just scored for clemson so hes into double figures with 11 and nobody else for the tigers has more than five knocked away and then a foul on georgia tech as sims was getting out to run with it and georgia tech hopes to follow devoe because the other guy whos there was moses wright it is the first on devoe this is really a nice job by amir sims just stepping in front of moses right and moses wright just cannot stand there and wait to receive the ball he has to step toward the pass if he does then its a foul on sims but because he just stands there sims is able to step in and devoe is the guy who picks up the foul theyre getting the shot clock situated 28 on the timer a minute in here to the second half howard into the game with right on the bench for george attack and a nice attack from alamir dawes and what a finish dawes did not start the game but he has started the second half in place of hemingway and alamere dawes when he is healthy he has shown that he can not only shoot the three but he can take the ball to the basket and howard picks up the third foul and thats what we saw from clemson toward the end of the half they werent making field goals but they were very aggressively taking the ball to the basket getting themselves to the line and getting georgia tech in some foul trouble so dawe is able to stamp the threepoint play and trimmed the margin to one clemson trailed by as many as nine in the first half right is back into the game usher from the corner for three and dan you mentioned this the first meeting georgia tech hit 16 threes thats just their second made three tonight usher made five of them and that five it was a third of his total for the acc season tyson got loose back door on the baseline and got it from trap you notice moses right had to be very careful normally he would make a heavier contest on that shot than he did but he had to let it go because hes got those three fouls usher driving and a blocking foul goes against clemson oh this was the usher three and then watch the top of your screen top left look at the reaction from head coach josh pastner here hes probably hearing about it from his sideline well he did some hopping around out of the coaches box but uh im not sure that jim behind could do that but josh pastner cant hes got the shield hes got the lanyard with the contact tracing chip in it all decked out with his yellow jackets on the road as usher missed both hit the line hes a 68 free throw shooter and came up empty and now dawes was trying to give clemson the lead that may have been a little deep but its a wide open three i think dawes has to take that the problem is when you miss one like that early in the shot clock generates a long rebound and that allows devoe to get out and score in transition and thats why dan to your point you hear so many coaches say that how our offense is doing if were making shots it has a huge impact on our defense because if we are making shots we can set things up a little more structured defensively this time the three goes down as clemson cuts it to one thanks to clyde trap Applause alvarado on the blow by and it rolled off the rim sims gave it up honor now dawes on the drive and hes blocked by usher thats the third for usher just like that one and a backcourt violation josh pastner sheds the shield hes furious with moses right he may have broken the shield because he took it off and he slammed it on the uh and hes got a technical teddy valentine just teed him up and he may see him up again josh better be careful but josh pastner got the technical foul because not only did he take the shield off but he slammed it onto the table now those things are going to be very 1999 online dan i mean can we get him another one right now that things mangled oh it is mangled and hes not upset with the referees hes upset with his team but that doesnt make any difference and he did mangle it you know usher usher would got himself and look at the thing i sure got himself in trouble because he picked up his dribble in the lane and he was trying to get rid of the ball he didnt want to get three seconds and he but he throws it to a guy in the backcourt moses right is in the background up at the top of your screen josh pastner takes off the face shield and slams it against the table and ted valentine calls the tentacle and thats what hes calling the technical for for slamming that shield against the table and thats a disadvantage of having that shield he probably wouldnt have gotten into trouble it was just a normal face mask only in 2021 that was definitely a covid technical right there hunter tyson missed that one with clemson again leading for the first time tonight usher an offensive foul and georgia tech is sensing this speed up on them as a team right now thats about 10 turnovers for georgia tech and this is usher hes trying to make up for that mistake that he made and hes a pretty good jumper but hes not jumping over top of amir sims Applause theyve got nearly 1900 in the building here as the call goes against clemson and so its one of the venues in the acc where there is a crowd as small as it may be compared to the normal 9 000 that you might get here and theyre starting to get into this thing in the first four minutes here in the second half Applause now its very interesting their capacity is 1876 and we ask well where did you come up with that number and its some sort of a state mandate they are allowed to have 208 percent of capacity not 20 not 21 but 208 of capacity another figure that who would have seen in any year but this one fun first four minutes to the second half clemson leading now by one one more time that got josh pastner the rare technical he does not get a lot of those smashed the shield now of course hes not happy with his team in that scenario and you can see his surprise that hes getting teed up by teddy valentine i i dont know what ted valentines doing with the kicking motion i didnt see josh kick anything but he sure destroyed that face shield man and you know look at that Music i dont know that that cdc approved anymore but and with all of that going on theres a couple things that have happened here amir sims picked up his third foul so hes on the bench right at the moment so both moses wright and amir sims are have three personal fouls in the game wright is still in there lets see if clemson tries to attack inside they do with honor nice body control off the window driving on alvarado and again its that strength that honor possesses its just that physicality thats enables to get him past alvarado theres michael devoe and he turned it over and honor comes away with it hemingway on the step through into the midrange and right secures it parham pushing nice job by usher to tip that ball away from the clemson players struggles continue from threepoint range for georgia tech in this one i think georgia tech needs to do a better job taking the ball to the basket devoe tried to do it that last time but was out of control i think they need to find moses right in the low post and let him go to work tough turnaround for tyson Music hes been good in this one bubba parhams up to nine points now and a guy who only averages seven and a half per game but as we said he was a big scorer his first couple of college seasons at vmi so he is somebody whos capable thats just not his role on this team tysons been active on the boards that one squirted out to hemingway into a lot of traffic and devoe comes away with it alvarado has been throwing up a lot of threes so far in this one and he has not been converting normally you wouldnt mind alvarado in transition thats good shot for him honor knocks it down and clemsons back in front nick connor has been big lead here early on in the second half dan well a lot of it has to do with the types of shots theyre getting theyre taking the ball close to the basket you saw sims operating in a low post then a couple of drives and when youre driving the ball that causes the defense to collapse which allows a guy like nick honor to get open thats his first threepoint attempt of the game an honor hes four out of five shooting from the field in his last game he didnt get inside the ark but today hes only shot one and made one from outside the ark defensive work against alvarado although hes going to pick up a foul right there yeah for his work on that end of the floor hes helped keep alvarado quiet just three points one of seven shooting one of five from three and alvarado without an assist as well and now its dawes on him devoe sinks that one and much needed for georgia tech and michael devos up to 15 that was really good pass by moses wright an excellent control normally you might see right attack the basket on that play but hes got those three fouls so hes got to be careful oh boy that was a break for clemson right there hall wasnt looking for that pass hes calling for it there from prosper going to work on usher with the shot clock winding down on clemson traps got to get it up and clyde trap and clemson have a shot clock violation hey tomorrow 2 eastern its boston college and syracuse second meeting between them this season it was a syracuse blowout win the first time at county forum tomorrow at the carrier dome right here on accn and the espn app theres the lob for right underneath nicely done by the yellow jackets its a really good play and again sims has those three personal fouls so hes got to be a little bit careful but really good movement by moses right and a nice catch inside moses wright does a nice job cutting to the top of the key and then he gets position its almost like hes under the basket trying to rebound he gets position and this is a really nice job by devoe to see that hes got that position and nick honor just didnt get over quickly enough well dan for as much as we were talking about moses wright and amir sims and i know you were curious to see how that matchup was going to play out it has shapeshifted a little bit here because both guys have been dealing with foul trouble right and sims with three each so its a little bit of a cat and mouse game between them as well that time the problem for clemson was they did not have enough pressure on the on the ball devoe was able to stand there and look over the entire court and he could see that wright had great position got to get more pressure on the ball than that alvarado is up on the ball here as sims set the screen honor kicks it trap points it and hits it Applause devoe back the other way drew a foul it goes on alimir dawes i think the strategy for each of these teams has to be pretty similar i think they need to attack you cant settle for outside jump shots devoe not settling there got into the midrange but missed it tipped around sims dribbled it off the leg of honor now a tie up and a held ball with the arrow pointing to clemson well clemson has started in eight days as you see here all part of five games in 12 days as you look at the road ahead this is gonna have a game on sunday as well georgia tech will be back home right here on accn against pitt and so at the start of the week josh pastner before practice on monday he showed his team two videos one was kobe bryant one was tom brady and they were both talking about how much time those guys spent on treatment and recovery because its a lot of games in a compressed window here for tech and theyre not easy games either and thats that clemson is really starting to heat up from three and that was the first time in the second half we havent seen them go inside and kick it back out for the three youre talking about their games they play against virginia one of the best defensive teams in the country against clemson another one of the best defensive teams in the country and then pith one of the most physical teams in the atlantic coast conference Applause and theyve played a really challenging conference slate so far shot clock winding down on michael devoe and a long two to trim the margin to one that is a big big basket for georgia tech now they have to dig in here on the defensive end Music clemson shooting over 60 from the field in the second half because theyre getting better shots than they did in the first half and look at the ball pressure from alvarado up on nick honor sins jackieing with right and sims score it over the top in an excellent post matchup between those two its hard to bring pressure to bring a double team because hes such a good passer but i think i would rather have clemson shooting it from outside than sims operating that close to the basket barham answers right back with honor up on him not bad defense there thats just a kid who can score and another great pass by devoe getting the ball inside kicking it back outside so at this end of the floor dan whether its by the dribble drive or when sims gets it on the block that has opened up some of the kick out threes it seems like for clemson yes absolutely that one was from the perimeter and a miss for clemson parham cant give georgia tech the lead but usher skies on the glass alvarado just doesnt have it so far tonight hes now one for six from beyond the threepoint arc and you dont often see him miss a wide open one like that and remember the number that we showed right at the top talking about the georgia tech guard stan this caught your eye that when alvarado and davao are both scoring in double figures georgia techs been winning an acc games and when its only one of them thats scoring in double figures it just hasnt gone as well for georgia tech in conference play its its its a you know josh pastner told us that he his guards have to play well and there just didnt any question that hes correct and the numbers prove it the only time that they were able to win was that first game against clemson when davao had the big game and alvarado had eight dawes missed it prosper tried to follow it thats really good pressure by davao on the inside devoes got 17 as well and josh pastner said to us this morning hes got to be a stud for us today parham couldnt connect with moses wright and a tech turnover sunday afternoon a doubleheader of womens basketball here on accn in the app wake forest and clemson wake is coming off a huge win yesterday and as ncaa tournament hopes miami and florida state will follow that two eastern again accn and the app as well Applause so 51 all is the score with eight and a half to go in this second half from littlejohn coliseum good hands from davao again for georgia tech on the run out its devoe laying it in that is a tremendous job by jose alvarado to basically just get in the way and set a screen for devoe the defense couldnt get to him because they couldnt get past alvarado all set up by a careerhigh fifth steal for devoe a great kick out from dawes to find sims how fun has this one been Applause devoe right on the offensive glass and then it kicked off the leg of sims and a tie up with the arrow favoring georgia tech to keep it at this end of the floor well we just keep going back out from deep last week and a couple of wins to get back on track and theyve got five threes down here in the second half and the way theyve done it in the second half for the most part has been drive the ball in force the defense to collapse and then knock it down and as you mentioned they were only two for nine in the first half but five out of seven in the second half has really improved things for the clemson tigers and georgia tech theyre a little bit better in this half than they were in the first half but theyre nowhere near on the 1627 pace they set the first time these two teams play boy every pass baseline out of bounds every possession so contested honor took it away trap on the scoop no and here comes alvarado and bear got a piece of it a frenetic pace to this one is dawes saved it parham spins out of trouble and it belongs to georgia tech hows that for frantic well frantics the word for it efficiency is not a word you could throw in there but frantic certainly works now each of these teams playing with a tremendous amount of intensity jose alvarado made a really good defensive play on the one end and then bayer made another good defensive play against alvarado on the other two teams in the top half of the acc for georgia tech searching for a quad one win clemson trying to build on the carolina and q swings last week heres alvarado knocking it down and finally maybe starting to heat up have been one of six from deep before that well you you know hes just not gonna miss very many of those wide open threes excellent job by par to make the one extra pass and for as much as weve talked about michael devoe bubba parham has played really well in this one hes got a dozen first time in double figure since a week before christmas shack hawk winding down this is sims going against right falling away no offensive rebound for jonathan bear given some good minutes off the bench here Music georgia tech weve mentioned theyve struggled from three but when you get ball movement like this and this is the second or third time that jose alvarado has been wide open for that three and hes just not going to miss very many of those and he knocked that one down jonathan bear good on the first the fifth year senior part of the very deep clemson team thats been well documented throughout the year as john newman the third checks back in well depth has had an effect in this game clemsons bench has outscored georgia techs bench 18 now 192 and some fresh legs to apply the fulllength pressure on alvarado and the Applause jackets usher driving on bear got it to go plus the foul for jordan usher way usher is the guy sometimes he takes that ball he drives it into the lane youre thinking oh no whats going to happen but here he makes a fantastic move and how many times have we seen this from jordan usher he is a guy who can take contact he can score with either hand inside he once he gets close to the basket hes capable of some acrobatics around the goal that is a heck of a big play really is for jordan usher the senior from canton georgia hes into double figures as well joining parham with a dozen and its georgia tech by three sims ties the bowl game Applause and keep in mind in acc play sims came into this game shooting 26 from beyond the arc Applause and maybe not as well as he had shot it from deep last year right over the top of bear look out below and then georgia tech takes a quick timeout after the right flush Music ive been talking about wright and sims the entire game and sims knocks it down his third three of the game but then moses wright is wide open on the inside and he just powers that ball past bear thats very optimistic on bears part to pick it hes going to block a moses right dunk these are the heavy minutes that we talked about that you were just mentioning dan for as deep as clemson is and how they come at you with the platoons georgia tech it is a very constricted bench for josh pastner and he will ride his aces well that those minutes played by the starters that is bobby kremens esque bobby kremens great teams at georgia tech they never played more than six or seven guys we saw some kyle sturdivant and khalid moore in the first half rodney howards giving some good minutes and now the pressure of alvarado forces a nick on her turnover about 93 feet away from the basket well thats just alvarado being alvarado hes extremely aggressive thats what brad brownell was saying to us this morning he just gets right up under you and he is always slapping down on the ball hes got such great hands joining us late in this one alvarado three steals per game we showed you earlier third best in the country came into this one with 200 steals for his career parham no and its clemson basketball down by two with about four and a half left thats really good defense by clemson i know weve talked about alvarado and his defensive effort against honor but nick honor has also had a very good defensive game against jose alvarado he uses that physical strength hes got about 25 pounds on alvarado and i think hes used that effectively throughout the game he threw the post entry this time for sims hes been battling with right took the contact drives a foul and will shoot a pair and thats thats when thats just one of those things you keep going in there and eventually wrights going to get that foul sims is just too good a player on the inside sims an 84 free throw shooter hey nothing but net every sunday is our weekly basketball studio show well preview the week and we will look back at this game four games tomorrow two games on sunday nothing but net eight eastern accn in the app sims good on both were tied at 61 and clemson has done a great job from the free throw line tonight theyve made all seven in the second half theyre 15 of 16 for the game and here clemson showing a zone enough its mantoman and right scores over bear drew the foul as well now again there bear is trying to defend against wright because sims has some foul trouble and this is just a great job nobody comes to help and moses right if youre going to give him that much time that close to the basket hes going to score some points and that was not an easy shot it wasnt like he was in the low post bear did a nice job keeping him about eight feet away from the basket but moses wright showing the kind of skill he possesses and thats just a giveaway by devoe right there that foul thats his second foul and it sends us to a timeout 3 56 to go this has been a heck of a second half coliseum this is a game that was supposed to be played tomorrow but because georgia tech is trying to squeeze in as many games as it can and will play now on sunday against pitt this game moves up to friday and dan bonner this has delivered especially here in the second half weve had six ties ten lead changes in this half alone and a threepoint game in the final four minutes here of regulation and the interesting thing about this is you see jose alvarado coming out of the huddle there alvarado has not had a good offensive game only two for 10 shooting the basketball but none of that matters right now alvarado one of the top players in the league and if he can deliver in the last three minutes and 56 seconds thats all that they need he doesnt have to make all the plays he just has to make the big plays and he certainly has the facility for doing that theres a foul on devoe before the break so the one and one here for jonathan bear 17 of 21 before that make to earn another for the 24 year old from germany getting some run here down the stretch and that i dont know what devoe was trying to accomplish out there but that was that was a foul where you basically send a really good free throw shooter to the line thats like a turnover and after a couple of makes it allows clemson to pick up full length against alvarado its been excellent for the tigers devoe has led the way with 19 now usher into a long two that was too strong and trap clears it clemson is a team theyre not afraid to turn it over to their defense their defense did a great job that time keep in mind moses wright has four personal fouls he came up on honor dawes blew a tire parham diving for it is going to get hit with a foul yeah and thats his fourth you cant just jump on top of a guy this isnt football youre not trying to recover a fumble see he jumps right on top of him and that that is the correct call youre not allowed to do that Applause dogs look like he was trying to shake out his arm there hes a 79 free throw shooter for his career this is on the front end so its interesting now georgia tech with two guys right and parham with four personal fouls both of them can be fairly aggressive on the offensive end you dont want to pick up your fifth foul with a charge heres right and he gets the roller over sims sims was in pretty good position thats just a great job by moses wright forcing his way to the basket and boy moses wright has come alive here down the stretch for georgia tech great entry from bear to sims to cut it to one now thats a place where they have an advantage because moses wright simply cannot afford to be aggressive on the defensive end thats a great catch on the inside by sims and how about the fire from the senior shot clock below 10 and trap commits a foul on devoe and so devoe will go to the free throw line for the one and one hes a 70 free throw shooter weve been talking about the guard play for georgia tech thats how we came on the air tonight devoe has carried the load scoring wise with 19 while alvarado with six points on two of ten shooting Applause and that has generally not been a formula for success as we mentioned for georgia tech alvarado having a very poor shooting night davao makes both so its 6865 clemson down by three with the basketball with less than two to go in regulation here at home high low this time it seems to bear with the finish thats really a nice pass by sims and we talked about the fact that hes a really good passer bear at six feet ten going up against michael devoe five inch height advantage for bear and work to perfection parham saved it at the midline that is some kind of play by paul and now para cannot hit from three Applause lets see if they try to go to sims hes been terrific 23 points found honor and hes blocked moses wright came to get it now moses wright uh you know he again he has those four personal fouls this is an excellent pass inside alvarado getting over just a little too late to help this time alvarado does a nice job forcing honor to stop and i think that was actually devon that came over and swatted at that as well and wright for sure gets it this time on sims right moves his feet controls his body Applause this is the spot where alvarado normally makes a play he got free underneath from devoe right on cue timeout clemson now you said it dan jose alvarado darting to the block but just nobody looking at him nobodys watching him honor is guarding somebody that means a passer but its not its somebody who makes plays and that time it was a scoring play finding the open spot realized nobody was looking at him and just cut to the basket it was his teammate jordan usher who said earlier this week jose would cut off his fingers to help us win a game thats what georgia techs trying to do here on the road clemson meanwhile down by three still 33 seconds to go everything seems to have gone through sims here these last few minutes dan offensively for the tigers well the tigers are six of eight shooting threes here in the second half but you dont need a threepoint basket if you get one doing it the way theyve been doing it driving the ball forcing the defense to collapse and kicking out for a three we are certainly going to take an open three but you still have time in the game to get the ball inside particularly to attack inside with amir sims sims off the bounce got some space and got the roll maybe carved out some real estate on moses right Applause and georgia tech will use its final timeout trying to inbound it with about 29 seconds to go here in regulation well it was amir sims and he has matched a career high tonight with 25 points in this one gives you the idea the kind of versatility of amir sims they dont try to get him the ball on the block they get him the ball out on the wing and hes able to drive the ball to the goal youre right he did push off there a little bit but the officials rule wasnt enough to call a foul the problem now for clemson is the shot clock is off georgia tech they do not have to shoot the ball again if they can hang on to it of course theyve got to get the ball over midcourt so if you can get and get them into a 10second violation then thats one way you can get the ball you go for the steal and i you know you just dont have a lot of time to play around here if you dont get a steal immediately i think you have to extend the game and georgia tech you know thats pretty tough the worst freethrow shooter tonight has been usher hes only one for three hes the only guy for georgia tech who has missed a free throw and you mentioned he only shoots about 67 percent so maybe early in the shot clock if usher gets the ball you want to give him a chance at the free throw line if youre the clemson tigers because you see georgia tech as a team has shot it really well tonight and for the season theyre 72 at the line thats middle of the pack in the acc but youre right its usher right around 67 moses wright 68 those are the two worst georgia tech free throw shooters on the floor right now with 29 seconds left and usher to put it in Applause Applause and about 10 seconds come off the clock and michael devoe a 70 free throw shooter will go to the line its a nice job by georgia tech getting the ball in bounds first of all and then putting it in the hands of alvarado who they didnt want to foul and so theyre able to run 10 seconds off the clock Applause though ninth team foul on clemson and devoe earns another how big has he been tonight bigtime bounceback performance for the junior from orlando who only had two points on one of ten shooting in the eightpoint loss to virginia on wednesday clemson will take its final timeout and will have 15 seconds left with which to work trailing by three oh this has lived up to the hype so far a couple of teams in the top half of the acc georgia tech at five and five in conference action but in search of what would be its first acc road win of the season this would qualify as a quad one victory and clemson meanwhile after dropping four out of five coming off the covid paws had a great week last week and has been off since a win against syracuse on saturday as we reset things here in the final 15 seconds well i think now if youre clemson you really do have to think about getting a threepoint play that means a threepoint basket were driving the ball to the goal and see if you can score and get fouled and georgia tech you see they dont have a lot of theres not a lot of breathing space here after this one but for clemson theyve got the nine team fouls so the next foul you commit its going to be two shots for georgia tech anyway so i think you got to try to get three here sims had a look at it got it down low to bear so they cut it to one and used only three and a half seconds no timeouts now what barm went down hard its been a physical second half in particular sims taking the ball to the basket electing to pass up the three i thought he might have had an open an opening from threepoint range one point game georgia tech in front trying to inbound it without a timeout left usher threw it to midcourt wright got it to alvarado who slams on the brakes and will go to shoot two at the line where they barely got it in in time nice job by clemson now moses wright playing around with that midcourt line but its not a backcourt violation unless both feet and the ball are across the line and that was not the case there but here missing the first free throw this gives clemson a chance 88 free throw shooter jose alvarado from both notes clemson down by one this is nick honor for the winner Applause clemson how about the tigers Applause well alvarado misses it and so that gives clemson a chance and honor this is a really good screen by sims alvarado never sees it and thats a situation where you cant be playing that far off of sims youve got to get up because the only chance is to shoot that long one and he banks it in our zaxbys player of the game honor was the hero sims was the start throughout matching a career high with 25 points and what a night for this clemson team we talked about the guards right at the top then and we sung the praises of davao and alvarado and we mentioned nick honor as well whos now had some big moments in this first year playing for clemson remember the nc state game he had some huge plays down the stretch and hes the hero tonight a great screen as we said by amir sims and obviously thats a little bit of luck that ball banking in but honor made both of his three point shot attempts tonight very very disappointing loss for georgia tech alvarado misses those two free throws and then have it banked in from three alvarado never saw that screen coming final score 7472 coming up next its bald men on campus for dan bonner our producer everett hutto director kurt sutton and our entire crew mike monaco saying so long
