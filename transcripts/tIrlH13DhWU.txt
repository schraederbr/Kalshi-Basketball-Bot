for and the freshman in the starting lineup for Duke theres six different starting lineup this season and Clemson wins the opening tip as we are underway they have not wanted Cameron indor in their last 20 tries so thats how feudal its been will today be a different story in a couple of hours Chase Hunter lines up the first one but cant hit it going to be very important for Clemson to get a good start here this is not a building you want to get off to a slow start and allow Duke to build momentum well that is for sure with the great success theyve had in this building all time 955 wins just 173 losses on the Move swooping in MC will drop in the first two nice move by the freshman and were watching Jared McCain grow right before Oz pretty much a shooter for the majority of this season but starting to do more things off the BS starting line for Clemson Paul getting 20 a game hes going to need a big one so Joe Gerard sheflin has been outstanding on the glass and Clemson on the board and I love the matchup early going inside to PJ Hall giving a chance to go one1 against Philip palsky and winning the first one all preseason First Team all ACC averaging 207 rebounds a game Kane on the outside comes in averaging 12 points a game Duke has Five Guys averaging double figures pass was tipped Mitchell got the back and lay it up and go to the line Mark Mitchell looked very healthy and spry against Louisville after missing a couple Jared McCain such a great shooter you have to run him off the threepoint line but showing how his game has progressed how he can get to the rim and PJ Hall showing all the progressions in his game back to the basket up against one of the accs best and winning the battle Joe Gerard will pick up the foul and Mitchell to the line after missing a couple of games he worked for 34 minutes against lville and put up a nice one a double double and that easy victory for a Duke to improve to 14 and four and five two in the conference yeah not just your average run the middle double dou 20 and 12 performance against Louisville and the second time hes done that in the last three games that hes played OB be so Mark Mitchell playing his best basketball of the season so John shy was hopeful that everybody was healthy again but now all of a sudden roach with a new injury nicked up with the ankle heres the touch by Wiggins he left that one short came right back to him in and out of his hands and theyll look at each other itll go the other way itll be D ball Brad brell head coach for the Tigers he has been Clemsons top man since 2010 trying to get them back to the NCAA tournament Just 4 and 13 against the Duke Blue Devils but when you consider the era in which hes coached in having four wins you know and against Duke is not bad considering he went up against one of the best in the business speaking of best the business this gentleman replaced the best of the business when you talk John Shire now in his second season as the head coach for the dke Music blue on thei will lay it in as he went strong to the 10 nice pocket pass from Tyrese Proctor coming off of that screen of roll action John sire loving the way Proctors playing right now boy look at the Kane hit the deck as he went for it its going to be Clemson ball despite his protest but a tremendous Hustle you see the dime dropped by Proctor and then just like that a little bit of collision but these two guys filipowski Runway I mean when you run into PJ Hall it can hurt if filipowski feeling a little bit of that one on just a little love tap after he makes the buck seven footer feeling the effects of that all at 610 fumble there right around the hash mark a nearly lost it that pass Almost Got Away to heres Hunter beyond the three shot clock is down the one will they get it in the air the answer well there was a whistle on the play theres a foul the shot clock was winding down to nothing McCain picks up the foul but did the shot clock expire before that well I believe thats what the officials are going to go over and look at theyre going to see did the foul happen before the shot clock expired or actually will that be a shot clock violation got a great crew going over to check it out led by B Smith at the monitor along with Lamar Simpson and Tommy morresy take a look at at top of your screen yeah thats it zero Im not sure on that one OB I believe the contact may have happened before the end of the shot clock so that one may actually end up being a foul which is tough luck for Jared McCain as we look at the shot clock theres the contact as considering when the whistle was blown that may end up being foul number one for McCain and Clemson avoiding a mistake of not recognizing the shot clock boy awfully close as they head to the monitor all three of them there to take a look and what were seeing right now early in this game Brad Brownell having to go to the bench get Josh Beetle on the floor because the matchup with wig having to defend one of the perimeter players for the Blue Devils was going to be a struggle so they make the substitution early and Beetle as he checks into the game doesnt recognize the shot clock going down but very well could have been bailed out by Jared McCain so our first controversy here today 1736 to Music go Clemson gets it in off the fake hul in traffic flipped it up there no basket as he was filed before the Music shot and that foul will be charged to Caleb Foster The Freshman for Duke is first tigers have been a very solid offensive team all season long averaging 81 points a game they shooted well there nice Fall Away there for two and thats the guy they have to get going Chase Hunter has to be aggressive for the Tigers to have an opportunity here and Cameron today hes the guy that had a huge breakout season a year ago on a corner McCain no rebounded Away by she hes been a rebounding monster unreal and John S talked about what he does not only on the defensive board but also in the offensive line he finds the open man and Hunter drains it he has five quick points here hes only hitting 28 beyond the threepoint line but you cant be more open than that but T hunter in his fifth year in college red shirt of the season now when youve been in this building a number of times the crazies arent as crazy in the thats a mans move by filipowski just couldnt finish it ACC preseason player of the year and its Clemson by two Beetle will laun chance no kicks to Proctor Proctor coming out a huge game 24 points and the of louville a career high filipowski too strong thats one he can hit though he is 40 out there and thats a differentiator for both these guys when you look at he and PJ hall both are capable of knocking down the three ball PJ on Q stepping up and knocking down the trail three already youre starting to feel a little Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better Among The Bigs well when you think about these two bigs going at theyre three of they two of the four preseason First Team all ACC bigs PJ went up against one Armando B we lost that battle so hes looking to get some retribution here against rip get around and out CL fivepoint lead very early Hunter wants to attack got it up on the 10 it wont drop for Applause him Foster for McCain The Freshman had a standout game against pit in that loss that we talked about it was Mitchell open yes sir hell drain a triple and Mark Mitchell struggled to shoot the basketball early in the season has since found his confidence John Shire says hes been so much more decisive as of late knowing when to shoot it when to just drive it and when to make a play Hs going to go hard hell draw the foul Mitchell came to try and defend and he hit him 108 Clemson PJ Hall has not won in this building however hes gotten off to a great start trying to find his route ch Hunter stepping up knocking down the three ball and PJ on the trail hold his three up as well so 1504 to go here in the first half and Clemson with a twopoint lead here on the Duke BL see him back on the floor he missed the Pittsburgh game a week ago where pit was able to come in here and get a win myON has more yeah I mean he didnt PRS at all this week he missed the pit game that he missed didnt practice leading up to Louisville with the knee injury and then he plays against Louisville and he suffers the ankle sprain last two days he has not been in practice and John CH Was preparing to play without him and then today he said listen I want to go and John CH said thats part of that senior leadership spirit that hes demonstrated he said it was a miracle for him to come back and theyre just a different team with Jeremy roach out there on the co they absolutely have been mying if you go back and look at what has happened for the Blue Devils this season you would have to say that although Kyle filipowski is their best player Jeremy roach may be their most important player and youve seen how that that manifested a week ago where they took a l on their home court without him I know its really early but the Tigers coming out playing well in the first 5 minutes and if you dont do that often times as a Duke opponent you can get buried right away yeah but Obie this is a veteran Clemson Tiger team youve got a lot of experience on this group youre talking about seven seniors and graduates so they have many of these guys have been through the fires here before Chase Hunter gives it up here for beetle beetle on the spin shot clock down to ad and well short so Duke on the attack Duke making 48 of their shots and they look at the veteran group for the Tigers so they ought to be able to come in here and play with composure and I dont believe any of them have a win in this building so thats also going to be some extra motivations Mark Mitchell working hard look very healthy and sty against lville after missing two games he played 34 minutes had a double double he has six quick points we and Mark mov to the three now with Sean Stewart starting to give more and more minutes double figure minutes for him the last two games with the blue doubles John shy talked about he makes them more physical and of course a bigger team when Stewart the McDonalds AllAmerican gets on the court H back outside for Holly just hit one triple he misses this one comes in at 20 points and seven rebounds a game the senior and now roach with a touch for filipowski averaging 18 and n on the back down and and a foul with 1322 to go in offensive on filipowski as first Obie you can get away with the first bump but the second bump a smart Defender is going to absorb that contact theyre going down PJ Hall we talked about him as a veteran and he cut his teeth on defense started out being much more of a Defender than he was an offensive player the offense has grown but he cut his teeth on being a defender in a smart possession right there by PJ Hall so filipowski will take a seat as 610 Ryan Young The Graduate into the pre got three outside the three Dylan Hunter Chase Hunters little brother hell shovel it here for Hall shot clock down to seven pass tipped to skipped right there with a miss and a rebound by tyres Proctor coming up 24 points against Louisville now for the sophomore thats a new career high Mitchell taking the Baseline almost hit it hell be headed to the line theres an example of that decisiveness that John Shire talked to us about Mark Mitchell as soon as he caught the basketball recognizing the defender closing out on him gets to the midrange but doesnt over penetrate and pick up the charge gets to the midrange pulls up and is able to draw the foul and get to the free throw line Clark with a personal Mitchell makes 7 3 we talked about the big rebounding game the double double that he had against Louisville in that game d wound up with 15 offensive rebounds and both coaches talked about how big that stat will be today it absolutely will be when you look on one side for the Clemson Tigers Ian sheins one of the best offensive rebounders in the ACC and then you talk about the numbers that the Blue Devils put up at Louisville they were all over the offensive glass between mark and flip who had 15 rebounds in that game they dominated the ground Foster coming on now the Freshman a 65 freshman from Harrisburg North Carolina rank is one of the top 25 players in the country on a Notre Dame High in California which to the bench for a moment theres Gerard back in 42 at their threepoint line Dylan Hunter Godfrey lets fly and he swishes into triple and Godfrey not known as a threepoint shooter however hes capable of making him when you take those Dary shots they basically dared him to shoot that and he makes him pay son of the longtime NFL linebacker Randall Godfrey who was a Cowboy by the way even though I knew youd get that even though Jay Lucas and I are still you still a little bothered by what happened with our Cowboys theres no way that that moment would have passed without you mentioning your beloved Cowboys you know what its basketball season now its just basketball lets thank basketball Dylan Hunter with the foul Foster another Blue Devil who can drain the 340 there Stewart coming off the bench on Stewart at 69 heres roach and John sh wants him to take more threepointers he hits 46 going to drive and test that ankle slam right back at him by Clark and transition high and thatll drop and for those that dont recognize oh we got a technical foul technical on Clemson is that going to be Jack so after a Ticky Tac technical itll be roach at the line on the other end at 86 Im not sure where anything merited a technical foul but 1145 to go and Clemson with a nice quick start on top by Ford Duke has beaten Clemson 20 consecutive times here at Cameron indor to go back to the 9495 season last time they won here I believe Brad Brownell is telling burmith right now Dave OBrien just said that was a Ticky cack technical foul we should not have gotten that one hes right about it yeah weve seen a much more aggressive technical to S Lis well well set on your part roach with a pull up from about 12T thats where he missed that free throw earlier so he had to get right back to that spot knock down the midrange and get two for that been so steady throughout his career captain and 1000 Point scorer for the Blue Devils and has played so many different roles for the blue doues you go back to thinking about he was on that team with poo B Caro and of course Trevor Ks all the NBA DRFT shein denied ran into a barricade there the follow wont go by Godfrey so Duke very Stout defensively in the paint over the top Mitchell went for the catch and a whistle with 1055 to play in the half and a onepoint game two more games highlighting our ESPN schedule tonight number six Kentucky taking on Arkansas Sonic Blockbuster at six and we C the night with Alabama hosting LSU at Coleman Coliseum both games available on the E ESPN out and you go back and you think ACC SEC challenge it was actually the Duke Blue Devils who lost at Arkansas and then the Clemson Tigers who went and won at Alabama so both those teams playing after this game a little bit of ACC SEC tie arkas one of my favorite venues in the country to see a college basketball game goty picked up the foul moments ago parer leaning in it wont drop batted around Tigers really hitting that glass interesting to see if they make the same level of noise in Arkansas for Kentucky that they did for the Blue Devils cuz it was off the charge so far Gerard has been a nonfactor he comes in averaging 15 points a game John shy said when they win in the ACC hes one guy when they lose often times they wi Spore all and the drive heavy traffic and made the shot Dylan Hunter off balance in the paint takes the hit headed to the line and the new hairstyle has worked well for Dylan Hunter early in this game his second basket hes a little more Sleek right now OB and hes finding his way to the free throw line trying to complete the threepoint play he came with a foul thatll be his second so a threepoint lead Clemson trying to make it four they not at the line very much this season it showed there but a second effort fall out to Gerard no great look for Gerard always the best time to shoot the three off the offensive rebound thats normally a shot he makes youre talk about a young man with 349 made threepoint field goals in his career and you see his numbers in the wins versus the losses a 20o per game score in ACC wins this year only 11 1 half in the four losses closing in on 2000 career points pass over the shoulder intended for sheff thats one you got to get it on the glass allow definitely to have the opportunity to put it back in nothing but net by McCain thats what happens when you make mistakes on the offensive end against Duke Jared McCain Caleb Foster Jeremy rhs Kyle Philip pal theyve got so many shooters that can hurt you when they get easy looks in transition a roach 46 out there McCain 41 and a half Foster 40 they can drill those threes so can this man Gerard gave up the dribble PJ Hall with a Fall Away filipowski with a rebound hes grabbing nine a game his 23 career double doubles nice spin with the paint but no by fori but he steals it Proctor got it and just like that Duke surges back in front Jase shot clock inside 10 down to three Hall with the left go Mitchell start the break here for Duke BL Devils at five and two in the conference one week before their first Showdown with conference leader North Carolina who won again today 10 in a row for the heels thats going to be short by Proctor this time thats a feeling good shot for Proctor after knocking down the last three in transition but one of the characteristics we talked about for Brad Brown now you got to limit turnovers and limit to threes from duke Chase on in a BL back under went for the DK he thought he got fouled on the play still debating that theyve got numbers Philip howski cant stick it he said kind of a rough first half he has and one of the things that hes had to do a little more in this half that he normally does is have to go up and contest another gu similar to him on the defensive end of the floor having to battle with PJ Hall so you can see Philip palski a little winded right now having to go up against PJ those two May wear each other out heres Gerard that Miss badley he also hasnt been much of a factor Obie look at everyone walking down the floor I think each and every play on the floor is looking to the immediate timeout they cant wait somebody might just throw the ball out of bounds to get a little bit of a stoppage of play gives you an idea the temple this one TI away was 649 and heres that timeout to give everybody a breather 21 18 both teams need that bench for a couple minutes here at Cameron indor teams average over 80 points the game the pace has slowed significantly a tire shot from Joe Gerard leads to these three guys walking up the floor PJ Hall needs a break everyone looking for the media timeout right now they cannot wait to get to the Gatorade cooler OB everybody just taking a stroll and this was when they went to the bench filipowski clearly in need of a moment hes not alone hes not far from alone everyone on the court at that point was looking for the next timeout they were all happy with the deflection going out of bounds Duke maintains the basketball but each and everyone was looking to get a break filipowski still with some After Effects have taken that shot to the solar plexus earlier heres Mitchell trying to make a move in close Mark Mitchell yes a sweet shot by the 69 softb hes got 10 points its almost been a tale of two seasons from Mark Mitchell the nonconference he wasnt the guy we were expecting to see this year but he is taken off in ACC play we talked about the two double doubles that included 20 points over his last three games and off to a great start here though Beetle finding the blue Lane flips it up there and its going to drop he got the roll on it and took the hit two Josh Beetle who had a strong performance at Florida State the last last time out for the Clemson Tigers attacking the basket and able to finish looking like our guy myin MF myin what you got for me down there well I mean exactly what we just saw in the time out braell was saying we got to convert if youre not going to convert you got to at least draw fouls and be aggressive around the rim and it looks like they took his advice fellas its looking like my when he was attacking the basket back in the day I can see him going up to going to the rim strong finishing getting to the free throw line all lies on the 10 you know and missing the free throw of course yes hopefully my was taking his free throw so threepoint lead for Duke here Young on the high post gave up the dribble Mitchell has been the hot hand Foster back for Proctors triple hes about 35 there the sophomore but hes coming up 2 four against Louisville didnt miss much in that one he has six and this is the biggest lead so far today for Duke up by half a dozen Wiggins on the turnaround around and outs and hares Proctor knocking down to three with the basketball probing in transition right now looking very comfortable myin what did John shy tell us about Proctor oh my oh my said if you dont can hear me with this wild crowd he said he knows that he can be aggressive when he plays like that it just changes the dynamic of this team he wants him to dictate the action and not wait for it to Happ and he also said the second half of the season last year he played with a different swag and right now its looking like his swag is back Duke on a 142 run to open this thing up and tyr Proctor Factor number one as he drains another triple and over his last three games hes averaging 17 a game hes been much better since coming back from injury turned his ankle in the game at Georgia Tech since returning hes been coming off the bench primarily was a starter here today but over 17 points per game over his last three games OB as you mentioned but he is playing with a different level of confidence now that we saw from him to start the season you could tell just that little Shake of the head after knocking back another three three out of four beyond that line Applause already sha for Hall they got to turn to him now those big shoulders of PJ Hall got bottled up there shot clck down to five rebound tipped and thats going to be some Applause ball and meanwhile the other guy the Tigers really rely on along with PJ Hall is George Gerard but he has not been able to get going but you and I and of course Marvin and our great staff Kim Belton Griff all of us watch we were involved in the film session today with Duke as they talked about The Scouting Report and how they wanted to guard Gerard and give the blue devs credit for following The Scouting Report oh again denied here P comes to Philip housei great Save By The Blue Devils leading by nine the Music Applause Music lowski hes in the paint the big F leaning in it almost went it was in in and out as he took the foul and unable to rise right away and take his time here after drawing the foul a 424 showing and with Mitchell and roach returning to the lineup the other night against Louisville he had 17 points and 15 rebounds that kind of took a backseat for Duke lets see whats up here well Philip whenever youre tying up that shoe normally its going to be the ankle and right now you get you see Philips reaction so he immediately goes to tie up that left shoe thats the an you see the ankle he lands on PJ Halls foot goes down but thats the old pickup basketball trick when you go tighten up that shoe you normally know that thats the ankle but you can still play through it so you get up Shake It Off get to the free throw line now number four scorer in the conference number four in rebounding at a terrific season outstanding career ACC preseason Player of the Year preseason AP allamerican as well makes 70 at the line youll have another one coming OB we go back and talk about in shoot around earlier today Duke brings out the flat screen and we sit behind the flat screen and watch and Chris Carell going over the scouting report and I mean it was they were locked in its different from the film sessions I used to be in back in the day where im nodding off in the back probably because they had them standing up on the court thats a Difference Maker right there if if they would have made me stand up in class I would have been a much better student OB is that the reason why that is it they want to go there heres Hall you Virginia guys you have a different standard than the rest of us heres Beetle backing it away shot clock at five locked away and stolen by pelowski theyll trigger it for Proctor outside for roach hell penetrate Mitchell grabs the rebound Kapowski went up high and that was inside the cylinder so he interfered with it and itll be Clemson ball when we come back with 347 left in the half and Duke leading at 20 Hall who has not scored in the last 12 minutes for the Clemson Tigers that had better change quickly it really has to hes going to have to be special for them to get opportunity to win this game and trying to get him a look on the perimeter when the Duke was switching on the pick and roll action Caleb Fon on a great job getting back to PJ Hall forcing the turnover all right Meanwhile were what a week away between the rematch of the great rivalry of North Carolina and Duke at the first to two for the regular season of course on ESPN Foster straight on left that one short right now North Carolina is just absolutely rolling they absolutely are right now theyve shown to be the best team in the AC but a tough task for the tar Hills next week as they come into this building which of course is always going to be a difficult place to play especially in that rivalry lining up a long one Foster yes a triple 32 20 but this is when Duke is most dangerous when theyve got all the shooting on the floor we talked about the different guys who are 40 threepoint shooters for the Blue Devils and we didnt even mention Kyle filipowski whos dangerous from Beyond The Arc as well Clemson really cold one for their last 10 trying to end that Hunter couldnt do it left it Shy Foster just drilled that three a moment ago right now Caleb fer thats a mismatch youve got to be able to find a way to go past Ian def with the switch now theyre calling it out you got to clear everybody out tend to Applause Music shoot these are two teams that did not turn it over very much at all and Josh be held up and fouled so itll be Duke at Carolina and the first of those vaed tussles coming up next weekend the Blue Devils have been sharing the basketball extremely well youve got two 40 threepoint Shooters in the corner Tyrese rocker Proctor picks Jeremy roach who makes the extra pass to Caleb Foster stepping up knocking down another three OB you and I watched this team make nine threepoint field goals in the first half at Pittsburgh on the road they show just how dangerous they can be when theyre making shots Bowski with his second foul good good job Josh Beetle at the line beetle came off the bench last Saturday against Florida State gave a big boost with 12 points yeah he was really good and a big win for Clemson going to Florida state whos been playing great basketball now losing two backto back games at the tuck to Clemson and to North Carolina coming in Florida State still at 6 and three in ACC play close to the top Music roach bouncing for Mitchell off the fake Foster cant cash Applause in minute 40 to go here in the first half the scoop shot wont drop for Beetle loose ball on the deck kicked and saved by the Tigers will swing it Chase Hunter to the paint get yes sir nice play by Hunter getting to the painted area playing all two feet spinning and finishing in the blue so Duke taking the Timeout on top 3224 over the Tigers of Clemson when one of the payoffs there thats absolutely great to be able to do that but also to be able to hang out with Dicky B just watching a game in itself sitting on the couch hanging out thats a treat H the hall at the line as he was foued on a play by Caleb Foster number two on the youngster all at 80 its been a rugged first half for him and will drop in number one and two of the top teams in the SEC Square Off in our ESPN Sunday afternoon womens basketball match up Tennessee taking on Old Miss at the Pavilion coverage beginning at 300 Eastern time of course the wom college basketball South Carolina reigning Supreme great win at LSU this week was a spectacular environment that was a great game I was locked in from beginning to in on B Mitchell off Dallas first it up there comes free to Hall all these final moments belonging to the Tigers on the drive and kick heres Hunter alling upside keep it alive he T it right to McCain great opportunity for Clemson right there unable to knock down the three but that could have made it a one possession game going into the halftime locker room and now the Blue Devils with the opportunity to hold for the last shot this games tighter than you might have thought you know just a few minutes ago it looked like Duke was getting very comfortable not so much right now roach almost lost it its rejected right back in his face by Godfrey thats how the first half comes to an end big momentum to win this game unless one of those guys starts to do what hes capable of doing offensively they absolutely probably need both of them to be able to show up to win this game especially on the road in this environment filipowski first touch of the second half barricaded in along the Baseline and hes going to travel with it and turn it over so good start for the Tigers and the Tigers trapping defensively we didnt see a lot of that in the first half filipowski caught it on the Block but Brad Brown up making the change and bringing the double team force a turnover in the first possession G Clemson has not won on this floor since the 9495 season its 20 consecutive losses to Duke at Cameron indor but Duke has suffered two defeats here this year heres Hall and that one didnt touch thing and itll go the other way as lets bring in myrra from here you got the camera conundrum where obviously Brad brell talked about taking the crowd out of it obviously limiting turnovers Clemson had four keep the Devils out of transition Duke have 10 fast break points they did do a good job of making at ugly Clemson shot 29 Clemson 38 and then dont make Sports Center theres still a lot of time for them to end up on the wrong side of a top 10 play fellas yeah thats a TBD as far as dont make sports center but talking about those turnovers Clemson did not turn it over for the first 10 minutes of the game all of those came in the second half of the first half and Clemson had a lead through those first 10 minutes up 18 to 15 and thats when Duke went on the Run was though turnover started and went on that run and built the lead up to 12 but Clemson closed the first half with a 60 run that allowed him to make it respectable going into the halftime locker room with some momentum EJ Hall with his first foul and another one on the way for filipowski a 70 foul shooter seven double doubles for the season as 23 in his career a 7 foot sophomore with his second shot he has four points its been quite a day for him so far it has been but you mentioned the sophomores OB when you start thinking about Philip hsky Mark Mitchell and Tyrese Proctor those three guys all could have entered the NBA draft a season ago all deciding to come back and theyre now starting just showed that promise that we expected to see from them last season the trio was spectacular and Louisville and looking to get a win here at home on the other side of the floor Gerard had a pretty good look on that curl so even the relatively easy shots hes not making hes not taking many either Dan off the fake filipowski straight on lot of iron but cant hit it 3426 the Blue Devil gting for their 15th win of the season thats filipowski with the stuff clean block to trigger the break Foster will give it up so does Mitchell Foster oh thats a tough shot in traffic and Caleb Boston known as a shooter but does a great job attacking the rim when you get ran off the threepoint line youve got to have something extra in your package Caleb FS is showing hes got all Fe shean no oh and they whistle and the opening few minutes here of the second half 1758 to go and theyre going to get Duke and filipowski for his third you talk about filipowski has been a little quiet on the offensive in but look what he does to separate and give space to his teammate he seals off not one but two Clemson Defenders to give Kay the Foster an easy run to the basket and three fouls on the big fella but I give him credit hes also got four block shots in this game so he is has been aggressive on the defensive end attacking Clemson shots when they go to the rim hes going to take a seat as Ryan young checks in for Philip palski but he is going after everything on the defensive end of the floor just a little overaggressive on that last possession so shelin a 68 Jr well see if we hear more from him in the second half itsit 17 rebounds in their win over pit hes been tremendous on the glass but pretty quiet himself yeah you talk about two Row games for shefin between Alabama and Pittsburgh he had 31 rebounds combined in those two games its really been an X Factor for the Tigers Foster with a pull up cant drain it now Gerard averaging 15 a game hes about 20 a game in the ACC when they win 11 a game when they lose in conference Play heres Hall way short his tough day continues it was tapped up by Duke and he just got coached hard by Brad Brownell who stepped on to the floor to speak to PJ Hall to make sure he could hear him with a loud voice on that possession BR trying to get Clemson back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 21 although they were robbed last year they should have gone they got you can say that about a number of years that Brad brell has been on the sidelines for the Clemson Tigers youre right Wiggs on the entry will hit two John C Wiggins 610 sophomore with a bucket back to sixpoint Applause game now youre here at Cameron so youre always waiting for the Breakaway for Duke for them to find fifth gear and take off as the opponent you have to do everything you can to find that moment and keep it from happening heres Mitchell swatted Away by Hall but a foul with exactly 17 minutes to go and OB how about the scoring in the NBA this week Joel embiid 70 points Carl Anthony Town 62 Devin Booker 62 last night Luca Don 73 points whats going on I tell you what its a number of guys on this floor right now Mark Mitchell jar McCain Caleb Foster Ty SP its a bunch of guys PJ Hall that want to be playing in that League sometime soon especially when you see those type of numbers going up in the lane bulling his way in tough tough play by RJ Godfrey who comes in averaging seven a game he has five points so far today fivepoint lead for the Blue Devils and the ball Foster drives it and draws the foul hes not afraid he goes in very strong The Freshman from Harrisburg North Carolina you always wonder about the first you know four or five minutes in the second half against the Blue Devils and I know Brad brell talks about this with his team all the time when he comes in here has been unable to solve it because they havent won here and so so long in the last 20 tries but when Duke decides okay today were going to put the game on Ice often times it is the first five minutes of the second half it absolutely is and when you think about this Clemson team you also have to remember this is a veteran Laden team so youve got a number of guys who have the experience of being here PJ Hall the last time he played in this building 26 points and double figured rebound so a double double double for him Joe Gerards had big games in this building so these guys can get going at any time but they cant waste time to make it happen d with a kick to the corner and its going to be in and out wiggins got a really nice look hes 38 out Beyond a threepoint line and again in traffic Proctor will draw the foul and so we have a timeout with 1553 to go foul on beetle a fivepoint lead for the Blue Devils on Clemson so gestures anyway Proctor at the line S it 3832 another one on the way as we bring in Myron both coaches obviously talking at halftime but what they want to see improve Baran now said hey stay the course play some great defense down the stretch and he also said because theyre packing the lane you got to make that extra pass John shy said we have to finish that has to be the theme of the second half also he said rebounder we can be a lot better in that area in the second half one of the things that John CH knows very well Yan sheon is a guy that can pick up extra possessions on the offensive glass so you have to know where he is at all times and on Q shein comes up with the offensive rebound D straight on yes finally a threepointer and they desperately need Joe Gerard number 11 to show up here in the second half but it comes off of just as myin was talking about the glass you got to take care of the glass sh knows that they can be better and you always have to account for where seon is geard one for five and a return by McCain whos out 42 at the threepoint stripe hes a freshman and ranked by ESPN the number one high school player out of California out of Sacramento Gerard feeding up top underneath sheflin waited beautifully nice hesitation and got the hoop and sheins taking over the last couple possessions for the tigers with PJ Hall on the bench rad Bell has his guide they can play through and Ian sefin John sire raved about Ian sefin earlier today talking about he is the key to what to their success sticking right with Duke here in the second half McCain to the Baseline Scoops it up Jared McCain responding backto back buckets for him on this end of the floor you talked about being the California pror year his familys actually moved from California you too Durham to be a to be a part of each and every one of his games Lance and Gina both in the stands here today Clark got a good looking absolutely Buri to three his first basket that cuts it to a fourpoint game Zack Clark the veteran stepping up and delivering when his team needs him most UN set the screen now back inside the paint off the fake hes fouled shein with the personal as he went for the block Music so we look at the first five minutes into the second half the shein picks up his foul the second the Tigers sticking right there three for n for the field yeah Clemson Clemson was standing that run but you think about the rebounds you look at Clemson out rebounding Duke and you talk about the offensive rebounds throughout that first stretch that has allowed them to cut what was a sixpoint halftime depit now down to four and a chance to cut into that lead even more after the Miss free throw by Young Kowski to check in in a moment he said a very up and down day here and so has PJ Hall who is two for eight and OB is just a small thing we see Philip palsky as hes sitting there holding on to that left ankle remember he turned that left ankle earlier in the game of course playing through it but you watch him walk on to the floor theres a little bit of a limp right there hes not playing at 100 at this moment you talk about Hall having trouble scoring but he does have eight rebounds took by five J buried to three moments ago bouncing here for Hall LS a contact short loose into the corner out it goes and itll stay on his end with 1323 to go in the contest grab BR now right in burs m ear saying that is a foul theres a lot of contact when PJ Hall gets the basketball in the painted area and you see two of nine from the field for PJ Hall its been a struggle and remember he made his first two shots he may scor the first possession and knock down a three so he hasnt gotten a field goal going in probably the last 20 plus minutes of playing time Gerard giving it up for Godfrey Godfrey on filipowski it rolls off the 10 back right for Hall and he will lay it in and take the hit but look at the exuberation from PJ Hall after the offensive rebound John Shire as myON talked about told his team weve got to take care of our defensive glass another offensive rebound opportunity and it ends up being a opportunity for a threepoint play as you see PJ Hall excited about his work in the paint stward a second foul so chance for three here nine points but a 610 senior set a couple of monster games this season middle of January went for 31 and 17 against Georgia Tech this is the closest that Clemson has been in the second Applause half and a travel Duke gives it away and a travel by Proctor only their fifth turnover but this KES runson chance to tie it or take the lead a miscommunication between sea Stewart and Proctor on what they were running offensively immediately Stewarts going to come out of the game in turn for the veteran Ryan young but as you mentioned now youre talking with Crimson with some momentum right here on the offensive in the floor looking to tie or take their first lead thatll go the other way a whistle here against Clemson with 1248 remaining and trailing by two and take a look at this Godfrey on the dribble hand off oh man I tell you what he was actually moving out of the way that that contact was created by Proctor Godfrey with the personal I guess and bra Rano does not agree with that call Applause over Music Roach Proctor will back it up Proctor trying to get loose on the follow away hit it and he hit the deck hes been the guy this afternoon for the Blue Devils and steps up and makes a big basket just to give Duke a little more separation sophomore with 13 Clark will pull and too strong 4743 poor bouncing filipowski an extra pass and a kick at 1157 to go so it remains a tight one here just under 12 minutes at Cameron Endor Duke by Applause four contact he tried to play around the contact this year he has played through the contact going through Defenders finishing especially with the life left hand and the pullup turnaround jumper so now filipowski showing off all of his skills throughout the season however today has not been the day for him only one of six from the field four rebounds after coming off a 175 rebound performance in Louisville earlier in the week now typically he is the dude for the dke Blue Devils but at the end of the evening well find out if the Dude abides or not because Clemson has other ideas 4743 and a close one just under 12 minutes yeah weve given Duke a lot of credit for the way theyve guarded Gerard we got to also give CL a lot of credit for the way theyve boted up Philip palski Hunter goes in strong after they stole the inbounds pass and he draws the foul and how about PJ Hall making the play Stealing the inbounds pass this is four on filipowski just picked up his fourth foul thats another thing thats hampered him throughout this game foul trouble and a lot of that is because they Clemson has attacked him on the other end of the floor we mentioned the four block shots however hes picked up now that fourth foul so John Shire will bring on the youngster McCain and filipowski to the bench but a much smaller lineup OB so now who do you have on the floor that can keep an shefin off the off defensive glass thats going to be the challenge for the Blue Devils with this smaller lineup I have Miss at the line they make 81 of their foul shots in ACC play the Tigers do will it come down to that heres McCain just into the game a feather a touch for the Triple knockdown shooter Jared McCain it doesnt matter if hes been in there or hes coming right off the bench hes locked and loaded every time he touches the floor at a 20point game against pit when you in for 14 so he can do that and make a difference hun with the bouns and a shove from behind by Young hell commit the personal Jared McCain snaking the screen and roll gets the switch miscommunication Joe jar cant get back in time as he knocks down the three ball to the Delight of mom and dad then again mom is not watching cant cant even bear to watch at times heres Gerard round and outs only made one shot today the former Syracuse star very cold one roach got open pulls it the three wont drop fortunate break for the Tigers a little too tricky right there yeah but a dunk there by she nice save yeah almost cost him two points and back to a fourpoint game and anybodys contest here in these last 11 filipowski on the bench for Duke with four fouls McCain on Gerard trying to weave his way inside closer in traffic it rolls home we talked about the sophomores earlier OB but right now its a freshman starting to take over Jared McCain has been the answer for the blue doubles here in this second half Gerard kicks for Hunter the three shein so tough on the offensive glass got it free to Gerard here comes a triple he knocks it in Ian sein continues to make plays John Shire talked about him he raved about him he gives his team energy he gives his team effort and now he gives him another Second Chance opportunity for Gerard to knock down the three do you see that advantage on the offensive HS 10 to one Tigers 15 to0 second chance points all in favor of the tigers that has been the equalizer for them in this game roach cant scoop it in shein another rebound and he has Applause eight Tigers trying to snap a 20 game losing skid in this building under with the bounce Hall in tight and hell draw the foul before the shot fouled on the floor 9913 to play and sefer has been a Difference Maker he does a great job handling a tough pass to finish it off with the dunk and then getting the job done on the offensive glass coming up with the second chance opportunity for Jo jard dropping the dime as Gerard knocks down the three ball and just like that its a one possession game here at Cameron Joe Gerard taken to the bench for a couple of moments but hes hit a couple of shots here in the second half wide open underneath its Godfrey great execution on the sideline out of bounds play John Shire wants to talk it over as Brad Brownell recognizes his team hung around in that first 5 minutes OB and now theyve given themselves a chance it has made all the difference they are alive and kick it the tigers with the nice find Godfrey finishes off and makes it a onepoint game filipowski on the bench hes in foul trouble Mitchell had a terrific first half and a whistle before the shot so no basket there with 856 to go and a onepoint game thatll go against the Tigers and Josh Beetle second foul and willll put Duke to the line for one and one and McCain has been the Difference Maker for the the Blue Devils down the stretch will you consider the fact KY filipowski playing with those four fouls they have turned to Jared McCain who has provided a number of buckets as of late for a blue double good foul shooter too Music 84 got a lot of Firepower on the bench dont you right now roach as well and you consider roach who wasnt I mean really was a game time decision coming into this one wasnt supposed to play today they prepared to not have him on the floor and wondering if you know that ankle was starting to bother him as he sat around allowing it to get tight Bowski 18 points a game appr 14 points a game big losses yeah the two leading scores for a blue b sitting side by side watching these young players try to bring them home here in the home court B on a high post good feed getting it downstairs thatll roll out for Godfrey hell get a second chance at it long one Hunter no thre for the threepointer and Young comes away with a big rebound but another offensive rebound for the Tigers just missing the three Proctor kicks outside Foster no young cradles it has it stolen away taken away by the Tigers Clark ripped it right out of his hand heres Gerard and fouled on it in the act of attempting a three hell be at the line for three shots one of the best free throw shooters the ACC has seen over the past Four Seasons now goes to the free throw line with an opportunity to tie this game at 54 Foster with his third Gerard Applause 92 the fifth year man out of Glenns Falls New York drops in number one of three and Obi as we go through the league you and I have seen a number of teams of course RJ Davis shooting 95 leades the league in free throw shooting but there are a bunch of guys who shoot over 90 throughout the ACC and we see the numbers for Joe Gerard averaging over 20 points per game in the ACC wins only 11 in the losses and now with that free throw hes at nine points and continues to climb I think he will have a lot to say about what happens over the remaining 813 of this game as to whether the Tigers can walk away from here with the win or not step out for the moment so who do the Blue Devils turn to now at the 8minute Mark locked up at 54 I believe its got to be McCain McCain penetrates yes and and John Shire understands when you got a hot hand you continue to feed it running action right there to get the basketball in Jared McCains hands and allowing him to go make a Applause play and who swings it back for gfri heres Hall way downt yes he drills the three they had not LED since the score was 18 1550 and now the Tigers up by Applause one 5756 Applause Clemson K swinging for Mitchell a dribble down and that rolls off the 10 right back up no young he couldnt get thats his second offensive rebound Ryan young unable to convert into Second Chance points allows the Tigers to be able to build on their first lead in 25 minutes of game action and shy cant wait hes got filipowski and roach ready to check in at the scores table Hall over the shoulder in and out approaching 6 and A2 minutes to go and Cameron indor Proctor wants that paint again Applause young handing off M tied up in the lane he was blocked out heres Proctor with a three got it dke by two and a timeout 606 to go Duke in front of the Tigers 59 57 I think Im ready for this heck yeah with E Trade youre ready today the tigers making the comeback only one turnover in the second half has allowed them to get back into this game Ian shefin on the offensive glass kicking it out to Joe Gerard PJ Hall stepping up making big plays and just like that weve got ourselves a ball game here in Cameron but theres been one guy who has stepped up with the Blue Devils all afternoon long tyres Proctor four threepoint field goals made in backto back games which ties a career high 40 points in the last two games and OB if they want to win he cant be done yet Jared McCain also showing up in a big way in the second half for Duke with 12 points Joe jard with nine since halftime for the Clemson Tigers he was a on factor in the first half but hes back in there again he gets a touch here he takes to the paint and a lay it in you always love to see what coaches go to out of a timeout a call timeout by Brad Brownell to make sure they got a good possession offense he goes to Gerard who delivers with the easy layup so tied at 59 and now you see Clemson going Zone defensively throwing a bit of a sixth ranked Kentucky taken on Arkansas that game will begin on ESPN news and we C theight with Alabama hosting LSU at Coleman Coliseum both available on the ESPN app so filipowski short rims the first one filipowski now two of five from the free throw line its been a little bit of a struggle for flip from the field and from the free throw line now as he tries to give the Blue Devils a lead back and missed the pair in a tie game under five and a half Applause left Chase Hunter to the Lane came free to Hall and he knows exactly what to do with it right back to the 10 but no fading away from the basket that was take on any contact that was going to be waiting for PJ Hall at The Rim he went through the contact on that possession all at 15 Clemson by two roach playing on a bad ankle which he turned this week against Louisville Slams on the breaks Mitchell tried the window and draws the foul so itll be Mark Mitchell to the line where he makes 73 hit by Ian shean thats three on the 68 junr but Obie weve got to mention at this point there are a number of ways you lose basketball games one turnovers both teams have handled the basketball extremely well another one has been Ill rebound it but more importantly free throws Duke right now 12 of 22 from the free throw line thats something that John CH can look back at and say that his team did not do well in this game especially if they lose another game on their home floor thats one of the areas theyre going to have to look at typically a very reliable foul shooting team they make 75 so theyve been off Applause today and this to try and retighten he does that the sixth time weve had a tie score 61 all gide swings for Hall Beetle heres Wiggins and Hall over the top he commits the foul thats his third but that was great ball Movement by the Clemson Tigers Wiggins got a wide open look just unable to knock it down Brad Brown now has to be happy with that offensive possession but those are the shots that youre going to have to make if you want to be Duke in this building youve got to take advantage of those easy opportunities will lead to two shots for Jeremy roach who is the best foul shooter on the floor for the Duke Blue Devils at 86 although they have had a bad day at the Applause strike again Clemson has not won on this floor since January of 1995 and that was a year that was different for for Duke simply because Coach K was not coaching in 95 I can remember well because I was playing in 95 and so there were many teams that came into this building that got wins that normally would not Duke two Beetle underneath and whistle tough sleding anything inside on either end of the floor here great cut by Beetle though to make himself available number one on Music roach so Josh Beetle The Freshman to the line coming into this game uses n out of 17 at the foul line but makes number one Tigers next home game part of ACC networks double header Tuesday night Syracuse and VC at 700 eastern then Clemson hosting Louisville at Little John at 900 eastern Applause time great ACC basketball action around this time as we see certain teams start to separate themselves but weve got a log Jam right in the middle you start looking at the group of teams with three losses and the road team starting to have a lot of success in ACC play now Duke in the middle of that what youre talking about at 52 in the conference Clemson at 3 and four in the ACC tied at Music Applause 63 roach so good beond the threepoint line at least hes perfectly healthy at 46 shot clock to seven filipowski looking for help shot clock down to three the scoop shot wont go the follow wont go by Mitchell Clemson on the run out and the scoop on this end will drop for Hunter and Clemson reclaims the lead the ninth time the lead has changed hands 6563 filipowski off the fake bangging into Hall again and another whistle and another one and now PJ Hall has four fouls so the both of Marquee big man with four fouls which of these guys is going to be able to stay on the floor down the stretches our got tyres brocker steps in from the threepoint line and is unable to finish it but however Chase Hunter with the finger rope team that needs this win in the worst way however the Duke Blue Devils dont want to give away another win on their home floor to an ACC team having lost to the pit Panthers rather stunningly 80 to 76 on this court so its filipowski at the line and a big sophomore 7 ft 250 lb will drop in the first one just three out of seven at the foul line which has not been a friend of the Duke Blue Devils but it was here for the big guy and he has tied it at 65 Ryan young going to sub in for Jeremy roach we got to mention roach playing on a sore ankle so John Shire going offensive defensive substitutions and going big here and shean back for Hall Gerard flips it up and hits two hes had a solid second half hasnt he he absolutely has also made two threepointers which ties him for Denis Scott for third all time in ACC history with 351 Music threes the K way outside Proctor he cant stick it filipowski kept it alive and another effort from McCain and short filipowski fortunate to be still in this game with all the contact he created on that possession playing before fouls not sure that was a smart attempt for flip however did not get penalized for it now the Tigers trying to increase their lead under 220 to play and the feed for Hall denied by Young Who commits the foul but thats why Ryan young is in the game right now so that he can guard PJ Hall and Kyle filipowski playing with those four fouls does not have to defend PJ Hall on the Block and now we see for the offensive and Jeremy roach at the table coming back into the game young foul number three to put Hall to the line the senior preseason First Team all ACC Applause and hits number one now hes perfect at the line hes four for four and as you mentioned roach back on and young steps out for John shy and you go back to the beginning of the second half when we showed the struggles that PJ Hall was dealing with only two for nine from the field at the time now you look up a double double 16 points and 10 rebounds for PJ Hall who is just stuck to the script and gone about playing his game here in the Rowdy environment and giving his team a fourpoint lead he really quieted the crowd didnt he and heres a timeout for the Duke Blue Devils 17 for Hall 6965 Clemson opening up a fourpoint Advantage with about two minutes to go and PJ Hall got off to a great start early knock down his first two but then struggled middle in the middle part of this game not just one air ball but actually two two air balls in this short range but then went over got Coast up a little bit by Brad Brownell and all of a sudden we saw the PJ Hall we move and were expecting to show up in this game the offensive rebound to put back knocks down a huge three and then playing with Force Through the paint PJ hall now with a double double 16 and 10 give me 17 and 10 10 points in the second half theyve needed every one of them they leaded 69 65 Duke Blue Devils all time at Cameron indor 955 wins just 173 losses thats 85 that theyve won in this building we came on the year today though talking about how unusual it is theyve already been beaten twice here in November by Arizona and then just a Week Ago by the pit Panthers are they going to fall again today or can they their way back to the lead in the victory heres filipowski leaning in hell draw the foul and head off to the line again hit by shein number Music four 206 showing and a sevenfooter to shoot he has had a rough day courtesy of the Clemson Tigers I think its so huge that Joe Gerard showed up in the second half regardless of how this game finishes up because he was a nonfactor in the first 20 minutes his second half hes been very tough he has 13 points Clemson cant win without him being productive John CH knew that going into this game talked about his numbers and the losses they wanted to Lim his production but they havent been able to do it in the second half Kowski for the second time misses two but great play by McCain coming up getting the turnover Bowski working hard short it has not been his day is it going to be Clemsons leading 6965 and the basketball back for the Tigers shein looking inside nothing there and picked off the Steel by McCain he goes in strong and lays it in a minute and 28 well see if they reset the clock couple of seconds ticked off there Jared Music McCain 21 points scored 20 in the loss here against Pittsburgh and hes been the star of this second half of the Blue Devil heres Gerard now 119 to go lemson by two Gerard wont shoot it shefflin bobbled it and gave it away one minute to Music play McCain step back heres the three rebound tipped by Philip powski he went for the save and saved it back to Clemson Clark gives it up smart play by Clemson Dont Force anything use as much shot clock as you can I would expect to see the basketball in the hands of PJ hall right now Mark Mitchell trying to defend him thats a tough match up for Mitchell eight to shoot it entry pass knocked Away by Mitchell a steal for Duke 20 seconds to go and a timeout with 192 John sh tried to give his team an opportunity to see if they could get a good look in transition but when they didnt have anything a good time out and you look at the size of the guards with Hunter and Beetle out there much bigger in stature than Gerard Co gets it in Kapowski heading for the lane on the spin had made it he hit the shot and fouled as well with 152 to go shein with foul number five and somehow the sevenfooter got it to Applause go this is what you respect about K filipowski regardless of the way the evening has gone for him thus far still finds a way to go out and make a play for his team only his second field goal of the game but it was a a huge one for the Blue Devils as it ties the score at 69 an opportunity to give them the lead at the free throw on remember Cory hes only four for 10 at the line it has been a fierce struggle today and he made it when he needed to didnt he Duke by one Thompson does have two timeouts remaining get it across half court you call the timeout and get organized with 124 to go and a timeout Tigers no game similar to what we saw from the Blue Devils you do the same thing if there is contact so clock to get it in right in front of the Applause crazies Hunter Hall working on filipowski and the lane and draws the foul with 74 seconds thats what you want youre taking your best player youre saying go out and take us home and not only does he get to the free throw line with an opportunity to tie and give his team a lead he also fouls out Kyle filipowski picking up that fifth with PJ Hall attacking the basket great execution once again you get the basketball in the hands of PJ H had he spun back Jeremy roach would have come away with they steal but PJ Hall is strong enough to go through the game in shefflin out of the game for Clemson which is huge even bigger palowski now disqualify from this game and will have to watch if it does go into the extra session so here comes number one for the senior PJ Hall trying to tie it and he does at 70 and now for the lead another offensive defensive substitution Godfrey coming into the game for Joe Gerard the Duke Blue Devils out of timeouts the 610 PJ Hall and put the Clemson Tigers in front he has 18 points the second on the way and the Tigers lead it 71 1 70 and they take a timeout 74 presence for the Tigers and is it going to pay off Music here roach is going to inbound no pressure on him heres Proctor Proctor across midcourt Proctor looking to get a shot in the air round the back he fires it up there left it well short there is a whistle a foul on the play with at point four on the Applause clock my goodness with the clock winding down getting inside a second point4 and a foul here against Josh Beetle and the Tigers but this is the reason why you want to go to the basket you dont want to settle and theres a lot of contact on there thats a foul OB you look at the left arm of beetle it makes contact with the right arm of tyres Proctor as hes shooting the basketball thats a good call thats a foul and Proctor now has the pressure on him to go to the free throw line and see if he can win this game and the officials Bert Smith Lamar Simpson Tommy morsey also going to the monitor to see if maybe more time needs to be put on the clock here less than half a second proctor by the way a 72 fou shooter take another look as he went around the back and you look look at the contact the right arm of tyres Proctor as he goes to shoot the basketball Beetle gets contact on that right arm throwing off that shot that is the right call so this will be two shots for Tyrese Proctor the sophomore from Sydney Australia as he draws the foul they have set the clock at 1 second remaining and lets also remember although Proctor is two for two at the line Duke 19 of 31 at the free throw line they blocked a lot of points at the free throw line throughout this game so Proctor to shoot two and hits number one to tie the game and another one coming to put Duke in front what a finish to this one Applause everybody holding their breath here he makes the pair Duke lead 7271 1 second to go Gerard trying to get it in Long pass knocked around and Duke cradles in and they win the ball game 7271 the final today at Cameron Andor Tyrese Proctor goes to the line
