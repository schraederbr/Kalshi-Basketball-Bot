explain later in the broadcast with Coach they had a lead this year at the half at OU and at LSU yeah thats and thats paused for concern if youre Cal and youre the basketball coaching staff and players that should get your attention so they know that Cal is coming in hungry though and Rick Cabrera in his second season on the bench at Northwestern State we both had a chance to visit with him and Coach that is hoping to have this team turned around uh from the do drums that theyve been over the last couple of years hes a veteran hes been a lot of places and the three on the way and good so Landing zuman able to get the bucket to get it going for Northwestern State yeah and heres that extended pressure they want to try to get some time off the clock make the cow Bears operate on a shorter clock drip to the basketball and Northwestern State comes out of there with it John Sanders with the dish and good defense at The Rim how about the patient or the uh pressure by sto yakovich to follow that play and the rebound Tapped Out of Bounds it will stay with K how about we talk about story elovichs offense he shows the def I mentioned it for a reason Dave hes LED their team almost in blocks as a guard and he avoids the contact you know avoids the body but great job of uh blocking shots and keeping the ball in play and then here we go in the other direction blackshirt dishes for petritis and the rebound controlled by Willie Williams North Western State comes in on a two game win streak including wins in their last two Road games Thomas underneath contested shot goes in for Williams one thing that you dont want to do is give Northwestern State a reason to think that theyve got a chance to win this game today coach no and Cs been behind the last couple games and I think they have to operate from behind and one thing you do is you give your opponents confidence doovic no good second chance bucket goes out P trus with a third chance able to cash it in and thats what Rus petrius does for his team I I cant tell you how many times this year hes kept the basketball alive and given his team a Reload petritis coming over in the off season transferring from Air Force Applause Mo Applause on gets tied up inside good hands by Ola Joseph well thats really a good Scrappy play the Bears need that Dave they need to come up with as many possessions as they can and as I mentioned they dominate their opponents on the on the glass so if you can just play good first shot defense and then just clean up on the glass youre off to the Applause RAC you can see that youve got a Zone matchup Zone by the demons theyre out there really playing a pretty good match up one on the ball everybody else talking and not trying to put two on the ball and the active matchup Zone forces the turnover as Colonel comes up with the basketball and then Northwestern State gives it right back the over and back but the the match up Z onone Rook cab did tell us thats something that he will definitely mix in today well its smart youre playing against the the Bears sometimes leaving your better and bigger players at The Rim is a good idea Cal can really crash you and hurt you on the glass so its not surprising to see a lot of teams elect to play a Zone against the Bears the dribble drive and one opportunity for black and the bears with an opportunity to tie this game with the old school threepoint play Dave look at this scheme and and this is something designed by the Cal coaches they put the smallest player on the floor in the high post now not many teams do that why because theres no help side you in the middle of the floor everybody one pass away and he just attacks you off the dribble too good that foul on jar uh Jared colel and by the way keep an eye on Colonel if they can get him in foul trouble thatd be big because hes tied for fifth in all of college basketball in blocks per game coming in at three per contest the three try is short Colonel right on Q with the second chance cant get it to go petritis throws it right back to Colonel and then the little floater inside touches every part of the rim but finally goes through for Micah Thomas well thats what Cals got to do now is get on the glass they cant give up second opportunity Second Chance opportunities theres a match up Zone again theyre talking communicating one in the ball Cs going to like to try to scream see if they can get some mismatches off the screen and thats a mismatch its a little bit too much space for Sanders no thats just you cant guard that if youre a big guy and youre black shirs on you youre going to hell put you on roller skates so he Retreat now he gets the open shot and now the other way the travel so a couple of misc now by Northwestern one on defense one on offense uh Dave keep your eye on on Cal and their bench and their rotations you know the good news is theyve got a really good long bench where they can play a lot of guys sometimes the chemistry is an issue but they really can put fresh guys on the floor and theyre going to continue to go to their bench and and try to keep the intensity up yeah Mark matsons roster is longer than Santas naughty list tied up inside and you see the frustration by Ola Joseph not happy that that he let himself get tied up thatll take us to a timeout a tight one early on and how about the Cal Bears ending a 12g game losing skid in the series great win for Shan Smith who played there at Stanford coach uh great win they dominated and that doesnt happen in that series they not only won they dominated and you had the game last night yeah it was a 20po win they hit 18 threes coach setting the school record for threes in a game yeah i love coach in those games yeah for sure everythings going in speaking of everything going in JT Warren comes in to the lineup and knocks down his first three well Northwestern State very confident theyve played Big Time teams in their gyms and theyre really confident right now as evident by their start Wilkinson the feed for of Joseph and he gets fouled and if that foul is on Colonel and I believe it is and it is indeed thats going to be two on hand that is and look at the range you know the Northwestern St their ability to knock down shots theyre knocking down 33 of the year but they look pretty comfortable you know if youre the cow bear is the one guy thats really been giving you a lift lately is Joshua Ola Joseph he had a phenomenal game I think 13 first half points just really nailing his threepoint shooting now but coach the one thing if youre an opponent coming in a play C right now You got to feel like youre going to get good shots if you look at effective field goal percentage which counts twos and threes only three teams only three in all of NCAA basketball are allowing their opponents to shoot at a higher rate well you that those are stats and I believe in Stats today but I also believe from watching Cal theyre capable of being a very good defensive team and Mark Manson the staff has addressed that and theyre going to continue to address it but theyve got some really good Defenders on this team its just a matter of putting it together and that takes time when you have a lot of new players it takes time to meld and your Chemistry sometimes you know is uh is off to start the season Addison Patterson and offensive foul is going to be called the the clear out by JC Riley Jr but you know you bring up a great point about defense offensive efficiency and heres a replay you can see there heres the uh the illegal screen wasnt set but you know most teams talk about most analytics everybody talks about offensive efficiency theres also a defensive efficiency and I think you brought up a great stat something that if youre a coach you can address ol Joseph and caber not happy with that call as uh the Calls going to go against Mitch Williams I like the scheme so far from Cal they what theyre doing is theyre putting their best scores in the high post theyre just simply saying youre going to have to guard us stop us with two guys well find an open man but theyre really you know most teams have trouble with oneonone players at the top oh Joseph sees an open and gets stripped from behind by Thomas the demons looking to add to to their modest lead and this has been the problem for Cal theyve trailed double digits at the half the last couple of games against Stanford and corn good news is theyve come back in both but thats not what you want to do uh have a steady die to that contested shot by Addison Patterson and the rebound is cleared by the Bears reaching fou by Patterson Ks got an advantage that they can go up and climb the glass Dave and get some breakout baskets theyve been at their best when they bounded theyve gotten clean rebounds and theyve pushed theyve got some great guys in transition uh and youve got to take advantage of teams quick teams like that that are trying to be pesky get offensive rebounds one of the other things C has done well coach and you know this theyve gotten to the free throw line and and Northwestern States already got five personals theyve only got one more to give before Cal start shooting free throw no thats not a fluke Cals been uh dominating their opponents by getting to the line more and as the season goes on theyre going to have to really lean on that St brookens s for black the feed inside and a nice finish by Dort well Dort with the Finish but how dangerous is Javon blackshire when hes healthy and hes getting his health back now and hes been resting a few games he is a nightmare to guard hes so quick and he gets into the paint now we distribute you mentioned help though we should mention no no Campbell today and BJ omat still out for the Bears as well yeah two big losses because those are two of their best defenders Patterson nearly lost it it goes right into the hands of Sanders cant get it to go second chance try and foul call itll be the first foul of the game going against the Bears but watch black show we talked about him Dave hes so quick off the dribble hes got the crossover you got the split Bo contact and he finds his big fella Dort Le Dort at The Rim really a nightmare if youre trying to guard the Bears youre going to have to try to find and devise a way to stop laure hes that good with basketball it was very successful player at Grand Canyon taking his team deep in the tournament last year substitutions coming on here for Cal as Christian Tucker will check in for the first time this afternoon so blackshire will get a breather Patterson able to knock down the free throw one or two at the line for him Music deep three for Wilkinson that wont fall and this is the key Rick Cabrera said he said his teams got to play D and get stops they got to have one in done and they get one there but then they they give it right back by dragging the pivot putot in the travel yeah theyve hurt themselves with some early turnovers against the bears bears fortunate but you know the bear team thats in the lineup right now theyve got some pretty good ball handlers theyve got some guys to attack so theyve got to get back on the board here and try to regain this lead Wilkinson for petritis back to Wilkinson oh how about that move doesnt get the Finish but the offensive rebound controlled by Dort then a whistle and the foul is going to go on Riley Dave if youre if if youre a chart or a statistic guy chart how many times Cal gets both feet in the paint offensively theyve got guys that can attack at will and now that makes the defense collapse and now their big guys are on the glass for either offensive rebounds or dishes its a its a pretty good stat the chart if youre interested in offensive Analytics tuer petritis shot clock down to seven petritis finds his way to the basket and finds his way to the free throw line in the process and not a lot there at the end of the clock but when the Bears need it they have some guys that can finish at the rim and theyre not afraid to put the ball down and get there but this is what they do they get to the free throw line sometimes its not a pretty basketball but you dont care about Aesthetics Dave just get me to the free throw line and as you mentioned get some guys in foul trouble getting the bonus and Chip Away way that foul going on lato lau and already seven fouls so theyre going to spend a lot of time at the free throw line here and Addison Patterson will check out now for the Wildcats well you know the advantage of depth Dave is that youve got the the ability to kind of over a long period of time wear down your opponents and thats what Cal can do if they utilize their their deep bench Applause recent foul here by Christian Tucker Cal on the other hand theyve been good so far thats only the second whistle of the game against them well they theyre trying to pick up the aggression Christian Tucker was a standout player at UTSA last year and he hes a hes a good player uh you know hes playing aggressively and thats okay to get some aggressive fouls early a nice step back for the finish for Sanders Music first points of the game for Sanders and hes a hes a player he can score hes been their most consistent player according to coach Cabrera how about 96 from the line and 44 from three Tucker on the other end off the heel rebound by sto yakovich whose dad is in attendance today yeah Pia is a pretty tough competitor himself and hes a pretty tough dad hes hes been tough on his son but you wonder why his sons pretty good player hes got a pretty good dad for a ro M this could be an Alist crowd here today because Jason kids AA tournament is taking place later today here at H brazilan and the mads just so happen to be playing The Warriors tomorrow the drive and the foul Ill tell you what that looked like pretty good verticality by Dort but hes still going to get called for the whistle and thats going to take us to the Under 12 timeout onepoint game right now here in Berkeley the Bears and the demons in a good one guy he told me he if I talk to his son a little bit help him to get a little more aggressive he said hell counsel my son who promptly lost his driving license I took it away from him the other day cuz he didnt follow some rules so PA maybe hell listen to you so we got a thing going on here Family Fair uh thats scary news cuz Ive got a 16yearold whos getting his drivers permit right now gets tough on him they want to drive that car but no but Pias dad uh obviously his career uh you know Mark for itself speaks for itself but uh hes been instrumental in his sons career and uh you know hes hes got pedigree thats for sure and be loved of course in nearby Sacramento beautiful find underneath But A Better Block yeah you when you got your jersey hanging up in the rafters uh thats pretty cool yeah no doubt Northwestern State hanging around looking to go back in front theyve had a modest lead most to this Music game Sanders gets the screen and then gets the foul as he drives inside thats going to be on D and thatll be the second foul of the game on Dort yeah thats pretty good defense by Northwestern State and then theyre coming back the other way and driving it you know CS do was a does a really good job if they can just avoid the body contact theyve got guys that can block the shot you know what they they also have guys that can alter your shots so many times shot blockers think they got to block shots if theyll just go up and avoid contact defensively they can get guys to alter their shots and theyve been at their best when theyve done that well Lau playing in his eighth game this season hes uh been a presence 7 ft thats thats tough to get around first free throw no good Northwestern State has left a couple points already at the line here this afternoon Applause Sanders able to knock down that one and that was you mentioned the free throw percentage for Sanders he came into this game hadnt only missed one in the entire season yeah thats pretty they good now now you see Northwestern State going from The Zone back to match up and now theyre manto man pretty much Mahoney gives it up for Wilkinson oh what a spin by Wilkinson and the Finish now you see him now you dont Dave thats what he does hes so good at slight a hand change of Direction so hard to guard oneonone Winson slips Sanders question State nearly turns it Applause over and now the drive by Sanders and hell draw the foul by Wilkinson thats going to be foul number two on Wilkinson yeah thats unfortunate but watch his a moves theres this crossover the spin and I mean he can use either hand Dave I just know how youd keep a guy like Jeremiah Wilkinson in front of you as a coach you say keep in front keep in front but oneonone thats an impossible task hes that talented and how about the fact that hes still only 18 years old hes not going to turn 19 until March Quick Pass inside and jumaan able to get the bucket thats off a double team I like the double team under the timeout you go to the coffin corner you got to try to make that a slow pass or a deflection the did a good job of trapping just didnt rotate out petritis and travel with the basketball so goes right back over to Northwestern State you know kale just searching for a a rotation Dave and theres two rotations two way you look at it they you can search for a defensive rotation that gets you guys going and get your team going and also an offense theyre just trying to get the right blend of guys theyve got a very deep bench but theyre trying to get their guys to go and just coordinate compliment each other yeah but it is tough When Youre missing two your keys as we mentioned with with om and those two guys are Stellar defensive players and believe me if you havent seen them play they can dominate defensively another bucket for Northwestern State to get the lead back to three blackshire stripped to the basketball from behind by Bettis and Bettis with an and one Petrus goes up and gets him with the body trus doesnt like to call but he got him with the body coach in Northwestern State looking to expand the Lead watch the the strip and now the n one you get the the tritis you know hes on your hip and you just lean in and you get the contact but look at the steel thats highway robbery and youre going the other direction now you got Cals best defender there who again just manages to bump uh bodies instead of just make them go over the top and you know thats really a hard thing to do Dave when youre teaching defense is to just play without your body Kell does a good job challenging shots but they got to keep their bodies out of the out of the out of the mix yeah you saw the season numbers there for love Bettis hes a guy who won a a national title at the Joo level he a great player now you see again Northwestern State theyre going to match up here now theyre going to switch and play their matchup Zone man in their area soov changes Direction after faking the pass and hell draw the whistle and and da thats what he does I mean when the Bears get in trouble its just its a its a constant youll see stokovich really with the ball in his hands and hes confident he can get to the rim or draw a foul he may be one of the more improved players in this country you look at his stats from last year at Stanford to what hes done for the Bears this year its night and day certainly looks comfortable that free throw ends a seven nothing Demons Run and works go well C right now has their best really their probably their best offensive lineup minus Wilkinson you put Wilkinson on the floor now youve got their best five offensive players but G definitely wants to get on the board but they going to have to Now find a way to stop this pesky team uh on the defensive end sosco checks back in out of the timeout or the stoppage kick ball here as blackshire got his foot on it and Mark Manson is applauding his team he likes the effort he likes you know you whether its a kickball or def flexion thats those are good stats anytime you can get your foot or hand anything on the ball youre youre digging youre playing Mark Matson no secret to success hes been a winner every level hes played on and coached that got the hardw to show it thats for sure Bettis pulls up on the Baseline a little bit too strong P trus able to come down down with the Applause rebound dakovic face fak the pass and then drives to the rack now too easy you cant give him any lane cuz hell get there and hell finish over the top or through you just like that Cal has it back to a twopoint Applause game pattis gets the screen gives it up for Pon keeping the dribble alive spins and fires no ball knocks back into Pattersons hands and hes able to convert well Johnny on the spot I mean that was unfortunate for Cal but the ball got popped loose and right into the Northwestern State players hands now if youre Cal you got to just you know you got to answer you cant allow this lead to grow seven Second Chance points in this game for Northwestern State and thats going to drive Mark Matson nut its given up that many Second Chance points to this team part of the reason why they have the lead with just over 7even minutes remaining here in the first half its the demons up by Music four Al so exciting time for the Bears Cal Bears Justin Willcox taking his team the LA Bowl against Nevada it should be fun stovic Cross Court for Pat chot clock down to five blure looks up at it recognizes pulls up at the elbow and connects D they have that the Bears have that and a lot of teams dont they can make plays at the end of a shot clock and manufacture a shot half doesnt in the game for him thats tied for the high for either Applause Squad ptis drows a double team and able to thread the needle to warrant for the Finish great look I mean does just a good job keeping your head up and finding your own teammate at The Rim nice job Northwestern State is shooting 56 this game dakovich finishes through some contact look like he got hit a couple of times no whistle but hell take the bucket he got bumped on the way to the basket and as he goes up sometimes youre a victim of your own strength and size but they you know they said play on but he says no problem Williams for Bettis Applause Music Applause Music titis back P sh how it he come down at that rebound smallest player on the floor and then he throws it away yeah I just got to look excited there but you know youre Cal Bears you you really youve got to go back and be thankful youve got a Andre sakovich who just gets to the rim bump bump bump score theyre not even trying to hide b bs height on the roster they got him at 511 a lot of times theyll bump up a guy to 6 fet but he got him at a 511 hit that back to the match up Bears chance to tie it or going front with a three oh Joseph strip to the basketball last touched and you saw great job by the officiating there as Greg Nixon put his hands in the air said I didnt see it well I love that I like an official who says I need some help but theres a strip good job you know Northwestern States been really active and thats the right call but theyve been very active defensively with their hands about sokovic da just sneak into the basket and boy is Rick Cabrera is as mad as I seen him like thats just a no no you dont give up a basket at The Rim under your own yeah just way too easy for the Cal Bears but the Bears fans liking it as they finally have tied the game at 26 Music Music he Music well Northwestern State coach Rook Cabrera instantly called time out after that he cannot give Cal those kind of opportunities no that wasnt a strategy session by the way Dave that was a butt Chey stovic eight of his 10 points have come in the last three Applause minutes JT Warren jum Mo comes over get the basketball and then takes the three and the rebound is controlled by sissoko thats good defense by Cal challenged shot and a clean rebound stovich great find oh and Joseph makes it count and he has been making a count Dave hes been on fire the last few games for Cal with the hot hand again early and the bears with a threepoint advantage Applause tettis crosses over against petritis shot clock at three and a travel by JT Warren now two really good defensive possessions but watch sakovich with the fine dead Corner thats what you do you spot up in the corner when youre penetrating all the defense is helping to the middle of the floor the corners are your best friend and Ola Joseph knows what to do bears are on a 7 nothing run this modest threepoint lead is their largest in the game and Coach theyve made their last six shot attempts well funny how it works They al also gotten some stops so play some good defense it tends to let you play a little better offensively players sometimes get amnesia forget that but the coaches are reminding him Im certain of that sto yakovich has been the driving force and hell draw the foul there I like that bve the driving force on the drive on the drive with some Force I like it but thats the been the recipe for Success when in doubt if theyre playing in the passing lanes youve got opening so heres theyre you know theyre playing tough on the screen theres one bump no call theres another and you know that was going to be a wide open shot if theres no foul call but stovich able to make plays for his team ninth foul is still a one inone situation here St alich doesnt care hell take both free throws imagine playing for a Hall of Famer you know college player and Mark Matson then you play for a player that play on a world championship with the Lakers then you have your dad paa you got some pretty good coaches around you Dave to push you a little bit and um you know I I really uh I really respect that uh Andres improved hes just gotten better since last year I think the skys a limit I think hes going to improve even more as his career goes on and Im sure hes met a few other names along the way coach well but yeah Mike m you know was playing coaching Stanford and he coached uh Mark Matson and boyed Mark Matson was for good years for Coach Mike Montgomery CU I coach against those teams no fun 12 years you were matching wi with the other Pack 12 pack 10 back then coach coaches that is able to kiss it off the glass and in now one thing I can tell you when you have good players youre a pretty good coach well that means youre a good recruiter though yeah we had pretty good players and some good coaches stovic to three and hes going to go to the line for three now R Cabrera again is saying why why give up the threepoint penalty oh thats a thats a no no gets absolutely bowled over by Dante Walker free throws coming up after the timeout here in Berkeley Music is now at ours inore stop by for Taste and go on the help line but you cant give up direct line penetration and Im sure Rick CER is talking about that because thats what happens Ola Joseph happy to be that wide open its n three of the Season St yovich had a lot of time to think about these free throws hes happy to be up there for three too because nothings come easy for the bears but you give the Bears three three free throws you get stokovich three and he knows what to do but uh you know good timeout uh an opportunity time out for Rick CER to talk to his guys defensively and for the Cal Bears now to reload and see if they can get going stovich two out of three second missed free throw today for for c nine of 11 at the line corner three for the demons wont fall Bettis slept it just a little bit short sooko with the board here come the Bears Al Joseph doesnt waste any time petrius comes up with an offensive board and hell get himself a trip to the free throw line I I really love Rus petrius because when you think the Bears have emptied their possession hes the one guy that just finds a way to Slither get his hand on the ball so many times he gets offensive tips and rebounds and and steals I mean a ton of steals on the year but watch him fly in there just poke the ball you want to tip the ball offensively and he does that defensively you dont want to tip the ball you want to grab it too but offensively just tip it and get it get opportunities hes given his team now a second chance opportunity the tritus has not been Stellar at the free throw line 66 on the season and he bricks them both yeah thats thats uh hes a competitor hes got to get those percentages Music up Sanders and now Pettis nice bounce pass inside for Williams and then Williams even better with the Finish yeah I dont know how he got that up over a taller Defender he put put in his left hand and just really scooped up a hook shot that was a shot thatll win you a game in horse yeah thats thats how you play your older brother or your dad stovich left all alone and thats a mistake defensively by the demons speaking of playing against your dad thats the one shot you might be able to get away with thats a great look by Andre stokovich from Deep hes up to 16 points in The Game season and career high for him is 26 so keep that in the back of your mind so Soo comes up with the defensive board and here come the bears looking add to the lead Music Soko leaves him well Applause short for Bettis Bettis will take it a little bit too strong and the shooting percentages for Northwestern State starting to drop a little bit much to the Delight of the Bears wide openen three w fall and the rebound is controlled by Sanders blackshire would like to have that one back no doubt and poked out of bounds well keep it on this end well how about the range again of Andre stovich I mean he steps back you know you cant leave him loose hes feeling really confident in his shot you know he can drive it but now hes knocking down that shot with ease Bears kind of zoning it up from the inside theyre playing Inside Out Underneath not going to give you anything to the rim they could throw out deep if they can oh what a pass no finish by Warren second chance try wont go and petrius makes sure there wont be a third chance try dives into the front row black Shir for of Joseph he cant get it to drop and its gotten wild all of a sudden here Bettis the euro step around petritis and last touched by the Applause demons well watch petrius I mean he always has his hands on the ball he saves it before it goes out of bounds gives his team another possession stands deep doesnt have any contact and now causes a block and the will going the other way thats a huge possession you dont want Northwestern State to get in there and tie the game or keep it close if you can such a big addition during the off seon out of the transfer portal he had a great career at Air Force does he still have to do his obligation to the academy Im guessing yes but Im sure hes have it if he gets up early I promise you that black Shir and the rebound controlled by the demons they could do two for one if they want trying to get it back to a one possession game the three by juman gets it to a twopoint game you know the NBA Dave I know you know it well thats thats an NBA move you come down you see if you can isolate get a two for one quick shot now they theyll get the ball back with a chance maybe the tire Take the Lead if Cal cant score only about a 1 second difference so the Bears how much time yeah the Bears theyre not theyre not going to worry about the time stovic is just going to go offensive rebound by blackshire P trus wide open look at the three that wont fall and we got a whistle underneath and the foul is going to go against the demons yeah youre right about the I got excited here two for one I said wait a minute but there was a 1 second differential but now if youre the demons you will get the ball back but youre going to have to endur some free throws from the Bears and Greg Greg Nixon veteran official talking to Greg Caba just explaining a few things here yeah the foul goes on Leu his first theyre going to verify theyre going to go to the Monitor and Mark Matson will take advantage of this call on the floor timeout wont sit down uh you know people ask all the time Dave what about the monitor I think its a good thing for college basketball does it delay the game yes does it get the call right keep the right guy you know from going out of the game with the inadvertent foul or wrong foul yeah so I I like it yeah its its tough to streamline it at this level the way theyve streamlined it not only in the NBA but in all the pro leagues because theyre able to have a central area where they can have a team reviewing it but because theres so many games and all the buildings arent necessarily wired to be able to send it back to a Central Area its different so they it takes a little bit longer sometimes in the college game that was pretty quick Cal bear is getting it right here they administrative staff Soko knocks down the free throw Cal here you want to try to get the stock going into the locker room as a momentum Builder you dont want to give up on a short clock 7 Seconds they got to be able to extend and the possession arrow does favor the Bears by the way so they look get the ball first out of the locker room still time and the block is going to make sure that there are no more points for the demons great work at The Rim by Cal I did it its a season so well see whether or not Colonel can avoid foul trouble hes going to start the second half hes sat on the bench the entire time with those two personals right well thats important you know you you want to play aggressive and not worry about fouls but you you got to make sure you keep yourself in the game Northwestern State coming out of the locker room active defensively no doubt trying to see if they could steal one this would be a signature win for them he speaking of stealing Reus Petrus gave me a fist bump I had to make sure my hand still that hell steal your hell steal anything from you hes such a good Defender but this is really important for your first few minutes blackshire pulls up cant get it to go Soko Taps it so Petr is able to get it doubling now theyre trying to double off the Zone in the corners stovic and theres a block Inside by Colonel but the bear is able to keep possession and now were going to get a whistle that you see the size uh you know Advantage for Cal I mean Northwestern State having a difficult time keeping the Bears off the offensive glass but how about that just like that jarald Colonel Gerald kernel picked up his third foul coach thats not good news for Northwestern State great news for the Bears open look and Ola Joseph knocks it down theres the one guy you dont want to give an open look to if if youre playing against the Bears Ola Josephs just been on fire hes been really on top of his game from the threepoint line This marks the largest lead of the game game for Cal waer is going to get called for a little bump here well this is a good test for Cal dve and what do I mean by that is they theyve taken a lead mind you its only a two possession lead a game a lead but at the same time can they sustain it can they now play defense get some stops string some consecutive stops together and see if they can put some more points on the board and stretch it to double figures first fou of the game on blackshire Sanders goes around the screen pulls up for a long two and tough shot knocks it down but if youre C youre more than happy to let a guy take a a long two well hes been pretty yeah and hes been pretty quiet now hes been their best scorer and hes only had two points to this point so GS done a good job on him hes got to step up for the def stovic has stepped up all afternoon first points of the second half for him yeah hes stepping up hes stepping by hes going by guys left and right uh really a difficult cover hes up to 18 Thomas changes Direction Sanders feeds it for Colonel cant get the push shot to go and here come the Bears again stovic just flips it for Petrus and hell say okay Ill give you a time well the Bears you can see now theyve got a little bit of a smile on their face you see the quick timeout you havent seen that in a while but the Cal bear is a happy Cal Bear Team leading taking their taking the lead out toight their fans are happy to see the smiles return here in Berkeley ninepoint lead for Cal on their home floor Music that hurt sh so uh yeah its its a great promotion and get some folks to the game out of the timeout Cal trying to get a stop to see if they can get a double digit Music Advantage Thomas had to pick up the dribble still plenty of time Baseline jumper is contested good job by Ola Joseph to get a hand in the face there of Sanders thats a really good possession defensively for Cal coming out of that timeout thats thats how you play defensely and now they do have a chance to get a double digit margin for the first time today nearly turned it over sto yakovich at three drills it well darkk Mansons happy with the three but hes hes Drilling you know make sure his guys get back defensively and dont relax theyve given up some leads he wants to see this intensity continue on the defensive in stovich 21 now in the game stovic is the only double digit score for either team this afternoon Point Blank missed by Colonel couldnt get the second chance to go Sanders able to track down the loose ball Thomas steps back into the corner Miss fires but the change is picked up and deposited by Willie Williams yeah its hard to play that you know you dont really play for Mis chot air balls you try to figure theyre going to come out 75 of the time on the opposite end Applause stovich has had himself an afternoon nearly lost it finds petritis leaves it short jumaan Dives to the floor and finally gets tied up and the possession arrow favors Northwestern State petritis has been a big part of it today but its been stoyanovich whos been the star and the cell Bears leading this one by 10 early in the second half Music and after the games Dave of holidays good time to be a sports fan isnt it a no doubt no shortage of games football womens basketball mens basketball its just been a I mean day after day so get off the cou though got to walk a little bit I Ill even occasionally stop on a hockey game coach no theres no question about Music that out of the timeout in Northwestern State they know this is uh this is a Time they either get back in the game or its going to be night night and sto yakovich trying to make it the ladder well he a ladder he climbed one and he put the shot back back on the in play wison open for three cant connect Colonel clears the rebound for the Music demons demons like to play Fast Cal doing a good job getting back in transition ptis taking on a much bigger Dort its a bad decision well and thats a good job defensively talked about earlier today just affecting the shot you have to block it just be there make him shoot over you stovic gets to the rack for two more I think youre going to see Pia smile I said I think Im not sure but his dad I think is up there going to hopefully cant crack a smile because his sons putting on a clinic I think were going to see his son done get his career high hes got 23 the career high is 26 floater off the glass and good for Bettis thats what you have to do against the Bears you have to pull up and take what they give you theyre not going to get all the way to the rim against some of their bigger guys inside in Dort sooko Its just tough only six points so far in this second half for the demons first ever meeting between these two schools in fact Cal hasnt played anybody out of the South Conference in four years and how about that bucket just great body control Wilkinson does that I mean thats thats thats a strength hes so good to the Applause rim Sanders pulls up just behind the elbow high off the glass and St yakovich able to come up with the rebound doing a good job of gang rebound I mean theyre playing much better defense Dave theyre really put putting their effort on the defensive end how about the stat line for stovich Coach its not only been to 23 points but hes got six boards three dimes two blocks yeah no hes hes got 12 blocks in the year pretty good for a guard Northwestern State the other way this one in danger getting away Patterson draws a whistle and the foul on the floor well you know we talked about Andre stokovich offensively but look at the the way hes he avoids contact with his body and and blocks and then he comes back on the other end I mean just his array of moves his hesitation slow to fast fast to slow spin moves thats just really uh a depth play with with the ball yeah and you know handles a lot nicer than a lot of six seven guys can its he he can play point if he has to I mean its not where you probably want him because hes such a good score but he he can handle the ball in direct traffic Patterson nearly lost Applause it and now another reaching foul on another drive by Patterson well thats the hardest thing to do Dave in in basketball I dont care what level youre at a college Pro High School keep your opponent and keep the ball handle in front of you youre one onone without help its just the offense is always at the advantage because they know where they want to go and you got to play without your hands you got to play with your feet and how about that Cal just picked up their third foul on a span of about 30 seconds yeah you know if youre Mark Manson and youre the Cal staff youre happy youre up double digits but you also know youve given up some leads this year so you want to close the deal you dont want to allow this team to get back in the game Patterson contested shot Dort and again coach like you said hes hes doing a great job in the paint altering shots well and and hes he does that hes done that this year I I think its a stat you go back to the Bill Russell days and you know he didnt always lead the league and block shots Im sure will Chamberlain did but Ill tell you what he did lead the league in Altered shots and and and thats something that young players need to know they can affect the game defensively by challenging and altering and and turn down shots yeah Music exactly Patterson oh that time D does come up with the block and how about the extra effort that was impressive by Mahoney as well well this is Cal basketball when theyre playing at their at their best I mean they you know they get to the rim theyve got some guys there Dort does a again a good job of avoiding body contact and just using his length to reject Mahoney throwing it off the demons to get the basketball for the Bears sto yakovich draws some contact and oo a little extra and a technical fouls been called on Patterson yeah that was a little chippy that that thats a good called by the officials unnecessary little bit of frustration and Rick Cabrera is making a quick sub you know thats a frustration play and you know I mean youre youre Andre sakovich you dont need to talk your games been all the talking now uh hes getting a couple guys frustrated but thats how good hes been today uh I think Andre might want to play some more early games what do you think about that those 1200 games those early games maybe uh maybe thats its been a good time for him yeah this is the earliest tip of the season for the Bears they did have a 100 start earlier this year well you know its something you havent seen in a cal many a couple of games now but youre seeing the Cal bear is not only playing well but theyre enjoying it theres a little bit of a bounce their step theres some Smiles on the floor and you know deservedly so theyve deserve it theyve earned it by the way they played well and you need some things to finally go right so the guys get that positive reinforcement coach yeah and it doesnt take a lot but sometimes it feels like it takes a lot Dort trying to back his way in crosscourt pass was dangerous Mahoney throws it off the underside of the rim and there numbers now with Northwest and theyre five on four Bettis finds the corner and jumaan able to cash it in yeah thats what happens when you when you lay down the other end you dont get a call or you fall and by Mahoney falling down this the wrong team to give up numbers to they they made you pay and he becomes the first double digit score today for Northwestern stovic with the three and just like that a new career high how good is that can you say he checked because thats what Andre stovic just did he just said Im going to shoot this ball I dont care how deep I am on the floor Im feeling it today 28 in the game for sto yakovich and the three triples match is his season Applause High wild sequence going on right there and the Bears finally come up with the basketball theyve got numbers Wilkinson pulls up for three and drills it and the Cal Bears finding their range backto back triples and the bears with their largest lead of the afternoon finally feeling a little breathing room here against the Northwestern demons in Berkeley you forget and you lead the guy with the best game does Dave you really youre trying so hard to stop the other teams best score and youre forgetting about the best shooter on the floor and and Lola Joseph has been there the best shooter well stovich I mean this is um as close as you can get to a perfect game yeah he hes not been perfect in terms of shooting hes missed a couple of shots missed a couple of free throws Wilkinson draws a foul but I mean coach nine of 13 from the field three of five from the from the threepoint line seven of eight from the free throw line and 27 minutes and hes got goose eggs in two other important categories no personals and no turnovers now I had a chance to talk with Andre before the game and you know he said hey thats on me last game I didnt come up aggressively and I said all right dont make me go to your dad now and have to get him in your ear uh but you know he he said right before the game uh and I I I respect it he said look I got to be aggressive and I will be and and he has been um it starts with being aggressive you you cant achieve anything if if you wait for the game to come to you Dave I know a lot of coaches I used to do it say hey dont press Let The Game come to you sometime if youre a good player you got to take it to the game and what hes done tonight to this afternoon hes taking it to the game well and especially you got to do a coach when you know youre playing and and no disrespect to Northwestern State but you know on paper an inferior opponent theyre theyre a team that is you know they can have their day theyve got some good players but theyre not as deep and you want to take advantage of those opportunities no most teams including Northwestern State dont have an answer for a 67 guard that can Elevate over the top you can play strong through contact and thats what Andre can do so hes just finding out really just exactly how good he is and he sometimes he forgets uh but tonight he has not forgotten throws AC Cross Court for Wilkinson who skies for the Finish you forget about Jeremiah Wilkinson theres a series of games Dave he had three consecutive 20 22 25 point games himself as a freshman so hes a capable score interior shot is good as Sanders adds to his point total he goes into double figures with 10 the only demon to get there so far now cenor from Detroit shows you his capabilities hes been somewhat quiet but hes capable and he will have a solid year for the demons yeah and excuse me jum moan is actually has 11 so hes in double figures as well Mahoney rattles out you see Mark Madson hes not done coaching his team he wants his team back in transition theyve given up leads this year he wants to make sure that they dont get too happy with with the lead and you know Mark Matson if you know him and I do uh he is a is a was it as aggressive a player as we Ive coached against and he wants his team to stay aggressive defensively Sprint the floor get back in transition how about the UPS there though you love seeing that out of Wilkinson well he makes it look easy Dave I mean hes so quick with the ball and he can finish he really gets to the rim and finishes over just about anybody yeah and you know what hes not the tallest guy on the floor but he can he can get up there with any of Music them Sanders is rejected by sto yakovich his third block of the game and then sto yakovich gets to the floor to tie up the basketball but how about the activity by Andre now hes so active again you know you say well hes got a this a lucky game for him getting a couple block shots theres nothing lucky about what hes done he came into the game and double figure your blocks with 10 so you add the three now hes up to 13 hes blocking the at a rate you know as high as his Big Fellas on his team and hes got some pretty good shot blockers on his team but thats amazing a guard with 13 blocks on the year he only had four blocks all of last year yeah thats an improvement and I said that earlier and I stand by it he to me is in my opinion one of the top and one of the most improved players not just that you know here in the C hes in the country hes doubled his production and hes just done everything offensively and defensively so hes got a career high in points a career high in blocks a season high in Applause rebounds thats all thats all and and Im checking to see the rebound the rebounds might be a career high now hes one off the career high for the rebounds I knew you wouldnt Applause done Baseline Drive and another shot alter by sasoko but this time theres going to be a foul call you know Dave sometimes s you players just need opportunities and here you can see the drive here thats a good aggressive Drive in here I think the body no question there was a body contact but you know players like like Andre stokovich you know some they just need the opportunity you know now hes got the opportunity his team needs him to step up hes a much more aggressive player than he was a year ago and you can see how its paid off plus lets not take this for granted hes also had a really good summer behind him the strength coaches here at T done a good job with him hes got them himself stronger bigger and its shown he plays with a lot of strength sto yakovich takes a seat and Im 5050 on whether or not we see him again theres still 8 minutes and 20 seconds remaining well if Northwestern State makes any run youll see him right and if they know about the career they they might they might you know sometimes coaches like to get a curtain call there but I think they also dont want to risk further injuries but well see well and if if Cal makes a run then then it goes the other way Cal pushes this thing to 20 or Plus its yeah its in the book petritis loses the basketball and then compounds it with the reaching foul thats going to take us to the under eight timeout so Northwestern State still battling its a 14point game here in Berkeley Music if you havent tried par recently your car and check out some of the Improvement made easy Applause Music Applause Applause aov has literally done it all today so uh if youre coaching him and youre trying to find something he needs to work come after you watch this one or what do you tell well usually you tell your players to be unselfish if Im coaching him I got to tell him hey continue doing what you do well worry about getting your assist total up another game but how good has he been I mean hes done it from everywhere his ability to step back knock down frees uh you know he can drive get to the foul line get to the basket look what hes done I mean hes on his way to a 30point game and hes back in you theres any question about whether he was going to come back in the game date hes in by the way the the three assists he does have they in some pretty impressive finds hes knocked come down hes an unselfish player but hes on on you to get 30 and you know if youre woring about records you I know youve got some stats there about 30o games and 40point games but hes on record to maybe attack those those record jumo on one for two at the line and the Bears the lead 13 its its not quite put to bed yet but its you know its its it it is getting dark out theyre theyre going to put the ball back in his hands I think Northwestern State face guarding him theyre pretty much playing a box not a box a manto man one on him just total face guard oh Joseph no the demons with a rebound still battling Bettis yeah theyre theyre trying to play denial defense on on St so Sanders and thats a nice find by Sanders as he sets up JT Warren for the three and thats going to get Mark mat to say all right guys hey were not done yet no and thats a great timeout you might say why the quick timeout because theyve been in this battle before like this Dave and they dont want to see this lead disappear theyve worked too hard for it 10 you know not going to be a good afternoon now you know and thats something that you just have to remind your players of but uh its the same team that got this lead they just got to go back and regain it Applause now getting in the hands of the hot man to yakovich Wilkinson for three Miss fires betrus able to get the basketball knocked off of a demon but Northwestern State Corrals it well if youre the Bears you need a stop you dont want this team again like you say feeling good about themselves getting it in single digits juman ftis leans in gets it back shot clock down to seven and the bears do get an important Applause stop blackshire for Wilkinson and petrius is going to draw contact as he puts it on the deck Cal has not drawn as many fouls in this second half as they did in the first half thats only the fifth personal of the half against Northwestern State good point Dave theyre usually in the bonus by them but I I do think their defense at last possession was a start awfully good possession Music defensively black Shire left all alone great action by the Bears to get him alone and hell cash in the corner three yeah you could to go to sleep on black you cant hes too good a basketball player to allow him to get something easy Sanders a scoop and how about the finish with authority at The Rim by Lau I love John Sanders on his dish he made the big fell go up in Sky big basket by Northwestern State Wilkinson gets it back from petritis and then the reverse layup underneath Im not sure even sure he saw that go in no thats crafty I mean thats what uh thats what dick he does all the time Jeremiah Wilkinson just really gets to the rim he can go up and use the glass either hand and then he takes the basketball away from Bettis hes got got Soko with him but he doesnt need him hell take it himself and now its Wilkinson whos been putting his fingerprints on the last couple of minutes well thats good to see you dont want to rely on one player and stovic to carry you Wilkinson now stepping up big time for the Music Bears and blackshire very active trying to come up with his steel knocks it out of bounds Mark Matson has to love the way his teams responded after that timeout well theyve done a good job and you know they can score theyve got a a myriad of guys that can get to the rim score for you but you like the defensive thievery over here the the the quick hands the Bears have a number of guys that just have awfully good and quick hands Wilkinson 11 of or excuse me 13 of his 15 have come in this second half Sanders goes around the screen for a three no sooko able to cral the rebounds Wilkinson loses the basketball w saying it was knocked out of bounds but the officials disagree well he was trying to gather it to make a play he knew he wasnt going to get to the rim he was trying to just gather it and make a distribution but couldnt do it good defense by Northwestern State Sanders into the corner for Thomas gets his own rebounds Second Chance attempt rattles out and well get a whistle and a foul here on the floor is the call Applause Music Applause so thats the ninth foul on Cal and he I believe he did call the foul as being on the floor so will be a one andone situation for the demons well again you dont want to stop the clock and allow the demons to get back you know and and continue to March the line and now youre in double bonus the rest of the way so youve really got to ask your team to play good defense and you know uh Cs cut down their turnovers they have 11 today they had 18 in the last game against Cornell uh so your C got to take care of the basketball do anything but turn it over uh play ball security and and then rest on your defense you know you got to Salt games away people think you have to Salo offensively day defensively is the way you get it done bler loses the basketball out of bounds and turn St will take it back thats uncharacteristic Javon black youre pretty darn sure with the ball but that shows you how aggressive this demons team is they really go out there and make put pressure in 12th turnover of the game for the Bears open look for juman and hes able to knock down the triple thats his fourth three of the game how about Northwestern State day they were kind of out of it well look at the way theyre playing just the you know the uh ability to stay with it not keep their heads down theyre still battling back its good sign if youre a demon player coach well yeah and you know I mean coach even if theyre not able to M to come back here and get this Victory as sto yakovich gets hit on his drive a game like this gives you a lot to build on going into South plan conference play no question and if youre the Bears you want somebody to build on too you want to try to extend this lead and not allow these shots to put you back in the game but able performance but hes given the Bears this type of leadership and presence uh but for him to step up and do what hes done still not quite enough the the bear is going to need one final push to get this game insulted away are you going to be talking to him before every game the rest of the season that might not be a bad idea Wilkinson finds to yakovich in the corner and hes got his first career 30 plus point game 31 now for sto yakovich yeah I think its going to be a pregame ritual now theres no doubt paid off Im going to claim all credit for this its his fourth made three of the game hes just had career highes across the board the three on the other end though by Bettis as Northwestern State continues to battle well da youre in the south in conference youre watching this game this not a team I want to play face they are competitive and their game I mean theyve got some competitors they get after defensively they dont go Applause away credit to their coach hes done a phenomenal job by the way that the fourth M three for stovic ties his career high in that department he gets tied up there wanted a foul call here come the demons the other way and just like that Northwestern State gets it back to 10 Mark Matson not going to call the timeout yet he just burned one but I can tell you if this thing dips he will hes got two in his pocket Northwestern State has one timeout remaining figure points here by Cal and the win probability goes up exponentially shot clock down to five sto yakovich looking for his fourth dime got his fourth dime and uh oh he he may have bangs knees hes kind of holding his knee a little bit he he calls to the bench well what a great find great pass they double team to his credit the respect the other team has the demons for him they double team theyre not taking any chances but he does what good players do they found his teammate we got a whistle Ando yovich is going to hes going to go over to the bench Im not sure if he banked knees coach but he he was you can still see him hes favoring that knee right now well you can see what he does I mean he gets open and mean knocks down the three uh theres no pain in the knee there yeah but it was it was up to the dime watch that while the camera shot goes away so you dont really see what happens after there was a double team on it there was a bump yeah you know bumping knees that is uh something that youll feel that but youll also more times than not walk away from it okay well hes going to the bench and what a you know I know he didnt want the rest right now but hes getting one anyways and uh trainer Barry Parson will take a look at him just make sure and I think it was just a bump there but uh unfortunate two Miss free throws juman trying to get it back to tan K and there a chance for the traditional threepoint play as Willie Williams draws the foul yeah this again you just you dont want to see this happen if youre the Bears you dont mind them making a shot but if you miss a shot you dont want to give up an offensive rebound now a chance for a threepoint play as the clock stops theres toy yakovich I think hes you know um he hes going to be okay I think hes still got a smile on his face course hes done a 30 piece so he should and his teams up so I think hes going to enjoy this one yeah hes got a 31 piece 31 piece not my bad its the first threepoint or 30point game since Jaylen tyon uh Tyson had a 30point game against Washington State last January this is the most points in the game since Jordan Shepard had 33 back against Oregon well Ks had some players that have gone and scored some points yes they have and and I you know I I uh I asked the the Fantastic Sid Garrett van genderen about uh the the history as we take another look how about the UPS there um and he said I said when was last 40o game because thats the way the the game was going and Leon po had a 41o game you said Leon Poe had a 40point game yeah I had that game I remember telling him probably mistakenly and Ill advisedly telling him Leon look youre getting double team you know against Oregon you got to pass the ball he said coach Im getting double team Ive never passed out of doubles now if I get triples Ill pass the ball out Im not not a double team and he didnt and he went on to score 40 so sometimes players know more than the coaches Im you won that game yeah well thats how tough yes and thats how tough he was he never bothered with a double team he said but if I get Triple coach Ill pass it and 40 points proof in the pudding hope hes watching tonight yeah he finished with 41 and that was on H March 10th 2006 so was that a was that a culmination of the regular season game or was that a tournament game well hes done some things had some ridiculous numbers both in the season out season even in tournaments 36 and 20 against USC in the tournament and hes just yeah proba with one of alltime bear great fortunate to to recruit him and a local product from Oakville Bears get the Stop and just about have closed the door here on Northwestern State bler nearly got tied up and hits the corner for ol Joseph yeah the Bears have found something in Ola Joseph Joshua Ola Joseph has been a dead eyee he has not slowed down I was afraid to shake his hand in practice yesterday they want to cool him off long three off the front of the rim and now the crowd starting to starting to know this one is going in the win for the Bears the three game losing skit is going to come to an end Coach now and I hear the bear territory I know that song well and when you win theres no sweeter sound but this is it uh this is what the Bears play for they appreciate their home out but theyve earned this one they had to play against aesy Northwestern State team and theyve earned this one Northwestern State did not go away easily Wilkinson the three and how about one more triple for good measure its been infectious its gone from stokovich to Ola Joseph to Wilkinson they have just nailed their threepoint Shots tonight heres a combo stat for you coach that was the 12th made three of the game for the Cal men the women made 18 last night so Bears fans have seen third 33s going wi in the last 24 hours in this building but watch I mean theyre theyre just on fire here you theres must be something about house Pavilion because people like shooting threes how about the women making 13 and a quarter thats unheard of you had the game I mean so so you you uh it must be something on the floor here D this must be an offensive floor ptis at the free throw line So Cal is going to improve to seven and four on the season and theyll get a little bit of time off now before taking on San Diego State next next weekend down in San Jose big game and they got Clemson and pit on the road they doesnt get any easier but you know this is the right in the middle of finals fans forget this viewers probably dont know this but having coached here youre at Cal its a little different the players go through finals uh Dave its a big deal and Mark Matson having played at at Stanford knows the the finals deal too so hell take this win players will go on and finish their finals but uh you feel good about this kind of win mark Matson congratulating coach Cabrera but its a big win for C they needed this win desperately 84 to 66 the final here this afternoon and uh coach uh mark
