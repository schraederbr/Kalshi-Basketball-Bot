and Utah and LSU this Florida team at 42 this is the fourth ACC team that Florida has played they beat Florida State and pit lost to Virginia and last time out in a showdown against Baylor out of the Big 12 they fell 9591 at the NIT tip off championship game Zion pulling misfires on the jumper and here comes W heres the tempo cam hildr so good going to the back B and they will reset starting lineups for Wake Forest four starters all average 15 per game the question Richard is can they get help elsewhere you know you talk about this is a team that can really score the ball and dont let the three and three record fool you this is a team thats really good comes within a couple possessions of can easily be six and0 thats a big reason why Hunter Salis the transfer from Gaga looking to follow in the footsteps of ACC player of the years like Alis Williams and a former Florida Gator Tyrese app thats what Hunter Salis does you know hes able to be a catch and shooter and knock it down from the outside so the starting lineups for Florida Thomas Hal first career start had it stolen away booby Miller at the other end and hes got free throws coming good in in action there by Wake Forest and getting the ball off to boy Miller as they get out in transition this is what he does gets a piece of the paint not afraid of the physicality and boy Miller going to the line to shoot for two Millers last three games hes been pretty good those arent his well yeah Charleston Southern starting from the bottom and then LSU and talson came over from Central Michigan where he was the Chipawa top scorer as a freshman last season cut short after four games due to a broken ankle and as weve seen hes got a great first step well you you talk about a tremendous addition to this Wake Forest basket basketball team A downhill driver not afraid to get his nose in there and get busy with the bigs in the interior gets a lot of his points in the paint he can really make this team Applause go Zion pulling the 64 Guard from UC Riverside where he was the big West scoring champion last year heres Clayton no good on a rebound by Keller making his fifth straight start Applause Music Music Salis Works around cougal and has it knocked away last touch Salis Florida basketball you can see W for try to get a little bit into their offense as the crowd definitely disagrees with the call but they can really score the ball they move it from side to side they get the quality shot that they want and try to get it on every possession Tyrese Samuel Thunder Down Low and the foul Florida getting into the paint dropping it off Tyrese Samuel with the finish and with authority and one the foul is on Keller his first Samuel came over from Sean Hall and the big emphasis for Florida head coach Todd golden in the off season was to import size Samuel one of those Imports well he does a really good job in the interior for Florida hes a good finisher around the rim sets solid screens and rolls well and gives them the interior presence that they need along with more depth on the inside Keller launches the three too much here comes pulling Wake Forest gets back defensively Clayton launches airball and Clayton trying to plead that it was a tip tie Dy Nation providing the chorus there is Todd golden second season as Floridas head coach this was a team last year that looked like it had a real shot to make the NCAA tournament theyre big Colin Castleton goes down and their season just spiral downward yeah well I got a chance to see this team firsthand last season you talk about a tremendous player with Colin castlen able to score on the interor and the outside as well as rebound at a high clip but his injury towards the end of the SEC season was a major factor while this Florida team who was on the bubble was not able to finish the season strong and make an NCAA tournament push theyve been able to get into the transfer portal and address some of the issues particularly on the interior with the absence of Castleton and theyve seem to be doing a tremendous job of that now also with the addition of elevated guard play hrth splits the double nicely done by the Englishman and thats a big time move right there by Ken hild talk about elevated guard play as he was able to split the defense get into the paint and finish with the left hand cougal over Salis rebound hildr Wake Forest pushing hildr to Salis tremendous in toend basketball by the Demon Deacons hildr with his head up throwing it on the dime to an Aly Miller almost poked it away Hal The Freshman from the outside boy hes a goodlook player 7ot wingspan grew up a Gator fan in West Oxford Pennsylvania and stepped right into that top of the key three with a lot of confidence theyre going to need a big time performance from Hal to get it done here Miller the step back Hal another rebound theres Clayton cougal thought about the three bouncing off Salis lot of contact the basket is good and one strong move by Riley koug as hes able to knife his way into the paint take on the contact and finish off the glass as he with the spin move takes the hit and one Raley cougar the foul is on Keller kou a tremendously talented guard little bit to a slow start to start the season but definitely caught fire in his last game showing you the talent that He has against Baylor went off for 25 nine rebounds knocked down four threepointers Salis the Gonzaga transfer Here Comes car heres a stretch four working on Hal one big loss for Florida today without Micah hand locked in one of their key big man he is out with an ankle injury we knew it was going to be up and down hildr to Salis and wait the early Lead You cover the SEC predominantly I cover the ACC predominantly listen the reality is it seems like the SEC in basketball over these last few years has passed the ACC well some can definitely say that you talk about this is a great challenge to see all of these Premier programs competing but you talk about the tradition of the ACC and of being a basketball conference and particularly the SEC being known as a football conference but the Southeastern Conference has stepped up their play on the basketball court producing some high level teams and a lot of professional talent and we finally get a chance to challenge to see who can take it and theyve invested in facilities theyve invested in coaches and coaching staffs the football money is real Richard Here Comes pulling this is Condon another freshman no good from the outside and the rebound pulled down by Wake Forest and boopy Music Miller W force does a great job as you can see moving the ball from side to side in action trying to get some quality looks moving until they get a the best shot they can possibly get Miller with the crossover and finish thats boy Miller right there getting into his patented fallway jumper he loves to get a piece of the paint and we gets inside that paint he can finish with high efficiency something youll see from Florida they like to push even off makes hildr off balance using the window tough shot by Cameron Hil taking the contact leaning back off the glass theres a reason his nickname is Music bangers Applause here is pulling 172 assisted turnover ratio in the three games that hes played Conan works it out good Trap by wake skip pass Richard has it turned away by Keller excellent defense there by Wake Forest coming over on the big to Big trap forcing the ball out for Florida you see a lot of that from Virginia packline principles Miller again gets separation with the crossover too much and Hal able to Corral the Miss Florida now wants to push Richard Catch and Release got the three will Richard was just one of 10 from three and its previous three games he has a really nice shooting stroke and you know if sometimes when youre not able to find your shot when you have a good fundamentals you give it time and youll be able to knock it down as you can see he stepped up and hit that one with confidence Applause Music theres Keller on the bench took a shot to the knees Matthew Marsh came back from a concussion Friday against Charleston Southern 33 for Wake Forest hildr so good around the rim and now pulling able to push for Florida cougle the trailer drops it off Condon battling his fellow trees and its pulled away by Carr definitely a battle down low and Carr coming up with the win on that Applause possession Carr can shoot it from out there Miller on the give and go Carr hesitates spins it up no good the followed by marsh and a rare Miss by Matthew Marsh who last year shot 88 8 mostly dunks cougal step back three good Florida within one there you see you get a glimpse of the talent of Riley cougal off the bounce high arcing threepointer nothing but the bottom he started to come on late last year and a team that was infused with transfers and freshman in the off season cougal one of the holdovers marsh the follow and he gets the foul theres Matthew March again on the offensive glass doing big time work going up strong getting the n Music one the foul is on cougal his first fourth foul against Applause Florida free throw is no good Marsh that was his first free throw attempt of the Season Samuel back in there for Florida heres Clayton strong drive to the 10 and a nice move to get the two really good drive there by Walter Clayton coming off that curl getting all the way to the rim Here Comes Salis one of the challenges tonight for Wake Forest Floridas got more depth and in a game thats fastpaced does that come into effect especially in the second half it definitely can uh W force is doing a really good job early on of setting the tone particularly on the interior if there was a matchup that you would think that Florida would have the advantage it would be on the boards with waight fores answer the Bell early on with some offensive rebound put box putbacks and setting the tone that wont count we get a foul and well

set timeout getting Clayton freed up off that curl knocking down the midrange Jay Walter Clayton played at Iona for Rick patino did not follow patino to St Johns the Florida native grew up a Gator fan had the opportunity to play for the team he grew up rooting for theres Frederickson The Freshman dangerous pass shot clock down to four down to three hildr against aine gets it off does not hit the rim and a shot clock violation Richard Steve Forbes telling us today for his team the key is rebounding guarding the elbow drives and getting back in transition well you know we had a great talk with him today he he knows that his team is continuing to grow and theyre exactly right they have to make sure that they keep Florida out of the paint with the elbow drives and continue to rebound as thats an area that they look to continue to improve but you talk about Steve fors a tremendous coach with a long history and experience not just here in the ACC but at many different colleges all over the country and in the junior college rank so he understands what hes doing hes got his team playing really good basketball and he knows that they can continuing to be better and better they can be a force in the ACC Frederickson picks up the foul for Wake Music Forest Samuel and it counts Tyrese Samuel hes been on a tear of late last time out against Baylor 18 points 20 and 10 against pit and it started in his last few games with SE Hall last year hes had a double double in six of his last 12 and with high level moves right that faking the dribble handoff and taking it all the way to the cup taking on the contact and finishing with an N one is a big reason why Tyrese Samuel has been playing high level basketball he was one of the most coveted transfers in the portal and it came down to these two schools Florida and Wake Forest and he chose the Gators you talk about 6 10 240 lb who can finish around the baset with tremendous touch and ability but as well agile enough to read the defense and put the ball on the deck and finish a big reason why he was so sought after Todd golden is thrilled to have him on his side wake has missed seven of its last eight Keller from the corner make it eight out of nine Florida in the midst of a 122 run great ball movement aine from the corner rattles in and out offense rebound Samuel he lost it but he was fouled and that is what Florida does better than almost anybody they are rebounding 44 of their misses third nationally well thats the best thing you can do is give your team another possession at it and continue to pound the offensive glass many times these games can become games of possessions and when you can get multiple attempts at the basket it only strengthens your offense Keller just picked up his is second he remains in the Applause game bar is tightened up its half court defense theyve also kept wake out of transition Salis looking for help Miller leaning in and hes able to draw the foul theres lopy Miller again always getting into the paint not afraid of the physic Al got his man up off his feet and Drew the foul its on Clayton and that is his Music second tonight 915 Eastern number seven Duke

settling into their offenses you know we mentioned that its going to be a a game thats going to have an up and down pace so you have you see theres a little bit of a turnover by Florida on the last possession getting into the half court set working your offense around trying to move the ball from both sides to get a quality shot almost a fourminute scoring drought for Wake Applause Forest Carr spots up knocks it down really good unselfish play there by Wake Forest as hildr will was able to give the ball back to Carr Carr getting his feet set and lining one up from the outside thats what makes pulling so tough 64 guard plays with physicality 18 a game for UC Riverside a year ago well hes a really good guard with the ball and not only is he good scoring but he can set his players up and allows his guard Ling team to really allow other guards to play off the ball in a little bit more of a comfortable position Samuel snatches it out of thin air numbers for Florida pulling and hildra threws out of bounds wow talk about tremendous athleticism and anticipation with tyres Samuel sliding his feet getting his hands up ready anticipating the pass and just sticking it grabbing it out of the air and pushing the break Julian Rish Wayne will inbound graduate transfer spent three years at San Francisco after beginning his career in the ACC with Boston Music College got Clayton on the bench with the two fouls cougal gets separation and the rebound to Marsh for looking to run out to Salis sets his shot and wake retakes the lead beautiful action by Wake Forest coming down in transition cam Hill just rejecting that transition pick and roll going to the Baseline and finding Salis knocking it down from the outside Samuel tries a three and he gets it he was 0 for five from three prior to that one you can see why he was so sought after not only the inside game but showing a little bit of his range and touch for the big man skip Music pass shot clock down to three down to two Miller turns it over Poland leads the break cougal strong to the tin out of bounds to Wake Forest high level action by both of these teams talking about end to end but its the beautiful play of Wake Forest with the beautiful ball movement kicking it outside to Hunter Salis and hes knocking it down got a ball game right now youre without Micah hand Lockton who you see there with the curly hair hes their starting center hes out and guess what theyre okay well they definitely addressed some deficiencies that they had Colin cman one of the best bigs in America last season but the depth was the problem for the Florida gers definitely adding some really good talent to the roster and a strong team and head coach Todd golden is happy about that hild in the paint blocked from behind by how well timed help defense good rotation there by how coming over from the weak side rejecting Music it Samuel posting up Marsh and he traveled good call by the official there CAU him the steps as he drugg his feet before as you talk about the helps side defense and the height of the Florida Gators as hul was able to come over and Hal with the rejection Marsh setting the pick for Miller gets in the paint throws it up off the glass and the rebound taken away by Pullin Zion Pullin accelerates out of control and hes going to get the foul on Marsh and that is his second yeah St waight Force definitely disagrees with that call but Pullen able to get downhill get a piece of the body nonetheless going to the line to shoot for two Poland had to sit out the first three games for playing in an

touch on the leaner he made a season debut against Florida State all of a sudden he said uhoh they got a point guard 15 points and 17 against Baylor he and he also allows Walter Clayton to play off ball he does you know and thats a really good plus when you have so much guard play that pulling can take on the point guard traditional point guard responsibilities letting Clayton lay off the ball be a little bit more free and set him up for better scoring opportunity Samuel Brazen and he gets turned back it belongs to wake his car again with the long arms a tremendous shot blocker and rim protector talk a good job rotating over sliding brocking that ball on the left hand of the tip with his right hand so he has a little bit more Applause extension cars played a lot of five when wake

this roster you talk about Demetrius Nichols and anthonis cavalas as well as BJ Mackey as well as this staff so you have some coaches who played the game just to name a couple out of them that really

going to the jump Hook by Andrew Carr now Samuel against Keller it spins away and a little bit of low post play that youre seeing from both of these teams something that you dont really see a lot in todays game a block from behind by Richard what year is this but you know for a second there it seemed like it was the early 2000s as you see car going to the low post and then a feed right back on the other end to Tyrese Samuel going to the jump hook but uh tremendous in to end action well see what the deacons have drawn up here on the Baseline out of bounds its become such a lost start to play

an opportunity for another slam dunk with wake Force back to the line to shoot the two k on the season just two of four from the free throw line now Matthew Marsh had started the first few games of the Season went out with a concussion and Marsh is now back but Keller starting his fifth consecutive game hes a guy who has size at 610 can also step out and knock down the outside shot well you know theyre definitely going to need the interior depth as Marsh was able to make a return with Keller picking up some valuable minutes able to get some experience and add a little bit more to this roster on the inside in a game like this those are two free throws you dont want to leave on the board knowing that Florida is starting to come into their Rhythm at the end of the first half wake four of nine from the free throw line pulling the jump step left it short and wake can hold for one hildr going quickly no good it comes back to Florida heres cougal Samuel driving on Carr gets tied up and it will stay with Florida 8 seconds left in the first half situation right there for both teams you have an opportunity to hold the ball to shoot the last shot at the end of the half both teams elect to

coming after the break pull it open and misses hildr that will not count it will not go in and the first half comes to an end a good one at the Joel Florida thir flashes sometimes you could say this is just for teams to find their identity these games matter well this matters tremendously you talk about two conf conferences known for basketball and football but both of them fighting so who can be the more Superior conference on the hardwood two close ball games early on and big reason right there its a close match because of the the work of Carr down low hes got 14 last couple of years the ACC took some big hits early in the year in nonconference and then paid for it on selection Sunday cougal got a dozen over Salis hes got 14 Riley koug youre showing the outside game now the midrange game getting to the cup you know the performance of kou and Carr on both ends theyre carrying their teams right now if Im wake Force Im going to continue to ride Andrew Carr on the low post he seems to have a mismatch and taken advantage of it hes been working a lot against the Freshman Hal making his first career start Clayton who had the two fouls gets the interception Poland lines up a three rebound hildr bopy Miller driving on the taller pulling swatted by Samuel hildr puts it on the floor and He will draw the foul it is on Hal thats his third good foul drawing there by hriff able to get to the paint but it was bopy Miller getting the rejection by Tyrese Samuel you know W Forest has to figure out right now in this moment who has the hot hand and its Andrew Carr you have to recognize your player thats got it going 14 points in the ball game six rebounds continue to feed him on the low post hes got a rhythm find the mismatch and when he gets the soft touch you play off of him to establish yourself in the second half Florida brought in another freshman Conan for Hal and they had Samuel on car and Wake Forest able to cash in and theres that patented Fade Away J by Boy Miller he loves to get a piece of the paint and fade away for two and theyre going to get Carr down low he was tied up with Samuel hooking a little bit as he was trying to get deep position as tyres Samuel was trying to push him up the lane line for the lob over the top for the easy not necessarily a bad foul here puts Florida in the Baseline out of bounds situation forces them to play out of that set without that it could have been an easy two for Samuel on the low post just the first foul on Carr Samuel eyes up Keller theres the help good ball movement one more to Clayton and the three is good that is textbook on how to pass pass out of a double team good recognition by the Florida Gator Tyrese Samuel embracing the double team coming over from the other big skipping it to the other side swinging the ball around the horns to the shooter and Clayton knocking it down Steve Forbes telling us at shoot around that was one of his concerns were going to have to double the post can we recover in time when Florida reverses well when you double the post its not that youre trying to create turnovers but you want to create confusion for the offensive team and Florida did a good job right there to handling that kicking it out on the outside finding the shooter and playing with a lot of poise poopy Miller against Poland lost his balance Here Comes Florida Clayton pull up three to strong and that is going against Florida its on Samuel his second got him for pushing in the back but its the Poise that Florida has on this offensive set kicking in swinging it all the way back around and Clayton knocking it down from outside that is tremendous ball movement what you want to see from the Florida Gators as theyre able to work the ball around and share it hrth the lob to Keller has it poked Away by Clayton and it went out on Keller good look there by Wake Forest going up top to Keller but if youre a big man when you catch that ball you want to make sure you catch it high and keep it high he brought it down to his knees Florida was able to get the strip stripped it off his knee out of bounds turnover for weight and thats going to be an offensive foul against Florida Samuel has picked up his third so quickly in this second half that big man depth starting to evaporate Hal has three fouls Samuels got three hand locked is out today well this is if youre wake Force this is where you have to try to make a surge you got Tyrese Samuel whos done a really good job rim protecting and also being an offensive threat and you have them out of the game now um you have to make sure that you try to ride in the low post when you get a mismatch and take advantage of it and Florida right now has two freshman Manning the back line and Conan and Hal I would expect a steady dose of Andrew Carr well this is what you should do get it inside the Andrew Carr let him work out and facilitate if he cant find something for himself then you have outstanding Shooters on the outside but nonetheless even if you bring car to the perimeter and run pick and roll action hit him in the short roll put the Defenders on him and then let him play he has the hot Applause Music hand hildr puts

Indiana State the fighting Larry Birds the Sycamore sevenpoint lead for Florida Carr nearly traveled Salis from the outside cant get the friendly roll and its a foul its going to be against Florida and not a bad foul there by Conan as he was challenging that put back I think the officials are going to call this as a loose ball and get it on the floor as opposed to a putback shooting for two but puts wake force on a baseline out of bound bounds play situation well see what head coach Steve fors will have dialed up an opportunity to get an easy basket here on the Bas onine out of bounds thats the fifth team foul on Florida first on cond Wake Forest only has one team foul hildr got free from Samuel great move on the inside really good pace and balance getting into the paint spin move with a

challenge these games dictate the streak treed of a league in the eyes of the selection committee obviously theres the metrics know with net and RPI and all those sorts of things too that matter in how we evaluate teams but what you do in nonconference and what your league does in nonconference thats your margin for error when you get to conference play absolutely and not only to play a quality game but to play a true home a road game for these teams to get a chance to pick up a win will play a big role in the teams getting NCAA tournament bids when the committee tries to make that evaluation yeah recent years the ACC has been penalized by the committee for beating up on itself in League Play why they got beat up in non conference and so the value of those wins isnt as high as Samuel gets the two thats the impact of the losses is much more severe for sure you know and tyres Samuel trying to give his team a quality win here on the road with that beautiful Baseline spin move quickly in transition Carr will get the continuation the veteran going after the green horn Condon and thats what you got to do if youre Andrew Carr you got to continue to pack the paint and and attack every single possession that you get swinging the ball around got the shot fake going give him a little bit of shoulder get him up in the air and finish through the contact the experience of Carr taking the young player down to the Woodshed and getting the n one and that was also the sixth team foul now the seven team foul on Florida so one more I guess no more Wake Forest in the bonus

what you want to do if your W for as you want to get some things going riding car make him be the Creator make some big time plays and get the crowd back into it we got a ball game you can see his foot is on the line when he releases so it is a 5149 game Carr and Salis have 33 of the 49 per weake rest of the team just seven of 24 from the field and this is the time that you continue to follow that Trend dont break it let those guys facilitate and play off of that Carrs doing a great job of finding the action and it leads to fouls or quality shots and thatll be a one and one as pulling gets called for the reach in his second now if youre a flter in these particular situations Andrew Carr has found his rhythm being the low post are catching on the high post at the pinch post with a little bit of a Twan game with Salis coming off of that you have to make it a little bit more difficult on Andrew Carr push him out outside of his comfort zone and get a little bit more physical dont allow him to just set up shop in low paint or on the elbow so easily and operate make it a little bit more difficult from him and then pinpoint make makes it harder him to make those pinpoint passes or shoot with efficiency and Dall cant get that second free throw an 85 free throw shooter so Wake Forest about 4 minutes ago was down by nine they have taken that deficit all the way down to one heres Clayton and hriff fouled him in the middle of the shot thats two on hildr 13 foul hild not agreeing with that call but Clayton such an agressive player has yet to really find his rhythm in this game but all it takes is just one little crease to get one going finds himself getting to the free throw line you can see one drop he can take a little bit of momentum from that now this is almost stunning Clayton coming into the game was 16 out of 23 from the free throw line misses a free throw there last year he was2 out of 107 he was a 95 free throw shooter a year ago number one in the nation thats outstanding so much concentration and when you have that ability to knock down free throws at that high level of a clip you become a threat on all areas of the Court they cant press up to you cuz if they foul you youre going into the line youre going to make them pay struggling a little bit with a shot right now but a shooter with that type of ability can get it back going HR the bounce pass the Carr Thats high level right there twom man action with Cameron hildr and Drew Carr drops it right on the dime for the slam dump we are tied at 52 Midway through the second half and the turnover eldr the other way now Salis from 15 cougal up ahead to Clayton driving on hildr too strong offensive rebound pulling is fouled on the putback try good they get Marsh his third goodness you talk about the Twan game with hris beautiful look on the bounce pass wrapped it around Andrew Carr with the catch and throws down the Applause hammer and this is the twoman action Andrew Carrs involved in on every single Play Wake Forest has to continue the ride that thats what theyve used to go on this run they scored five out of the last six possessions on field goals if they can continue to to do that thats how youve gotten themselves into this game and thats how youre going to continue to have to put it together to try to win this game Floridas known for their offense and their guards theyre going to turn it on and make some adjustments but you have to ride it if youre wake Force until they stop you pulling gets them both now with wake the issue this season especially early on we told you about Fon Reed and deari mon Santos still being out their big four are as good as anybodys Four Guys averaging 15 or more per game Miami is the only other team in the country that has that you get outside of that youre not getting much offensively no youre not but you know when you have a game of this magnitude with a really good team like Florida you got a blocking foul called there on Riley cougal 30 ft away from the basket but you have so much tremendous guard play and everyone giving you 15 points per game of more on average with your four really good players this is not the game that you want to look at the scoreboard and say how do I continue to get my numbers and get my averages you got a tough game here thats weighing in the balance here you got a tough opponent in Florida continue to figure out whats going to work to get yourself to get back in this ball game and come up with a win and a good team win for way Force Hildreth can tie it here and if he makes this free throw he would be 23 of 24 on the young season hes gotten better every season with Wake Forest average Four Points A game A couple of years ago up to 12 and change last year a big Testament to the Player Development here in this program to see a kid whos coming in gets better and better earns more minutes and now finding themselves in a starring Applause role Clayton down the lane Samuel long the handle its Tapped Out it comes back to Samuel Hal chases it down Clayton had the three gives it up pulling the three rebound hildr awake forest with a chance to take its first lead of this second half Floridas got to settle down and run some quality offense they got themselves with a big lead getting out in transition going to have to get a clean shot wakes last lead was 3231 late in the first half and Carrs got 22 and the de on top by three and hes filling it and letting everybody know catching it on the pick and pop cougal the tear drop wow and the answer nice Poise by Riley cougal getting into the paint with this nice floater over the top this is one of those games that the tone of this game teams are doing a really good job of getting back in defensive transition but also at the same time you know when you score youre making teams take it out of the net so its going to be who can make sure that theyre executing the halfcourt set cuz its going to come down to the wire Salis had the mismatch now Hal gets back Frederickson long three its good Steve thorpes called him one of the best Shooters hes ever signed and the Freshman hits he steps up in a big moment extending the lead for Wake Forest good ball movement if youre Clon you got to shoot that ball you wide open swing it over but when you get wide open looks you got to make them pay and that find the right pieces and the biggest piece for Wake force in this second half has been Andrew Carr you talk about hes the one player out here on the court we talk about the guard play for both of these teams hes the one player who has the mismatch you know he has the the senior leadership he has the experience he can play on the perimeter he can post up in low post and wake Force has done a really good job of getting him the ball in several ways and letting him be the facilitator to get quality shots meanwhile Salis doing what he does hes at 19 points a good job there by Salis rejecting the screen roll action getting into his sweet stot in the in the midrange and knock knock him down the J koug throws it up and hits and koug has had the answer all night long every single time wake force does a m playay cougal answers and they get a foul down low against Carr this potentially could be a huge swing for the Gators the foul was not on the shooter so the basket is good the foul is on car and now Florida gets the ball back so this could be potentially a sixpoint possession if they hit a three Samuel blocked but it still goes in and that ends up being a fivepoint possession for Florida and thats a big time possession for Florida and a strong finish by tyres Samuel going up Rim level finishing through the contact 22 points per car two shy of a career high Salis drops it off Marsh dribbled and if its a turnover Here Comes Applause Clayton cougal puts it on the deck runs into Carr and now they want help down low theyll say jump ball possession Arrows Florida and they may talk about it Applause now both teams getting in to in action some really strong finish by Tyrese Samuel going up top finishing through the contact little bit of hand could have been a and one situation from Florida so they went with the jump ball call alternate possession so went back to Florida they had the possession arrow Gator turn it over here comes wake weake come up on 6 minutes to go Gator led by as many as nine in this half day two of this ACC SEC challenge and that will stay with Wake Forest last touch Florida nice catch by a fan every set that wake is running theyre making sure to make sure theyre getting Carr in a screen roll situation he has an advantage when he goes to the pop missed him there he was wide open on the wing but getting him involved creates the mismatch Salis able to get to the free throw line something else to watch thats 10 team fouls on Florida so from here on out Wake Forest is in the double bonus and you got to love Sals creativity understanding using how to use and reject screens players are playing up on other players he makes sure to take that to his own Advantage gets into his sweet spot has a soft touch the leading scorer on this team finds himself back to the free throw line one point away from his fourth 20point game of the season and there it is get ready for the weekend Friday night Oregon Washington Pack 12 championship and a trip to the college football playoff on the line Texas needs to win in the Big 12 championship against Oklahoma State to have any chance at the playoff Florida State right now one of the top four without Jordan Travis can they beat Louisville theyre likely in the playoff although you never know thats the ACC Championship Saturday and then we find out Sunday at noon on ESP end it is the exclusive reveal of the final college football playoff rankings you know you talk about thats a committee I dont know if anybody wants to be in that room right now having to make the decision through all of these really good teams who are deserving of a spot in the playoffs but its going to have to be played out on the field should be fun to watch Georgia and Michigan sitting at one two Poland saying the ball was tipped Teddy Valentine says no wake fors ball and Todd golden livid with the officials and I think Todd golden might have a part have a a really good case here as Marsh on the contest from my view got a piece of Music that down low to Marsh instead its a turnover that did look like somebody got a piece of that ball on the way up here comes Clayton pass Frederickson and we get a whistle and a foul on the Freshman Parker Frederickson from BBY Oklahoma sixth team foul on Wake Forest I think Todd golden heily had a point as Marsh got a piece you can see the ball rotating changing its flight path tough break for the Gators Clayton off the feed from Samuel back iron offensive rebound Samuel koug the three and were tied at 64 timeout Florida kud filling it another money shot for him and the best time to shoot the Three is coming off of the offensive rebound Riley cougal filling it from the outside and we got a to Andrew Carr two points from matching his career high they have been dare I say driving the car for the respective teams well the big man for Wake Forest has definitely stole a little bit of the show from the hard play but tremendous performance from both of them Riley cougal has really been doing a great job of answering the bell every time when when Florida needed a big shot he stepped up and made it under five minutes to go in the ball game youre going to need both of these guys to continue their big time Music play fredericksons a catch and shoot guy shot clock down to five Salis double team on the perimet gets it to Marsh hell put it up and he hits how about that Matthew Marsh wow Matthew marf known for his scoring in the interior shot clock running down he lines it up from the outside cash he shot 88 last year because he wasnt shooting from out there how about the drive by pulling the tied at 66 hes down might have got poked in the I its a tough shot by pun driving in there taking on the contact rainbow and finds the bottom of the Music cup well take the media timeout early with 403 to go in regulation Gators and deakes all tied up heres the guy off pick and rolls off offensive rebounds dunking down low thats why he made everything that time he had to put it up and then look at what happens to Zion pulling here on the drive hoop and the harm to get it open over the top but definitely took the punishment but good to see him up off the deck and back on the court asz the gator going to need him for the last four minutes and 3 seconds in this ball game a tie game as we come to the final four minutes what is this game come down to for each team its going to come down to execution and rebounding you can allow teams to get Second Chances uh after their offensive set boxing out clearing the boards and then when you get on the offensive end you got to move the ball around its been difficult to manufacture points in the transtion game so you have to have really good spacing pinpoint your passes get the spots and make plays on time and on target Salis with the shot clock winding down spins to hildr down the lane off the window and he draws the foul its on Clayton his third good individual effort there by Cameron hriff getting downhill driving with a strong drive to the basket coming up with the foul as we mentioned such a prolific scorer on this team you got to figure out ways to get your point production get into the free throw line when the shots not falling on the outside is going to be critical and scoring points with the stop with the clock stopping and getting more fouls on Florida and a rare Miss just the second of the season for hildr in 25 Music Applause attempts wake by Applause Music one Floridas going to have to move it around as we mentioned its not going to be easy to find any shots as W force is did a good job going flat pick and roll and switching some pick and rolls making it tough and making him shoot over the top Pullen gives it up to Clayton left hand Tipp by Samuel thats basket interference and its Wake Forest Music ball yes Canadian in international ball they allow you to touch the ball over top with Tyrese Sam called for baskets interference touching the ball while he was on the rim he is Canadian for Montreal Salis the skip pass Carr Catch and Release rebound Clayton Wake Forest gets back defensively heres pulling just three of 12 from the field over hildr make it three of 13 he has not had the touch tonight does have five assists and no turn turnovers however wake walking the ball up the court trying to get some good action boopy Miller hes been quiet in the second Applause half hildr driving on Samuel gets the bounce in a really good seal by Matthew Marsh holding his seal giving that alley for Cameron hriff to drive downhill hriff doing all the rest of the work with a beautiful leg third for hildr cougal turns it over Salis ahead of the pack drops it off to Miller for the easy two and wake leads by five Todd golden wants a timeout 204 to go in regulation Wake Forest turning defense in the offense getting busy with active hands coming up with the strip taking it from the defensive end for the easy lay s is down near the threepoint Applause stripe looked like he might have cramped up wake Force finding a driving lane in the crease by cam hriff getting downhill and not just that from the offensive end but turning defense into offense with the trap on the screen roll and the unselfish play Miller doing the last work Applause now this is a Florida team where when you look at the talent especially when Micah hand locked and gets back this is a team thats got a very real chance to get into the top 25 at some point in the next six weeks youre Wake Forest you can Bank a win like this thats huge and for Florida theyve already beaten Florida State theyve already beaten Pittsburgh you get a third ACC win not not only does that boost your nonconference resumee it does so for the entire SEC yeah well you know in this ACC SEC challenge every single game is an opportunity as an NCAA tournament Resume Builder cuz so many top teams with top talent youll be giving your sense an opportunity to give you a quad one quad 2 Victory so with wake Force an opportunity to play against a quality Florida team whos played some close teams as of late and has potential to be an NCAA tournament team and for Florida with a true Road Victory opportunity here little bit of time left in the game Mak some untimely turnovers but still a lot of time in this ball game for both teams the two possession game cougal over to Clayton less than two minutes to go with the Joel Clayton lines up a three front rim Conan has the rebound and he gets tied up and fouled and theyre going going to get Marsh and that is going to be four on the Junior from Cornwall England and thats really good action by Florida coming out of the break being able to move the ball around and find a clean B for Clayton hes not able to knock it down and as I stressed earlier if you are if youre wake Force you have to finish your defensive possessions with a strong rebound Conan with his activity getting another crack at it and going to the line for Florida seventh team f foul and that means Florida is now in the bonus that was a shooting foul so two shot foul for Condon whos now 12 of 20 on the season from the stripe and he knocks down that one to make it a fourpoint game still a twopossession game as bopy Miller will bring it up still a big free throw to split it with one for two important every single possession will matter on the back door cut Salis B basket foul wow that play was a great play by Wake Forest as they were get freed up on the back door cut and get a basket when they needed to extend the lead trapped finds the back door cut and Salis does the rest of it with a beautiful pass over the top finish through contact and one Hunter Salis Conan has fouled out Salis has a team High 23 and he heads to the Music line 7467 salad stepping up with big plays for the Deacons a wake has matched its largest lead Gator turn it over boopy Miller accelerating playing keep away from Clayton Miller driving lays it up the lead is nine great drive by Boy Miller getting into the paint and extending the lead for the demon de wake pulling away in the final Applause minutes pull into the basket and two shots coming with a grb transfer from UC Riverside 55 seconds to go here in regulation Wake Forest with its largest lead of the ball game and you know Wake Forest has made the plays when they need them they have a three and three record as we mentioned but several of their losses the three losses have all with within a couple of possessions you can tell theyve gotten to the practice court answered the Bell on when they need to make possessions at the end of the game make plays at the end of the game and youre getting a glimpse maybe of what Wake Forest is capable of remember theyre waiting on one of the best Shooters in the ACC in Monsanto to come back from an injury he suffered last year theyre hoping to get an NCAA waiver for a twotime transfer in Fon Reed who they think could solidify their interior and give them a real Difference Maker in the ACC well a lot of potential on this team and and with the attention of Fon Reed now you have a really good front court and right now Florida is starting to lose its cool and the officials get in there and now lets see how they adjudicate the Applause Carnage both teams getting their teams over to the side as a little extracurricular right there Samuel and then he and hildr got into it the officials break it up theyre going to the Applause monitor officials taking a moment to sort things out getting a little chippy and physical in the final minute of the game been a really good matchup so far you have the one common foul in the corner on pulling so thats going to be two shots for hildr and then what do they decide with Samuel and hildr getting tied up down low time now for tonights player of the game brought to you by Continental Tire and Andrew Carr 22 points knocked down three threepointers his defense down low against these Florida bigs was considerable as well the 22 points two off a career high along with six rebounds and three blocks to go along with it so an allaround game for Andrew Carr and most importantly he weathered the storm in the middle of the game when the Demon Deacons were down giv some consistent scoring threat adding his uh adding the inside and outside game when he had the mismatch and was able to keep the game close and then the rest of the teammates were able to take over and finish it off a Richard we talked about the big four for Wake Miller hildr Carr and Salis they have accounted for all but seven of wakes points tonight well a typical trend of this team and it shows the Firepower that they have and the unselfish play that it can be any of them tonight as the big man Andrew Carr was able to carry a lot of the load uh and definitely weather to storm as Florida had their surge going now they finds their team up with 50 seconds 501 to go in the game Ted Valentine Tony Henderson Tommy morresy officials tonight well get the explanation as they continue to talk about Applause it so if you could hear that it was a dead ball technical against Tyrese Samuel after the play the common foul on Poland of course still stands and essentially this gives Wake Forest a chance to put the game away an extended possession here wake Force adding to it you add a 95 free throw shooter in hriff going to the line to do the honors this was a really wellplayed ball game by both of the teams never really able to get out in front Wake Forest able to keep him sustaining the runs and the punches of Florida but coming back in the end with a chance to end extend their lead so those satisfy the technical now the two shots for the common foul this is a wake team that won 23 ACC games the last two seasons in the previous Four Seasons combined they had 17 conference wins Steve Forbes has this program headed in the right direction when you talk about the players that hes waiting on to get on the court you talk about this potentially could be a dangerous team in the ACC you talk about underrated Talent all the way across the board and adding more depth to it potentially can make a run dont let the three and three record fool you this is a good team in a well coached ball Club yeah a team thats looking for its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2017 and even the feat that they had the last two years winning double digit conference games in backtoback Seasons prior to Forbes doing it the last two seasons before that you got to go back to 96 and 97 when they had a pretty good post player wow pretty good talk about one of the top five players of all time with Tim dun out there down low so to go back to have that many wins in the strong basketball conference shows the strength and where this program is headed so so hildr hits all the free throws and now possession to Wake Forest and a game that was what tied at 64 tied at 66 a few moments ago it is allw Forest now 80 69 that is their largest lead of the game they have pulled away over these final couple minutes we came back from the under four media timeout at about 40 three to go and it was a tie game tie game every single possession mattered but you know Wake Forest was able to make a move hitting some big shots and then turn the defense up turn the defense up get a steal L out to the break and got another chance to extend the lead up to five and then the bottom fell out for the Gator front end of the one and one is good as the crowd broke out into a chant of ACC just means more in basketball Richard its looking like right here in Winston Salem tonight but you talked about two conferences have some of the best basketball talent in all of America and been putting it on display and hildr gets the timeout before a 5second violation I guess he didnt get it so he did not get the timeout so it is a 5second violation wild shot no good and then the foul against Florida so Wake Forest will head back to the line Poland picks up his fourth you know at this point in the game Florida seemed that the game is Out Of Reach where they played a wellplayed ball game for probably 35 Plus minutes this is not the time that you want to play sloppy if youre Florida continue to build who you are as a team try to continue to get quality shots and quality defensive possessions even when the game seems to be Out Of Reach Youre Building Who You Are as a program and as a team and you want to make learning moments every opportunity you have to be on the court again you learn a lot from teams in defeat when you watch Florida against Baylor in the NIT tip off Championship you watched a Florida team that is going to do damage in the SEC this year they definitely will you know they have the talent all the way across the board they now have the interior play to match with the outside play but you have to continue to play the game the right way several turnovers down the the stretch of the game unnecessary foul call undisciplined defense this was not the way that they played for 35 minutes and you want to continue to build as a team and play that way so it only makes you better and better as the season goes on Poland commits his fifth foul so he is done and Kevin poopy Miller will head to the free throw line he got the nickname it was actually his uncles nickname his moms brother and when his moms brother passed the nickname passed down to Kevin he likes to be known as Kevin on the graphics but he says he call me boopy hey well you know hes hes got to represent hes done a great job got to represent for his family keep the Legacy going and hes definitely representing now of the Court hes do a great job of playing pressure defense all night long handling the ball and some timely baskets when wake force needed the most well these early games tonight look to be a clean sweep for the ACC Virginia beat number 14 Texas AM North Carolina is up by 10 on Tennessee whos come back a little with a couple of minutes to go and Wake Forest about to dribble out the clock and and Florida its third loss of the season this is a well played ball game for 35 Plus minutes of the game with the Demon Deacons able to execute down the down the clutch and end it very strong Salis Carr Miller and hildr The Fab Four
