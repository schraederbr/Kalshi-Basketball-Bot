didnt get to the hotel until about 10 30 so we do expect to see fatigue and tiredness to be an issue today all right well keep an eye on and the cards in all red head to toe will kick it away brock travelstead drives it and the deacons will return it back beyond the 20 keyshawn williams theres another change in the return game because donovan greene is also unavailable for today and well look at the deacons offensive set and heres a an interesting wrinkle roddy the staple is this ride read a play that they run the quarterback sticks the belly it sticks the ball in the belly of the running back and almost walks him up to the line of scrimmage at times which makes the linebackers commit and then the running back explodes out for big gains well see christian beale smith doing it by himself here today kenneth walker opted out of the rest of the year so christian bill smith will get the bulk of the carries and bill smith tries to find a cutback off the first down at the 24 and rallying to the ball yaya diaby one of the veteran guys hes not the most veteran by long shot junior from atlanta but diabetes plays up front with jared goldwell to barius peterson all veteran guys heres beale smith little hesitation runs right into dorian etheridges arms out at about the 28th quickly were the third down with two fast snaps from the deacons well the wake forest can be one of the fastest teams in the acc Music heres skinner i say skinner its sam hartman and hell throw complete to jacory roberson another slingshot throw from hartman his first completion of the day to roberson who had 12 catches in their last two ball games prior to the prior to the stoppage of play for wake forest first and ten and heres peal smith and hell be pushed out of bounds at the 43 marlin character over there for louisville on the play mention that kenneth walker not going to play in this game not going to play for the rest of the year wake forest hopes to get the sophomore back in the spring but christian beale smith has carried the ball the majority of the time the past few games he is a very capable very good back as well here is beale smith kind of waiting there on first down and abdullah 22 will shove him back hell measure it to the 41 third down coming up wake forest can change gears roddy about as quick as anybody in college football in their tempo it looks like absolutely can hartman third down far side throw and a catch taylor morin hauls in the grab his 26th of the year and a first down for the deacons here on the opening drive so third down conversion for hartman well the the protection was fantastic by this experienced offensive line sam hartman does a nice job of just sliding to his left delivers a strike to moore in youre going to hear a lot from 5 83 in 89 with donovan green out today yep and here is beale smith again driving for a couple of yards micah bland junior from mail or in the two or the two linebackers becky pardon etheridge and avery on the stop so second down and eight after a twoyard run and beale smith trying to hesitate roddy i want to go back to this read and ride here beale smith when he takes the handoff whats that what do you mean were talking about holes theyre looking for in the block game but theyve muddied the water enough havent they yeah louisvilles done a nice job up front of plugging some of these holes and you see the offensive lineman and talking to the coaching staff yesterday they said we teach the offensive line to stay on those double teams hartman another throw this one out of bounds beyond chapman the tight end who was over there and a third down miss for sam hartman kenard in the neighborhood defensively for louisville on hartford Music so heres ivan mora whos had four straight games where hes averaged more than 40 yards a punt and rodger burns averaging just about three yards of return there havent been many of them more trying to angle it toward the far corner and itll be back up the field where the cards will get started 320 in at louisville no score play right there and heres the play action off of it it makes it so tough that naked boot off the play action theres a throw and louisville had a ton of stuff going on here the ball got loose into the backfield and theyre going to call that a lateral des fitzpatrick ran it down jerry magdalenis is the referee today and it was recovered by the offense it started off the 20 and watch the play again here well lets take a look at where he releases this ball looks like his hand is right at around the 10 yard line so it will look like it it is correct theres going to be a review on this well take a look at it during the break well update you on what the result is after we come back our new house is amazing great street huge yard there is a bit of an issue with our neighbors fencing was a fumble roddy and it was confirmed so its second and 28 for louisville and for the cards thank goodness dez fitzpatrick picked it up yeah and almost picks it up on his way just to grab the ball and get it to the ref louisvilles lucky that he did it or else it would have been a walkin touchdown for wake forest but look at the field pressure from wake forest expecting that naked boot on the first play its the exact same first play that louisville ran last year second down 28 cunningham from the end zone and throws and the catch is made and that is the tight end francis sherman because we got word before the game ian pfeiffer is not going to play today so francis sherman 44 the tight end on the field now for the cardinals red shirt freshman from bay village ohio by the way thats in addition to cole bentley their starting center being out and cam to george as well yep heres cunningham on third and 17 and a keeper for the quarterback and cunningham will push it out to the 26yard line and after losing 18 before 18 yards on the first snap sminda may have saved a conversion by the cardinals we certainly did rallying back to the football and with bentley out with degeorge out no atwell no javian hawkins no ian pfeiffer the load is going to be shouldered by malik cunningham you saw it there louisville putting the ball in the hands of their dynamic playmaker so heres the ball being snapped the punter gets up with it and moving with it is harwell and hell be tackled back behind the 25yard line the deacons collapse around the football blake whiteheart the tight end whos on punt cover and punt return makes the play after the bad snap the snap is low hartwell not able to handle it has no choice but to tuck it and try and get it himself a nice play by wake forest on the defensive side being aware can you believe the first few plays for louisville though you get a lateral that puts you way behind the chains you eventually get decent field position and then the fumble punt snap the bad punt snap that sets wake forest up with great field position boy id say so the deacons have the ball at the louisville 25 yard line hartman on first down zips it to roberson and hell pick up seven almost eight yards on the play so the early break in the ball game goes to dave claussens team its a first down out to the down to the 13yard line nine and a half to go first period and the deacons trying to use the botched snap and play by white heart the tight end here to see if they can cash it in bill smith will pick up two yards well louisville had a bad throw on first down roddy it was a backwards pass and here we go with the turnover storyline that we thought might happen today wake forest has only turned the ball over once this entire season which is absolutely incredible louisville on the other hand 24 turnovers this year you saw the difference in the turnover margin and honestly wes the turnovers are whats different for louisville this season just the amount of times they have lost the turnover margin the record is about the same when they lose it theyve just been super careless with the football this year second down and eight beale smith again cracks down to about the ten third down coming up cj avery the first guy in the red shirt to get there the 29 roddy the minus 14 for louisville the plus 15 for wake forest largest in an acc game in at least 15 years the most in an fbs game since 2017 when san jose state and wyoming were something like 49 which is just insane but what do you expect its the whack right mountain west stuff here is third and seven deacons have been pretty steady their first in the acc and eighth in the country in red zone heres hartman for the end zone and it is caught touchdown moran hauls it in a great throw and a better catch on the back end for the touchdown it looked like russ yeast the louisville safety had a great shot at either picking this ball off or or at least knocking it down and marin just picks it right off his head thats a wru candidate right there wes anytime you must do it in the back of the end zone oh yeah that thats that thats gonna get mark packer uh and west durham thats gonna make the show i think 804 to go and the touchdown pass from hartman to moran gets wake on the board early point after from skiba is good so the botched punch snap and the mishandle on special teams its not charted as a fumble or a turnover roddy but it turns out to be like one with weight cashing in the score yeah youre exactly right its going to feel like that penalty is defined and the deacons the deacons strike in four plays dave claussens team goes satterfield as offensive coordinator dwayne ledford standing there on the sideline because the onus goes back to the cards now after a essentially a three and out that featured a backwards pass and a box punt snap roddy wake forest took advantage another red zone trip deacons are 35 out of 37 now on the year in the red zone one of the best in the country once they get inside the 20 and the start for louisville uh has certainly been one that scott satterfield is going to want to forget as you see the t blowing off the the ball blowing off the t its not windy where i am west but it must be windy though well check with lauritia since shes there in just a minute deacons to kick it away hassan hall deep for the ville and hell have a chance at the nine and well get to the 25 and no more and thats where louisvilles second possession will start and lets check with larissa pretty good start for the dekes who might have gotten a few less winks of sleep along the way youre right wes we have seen them get off to a fast start here we know that when talking to head coach dave claussen he mentioned that it was going to be a concern because these guys they havent tackled in a month ball security was going to be a concern for them and if they were actually up and ready for game speed and as you can see them getting on the board first they seem pretty ready see what happens with the deacon defense whos down two of their bigger stars in the front today and the first down carry belongs to jalen mitchell and hes tackled on the play by big miles fox fox who had seven total tackles three and a half behind the line in the dekes last three games before the pause in midnovember so nowhere to go for the cards offense on first down thats smith in motion cunningham a fiveyard throw here to the near side the catch made by dez fitzpatrick he and his brother christian starting today nice storyline for louisville on senior day jasir taylor on the cover for wake forest id expect number seven to be pretty busy here today wes when you talk about your biggest playmakers being out and at well and obviously hawkings having to declare it out earlier this season i think seven is going to get a ton of work here in this one third down and six for the d or for the cards against this wake forest front that brings a fifth guy through cunningham will be sacked and theres fox again pretty pronounced effort by miles fox roddy yeah it looked like he beat the freshman center austin collins watch right in the middle of your screen collins is going to slide out on fox just not able to handle it collins starting at center because colbys cole bentley excuse me was declared out early in the week cameron did george have been practicing at center he was declared out in the middle of the week so austin collins gets the start at center as a true freshman a converted defensive lineman and hes gonna have to grow up quick here today theres the punt for harwell after back to back three and out start the ball game for louisville and it will bounce out of bounds near the 39yard line crowd not happy at all the punter ryan harwell thought he might have been interfered with some of the partisans have a little look oh looked like uh williams might have gotten away with one there roddy yeah and i believe the the call on the field was that the punter was outside of the tackle box so therefore would not be subject to the same rules that protect the kicker when hes in that box when hes in a traditional formation so no roughing the kicker hartman wanted to run with it it looked like and will fire errantly looking for at perry who had a touchdown catch earlier this year against virginia but missed the last two ball games before the break in the schedule for wake forest that ended up lasting a month so its second down and 10 on the perimeter roverson track down got a yard itll be third and nine nice play peterson off his defensive end spot out into space so far this louisville defense has done an excellent job on first down stopping the run and creating these situations for wake forest now the question is going to get off the field hartman straight drop with time and throws it away over the top of morin incomplete so wakes going to go three and out here and again wes it goes back to that first down stop they created the second and long they were able to rally on second down and then on third and long hartmans got great protection but louisvilles dropping eight theres nowhere to go with the football and hes a little bit high on the throw not sure that morin would have had the first down anyway character over there to make sure so heres ivan mora to punt and roger burns the return man for the cards wants everybody out of the way and it will take a bit of a louisville bounce right along the 30 and out of bounds and thats where the cards will start their third possession dont forget we got more acc football coming up for you four oclock eastern time off to tallahassee will go for the blue devils and the seminoles those teams have combined to lose their last six roddy and florida state coming off a 28day break by the way as well chris cotter mark herzlich eric wood at dope campbell stadium and then later tonight acc network primetime presented by geico the 102nd commonwealth cup game the wahoos and the hokies with dave obrien tim hasselbeck and katie george presented by geico and this is jalen mitchell on first down scratching out a couple of yards and itll be second down at about six coming up they were uh dwayne ledford and scott satterfield really talked yeah javian hawkins big time star in this league roddy no question but they talked effusively about what they think jalen mitchells ceiling could be here at louisville in the running game hes a 221 pound redshirt freshman running back whos shown some ability in this outside zone scheme hes got a bright future here is cunningham quick throw to the near side gaz fitzpatrick another catch and finally brought to the ground jasir taylor the corner hanging on for dear life out there against fitzpatrick who got up and told him you were you were just this close right let him know let him know hey if you didnt get that jersey its a house call fitzpatrick oh my goodness first down in 10 near midfield louisvilles first third down conversion of the day so far after a pair of three and out started the contest and mitchell spins away from a play in the backfield and deacons look like chase monroe who played high school football with sam hartman and davidson day might have had a shot here at a tfl yeah he saw isaac martin was looked like he was supposed to account for monroe and roe runs right by him and just like louisville wakes done a good job with the run game on first down heres fitzpatrick and he got trapped that time by taylor in the backfield but they brought the uh the guard chandler out into space here roddy on the screen game youre trying to find some way where to take pressure off the the battery there austin collins and joshua black at center and right guard trying to take some pressure off and get some creative ways to put the ball in the hands of your playmakers but wake forest has been up to the task so far does fitzpatrick now in the slot to the top of your screen lets see if they try and go to him hassan hall in the backfield for cunningham third and the full 10 for the cards and cunningham looking for braden smith no flag on the play the louisville bench not happy with the no call and it looked like the the deacon coverage was kobe davis its probably i think thats a good no call im not sure braden smith gets to that ball either way kobe davis is flirting with danger there but a good no call by the referees braden smith wasnt getting there anyway davis yet another young guy relatively speaking for wake forest fourth and ten after the first down the drive stalls near midfield heres the harwell punt and it will be fielded and the deacons will start right around the 10yard line on maureens gather so 70 wake forest the early miscue in the special teams game still the difference and sam hartman another i tell you roddy we were talking about this during the week the the wake forest quarterback pedigree here in recent years often gets overlooked doesnt it yeah when you go from john walford in 2017 to sam hartman and jamie newman then jamie newman and sam hartman now to hartman those four years of quarterback consistency is something not very many schools outside of clemson south carolina and charlottesville virginia have had over the last four seasons throw to roberson on the perimeter on first and ten a couple of yards to the 14 you see levy jenkins out of the secondary with marlon character on the play and going back to the quarterback conversation wes you know i mentioned those two schools just because of the consistency with most other schools in the league you can point to a year with a quarterback play just wasnt exactly up to par sam hartman one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the league and that throw for roberson defended again by jenkins true freshman from orlando two and a half to go larisha more on sam harper as were talking about uh just a quarterback situation when we had the conversation with taco state claus and as well as the offensive coordinator they both echoed the same sentiment saying you know that sam doesnt get the recognition that he deserves hes one of the most underrated players and quarterbacks in the acc here is hartman on third and six and underneath beale smith tried to make the first guy miss and boy louisville did a nice job cj avery got christian bill smith right around the legs and was able to stop him at the 20 so fourth down coming up roddy when you look at the numbers how do you how do you put sam hartman in the pantheon of current acc quarterbacks this is a really good quarterback league this year so you have to preface it by saying that but but sam hartmans numbers dont speak to everything that hes done this season hes doing it on an offense that really has two guys coming back around him no receivers of most of the running back production gone most of the offensive line production gone so i put sam hartman yeah up in the top half of the league for sure in terms of quarterbacks in the acc right roger burns a fair catch at the 42 well when we talk about deacon quarterbacks roddy interesting we go back in time but we also got to live in the world of reality television here dont we look wes uh this is the most under talked about story in the entire in the entire country tyler cameron was tyler c on the last season of the bachelorette its its the thing that we need to be talking about the most i mean when you look at when you look at reality stars wake already has one on their team sam hartman was on qb one hes a good looking dude could he be the next bachelor this pipeline could continue us im telling you he could be the bachelor one day wake forest has produced as ive said two contestants already and it may continue for the future only thing i can add to this conversation is down to larissa in a moment for more on this apparently very hot topic involving wake forest football second and ten not much there as you see wake forest rallied to the ball will smart to stop larisha well i had the conversation about whether or not sam hartman should join this pipeline with a couple of fans today and they agreed they said he had the look he has the hair the beard the poise he could definitely add on to this and be a great candidate for the next bachelor oh boy i mean look a lot of people say tyler c tyler cameron should have won the former wake forest quarterback now you get an opportunity to see matt james go through the whole thing as a receiver i mean sam hartmans had a better career at wake than both of them cunninghams going to be sacked wait gets into the backfield jacquez williams fifth year senior steps in through the offensive line of louisville and gets right to malik cunningham here he gets oneonone against hassan hall and just wins in that pass pro quez williams exploding through the hole tackling the quarterback and without boogie basham theyre going to have to create some of these opportunities a little bit more the oneonones with running backs and linebackers and williams able to win there heres harwells punt maureen will signal again for the fair catch watch it bounce and it takes a big louisville kick now inside the 20 and inside the 15 so harwell down around the 12 here on one of the final plays of the first period well while roddy and larissa were setting the table for the future of the bachelor and bachelorette series uh and apparently auditioning sam hartman into the classification id like to say that louisville has also gone three and out in three of their first four possessions ronnie yeah this was a 6259 game last year im not sure we expected seven nothing as we enter the end of the as we get towards the end of the first quarter but thats where we are this louisville defense has been content with stopping the run early and then dropping eight on third downs making it tough on sam hartman and wake forest on defense has really gotten after this louisville offense justice ellison has come into the backfield now we see the backup to christian beale smith after news this week that kenneth walker is not with the team and here is ellison on his first carry picking up eight yards into the secondary rod jay burns makes the tackle with josh minkins and that will get us to the end of period one at cardinals stadium seven nothing wake eleventh and planning for them being meticulous and we are confident well be ready and i think college football will be ready mr hancock paul stark another set of the rankings tuesday night five start second down and second down coming up as we continue second quarter play here at cardinal stadium and of course the cfp exclusively on the espn family of networks roddy im anxious to see kind of how the this weekend and the next weekend play out in determining not just the four but also the rest of the new year six as well as we get a look at justice ellison here on second and seven and ellison powers across the 30 for a first down before roger burns makes the attack and this is the best first down play that wake has had we saw justice ellison exploding up the middle for that big gain now wake is going to be able to get into some of their tempo and really stress this louisville defense low snap for hartman trying to get away ball popped loose and recovered by ellison i believe diving forward at the 34 deacons came within a whisker after peterson jarred it loose wake almost had their second turnover of the year well when you turn the ball over this few times in a season you need a little bit of luck on your side you see peterson coming from the bottom is able to knock the ball out and the football is shaped like a lemon west which means you never know which way its going to bounce some years all of those bounces go away from you wake is in one of those years where all of those bounces go towards their players good point heres the hartman throw and incomplete looking inside for morin and then all of a sudden it becomes third down rowdy very quickly the deacons have got a couple nice runs out of ellison the fumble and then the incomplete ball heres third and eight and on these third and longs louisville has been perfectly content to only rush three drop eight and make it really tough for sam hartman to find anyone to go to hartman from dead in the pocket and almost intercepted that was monty montgomery the secret sauce of the louisville defense almost came away with a pick and it would have been the first of the year for hartman monty montgomerys explosive watch him read the eyes of sam hartman as he comes back he just drifts back to his left and almost picks that one off again a little lucky if montgomerys a little bit too more to his left thats a pick and hes got a lot of room to work with so wake continues its turnover less streak and sam hartman continues his streak without an interception six plays and now a punt and the deacons have a chance cant make the save some kind of punt though with the win for maura hartman now fifth all time in the acc without an interception that one came within a whisker 246 attempts and mora a season best 66yard punt right there for the dekes and a career best as well for ivan mora the redshirt freshman from dalton the question here wes is going to be what does louisville go to to get something going on the offensive side of the football theyre going to have to get malik cunningham involved in the run game more either on naked boots quarterback draws just something to create some explosive plays empty set for cunningham and now we get procedure full start offense and the cards five yard penalty going to take a procedure penalty of five yards roddy you mentioned no cole bentley today no cam to george so a new battery in there with austin collins who is the fourth team center today for Music malik cunningham you see the the prowess of louisville offensively five straight games of 400 yards or more eight total this year and dwayne ledford looks on here as his team has it first in 15 and theres another slow start and a busted play and thats going to result in another penalty roddy i guess my question is austin collins is one thing and then you push josh black into the lineup thats an entirely different deal right youre two guys it certainly is and you know when its your center you see malik cunningham and marshawn ford talking austin collins in the middle number 51 five yard panels that ball was snapped during the shift so there was some miscommunication on what the snap count was going to be you see ford moving up the ball being snapped cunningham certainly wasnt ready for it and you get the procedure penalty its been a rough start for this louisville offense you had the the backwards pass that set them behind the sticks a couple of a couple of series ago and they have not been able to get anything going on offensive side of the ball yep and no big plays for the cards too straight ahead mitchell and hell pick up a couple to the 15 tackle made by monroe so we get chase monroe in the mix today redshirt junior three tackles against both virginia and virginia tech earlier this year but wake forest is we told you 20 minutes before the ball game we found out that carlos boogie basham suleiman kamara would not be playing on that deacon defensive front today here is mitchell trying to get to the edge on the boundary side and hell be shoved out again monroe over there for wake forest along with jj roberts a young freshman from hurricane west virginia playing in his seventh game of the year for the dekes theres nothing in the playbook for a third and long like this again you know i mentioned it on first down it looked like they were going to go to it malik cunningham is going to be the guy who who keeps you in this game getting him involved in the run game maybe not here but down the line is going to be the utmost importance its going to cut it loose on third down and it is offline dez fitzpatrick closest guy there for louisville katelyn carson respectively for wake forest and roddy the third three and out or the fourth three and out in uh five possessions now for the cards in this first half its its been a rough go um theres theres no way around it and i think the mistakes that have shot themselves in the foot are gonna be the most frustrating the bad snap on the pawns the the miscommunications that created the procedure penalties thats the stuff that scott satterfields gonna be the most frustrated with harwells punt toward morin at the 45 of week and the first down throw from hartman across the way toward the wide receiver at perry is out of bounds so itll be second and ten and here is beale smith bouncing outside and christian beale smith taking two three red shirts to the first down at the louisville 45 yard line yasir abdullah was uh trying to get there or and okiki as well theres nikko kiki christian bill smiths got the old adage runs behind his pads roddy yeah he does hes tough to bring down hartman and angled out of bounds after a yard or two bonnie montgomery chasing across the way second at eight for wake forest hartman and tried to fire it to perry across the middle marlin character there in coverage so third down coming up all right first half time for todays trivia question 2016 pitt in syracuse combined for the most points in an acc game with 137 what was the second highest scoring game in acc history answer in a moment ronnie ramsey 137 by the way were you a part of the series yes sir i was there i was there yeah so say pat narduzzi was the winning coach was not happy not happy after the game third down and eight hartman deep and overthrows perry isaiah hayes in coverage and i tell you what after pretty good field position the initial stop the initial curl would have been open isaiah hayes was giving a big cushion to at perry and perry just not able to get over the top of them that ball falls incomplete had they gone to the initial curl right at the sticks would have been wide open for a first down wake forest here three for eight on third down heres more at a punt and that ball will bounce into the end zone right between two dekes well lets go back to last october roddy truest field in winstonsalem and hassan hall hesitates and next thing you know he houses one from 100 yards and that put louisville up 217 but that was really only the beginning of the story this was an incredible game malik cunningham gets hurt evan conley comes in this salted the game away and louisville wins 6259 in a game that they needed all that they could get from the offense the defense the special teams everybody contributed and weve got a completely different game this year and no defensive coach was happy again and speaking of hall hassan hall with one of the best plays of the day so far for the cardinal offense on first down ronnie absolutely and nick andersons been a great story this year saves a touchdown you get an inside zone here hassan hall gets through a big hole and it was he and anderson up the middle anderson makes the tackle or else that one would have gone for six sure best player of the day for the cardinals and heres cunningham on the keeper trying to find a seam steps through a couple and well reach the 45 for another first down well and you know what they say timings everything now for todays trivia question answer roddy if pitt and syracuse is the most points in an acc game with 137 whats the second highest scoring game aha a year ago in winstonsalem 121 for the cards in the dekes 6259 and theres a whistle and a flag and is this the third procedure penalty first down three of those right roddy here in the first half Music we had him on backtoback plays on the last drive and and then you get that one on caleb chandler as you get a look at uh some of the stats from last years game 1100 yards 16 touchdowns 121 points what a difference a year some opt outs and some injuries can make and now we get another movement this will be the fourth procedure if you will false start same variety type systems penalty all four have come on the louisville offense fourth on the cards theyre all the same and we tell you about bentley and george not being there austin collins 51 the fourth string center is starting today they plugged josh black in at the right guard spot to spell to george the george was gonna play center because they knew that bentley couldnt play and theres a throw in a catch grab made by jordan watkins by the way near the 45yard line lets go to laurisha whos bringing us up to speed on this austin collins lorisha when i had the opportunity to talk to malik cunningham i asked him what was the conversation between himself and collins and he told me hey i just told him play your game trust your instincts do what it is that you do best and we saw them on the sideline give each other a little bit of encouragement as well as others on the offensive line all right well collins has got his hands full today and you saw that time isaiah chaney bust through red shirt freshman from cartersville georgia former fighting purple hurricane near rotty you know a little bit about the fighting purple hurricane living up in cartersville georgia not as much as my wife it was a proud fighting purple hurricane but yes youre right louisville is over five on their third downs this one a third and eleven its been tough for malik cunningham to have much time to do anything because of the absences on that offensive line heres cunningham trying to slide it up field fitzpatrick to catch first down and more down the far sideline goes dez fitzpatrick and now louisvilles got a little offensive momentum built at the wake 29 kobe davis the tackle after a 27yard throw and this time the offensive line does a nice job of sorting out a twist gives malik cunningham some time and dez fitzpatrick one of the best receivers in the acc has been the past couple of seasons dangerous with the ball in his hands i expect lee cunningham to continue to go to seven especially in these crucial third down situations hes a guy that just continues to make plays so lets see what louisville can do in a seven nothing ball game cunningham looking for the end zone and caught fits patrick first and goal around the one roddy hes throwing it in the wind and fitzpatrick stays with it watch the route its patricks gonna go inside try and get in between these safeties and then up the field and malik cunningham actually hangs this one up a little bit as you said may have gotten caught in the wind but sevens gonna go up and get the ball when its in the air dez fitzpatrick is exciting to watch on those 50 50 if you will balls and dez fitzpatrick has always been good at it and he proves it there again theyre gonna move him around and find ways to get the ball around number seven first and goal and cunningham kept it no gain on the play and second and goal coming up this is marshon ford territory malika cunningham likes to go to the tight end number 83 five touchdowns on the year they like to try and get cunningham outside on these bootlegs typically theyll either try and go to atwell or ford with atwell out lets say find 83 and if they go to the pass game and watch where he goes because the ball is going there you see they go two tights to the left here cunningham going to pitch this its a foot race to the corner and hall will win for the louisville touchdown it makes it look like looks like its going to be zone reed hassan hall just takes out takes off on the sweet play and pitch it out to him and youre able to leverage the defense its a nice play design the linebackers are watching the fake as if its going to be zone read they come to malik cunningham when he just pitches it outside to hassan hall whos got the burners to make the foot race to the end zone first rush on the launch pad and finally got off of it on that last drive 80 yards for a touchdown 14 yards in the first five drives yeah it was a it was sloppy it was a sloppy transition from the space program to their last drive but i tried thats right yeah why didnt you just say blast off while you were there i mean come on what are we doing here uh short kick itll be fielded and coming back across the 25 to the 30yard line is christian beale smith for wake forest so were tied at seven and dont forget new years day is where you want to be rose bowl at five allstate sugar bowl at 8 45 the top four in the play for college footballs national championship roddy heres the interesting thing for wake forest you had a seven nothing lead we talked about louisvilles three an ounce wake has run 11 plays in their last two possessions but also ended up punting you talked about the improvement weve seen out of the louisville defense from last year to this year car defense played okay here today right now i would say the car defense has played well theyve only given up the one touchdown and that was on a very short field heres roberson keeping his feet on first down driving it to the 48 before avery makes the tackle another good first half for jakoy roberson of wake forest yeah this louisville defense has done the improvement by not giving up chunk plays like that one really the first one that wakes up hartman overthrows morin with chandler jones there in coverage for the cards and just look at the improvement on this louisville defense total yards allowed they go from 13th last year to fifth in the conference this year yards per play they go from 13th to 8th i mean its been incredible for brian brown and this louisville defense the improvement that theyve seen in the season that hasnt gone louisvilles way yeah lovie jenkins to stop neil smith one of his best runs of the day deacons trying to answer the louisville td drive now with under six to go in this first half one of three today on acc network for you here is christian beale smith slipping on the cut and down to the 32 larissa lots of credit for his defensive effort and he took me to a conversation that he had with his players after a georgia tech game this year and he said he just asked them what was going on what are you guys doing and basically after that they decided to go back to the fundamentals they went back to tackling and to putting forth fullblown effort and he said thats the credit for them with their improvement every game they went back to the fundamentals and so now that mentality is there for his players its paid off since that loss in atlanta on a friday night quick throw to at perry ruled out of bounds again second time perry has trapped himself on the sideline in this first half on the catch yeah it feels like hes just lacking awareness when he gets towards that sideline or where those feet come in i dont know lewis i actually think that was a catch i think that left foot came down first another quick throw and all of a sudden wake forest has found themselves the third in the full 10 here wake forest tempo kind of worked against them there i think if theyd had more time they may have gotten that last play reviewed that theyve got this louisville defense scrambling with the substitutions dont take advantage of it yeah digs three for eight on third down hartman straight back cuts it loose and overshoots perry again marlin character in the neighborhood and now fourth down with 503 to go and here comes nick skeba to try and put weight back in the lead it was the best drive for wake forest but just stalls out sam hartman not able to follow through on that throw because of the pressure around him it sails high you see the disappointment from hartman and missing the open receiver 45yard try for skiba 46 his longest of the year fifth best score in the acc kick away i mean that is that is some quality gear there theyre gonna wear it make it look good yeah and louisville last time they were at home rocked those throwback jerseys those were clean yeah and the cards trailing 107 always great fans when you come to derby city for acc football or basketball whatever just great support here here is the kick and hassan hall will wave it off cards will start from their 25 roddy uh these fans a week ago not particularly happy with their football coach when word got out about a reported meeting with scott satterfield in south carolina he apologized issued a letter to season ticket holders and it it brought back some bad memories quite frankly for louisville fans it certainly did but the players really really rallied around scott satterfield i mean they had a number of different statements tweets in public issuing support for their head coach and look time heals all wounds as they say but but louisville has been burned in the past and ultimately wins are going to be the thing that propels scott satterfield back into the good graces first down play and here goes mitchell breaking free jalen mitchell in a foot race with kalyn carson to get to the end zone and he makes it to the five big time run by mitchell big time blocks by the offensive line up front you know weve talked about what theyre missing on the interior but the inside zone they just wash the entire right side of the line down opens up a massive hole and jalen mitchell you got to get the piano off your back once you cross the 20 you finish that run that gets them inside the 5yard line and sets louisville up in great position to take the lead in this game huge run 70 yards from mitchell and now first and goal for the cards boy look at this package thats thats smith in motion and a timeout being taken by louisville louisville their first time out of the half 30 30second timeout so scott satterfield wants to talk larissa gives us a chance to follow up on what roddy mentioned a moment ago and that was the the voices of support from the current players for the head coach in the midst of the aftermath last weekend yeah so many players were very very supportive malik cunningham one of them telling me that coach is a very honest guy and he actually thought the media was bashing coach in a sense and asked if they could just take it lightly because coach has been nothing but truthful and honest that also came from trey clark and james turner and even dorian etheridge they all echoed the same sentiment saying that coach has been nothing but open and honest and hes a very standup guy and a guy who is one who keeps his word so a lot of support coming from current players and former players as well roddy as a player scott satterfield tumultuous week especially publicly press conferences those type things as a player and to a degree a coach well ask you after this first down play out of the louisville timeout heres cunningham the cards in front backtoback touchdown drives now for satterfields team well i i love this play call because you go with the tight end to the right side creating an unbalanced formation run back to the nub side with the tight end with your hback and your running back leading malik cunningham is able to find a seam and dive into the end zone and you can see the excitement on that sideline its been a tough week as you said youve had a lot of news coming out a lot of stuff going on around the program a bad start and yet theyre able to take the lead in this football game it you get the cunningham touchdown run which is his seventh of the year by the way roddy the point i guess is players and coaches are the ones thats thats the most important relationship for success in a football program how much does that presence on social media mean to scott satterfield when its been as turbulent as maybe its been the last eight days well scott satterfield told us he has not been on social media so im not even sure hes aware of the public support or he was aware until we told him what his guys had tweeted out but i think its incredibly important and look you have to realize what these players have been through from a coach standpoint the previous regime was completely different from this one these guys love scott satterfield and what hes brought to this place and he has been completely honest with them from everything that we have heard so the feeling in the building seems to be hey look coach may have gotten caught in something that is very complicated and probably doesnt look great but they truly believe that this is where he wants to be and that he truly cares about them which is the most important thing well and the cards have rebounded not only there but theyve rebounded in this ball game to take a four point lead and short kick is handled here by beale smith and he will dance through the 25 and again right around the 30yard line when hes brought down cards by the way 75 rushing yards on their last two snaps after having just 10 yards on their first 16 snaps today and a second quarter against provided magic for satterfields team theyve now outscored opponents 127 to 50 in the second quarter this year roddy its incredible and it shows the ability to make adjustments on both the offensive and defensive side of the football a lot of times that first quarter is feeling it out second quarter is when you settle in and make those adjustments so sam hartmans got justice ellison with him now ellison taken down in the backfield thats rajay burns another big play the senior from trinity high school in louisville burns is going to come off the right side hes unblocked and just tackles ellison in the backfield its really felt like brian brown the defensive coordinator from louisville has had a really good feed on when wake forest is going to run the football and been able to stop it really well ellison on second down battles across roger burns another tackle boy justice ellison has done a nice job roddy he came into the ballgame had six carries against syracuse for 16 yards five for 27 against the campbell camels and theres a throw roberson a catch thatll be another first down just ahead of three minutes to go and now all of a sudden the deacons starting to find a little momentum were able to find roberson on that third down going underneath and thats what theyre going to have to be content with louisvilles saying hey look were not going to give up the big play well give you the passes underneath hartman resets and looking for roberson who was in hand to hand with dorian etheridge its been kind of a fun chess match to watch between the wake forest defense offense and the louisville defense louisville has had such success stopping the run on first down they anticipated pass on that one press coverage carrying up the middle and able to create the incompletion and that ball is caught by brandon chapman hes wrestled down monty montgomery who had a big play earlier in the half for the cards and forces another third down clock rolling here late second quarter big third down for the deacons hartman had it broken and intercepted monty montgomery who then laterals the ball russ yeast in the open field tackled at around the 37yard line of wake forest first interception of the year for hartman second turnover of the year for wake forest hartman visibly frustrated with whats go with what happened on that play the throws just a little high for roberson whos not able to bring it in it bounces around and monty montgomery comes up with it we talked a little bit about the fact that when you have those streaks of no turnovers you have to have some luck the ball has been in danger now this is the third time for wake forest and finally this louisville defense which hasnt been great at creating turnovers only their 11th turnover this season that theyve created their 11th takeaway finally gets one into their hands oh hartman frustrated it looked like chandler jones got a hand in there and then finally deflected into the hands of montgomery who then lateral to yeast the guts of a gambler there and by the way the we have marlin character shaken up on the play for louisville but meanwhile the first interception of the year for sam hartman snaps the interception less streak and now louisville roddy after a sluggish start offensively takes over here with 225 to go on the interception and in wake territory at the 37th and not a lot there on first down for hall i think you have to give a ton of credit in this game to the louisville defense and what theyve done against an explosive wake forest offense and given their offense time to kind of figure out whats going on this has always been an explosive unit no matter whos back there for louisville but dez fitzpatrick really powered them a couple of series ago you had the big run from jalen mitchell on the last series thats allowed them to take the lead here goes hall runs right into smenda bounces off of him and then forward hassan hall driving down toward about the 31yard line or so well see how they spot this and wes we talked to lyle hemphill the defensive coordinator for wake about sort of their game plan a year ago and he mentioned they had a lot of success against that outside zone that we talked about at the top the stretch play so louisville went to the inside zone thats where theyve had the most success here today as well cunningham looping it down the field and caught braden smith itll be a catch inside the five around the two lets take a look and see if he gets his feet and this ones gonna be closed secured oh i think that left toe comes down on the line this ones going to be reviewed and i think its going to come back but what a great route by braden smith almost almost completes that i think its going to come back though after the first review that we saw after the first replay so we will hold here at cardinals stadium while they review this watch his left foot the right foot clearly in but well the question is does that right toe come down with the ball secured before the left one does the left foot clearly the toe comes in out of bounds but theres a toe tap on the right foot that trailing foot that may have gotten down before the the left foot comes down out of bounds i dont know well we couldnt see the right foot on that one it was remember now call to catch thats the other voice it was called a catch on the field mike griffin our director thomas marcia our producer trying to give everybody looking on here the replay booth at cardinal stadium the master operations center for acc football at the conference offices in greensboro watch the right foot so so if you watch the right foot the ball is coming in hes got it secured now the right toe looks like it touches the ground before that left one comes down right this may give us a good look the right foot boom hits you can see it bounce off the turf that left one comes down and the the heels in bounds but the toe is out this ones going to be bang bang i think i would let it stand just because the timing of those two feet and the call on the field was a catch all right now you have always been kind of at the forefront of these interpretations and evaluations especially as it relates to targeting we sat in that room two summers ago and watched guys for a couple hours go at it on this stuff this is one of those in that room right and ultimately there there are people making these decisions so so its going to come down to some judgment there youre looking for indisputable video evidence either way theyre further reviewed the ruling on the field stands as call ruling on the field stands is called the reason it stands is because of that right foot right you have to have indisputable video evidence that the right foot did not come down prior to the left foot coming down out of bounds and there was not there there was enough disputable there was enough to dispute to let that play stand i think its a good call by the officiating crew 29yard throw braden smith a great catch first and goal the cards with 73 seconds to go low snap they hand it to hall and hassan hall gets turned around right at the point of impact jakory johns the big 250 pound defensive end red shirt sophomore from cartersville georgia in there again for the dukes 30 second time out so second and goal coming up we get a quick timeout good chance for us to remind you theres more acc football ahead after the ball game today well send you to tallahassee for duke and florida state 8 oclock tonight acc primetime football presented by geico the commonwealth cup with the cavaliers and the hokies by the way virginia tech needs a win roddy to avoid their worst record since 1977 when they went 371 wow cavaliers 54 last year bryce perkins had 475 yards of total offense for the cavaliers and that thrilling victory for bronco mendenhalls team at charlottesville that comes up tonight dave obrien tim hasselbeck katie george even with the limited number of folks in attendance should still be a really really physical football game out of the timeout heres hall again and wake did hall get in he did i thought he got smashed at the line of scrimmage and hassan hall was able to bound into the end zone for his second rushing touchdown of the day and louisvilles third roddy in about the last five minutes and change what a difference the first and second quarters make for louisville theres nothing there to say that he was on the ground prior to busting into the end zone so that stands and i think its important louisville took a timeout before that last play which preserved about a minute left on the clock for wake forest who has all three of their timeouts so plenty of time for wake forest to operate and be able to get a score if they can get something going but that louisville timeout actually helped wake forest because it left more time on the clock and allowed them to preserve all of their timeouts although the most important thing in that situation is obviously to get the ball in the end zone five plays 37 yards in 121 the time of the drive and here is the point after from turner and how about that so the hall touchdown run makes it an 11 point cardinal lead and roddy what a difference a quarter makes for scott satterfields team and to be honest with you this this louisville defense has only given up the touchdown on the short field after the up to the bobble punt i mean other than that its really been been fantastic so far in this game you see the first quarter negative 22 yards rushing 29 passes thats seven total yards west i did the quick math there seven total yards in the first quarter i am not going to attempt to do the math in the second quarter i think im going to embarrass myself but lets just say over 200 yards in the second half completely different amazing transformation three touchdowns and essentially about five minutes and 42 seconds of game time hartmans first interception of the year by the way has produced a touchdown an 11point lead and with just ahead of a minute to go we got a whistle blow as the ball is kicked away well reset the ball fell off the tee before it was kicked and brock travelstead will bring it back and theyll sort it out Music again when wake gets the ball back here wes and obviously the most important thing is going to be getting something going but theyve got plenty of time a minute four left theyll have either a little bit over a little bit under a minute left on the clock with all three timeouts the run games in play everything in the playbook at least at the beginning of this drive is going to be open to them the most important thing though is that first first down and getting going yep and the kick by travel stead and wake forest handles it on the return here deakins working to the perimeter with keyshawn williams and thats where theyll go with 57 seconds left dave claussens got all three timeouts remaining by the way for sam hartman and the ball will be spotted for play right at the 30yard line and this is not wake up by the way for wake forest here in this first half yeah incredible this is the wake forest offense that already can go at warp speed so this is going to be no different for them going with three receivers into the boundary taylor marin one on one down to the bottom see what hartman does following his first pick of the year from the pocket now flushed and hell throw it into the bench area took out a gatorade in a dozen cups or so itll be second of ten you know this this level of defense has really had the number of wake forests on offense that time they looked like they were going to go with the one high safety look and give taylor marin some room down to the bottom of the screen in the oneonone but they go with the cover two look and really muddy things up to the boundary and give sam hartman nowhere to go with the ball harmon going to try again and that time looking down the far side Music sam got us down you got to start looking at it from the other way i mean theres 45 seconds left louisvilles got two timeouts does does wake forest dare to throw another pass and try and get the first down because louisville gets the ball first or gets the ball in the second half as well so what what is wake forest going to go with here do they try and dry out those timeouts so they go unfoldable theyre going to throw it it looks like hartman now flushed here to the left trying to get something going and overshoots marin incomplete so three and out goes to dekes with 37 seconds left and now scott satterfield with those two timeouts and the clock stopped and roddy the interesting part is now maura will have the wind at his back he had a 66yarder earlier in this period good snap good punt and louisvilles going to let it bounce and the clock continues to run and out of bounds it goes around the 17yard line with 27 seconds left so scott satterfield gets his choice here its been quite a second quarter for his louisville team didnt look particularly good in fact the cards went three and out on four of their first five possessions ronnie their first five drives 17 plays for 14 yards their last four drives 14 plays 192 yards so they found the offensive button here and now how aggressive do you want to be going to the locker room with this lead of 11 points well ivan moore gets a lot of credit for flipping the field here i think had that ball been caught around the 30 you probably push the gas a little bit and see what you can get now i expect louisville to hand the ball off if you get a big game then maybe you bang a timeout and you continue to try and score but other than that youre just going to be happy to take in the locker room jalen mitchell trying to get the run game going and big miles fox wraps him up and that likely will be the final play of the first half yep cards are just gonna head to the locker room so one play and let the clock run out and thats what louisville will do quite a turnaround for satterfields team though roddy absolutely was yeah i mean you look at the way this game started and then everything that could have gone wrong seemed like it did and then the defense just battled and battled in battle kept their offense in the game and allowed them to sort of find their footing with the young offensive line the replacements and skill positions and they completely turned around lets go downstairs to larissa with coach centerfield coach you guys settled in in the second quarter whats the credit for that shift after a sluggish first uh first quarter yeah well i mean were trying to work some kinks out we started six freshmen today on offense and uh gave up some pressures and some sacks early in the first quarter kind of settled in there in the second quarter our defense is playing good you know we put them in a bind in the first quarter with the uh with the muff punt or whatever i mean a bad snap there but but i think overall uh the defense kept us in the first quarter offense came to live in the second quarter what was your reaction to montgomerys interception that was awesome you know uh we gotta we want to win the turnover about marching today you know coming into this game you know white was number one in the country we were like third to last so uh you know we went in the second half i feel like we got a good chance to win it thank you malik cunningham like i said seven total yards of offense in the first half for louisville 208 total yards in that second quarter dez fitzpatrick with the catch hauls it in good good field position here deep in the red zone two plays later cunningham keeper dives touchdown on wake forest great to be with roddy jones and lauricia harris uh this afternoon game one of our acc network triple header roddy and its the first half really punctuated by big plays from louisville in the second quarter after they were trailing 70 yeah after that this second quarter really got going with the long dez fitzpatrick play before this one he converted a big third down then they go up top to him and hes able to come down with a jump ball that really got them going for their first touchdown then you get jalen mitchell up the middle exploding for a big 70 yard run gets him down close to the end zone able to punch it in there and then the defense came to play this defense have been fantastic all game but they create the turnover get the interception of sam hartman this team this wake forest team thats their first interception of the season throne that led to the third touchdown scott satterfield has to be really proud especially of his defense in this game that kept him in it early while the offense struggled then the offense was able to create some plays in the second quarter and the defense brought its lunch pail as well creating the turnover well you see the difference in 15 minutes of play the first and the second for scott satterfields team the other issue becomes big plays only three of them beyond 10 yards in the first period seven in the second quarter and the last four were 29 70 28 and 27 thats the kind of stuff that theyre used to here when satterfields offense is up and humming took a little time to get maybe lined up and ready to go and he indicated that with laurisha as our second half starts and the cards ironically get the ball to start the half therell be no return of the kick and louisville will start from its 25yard line and uh when you talk about the numbers malik cunningham eight of 11 123 remember now the first play of the game was an illegal by a legal forward pass that was thrown behind a legal backward pass i should say result of an 18yard loss but cunningham kind of rescued a little bit in the throw game roddy 123 yards on 11 attempts thats a pretty nice yards for throw yeah absolutely and the big plays that thats fitzpatrick have really been the story there but this offensive line settling in and finding success with that inside zone play has really gotten this offense going as well so it looks like the winds blowing so hard the ball was rolling yep so the the wind whipping through cardinal stadium here and you see the streamer on the top of the goal post first down give and this is mitchell who had the big 70 yard run he gets about seven on first down here second down coming up and uh lets check with larissa harris i was able to talk to heco steve claussen and i asked him you know was fatigue an issue when it came down to the play that we saw from his his players in the first half and he said no they are a little tired but thats no reason for what took place he said the key to being better the second half is converting on third downs tackling better meaning completing their tackles and also just finding an offensive flow they have to get that thing moving pistol set here for louisville on second and short cunningham going to keep first down and more and its going to be jacquez williams that rides him out of bounds over in front of the deacon bench after a good run for malik cunningham here 15 yards rodney we usually see that outside zone play as the staple of this louisville offense but the inside zone and the triple option look off of it is something that louisville went to last year against wake forest and they brought it back this year and found some success as larusha said with david claussen theyre going to have to make plays tackling is going to have to be one of those things as well because weve seen a couple missed tackles on the last couple plays straight ahead and this is mitchell again and jalen mitchell will push it to the deacon 45 and a half yard line and louisville kind of off and running picking up from where they left off you might think yeah they absolutely are and and the fact that malik cunningham hasnt had to shoulder the load in the run game like it looked like he was going to have too early it is big and jalen mitchell i think were seeing the emergence of maybe the next guy at that running back position hassan hall is a good player but jalen mitchell from a running back standpoint just looks more the part looks more comfortable running the zone scheme yep and here is mitchell again trying to find a seam on the left side hell have enough for the first down jacorey johns wrapped him up for wake forest well the one aspect about this is and you start thinking about the momentum the cards built in the second quarter wake forest will have to find a way to build their own momentum offensively roddy and and you mentioned this late in the first half the the touchdown they got was off a miscue in the punt game for louisville and outside of that wake forest has gotten the skiba field goal on a uh on a nine play drive about midway the second period of play and that kind of you know youre looking maybe for wake forest to kind of find the momentum that louisville found in quarter two here when they get the ball back but right now they got to get the cards off the field and mitchell and cunningham are just running it right at him yeah and and lets not lets not forget that this is the wakes first game since november 14th i mean they had a couple of games postponed they had to pause activities in the program they had some shuffling and then they had an issue getting to louisville they got on the plane yesterday was supposed to take off at 2 30 they their first plane had some issues they walked a mile to a hotel we did the coaches interviews while theyre sitting in the hotel scrambling with meetings had to walk a mile back to a plane that got delayed they got to louisville around nine oclock last night didnt get to the hotel until 10 30 this is a wake forest team thats dealt with an incredible amount of adversity and there is mitchell pushing the first down stick on the tackle by smender and louisville is just kind of lining up and finding some confidence especially for austin collins at fourth team center who drew the start today with cole bentleys sideline cam to george also out of the lineup as well and for montgomery alabamas malik cunningham just the just the momentum of getting stuff done offensively in the second quarter has carried over to the opening drive of this second half you got to ask yourself how much does wake force miss boogie basham and suleiman suleiman kamara on the defensive line as well yeah good point there heres mitchell trying to spin for more and he got brought down by jakori johns big number four there to be the first deacon to arrive and so all of a sudden louisville now finds itself in uh second and long theres a look at carlos boogie basham roanoke virginia 45 career games 36 and a half tackles for loss 20 and a half sacks and about 20 minutes before kickoff it was announced he would be unavailable today he did come out and warm up early today and then was announced as unavailable heres cunningham on that bootleg play roddy you talked about got the ball away and the catch is made and our first look at marshawn ford in the open field for the louisville first down wake forest did a nice job of containing the quarterback making malik cunningham pull up but hes able to dump the ball to his tight end that becomes more and more one of his favorite targets the closer they get to the end zone we havent seen that play action naked boot very much because they havent gone to the outside zone a ton but able to get a good play there and create a third and one yeah youre seeing just short so ford stepped out of bounds at the 22 heres a big third down play cunningham going to flip it to ford again ford made a man miss in the backfield that was carson the corner who had come up and eventually anderson makes the tackle but not before marshawn ford gets the first down yardage goes to him again a similar play this time they fake that inside zone that theyve gone to so often theres pressure on malik cunningham and he just dumps it quickly and does a nice job to get a block out on the perimeter in the first down so the cards from the 16 now red zone opportunity for satterfields team third in the acc coming in hassan hall has come in to replace mitchell as the running back thats smith in the orbit pattern and heres cunningham on the keep and hell slash down near the five yard line nick anderson the safety who had the three interceptions against virginia tech earlier in the year makes the play on the cardinal quarterback you cant blame malik cunningham for deciding to just go here but if hes able to press nick anderson and get that thing pitched man its a walkin into the end zone but you cant fault him for taking a positive play i mean that was uh he always feels like he can take it to the house he saw him when he came up man i almost had that one who amongst us though wanted their quarterback to pitch it to him on a regular basis right absolutely i was the one that come back to the huddle saying man josh you got to pitch that one like i know you thought you could have made the play but i could have had a touchdown and it was going to come off first and goal for louisville at the five and here is cunningham keeping it again gets a couple toward the three and its jones that makes the stop for wake forest the alignment that louisville gets into with the pistol set the triple option you talked about the outside zone the stuff theyve run inside today after they got collins comfortable he and black playing at the center guard spot for louisville yeah the inside stuff has been whats been open and how about this drive for louisville to start the second half almost seven minutes off the clock wide open for the touchdown is sherman a 12play drive is capped with a throw to francis sherman the tight end this is a complete team drive i mean malik cunningham certainly made some plays marshawn ford and then the easy touchdown for sherman in the end zone but you got to give credit to the offensive line opening up holes for jalen mitchell you got to give credit to dez fitzpatrick and this receiving core as well that was a statement drive yep and they could go up 18 here with the extra point and the point by turner is good inside the upright so they burned almost seven minutes of the third quarter off the clock and now the cards have built an 18 point lead on wake forest 28 to 10 scott satterfields team here too the stop at the end of the first half becomes huge with the ability to score in the second half i mean this is a completely different louisville team since that first quarter wind really whipping around here on what is senior day by the way at cardinal stadium as well uh a number of players uh most of them on defense of note here today being honored you do see dez fitzpatrick uh on his final walkout on the stadium theres dorian etheridge whos had a marvelous career here you saw cj avery earlier and larisha pictures all around for this group as well incomplete pass on first down the struggles of sam hartman now three for his last 18 roddy in the ball game yeah its been its been a struggle to find holes in this in this louisville defense i i do want to give a shout out to some of the seniors that didnt walk the west wake forest is going fast so well do it after this heres a throw near side and the deacons with at perry thats his first catch and should be enough for the first down roddy well i i want to talk about and recognize the fact that cole bentley cameron degeorge out for this game not able to participate in this senior day those are two guys that would have walked ian pfeiffer as well would have been a second senior day but but he would have participated as well those guys declared out for the game not able to participate wanted to give them a little shout out because that is certainly something that they deserve in a moment that theyre not going to get because of because of everything thats going on this year yeah trey clark by the way the stop there against the wake run game so second down and eight for hartman and the deacons theres hartman fake the handoff now going to throw and roberson with a great catch cant keep his feet falls down inside the 15 at the 14 against russ yeast and that is some kind of catch by jacquarie roberson just watch this i mean he gets oneonone does a

point louisville lead its been really a tale of quarters two and early three here for the cards malik cunninghams been at the wheel here this afternoon for scott satterfields team and mitchell will work his way toward the 35 roddy i exchanged notes with uh coach claussens daughter courtney whos in school at davidson she and her brother eric are watching the game so we say hello to them i asked about her mom she said well you know tv no moms listening to stan cotton the longtime radio voice of wake forest and i said thats probably a good choice stans a long friend long time friend and uh he and larry sorenson got the call on radio today but we spent special holiday wishes to the clawson family for the sacrifice theyve made as this pandemic is kind of held course through the college football campaign its been a its been a different walk for all of us in many many ways heres mitchell breaking free another long run for jalen mitchell case and debate cant do it again hes tackled inside the 20 around the 18yard line but another another long run for this redshirt freshman its another inside zone play i mean they just wash down the right side and right up the middle goes jalen mitchell hes exploded a couple of times wake forest having to sell out to stop that third and one and louisville which who is so good often increasing teams on the outside has been able to crease this wake forest team on the inside over and over and over its a really nice job by this offensive line they found something that works taking advantage of the right side of that offensive line washing down the defensive line and just running right behind them 16 carries 167 now for mitchell in the ball game heres a throw onto the perimeter catch made by watkins its jordan watkins hes from butler high school in louisville kalyn carson who stopped mitchell a moment ago makes the tackle there another one of those young players in the wake secondary theyre excited about but boy jalen mitchell has kind of announced his presence here today roddy with a little more a little more playing time as a result of the hawkins opt out earlier and the emergence of hassan hall at the running back spot and you know i thought dave claussen said something that was that was incredibly enlightening about scotts hatterfield i mean theyve played each other a number of times and he said look i i think the louisville team has a great scheme i think scott satterfield has a great scheme but its not so rigid that it doesnt take advantage of what his guys do best jalen mitchell is not the same type of outside zone runner that that jvm hawkins was so this team has evolved and changed what theyve done to take advantage of what mitchell does well which is getting his shoulder square running downhill yep and you see coach satterfield with dwayne ledford on the sidelines his offensive coordinator and heres third down and nine now well the way the winds whipping around here cardinal stadium any kick will be an adventure from here on out today and certainly in the current conditions under two to go into third they got it snapped cunningham quick throw dez fitzpatrick trying to get some blocking help and the deacons do a good job kobe davis has had a nice day out of the secondary for wake forest fights in there to make the play around the veteran fitzpatrick young kobe davis has made a couple of tackles not surprised there with the wind and the way things are going that you go with the safe pass and hope that des fitzpatrick can make a play now theyre going to come out and try and extend this lead back to 18 but look at that win look at that look at the way that wind is whipping around thats going to make it really tough a hard right to left win yep see what kind of wedge game james turners got here and the kick is faked and the cards get it inside the 10 to the nine yard line and the play is with the tight end sherman again francis sherman ends up with the football lets watch this play shermans on the right side of the screen just a little shovel pass they open it up get a couple blockers out front its actually a pretty decent play by wake forest defense to be able to contact him early ive not seen a call on whether or not its a first down but louisville kind of think of what we are hey look the kicking game is going to be an adventure our defense has played well lets just go ahead and see if we can pick it up on the fake francis sherman the freshman from bay village ohio just short though yep going to be measured just short the deacons deacons are going to take over at their own 10yard line 2813 a minute and change to go third period cardinal stadium continues scott satterfields team holding to a 15point lead roddy yeah you see the shovel pass and sherman just not able to get quite across the line you see that ball lands just past the 10 yard line not quite enough and the defense is played well enough where you feel comfortable making that decision and the first down give justice ellison now he and beale smith been handling the run game today for the dekes and they will whistle the play after four cards wrapped him up justice ellison came in on the year 15 carries 44 yards the touchdown against campbell hes hes played well though in his first extended look second down give broke away from one and but then gets hauled down by avery pickup of a couple on the play you see its a been a tough ride for sam hartman after the opening 15 minutes now a throw on third down and thats caught the tight end blake whiteheart fourth catch of the year 2813 with roddy jones larisha harris thomas marcy producing mike griffin directing we welcome you back in the fourth quarter underway with wake forest trying to drive it on the ground with justice ellison as we start quarter four here roddy in a ball game that the cards took command of with oh i dont know about six minutes five minutes or so to go in this second period of play and really louisville has not looked back its gonna be coming upon wake here to to build their momentum with these possessions yeah theyre gonna have to string together some some third down conversions or be better on first and second down ellison tackled by clark and third down coming up here for the dekes been a tough quarter two and three for sam hartman five of his last 21 and he will try for the quick snap sneak and a procedure penalty against wake forest here flag on the play it looks like will cost the deacons five full start offense all 11 players were not set prior to the snap five yard penalty third down and but but because because theres no play there was no play there so the helm he should not have to exit the game right i wouldnt think so but well it was a procedure penalty so theres no hes declared a no play i would think and oh and then the helmet post scrimmage looks like he got pulled off and here is uh heres michael curran the redshirt freshman from orlando and now hartman comes back michael kern all ready to wally pip this thing and i think that was the discussion because theres no official play right the helmet coming off does not affect sam hartman being able to participate in the next play right it looked like zach edwards was the guy that got into the stack around hartman and pulled the helmet off theres uh the ruling on the field heres jerry bagley number 10 quarterback there was no play and this helmet came off therefore he does not have to leave for one play so there you go roddy just as you had indicated because there wasnt a play sam hartman gets to stay yep third and five and heres ellison and justice ellison gonna be held up and first guy there was peterson another senior from the atlanta area and tucker georgia fifth year guy and now wake forest on fourth down roddy well its a nobrainer that you go for it here awake uh louisville played that well on the last play you see the press coverage youve got jaquarie roberson and in the slot to the bottom in here roddy what are you looking for out of the timeout on fourth down well i think you go to your best twopoint type play you only need a couple of yards here so you see what the matchup is with jacquari roberson whos in the slot to the top if you dont like that then maybe you come back to the bottom with blake whiteheart something going out towards the sideline theyve got at perry bottom of the screen theres roberson in motion here for hartman fourth down and two wake will throw and its caught this is roberson first down and moore hell cut it to ten and jakoy roberson scores touchdown wake forest on a fourth and short play thats exactly what they went with west they go with their best twopoint conversion play tight play and louisville just loses complete track of jakoi roberson hes able to be wide open on the sideline makes a safety miss and now wake forest is gonna go for two which is the smart move here when youre down by nine so 13 24 to go in the ball game deacons looking for two to cut it to a touchdown again watch roberson slot to the bottom of marin on the back line on some sort of dig louisville brings an extra guy hartman tries to get away throws the ball up in the air and its incomplete hartman was going down in the clutches of yasir abdullah so it will stay a point game looks like theres a penalty west yeah hartmans pointing the other way dekes may get another crack at this holding defense number 33 half the distance to the goal penalty we will replay the try so a holding call on isaiah hayes the quarterback was outside the pocket and got the ball past the line of scrimmage so all right roddy you get another step closer here you still agree with the two obviously to cut it to seven yeah and the reason you go for two here is youre eventually going to need a twopoint conversion so you go for it on the front end so that if you dont get it you can change the way you operate and plan to have to score twice down the line whereas if you go for it on the second one you may not have time to get that other score that you need to get a little conversation im not sure what the review is going to be here right so jerry magellanis talking touchdown for wake forest eight plays 90 yards and 244 and heres the play in question was he down when he threw it as the question but they cleaned the hole right yeah you saw the hold up top so it shouldnt matter whether or not he was down we will replay the try either way hes gonna get another shot yeah yep and beale smith stays in the ball game with hartman to try and draw the dekes now within a touchdown hartman quick throw and caught roberson for the two points so a twopoint play brings wake forest to within a touchdown were early in quarter four not as high scoring as we expected but it is close cards will have the ball after a great play on fourth down Music the twopoint conversion follows and now the deacons who were getting bounced around pretty good quarters two and three and the kick will be handled right around the goal line and not much more than the 20yard line for hassan hall lets go back to the fourth and two touchdown well lets look at jaquari roberson he said the top of the screen in the slot and it looks like russ yeast has him mantoman because its a man across the board when he motions across theres no communication youre going to see isaiah hayes come off the edge no one picks up roberson yeast is in the middle of the field roberson is able to make a miss after being wide open hes able to get in the end zone so a complete lack of communication a complete bust on this louisville defense on a crucial fourth down wake forest is able to take advantage okay roddy now we go back to the point here where louisvilles defense which has played better this year has to hope the offense can maintain some degree of momentum and again were talking about a team thats lost his two top offensive stars not named malik cunningham and javian hawkins to an opt out on november 16th and earlier this week 22 atwells louisville career came to an end so now its on a guy like mitchell whos run for a careerhigh number today had two big long runs among them and cunningham right and its going to be on those those five guys up front austin collins there in the middle josh black caleb chandler adonis boone renato brown those guys are going to have to bring this thing home for louisville second down and eight cunningham to throw from the pocket and incomplete looking for fitzpatrick on senior day dez fitzpatrick set up the first touchdown of the day for hassan hall hes had six for 77 and that was the eighth time hed been targeted today this is a huge third down for louisville obviously and with the wind and the inability to throw the football really consistently well i mean the wind is ripping around so hard its going to make it tough if im louisville im thinking about maybe a quarterback draw something to get malik cunningham in space yep third down and eight cunningham back across the middle catches made and braden smith holds on tackle made by nick anderson well no need to go to it if you can get braden smith one on one with colby with kobe davis and hes able to come in on the dig and make the completion a nice delivery good pickup of the blitz too by this young inexperienced offensive line so brayden smith the sophomore who had seven catches against syracuse earlier this year and we got a whistlestopping play with three minutes gone in the fourth period offense number 88 five yard penalty first half and the penalty will be on roscoe johnson the wide receiver whos come into the ball game again without atwell whose career is over justin marshall josh johnson are down we saw christian fitzpatrick dezs younger brother start the ball game today were going to see roscoe johnson jordan watkins among others trying to fill the gap in the receiving core for gunner brewer who coaches the wide receivers for scott satterfield heres cunningham trying to make something happen on first and fifteen deacons rallied to the football and the uh bergen looked like a guy who was first there its gonna come down to this wake forest defense making a play i mean louisvilles offense really figured it out the inside zone and hitting some place of dez fitzpatrick down the field but this is a perfect situation youve got louisville in second and long opportunity to get to another third and long you got to be able to get off the field to be to get the ball back to your offense after that last score low snap cunningham in the pocket cannot get away that time the dekes get there with jj roberts roddy another young freshman coming through and making the play for coach claussens team miles fox is the guy that spun cunningham around and the big thing watch the blitz come off the edge its actually picked up halfway decently but the ability to rally back and tackle malik cunningham before he really gets going by jj roberts i mean that prevented a huge play there was a ton of room had he been able to get past that initial wave and it creates that third and third and long once again third and thirteen can you get off the field if youre wake forest louisville five of 11 on third down today there were 15 of their last 28 coming into the afternoon cunningham hit as he throws long throw for fitzpatrick and a flag will be thrown kalyn carson with pass interference defense number 29 15yard penalty automatic first down well lets look at the pass interference the shame of this is kaylyn carson didnt need to do it because theres no way anybodys catching this football the balls thrown five yards out of bounds im actually surprised that that wasnt declared uncatchable but malik cunningham under pressure just throws the ball up and is able to get the call but gosh that ball was thrown so far out of bounds that wake forest didnt even need it yep so first and ten for the cards heres cunningham and hell find a seam left side again and quarterback goes 16 for the first down looks like he got hit right on the right wrist roddy by nick anderson hes a little shaken up after that play you can see him in pain well hes grabbing that left hamstring that is not a good sign if youre louisville and his legs are such a big part of what louisville does its such a big part of his game ive played with a hamstring injury before it is it is no fun and it hinders you in multiple multiple ways well see what happens here thats going to go straight ahead and cunninghams really now favoring the left leg you saw mitchell not able to get anything going so lets get another look at the snap before and malik cunningham because we may be getting ready to see puma pass here yeah i dont think theres any question that that youre gonna have to i dont see how malik cunningham can continue hes got no escape ability with that hamstring if its bothering him as much as it looked like it was after that last fake i mean theres going to be no mobility no way to get out of the pocket so youre completely relying on the protection ahead in front of him and his ability to deliver the football on time heres cunningham to throw on second and ten looping down the field fitzpatrick was there with carson incomplete and now third down facing the cards who lead a touchdown here but you sense the momentum might be the guy with guys wearing black helmets roddy as we work our way inside nine minutes watch the tight end coming across the field i mean sherman was wide open francis sherman dragging across the field on that over route was wide open cunningham opted to go deep but i dont know if the wake forest defense is going to be in tune with with whats going on with malik cunningham and the way hes moving but you gotta think youre gonna heat the pocket up here and make malik cunningham make a play with his legs hassan hall is coming the ball game in the backfield cunningham slips it across the middle this is braden smith on third and ten the tackle made by kobe davis but its enough for the first down what an amazing set of circumstances facing louisville here and cunningham guts went out in the pocket here roddy wake decides to drop into his own they dont bring anybody extra braden smith just kind of settles in that zone hes able to make a man miss and pick up the first down you know in that situation that that pass interference calls got to be in the back of lyle hemphills head you know thinking if we go mantoman again and they just throw it up are we gonna get a little too handsy once again so they decide to go with zone it gives malik cunningham a ton of time and hes able to deliver an accurate pass so first and ten cunninghams not running anywhere with this football and the carry to hassan hall as we go inside of eight minutes jacquez williams the tackle you see cunningham now not trying to play his hand for the wake forest defense but clearly evident that hes nowhere near 100 percent and the cards are letting the play clock wind down here too roddy they know good and well whats at stake now with the touchdown advantage and halfway through quarter four youre trying to shorten the game youre in field goal range at least in normal times youre in field goal range maybe with the wind it would be tough on a day like that but try and shorten the game theyre going to flip it on the reverse coming here to the near side and down the sideline and a touchdown for jordan watkins true freshman had four catches against syracuse and now has a touchdown how crazy is this play its just a little reverse you fake the zone inside you get a nice block out front look at marshawn ford leading out front nice block on the perimeter watkins into the end zone and this wake forest defense had its opportunities you had louisville in the third and long two times one time theyre able to convert on the pass play the other time well a uh a reverse of sorts if you will roddy jordan watkins on the ground the wide receiver goes uh 23 yards louisville pushes the advantage back to two scores 3521 the win playing a tremendous factor here today and a short kick deacons got to get on this its loose and i think the cards have come up with it just outside the 20yard line and they have marvin dallas on the kick cover unit wow i you absolutely are right youve got to be aggressive here and field this in the air because this is what can happen you know if youre one of those up backs the closest one you have to go and field this its why you do those those those pop kick practices before practice every single day you cant let the ball hit the ground in that area because you never know how its going to balance but good for louisville hustling down field and if theyre able to get points here especially a touchdown got to feel like theyre going to put the game away at the wake forest 21yard line heres cunningham quick throw the perimeter and smith got taken out of the air on the throw by jasir taylor second down coming up this wake forest team has been so good in the turnover margin all year and really not making those kind of mistakes or the interception that we saw earlier in the game and here today maybe its the layoff maybe its the the adversity over the last 24 hours just have not been as sharp second down and 10 and we got movement i believe on the cards here offense number 44 five yard penalty second down well we told you that coming into the ball game the turnover disparity with these two teams was just so staggering louisville technically now is plus two with the fumble recovered on the kick you get the dekes whove not lost it all year lou has not won it roddy louisville has seven games with three or more turnovers theyre minus six in their last four theyve had three straight games or four straight games of three turnovers and so far scott satterfields teams been able to hang onto the rock and its giving them a chance to win the game here and thats with a a center whos the fourth string center playing austin collins in the game uh the joshua black at right guard a guy who scotts out of field told us look these guys probably arent ready to play but theyre going to have to grow up quick because thats who we have to have out there absolutely incredible that not only have they been able to not turn the ball over but theyve been successful running the football against this louisville defense so third down in 13 see the ball at the 25 the deacons can ill afford any points here and they shut the door on hassan hall chase jones the linebacker who had two dozen stops a year ago but because of the emergence of jacquez williams and some others has only had about a half dozen tackles this year coming into the ball game well lets see if turner does kick it this time 40yard try hes perfect under 50 this year west but the win could be a factor yep you see the clock you see the line 14point game and under six to go hes 1214 on the year that one is good new score at cardinal stadium the ville in front by 17 back after this support your favorite college at fanaticscom the worlds largest collection of officially licensed fan gear shop the most experienced and more the championship hub launches monday as an and is accessible from the acc mobile app or online roddy acc now thats monday it launches theres another kickoff mishandled briefly but beale smith picks it up and christian going to try to get to the far side here and see how far he can go before angling out of bounds shy of the 25 and a pair of markers down near the 20yard line here during the return thats christian smith number two receiving team 10yard time gather and while they stepped this off against wake forest uh what say you number 20 about next saturday afternoon 4 oclock in uptown charlotte well its never too early to start talking about it so so first for clemson theyre going to have to get trevor lawrence involved in the run game i think hes going to be fantastic in the past game as always but his his presence in the zone read game is going to be huge the big question is how healthy are they on defense we saw james skalsky exit the game against virginia tech landon xanders we havent seen in a while thats going to be the big question for notre dame you got to make the others beat you again someone not named etn or lawrence has to beat you and the other thing you got to bring the magic book not just any book the magic one weve seen recently off the wake 13 yard line so youre talking about the ian book that you know played in chapel hill the in book that played the first time against clemson that that ian book right yeah and theres no reason to think that we wont see him but if if the magic book doesnt show up then i think its going to be a tough day i think its going to be a tough day for notre dame the the the others thing though like youre going to have to have cornell powell or an amari rogers be the guy to make the backbreaking play you cant let lawrence or etienne do it i know clark lee obviously is going to have the game plan for that 10 yard throw to roberson and boy a tough afternoon has materialized we got an injured card on the play and so while theyre out to check on the injured louisville defender third down and one coming up its rush east who by the way is uh been shaken up on the play clemson notre dame of course went to a double overtime contest in the first meeting and they meet again next saturday afternoon in charlotte to determine the acc and i thought it was pointed out that when you talk about the two cubes here roddy youre talking about two of my goodness i mean i i dont want to put a a number on the list but easily two of the top ten right now in college football yeah two two of the absolute best and two guys that should be getting conversation for the heisman trophy thats supposed to go to the most outstanding player in the country now their stats dont stack up to guys like kyle trask or mac jones but these two guys are two of the best quarterbacks in the entire country trevor lawrence obviously had the absence due to a positive covig test but in his return hes looked really good and ian book has just been so much fun to watch over the last half of the football season tell you whats helped ian book is uh not only the emergence of michael mayer tight end but javon mckinley has been sensational in the vertical game for the irish yeah theyve been theyve been good in the run game with kyron williams avery davis has made some plays for him yep its just been a really nice coaching job by brian kelly of making a good team at the beginning of the season with a ton of questions a great team by the end with just about every question under five to go now on a 17 point lead for louisville christian beale smith picked up the first down but sam hartman and wake forest got to get it going throw games been tough to come by and that one intended for morin is broken up by marlin character the senior from grady high school in atlanta playing in his 34th game today as a member of the cards and roddy interesting to talk with coaches the last couple of weeks about seniors and the waiver that was extended for this year of athletic eligibility by the ncaa before the year started and theyre going to be some decisions made here in the next couple weeks that are fascinating as it relates to guys who may try and come back and play that bonus year if you will theres another throw by hartman and that got carried well out of bounds to make it third and ten and i think theyre theyre personnel decisions to be made by not only the student athlete but also by the coaches too well student athlete coaches and administrators some administrators are going to have to have conversations with coaches heres how many other scholarships we can afford we didnt have budgeted years ago for 95 or 100 scholarship players in a season and thats on the backs of one of the toughest financial seasons that any administration has had so its going to be really interesting to see how many schools take advantage and how many players third down and ten well played by louisville on a ball for keyshawn williams the cards just built the wall right away and lovie jenkins really led the charge here he fights through the block theres nowhere to go and it knocks the freshman keyshawn williams back and this is if theres any hope for wake forest this is it yep down 17 with four minutes to go in the game the hope is slim but youre gonna have to convert here if youre gonna have it at all fourth down and ten hartman cuts it loose and dropped roberson was there you saw jenkins in coverage as well but the deacons give it away on downs here with under four to flight yeah this has kind of been the story its been so tough for for wake forest in these third and fourths and long when louisville has dropped eight they have not been able to consistently find the space underneath you really have to tip your cap today west to this louisville defense i mean they have kind of been overlooked because of the record but the improvement that they have had this season is one of the biggest improvements of any unit in the conference this year you look at the yards per play you look at the number of big plays given up and brian brown has done a fantastic job with this defense and i think you saw exactly how complementary they have played here today keeping the offense in the game until they figured it out under four to go jalen mitchell in the ball game hell take the toss from cunningham trying to get to the edge and a tackle out of midair by luke masterson will make it second down and the cards with this 17 point lead dont forget roddy tonight late after the commonwealth cup the huddle after dark right no tie required jordan cornett coach rick dj manuel eric mclean the full day in the acc all the games including highlights from south florida tallahassee blacksburg and obviously our ball game here today in louisville along with analysis commentary and much much more the huddle after dark scheduled for 11 eastern always better when its closer to midnight here on acc network and streaming live on the espn app second down and seven itll be third down coming up as we go inside of three minutes to play roddy a win today would obviously for louisville give him four on the year three in the league but for scott satterfield its it might be a pretty important win given the kind of turbulence hes had to battle the last week yeah if youd have lost this game i i think you know the the negative feelings of losing are combined with sort of the negative feelings amongst the fan base that have happened over the last couple of weeks with the conversation with south carolina and just the entire way that thing was handled but a win starts the healing process i feel like you know whether or not louisville season is over after this one everybody obviously is eligible so they could get a bowl invite and a catch and a touchdown for barshawn ford usually a red zone target rowdy how about 83 coming up big if theres a guy that youre that youre not gonna you know turn completely loose id put marshon ford up there for for wake forest kind of selling out trying to get the ball back and louisvilles obviously feeling really good about where they are in this game right now and scott satterfield certainly is going to be happy with the effort of his team with the the number of guys that they are missing today in this offensive performance Music so with 217 to go the cards have thrown two touchdowns on the board the last five minutes and this one marshawn fords sixth touchdown catch of the year hes in the backfield just runs a wheel route they do it a couple times a game nobody takes them for wake forest an easy pitching catch to get in the end zone and malik cunningham looks to be okay after that uh little hamstring scare earlier but has not run hes been able to deliver the football though well and scott satterfield has now seen his team score on seven of their last eight possessions and total up 439 yards of offense along the way in those eight possessions roddy how about this team i mean just battling over and over and over in this game they were able to do it in multiple facets the latest one being the recovery on the kickoff team just hustling down hoping for good things to happen it does puts the game away and then this offense continues to roll and to be honest with the us like this is what this team could have been all season without the turnovers the turnovers have been the biggest thing because coming into this game when you looked at the turnover margin this team was really struggled in it obviously one and six when losing the turnover margin heres the kick and the return keyshawn williams quick return and larisha downstairs next to the uh gotta believes the jubilant louisville bench here this afternoon it definitely is i think the emotions are now starting to flow especially from the seniors i know when i talked to dorian ether she told me you know its game time i cant think about the emotions but now that we are towards the end here a lot of the seniors are are actually starting to express that emotion and i saw jared goldwyer come in for a long embrace with fellow defensive linemans and dorian etheridge he also played a part in that too long embraces with others on the defense as well so we can see all of that emotion starting to finally flow as i think its settling in for these guys that this is or could possibly be their last game on this cardinal field yeah no question and uh you know its uh with a couple minutes to go here you see the run and this is the young freshman of monty marshall getting the carry third of the year for uh and also michael kern by the way has come back in at quarterback we saw him briefly but it looked like hartman would have to take a snap off due to a helmet coming off but heres michael kern appearing in his fifth career game as a demon deacon from lake nona high school down in the orlando area under two minutes to go and marshall who this weekend next week behind ellison and beale smith might get some more reps to polish off his freshman year roddy go back to satterfield though this with all the things there was a letter released to season ticket holders yesterday it became public it was a a pretty good letter in fact you know we we talked to several folks in this community about the value of it because scott satterfield did enough here in year one as you mentioned at the top to kind of make people forget that tumultuous into bobby petrino the you know the the john l smith walk off the charlie strong situation to texas all the things that have kind of inhibited louisville fans from fully embracing football scott satterfield cured a lot of that but then those wounds were kind of opened back up last week with the reports of his visit with the folks at south carolina penalty and so you had to have a little bit of therapy this week for louisville fans but also i think coach satterfield had to realize too the value of that embrace from this cardinal fan base that had taken place over the last year and even this year when youre not as you said earlier maybe winning as many games as youd like to yeah i i think i think thats very true um and to be completely honest you know im not sure scott satterfield didnt realize pretty quickly the mistake that he made by even having the conversation uh but look the healing process is going to be a long one and its only going to to come with time wins and also just being dedicated to this program but hes obviously got the support of his players they played very hard for him here today and and its great to see these seniors go off on their home field with a win because you one of the questions that youre always asked about your football career is well how was your senior day and to have that memory for these guys is one that theyll cherish for the rest of their lives especially uh in a scenario like this and wake forest will have to snap it one more time but the cards are going to pick up win number four waco have a game to go next saturday scheduled at truest field against florida state the dekes who had won four of their last five coming to louisville led early but a second quarter explosion by malik cunningham and some a turnover our turnaround in the turnover game roddy really proved to be a difference here today 10 louisville points on the twoway forest errors i think though the defense is the story obviously the turnover was big but the defense holding in early in that game until the louisville offense figured it out with that young offensive line the success in the run game its just a really nice performance for louisville well two guys that defend many times before and will continue to do so in the years to come with a nice greeting there midfield a winning saturday for louisville 4521
