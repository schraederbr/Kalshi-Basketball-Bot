today four newcomers in the starting lineup where the Panthers who are in the home whites in their season opener in the fifth year for Jeff cable game away from the NCAA tournament and no nerves in the opening game at Cameron Indoor Osio sifo drills it to open the scoring this is a veteran group taking on an inexperienced yet talented Duke team tonight and when we spoke with John Shire at shoot around he was concerned about it hello college basketball is back Mark Mitchell how about that start for the freshman and we saw that exact same play in shoot around this afternoon they worked on that play and the pass was on point beautiful start for Duke offensively take a look at the Jacksonville starting five you were just talking about how John Shire was concerned about their experience how theyve got the age experience advantage of this one wide open three Jordan Davis Off the Mark Applause this is Kyle filipowski Tangled Up and commits the foul take another look cant think of a better start to the college basketball season than this one well watch the screen this is key right here beautiful screen by Ryan and in the pass is on point young players take note Ryan the veteran setting a beautiful back screen well executed play and again thats something they worked on multiple times this afternoon and shoot around tough take hangs in the air and gets it up and in Jacksonville has come in and they are not shy thats Dylan ohern the transfer from NJIT beautiful offensive look for Duke to try to establish Ryan young early filipowski a three too much on it one of three freshmen starting in a very highly touted Freshman Class youre still gonna have to wait to see the top two recruits though Derek Lively and Tariq Whitehead both ruled out tonight they start the season on the injured list but John Shire told us he hopes theyll be back sooner rather than later Applause deep three rattles in and out no good offensive rebound Falls to Jordan Davis the floater no good another offensive rebound for Jacksonville wide open three Davis missed fires and finally Duke can end The Possession Applause Mitchell on the move tonight at The Rim gathers count it plus the foul Mark Mitchell has all four points to start the John Shire era tonight Purdue just a great individual effort right here gets it blocked sticks with the play and then great body control and they are so high on this young man long arms and when I spoke to the assistant coach carriwell he said he reminded him a little bit of Stacy Ogden going back now babe yes UNLV days he said hes a wiry guy just understands how to play and they love his motor so we mentioned Lively and Whitehead are out as duke goes full court press for the first time tonight but still a really talented freshman class without those guys when they add them back in thats why people think Duke will be a top team in the country and this Jacksonville game though closes some problems without those two guys John Shire and staff are concerned about the size advantage that Jacksonville has right on cue they go inside in Omar Payne hammers it home transfer from Illinois went to montverde Academy same high school as Tariq Whitehead one of the top performing theater programs in the college game in the country so you know hes got talent inside roach acrobatican gets it to go uh he is just continue to improve thats a big time play there under control getting his team back on top on one of the better guards not just into ACC but in college basketball Jeremy Roach Nolan Jacksonville goes inside again this time Mike Marsh bodied up by Ryan Young Who forces the turnover transition three Roach and Jay thats all set up a beautiful play by Mitchell in transition Applause fouled on the three so Jacksonville will get three at the Line with Kevin Nolan when we come back but the fireworks have already started here in Durham didnt take much Meet The Freshman Mark Mitchell of the Jeremy Rose are so good Dukes got an early lead 106 Blue Devils four of six from the floor all 10 points scored by just two guys Jeremy roach in the talented freshman Mark Mitchell Applause thank you Jay on the other side when we spoke to Jacksonville coach Jordan Mincey he said two key areas for them they cannot turn the ball over no live ball turnovers to get Duke out in transition for easy buckets and then he said we must control the pace and try to work the ball into the paint get high percentage shots five seconds to shoot Marsh trying to back down double team comes in swatted Away by Mark Mitchell roach another three Jeremy roaches red hot to start this season oh he is just picking up right where he left off we talked about the tournament run that he had arguably one of the better guards in all of college basketball last year during the NCAA tournament and he is shooting the ball lights out that time pull up three Duke on an eightnothing run Applause oh Hearne exactly what Jacksonville needed hard to the hole and that stops a eightnothing run for Duke Blue Devils have made their last four shots yeah I know her made that look easy tough adjustment in the ear able to concentrate Kiss It Off The Glass Mitchell through traffic kept alive great ball fake Mitchell right to Iraq lays it up and in for two so easy to see why they are so high and excited about this young man excellent decision that time not settling for a jumper Jeremy roach and Mark Mitchell still have combined for all of Dukes points tonight Applause Jacksonvilles done a nice job getting to the rim found success that time Mike March and they continue to use their size of something that Duke and the staff were concerned about in Jacksonville again rightfully so now trying not to settle for jumpers get the ball into the paint or try to crash the offensive glass offensive rebound good opportunity Mitchell couldnt put it home can you believe were saying that about an asun team about against an ACC team and Duke that Jacksonville is actually the one with the quoteunquote size and experience tonight yeah and obviously with darik Whitehead and a lively out thats probably uh the big reason why they have that size Advantage missing those two big bodies uh for Duke but make no mistake about it theyre a very good defensive team and then theyre very good on the glass has got a terrific head coach as well officials blow plate the play dead hit the shot clock there Applause Paul Mitzi trying to get an explanation Jordan Mitzi we just showed in his first season goes 2110 most wins the Jacksonville has had in program history since 1986 how do you even follow that up buy stock now right now of Jordan minty even the contract extension through 2031 yeah he is really good one of the bright young minds and he has done an outstanding job as you said year one getting this thing going in the right direction a heat check for Jeremy Roach that misfires roach leads the way with eight points thats what you expected Hawk I mean hes the lone returning starter from that final four team a year ago surrounded by a lot of transfers and freshmen so no surprise theyre going to number three early and often yeah and John Shire said look he needs to impact the game not just with his scoring being a playmaker but I think the key thing in this game against a very good guard and Kevin Nolan on the defensive end set to tone defensively for this unit great passing wide open three Blake makes Jacksonville pay Jalen Blakes the sophomore thats probably the best offensive possession in this early season four Duke ball movement going left to right and then sharing the ball cant ask for a better look and once you get the crazies going theyll make you pay as well all set up again by Mitchell I really like how he drives and hes not always looking to score extra pass you cannot ask for a better offensive possession if youre John Shire now Jacksonville in a Zone Duke shooting right over it its that one with grandison comes in from Illinois after starting the last two seasons for them in the Big Ten Applause cavion Nolan fires up a three nothing but the bottom of the net and look out if kevion Nolan heats up that could be problems tonight John Shire had high praise for Nolan but said he is a guy that could be a high major guy uh he is really impressed with his game and he said look Jeremy roach is going to spend most of the time on him right now Blakes is on him but thats going to be a key matchup for Duke as this game progresses and Nolan had options to play professionally overseas could have went into the portal and probably end up at a power five program but decided to come back to Jacksonville to finish what he started get back to that asun championship game called for a travel here its a new season a new head coach for Duke but the same Cameron crazies Blue Devils up seven starts off beautiful pinpoint passing showing off the Hops right here effort play this is what they love about this young man his energy hes so versatile and speaking with the coaching staff they think he can be an elite Defender but Im liking this right here his decision making I think they can run their offense through him he can rebound and lead the break and hes made some nice passes that have led to some open opportunities for his teammates certainly can score two he led the McDonalds AllAmerican Game with 19 points its funny we were talking to John Shire before the game about Mark Mitchell he said when he was recruiting him out of high school he was a little concerned that his nickname is easy hes like I hope that doesnt mean youre easy to beat off the dribble as Blake drills another three Jalen flakes gives Duke their largest lead of the night at 10 and John Shire went out of his way to talk about Jalen Blake he said listen he is going to be a key person for us in particular on the defensive end but if hes able to knock down shots like that off of excellent ball movement were seeing early thats just a bonus doing it with defense as well Blakes did well to get a hand in there didnt see a ton of action a year ago but was a part of that team that went to the Final Four and you could see that hes trying to take that leap from freshman to sophomore year to Duke uniform and the message to him was defend dont turn the ball over and knock down shots early on in this game he is going by that formula hole center in out for dilido Hearn hes the Sharpshooter for Jacksonville Applause foreign cant show it off there but at seven foot hes a dangerous player on both sides of the ball number two Center in the 2022 class hes only behind his teammate Derek Lively Jacksonville struggling from Beyond the arch is one of six and theyre at a scoring drought of two and a half minutes now roach draws the contact and it charges the call Wednesday well have the mens soccer championship semifinals for you in the ACC tournament third seed in Virginia take it on second seed at Syracuse at five eastern and then eighth seeded Clemson who upset undefeated Duke in the quarters take it on Wake Forest both matches right here on acc Network and the ESPN app and the winner of those games Playford ACC title Sunday at noon Eastern on ESPNU as a college sports fan theres no better time than when the fall Sports and basketball season in the winter sports start to overlap here in November and December constant action well you had me at college basketball is starting to me right now youre absolutely right best time in sports and Jay this place really you know weve talked about it I mean one of the most difficult places to play in so loud and he played here your freshman year it was my second college game in to this day Im still trying to find a place that was louder than in here and certainly got ugly with the likes of Grant Hill and Kristen leightner in the second half were starting for a freshman but I can tell you right now nothing has changed on that end the Cameron crazies are still out here making a lot of noise no Coach K on the sidelines but this is still the same Duke basketball the Traditions the Brotherhood all things that John Shire wants to keep as he starts his tenure Jacksonvilles had success going inside tonight they get a and one opportunity coming up and beautiful high low action right here and Marsh does a nice job sealing the big right there and then finish with the left hand you know Jacksonville early on and thats something that coach Mincey talked about they have to withstand these runs by Duke early hes like look we know theyre going to go on runs we have to control the pace and continue to do that right there get the ball in the paint either off the bounce or try to get your big some touches havent seen too much from Tyrese Proctor tonight he takes the ball up here Prospect then reclassified from 2023 to 2022 comes over from Australia number five in white they have high hopes for him here he is with the ball gets it inside excellent passing Ryan young an easy finish inside and philipowski that is a beautiful find great patience I love to change up a zone that time by Jacksonville thats just better offense by Duke get it to the high post and then your bigs make nice passes right to the rack no answer Blakes calling for it and gets it hes two for two from three that one off the mark phillipowski lost the handle straight into the hands of Jordan Davis Who cashes in underneath Bill hanging around in this one only down seven and I like the change up that really has changed the pace of this game going to that 23 matchup Zone foul called against Mike Marsh college basketball is back John Shire and Duke up seven see network as we get the college basketball season started obviously you know were on acc Network weve spoken a lot about Duke and John Shire tonight but lets give Jacksonville some love a team that went to the asun championship a year ago totally overachieved in year one of Jordan mincy being the head coach theyre picked number two preseason this is a team that you could absolutely see in the NCAA tournament come March absolutely and look no further than what the Duke coaching staff said about they said look this is uh by no means a cakewalk first game they have veteran players of their led by a guy and Kevin Nolan that is arguably one of the better guards not just in the asun but in college basketball so this is no freebie for Duke to start off the season Jacob grandison called for a travel early impressions of these freshmen for John Shire a really highly touted class and theyre still missing the top two players in that class Derek Lively and Tariq Whitehead who are both out still with nagging injuries but Mark Mitchell the energy hes brought to the floor both sides of the ball is really impressed me Jacksonville cuts it to five and Mike Marsh continues to impress that time showing off some touch from the foul line hes posted and that time they continue to back off takes a nice little floater that time from the foul line Mitchell driving the Baseline trying to muscle it up and in foul on the floor called against Jacksonville Music well I think Jay youre seeing though them missing of the big bodies uh Whitehead and Lively those two guys bring that Rim protection right with those two out they really dont have a rim protector in the lineup and thats hurting them obviously it gets the team like Jacksonville that wants to get the ball into the paint Applause foreign Applause Jacksonville with a head of steam coast to coast and drawing the foul Jordan Davis unafraid the change of Defense uh theyve changed it up theyve gone man theyve gone back to that matchup zone and then theyve been opportunistic in transition they want to play at a slower Pace but that time off the turnover uh heads up play get out before that Duke defense can get set Saturday morning get your college football Saturday start at 11 AM eastern time the ACC huddle crew will be in Syracuse to get you set everything you need to know in the ACC and then Prime Time matchup between Florida State and Syracuse 8 oclock all right here on acc Network just like that Jacksonville on a sixnothing run theyve cut it to 31 possession game with less than 6 30 left in this first half Applause foreign Applause left alone too much on it and the rebound ripped away by Mike Marsh this Jacksonville team really impressive they went down by 10 and they are battling back unafraid to open the season at Cameron Indoor and I like the pace that theyre playing at theyre running when they have opportunities but otherwise theyre keeping this pace slow deep three contested Kevin Nolan Applause foreign Applause captain Music on this Duke team they need his leadership and he sense and his team needed a bucket he continues to impress with his play on the offensive side Applause Jacksonville trying to answer and they do Mike Marsh feasting underneath he leads the dolphins with nine looking like a tight end that time like rock I mean that is a great catch and finish the big fella showing off the hands Mark Mitchell the immediate answer Applause Davis the runner goes begging Applause foreign Mitchell for three air ball Grandersons there to lay it up and in call it a pass from The Freshman Mitchell time now Jacksonville Applause the Dolphins had cut it to three but Duke immediately Rec Marsh leading the way hes been impressive on the offensive glass hes been a monster hes done a nice job establishing position hes got a great set of hands and then the passing of this has been excellent for them find a soft spot and then they found him and you cant ask for a better catch and finish from your big right there I think whats hurting Duke right now is their ball screen coverage Marshall setting screens hes diving hard the rotations are late and Jacksonvilles doing a nice job finding him how about this for Jacksonville theyre shooting 45 from the floor if you take away the threepoint attempts where theyre one of seven theyre shooting nine of 15 if they can keep getting it inside thats the soft spot for Duke defensively right now yeah and I think right now watch ball screen coverage uh for Duke but Bigs got to do a better job hedging on these screens and then the rotations have to be quicker OHearn pull up pop left it short Jeremy roach leads the way with 11 some Bill back in mantoman works out for him to get the steal now can they convert on the other end Applause Omar Payne Jacksonvilles getting good looks trying to shrink this deficit cant get it to go Applause Applause Applause foreign Applause pulls the trigger from three Jacksonvilles missed their last five Mitchell right to the right and hammers it home mark Mitchell putting on a show in his Duke debut love his energy and activity that time showing off the handle and body control and then the Strong finish for the freshman he has nine hes doing it on both ends of the floor Applause great feed inside the Finish from Mike Marsh again hes five of six from the floor leads Jacksonville with 11 and credit Jacksonville again the patience and they are picking apart uh this Duke defense on the screen and rolls rotations continue to be an issue for Duke Mitchell calling for it Applause roach on the drive absorbs the contact it rolls in the lone returning starter from last years final four team picking up where he left off and its just an understanding John Shire and his staff they said look he is just so sure of himself this year obviously the end to the season last year was playing some really good ball his last 10 to 12 games but this year he is the leader and hes a guy that just has a great feel for the game Applause thank you Applause Applause Kevin Nolan weaving his way in tonight at The Rim Omar caressi couldnt squeeze through filipowski a trailing three its good Kyle filipowski showing off the range all set up by Jeremy Rhodes thats what your leader does make the game easier for The Other Guys beautiful setup and transition that time by Jeremy Roach and philipowski rips down the rebound on the other end the fivestar freshman showing off Applause foreign Proctor for three philipowski offensive rebound and now Duke can hold for the last shot roach decides not to though there is another one shot 32 percent man hes on fire what an end to this first half for John Shire and his Duke debut as head coach largest lead of the night 4226 they finished the first half on a 122 run Jeremy roach leading the way hes got 16 Duke up big at halftime you do return one starter from last years final four team thats Jeremy roach with him on the floor look at that plus 21 with him on the bench minus five so it all starts with number three Jeremy Rose I think its simple they need him on the floor and uh we said it right at the top his leadership was going to be key for this Duke team transfers and some young talented players freshmen coming in his leadership really I think is going to be the key for this Duke season tried to go high low into Ryan Young it was there just pass was not on point missed opportunity have your post player two feet into paint you got to make that pass and Kyle filipowski the scouting report on the fivestar freshman is he is an extremely talented passer at seven foot its his birthday today turns just 19 years old and that number 30 for the Blue Devils stub with osai osifo right now trying to body him up got a piece of it great defense from the birthday boy philipowski and now trying to make it happen on the other end rejected at The Rim foreign Applause Nolan only three points in that first half for Jacksonvilles leading scorer from a year ago five seconds to shoot osifo about that nice job osai osifo ran the Baseline got the feed slammed it home and thats more what Jacksonville wants be patient offensively make this Duke team defend dont shoot early in the shot clock and then use your size that time excellent ball movement Applause foreign Applause the corner cant connect Jacksonville looking for a spark trying to do too much there Applause well this is a great start of the second half trying to get back in this game Jacksonville great individual effort that time defensively and then right here pick and roll that continues to be an issue for Duke ball screen coverage on the back end the rotations continue to be a little late that time Jacksonville able to get a dunk Applause thank you Proctor everything but the finish for the Australian still looking for his first Collegiate points Applause offensive foul Applause and thats three against osayo sifo its been great when hes been on the court but foul trouble going against these Duke pigs and back to the first half that Duke had the 12 assists and only five turnovers against a very good Jacksonville defense mainly because this guy right here has had the ball in his hand Jeremy Roach Music fouled on the drive thank you and if the inbounds move led to an open three that roach cant cash in on Dukes yet to score in the second half from Jacksonville take advantage Applause stolen away four on two for Duke Proctor a transition three Off the Mark young what a job to keep that in play Proctor two really good looks that he couldnt connect on either one of them but Ryan young how about that enthusiasm from the transfer from Northwestern man Jeremy roaster almost got hurt right there on the floor excellent opportunity right there again Duke getting a wide open look off a excellent dribble drive and kick and thats just all a work by Ryan Young on the offensive glass it played for Chris Collins obviously former Duke assistant is on staff with John Shire for take it over at Northwestern so very familiar with how things are run said same drills being conducted in Northwestern that there are at Duke and hes come in and provided a big spark for this Blue Devils team and Shire had a little laugh with us and I said ah you sure I can share this on her so yeah he had four years of bad coaching at Northwestern but all jokes aside so much respect for Chris Collins and he said look I called them we had a conversation I wanted to make sure we knew he was leaving and hes been the perfect fit for us and I think the big area where hes going to help with the younger guys The Bigs like Lively is his preparation and his footwork they cant say enough about just how he goes about kind of an old school type player great footwork very good passer High basketball IQ and he thinks he is going to continue not only to be an asset for them on the court but also tutoring some of these younger players that are very talented for Duke officials are over at the monitor right now taking a look at if theres anything flagrant against Ryan young here see that push I mean anytime Marsh yeah anytime you make contact now I think theyre probably just going to make a comment on the foul yeah and I like that its kind of like all right get off me it wasnt really like a throwing of a punch just say get off me game getting a little bit physical if there was anything to the head high Hands To The Head then you could start talking flagrant but that was clearly beneath the neck love seeing the passion and the energy from Ryan young though theyre going to need that from a veteran transfer like Ryan young a really inexperienced team anchored by this highly touted freshman class well you mix in a transfer like Ryan young and Jacob grandison to provide that experience and you know the skys the limit for this Duke team yeah and its going to make for some competitive practices because guys are going to be fighting for minutes when they get back whole and get everybody healthy on this roster still waiting on lively and Whitehead look at that roster by class almost all freshmen but you mix in those four grand transfers Ryan Youngs one of them Cashes in on a possession that he kept alive yeah and thats a great pass though by grandison that time off the spin move and two veteran guys that theyre going to count on uh to play some big minutes for Duke and provide just that right there laughs Jacksonville on a scoring drought of three minutes now danger zone for the Dolphins as Dukes begins to separate themselves in the home opener here Applause wide open underneath Ryan young back to back baskets one of the things I noticed and shoot around early with Jeremy roach he is just one of the better passers in college I mean he is just a floor General that is a beautiful dime right there for a wide open layup for Ryan Young quick hands from Mark Mitchell swats that away the Blue Devils dialed in on both ends of the floor Ryan young chipping in the transfer from Northwestern hes got Duke up by 18 Malcolm Huckabee Jay alter with you John Shire and his Duke debut as head coach up on Jacksonville by 18 and you call the danger zone right now for Jacksonville they are in desperate need of a bucket pull up pop they need it dont get it from their leading scorer from a year ago Kevin Nolan Applause inside philipowski the big man really stepping up in this second half and Duke is up 20 a great recognition that time by Ryan young high low action realizing philipowski has the advantage soft touch excellent passing but again back to his basketball IQ thats what he brings to the table Ryan young the transfer from Northwestern Jacksonville scoreless in the last four minutes and 20 seconds Applause meanwhile Duke has made their last three attempts Applause Ryan Young Dukes getting everything they want in the paint right now I mean listen me and John Ty we were laughing about it hes got one of those old school games just one of those guys hes not the most athletic but just knows how to play and right now Duke is Duke debut its been for the transfer from Northwestern Ryan young hes perfect from the floor 86 rebounds and hes having a monster second half first thing John Shire said to me when I asked what does he bring to the table he said this right here footwork and then just experience hes just a guy that understands how to play the game of basketball what he lacks in athleticism he makes up for it with great footwork Elite footwork and High basketball IQ he is not beating anybody in a foot race but I tell you right now hes got some of the best footwork for a big in college he said hes got a little bit of that YMCA lunch break game to him which is a compliment one of those guys theyre like man howd this guy just give me 10 straight buckets and he cant even touch the net Applause and a team thats dominated by freshmen John Shire went out and got four grad transfers Youngs one of them to bring that experience that leadership whats funny is coach Ks 42 years of Duke he only brought in three grad transfers in four decades and John Shire goes and brings in four in his first year thats how the game is changing college basketball in the year 2022 get old and get experience quick and obviously the transfer portal has done that and Johnson recognizing he needed to take advantage of that with this talented uh mix of young players he has I like the mix that he has look Ryan young in them they know who they are as players and I think thats important when you bring in guys in the mix John Cyrus said look hes going to be an asset in practice for some of these young talented Biggs Blue Devils team that has certainly looked impressive in this first game of the season still missing their top two freshman Derek Lively and Tariq Whitehead Jacksonville really struggling in this second half a scoring drought of five minutes and 30 seconds credit Dukes defense and theyve done a nice job cleaning up the defensive blast theyve limited any second chance opportunities in the second half for Jacksonville Dolphins just one of seven from the floor three turnovers in this half Applause those are the two highly touted freshmen according to ESPN 100 these are the top two players in the Freshman Class Lively seven foot one Center and Tariq Whitehead who can really play all over the floor as another fivestar freshman drains the three Lively the number one Center in this freshman class while filipowskis the number two Center and theyre going to be teammates playing on the same court in a couple of weeks with Lively gets back to action and I think thats an asset that filipowski brings ability to stretch the defense thats a seven footer knocking down threes on that previous possession for Duke will it be difficult to get those guys on the court at the same time no I think they can because again if you have mobile bigs philipowski I think is going to get better defensively and his ball screen coverage but you certainly can play those two together if you missed it earlier John Shire said youll see those guys sooner rather than later just not a hundred percent werent ready for the opener but Duke not missing him theyre up by 23 Midway through the second half now for the first time in 43 Seasons a Duke campaign starts without Mike shazewski on the sidelines its John Shire he knew he was getting the job for 17 months announced June 2021 he told us its kind of surreal that the day is finally arrived that you know he takes that seat on the bench as the head coach its been on that sideline for nine Seasons as an assistant hes got to be happy without his teams performing in game one of his tenure and you know obviously all eyes on him as weve been talking about and I asked him I said look you know whats your conversations like with Coach K and he said look we still talk Xs and Os why wouldnt you uh and I absolutely agree why wouldnt you go and seek advice from one of the best to ever do it and you know certainly hes going to put his own stamp on this program uh but he said look theres not going to be these wholesale changes with this program were going to take a look at John Shire in action during the play here its funny Im sure youve gotten some texts Ive gotten some text people want to know where is Coach K hes not in the arena not in Cameron Indoor coach Shire thought he might be watching in his office or at home Applause dude called for the offensive foul there Josh Shire not happy about it its been very animated though throughout the night well we called two of his games on Ender invasive this one right here is uh this ones starting to count towards that that record that he wants to build upon and you know make no mistake about it this guy was a competitor he scored over 2 000 points in his Duke career you talked about it national champion so not surprised to see him animated and he is not going to be happy until theres zeros on the clock and his team has won now you mentioned he stepped up as head coach on an interim basis twice Duke won both games Music love getting a look at him over on that Duke sideline for the first time Applause but its his team and his team alone Applause funny enough we called both of those games that he stepped up as the interim so when he came over and chewed around hes like are you the only two guys that do this but just as luck would have it Applause well Jacksonville still continuing to fight trying to claw back into this game theyre gonna have to put together some stops defensively they got one there Applause good time to remind you Wednesday mens soccer ACC Championship semifinals third seed in Virginia taking on twoseeded Syracuse Ian McIntyre in the orange trying to win another ACC title and then eight seeded Clemson who just knocked off number one Duke of the quarters taken on Wake Forest those games on acc Network Wednesday and then Sunday noon Eastern on ESPNU will be the ACC Championship Game Applause Nifty move Kevin Nolan draws the foul and that was the key matchup coming into this one I think a big reason why Duke has the lead theyve done a good job on uh Kevin Nolan the guy that really is their leading scorer guy that can get you a bucket anytime hes going to be one of the better players in the a sun but Ill give the backcourt credit of Duke theyve done a nice job making it difficult for him to get anything going Ryan young heads to the bench with three fouls Mark Mitchell back into the game and Jay one of the things that Mitchell brings to this Duke team versatility not just on the offensive end but hes a guy that really can guard uh one through four can switch on uh ball screens he can just do a lot of different things and I think the biggest area where he can be a really good player on the defensive end shows the ring the range too Applause hes up to 14 points in his Duke debut if hes knocking down shots watch out with his handle and athleticism Applause Mitchell time missed it it would have taken the roof off Cameron Indoor John Shire has to be happy with how his team is sharing the ball theyre playing really unselfish and thats something he talked about with this team he wanted to see he wanted to see them all share the ball obviously be aggressive they want to play Fast uh but guys are getting into the lane and then theyre finding open teammates Applause Applause Applause yeah Dukes been really active defensively sometimes they get a hand to it and its a takeaway for deflects out of bounds that time Jeremy roach called for the foul but you can see John Shire used the word aggressive to us today I want these guys to be aggressive and sometimes thats going to result in a fouling for Jeremy roach thats his fourth but the aggression has certainly shown up tonight in the home opener and I think once theyre back whole you add in Lively you add in Whitehead theyre going to be a very good defensive team as they progress through this season hook pull up pop too much on it you mentioned those two guys Lively and Whitehead John Shire reminded us hes yet to have a full practice with his full team think about that not one practice where hes had everybody available on the same day and I think it hurts on all aspects but the little things we saw him at shoot around today working on rotations on ball screens uh help side how were going to defend ball scenes are we icing are we hedging hard are we trapping uh not having those young guys out there learning that and then playing together as a unit its going to take some time for them to ramp up and I think where its going to show up the most early on is defensively but believe me they have the talent its just going to take a little time Applause Blakes called for a foul thats his first but the Blue Devils have committed six fouls already in this second half and theres still nine minutes left in it Jacksonvilles in the bonus on the next Duke foul and thats something you dont want Virginia probably one of the better teams in college basketball playing great defense without fouling you dont mind guys being aggressive you just dont want to put teams in a bonus situation obviously you gotta lead now you dont want to give them freebies and stop the clock tested three Off the Mark again Jacksonville really struggling from Deep one of 11 for three Applause ripped away dolphins have numbers three on one Applause philipowski got a piece of it thats a goaltend though wanted to add a block to what is already a doubledouble tonight for philipowski 10 points 10 rebounds but that wont be a block hes in the cylinder Timeout on the floor Blue Devils leading by 20 Duke looking good without Coach K on the sideline new college basketball season tipping off tonight happy to be here at Cameron Indoor Stadium take a look at the ACC preseason Paul Malcolm Huckabee its early but overall thoughts at how the league looks this season well North Carolina clearly the front runner yeah no doubt about it I mean Armando baycott Mr DoubleDouble but for me its their backcourt uh RJ Davis and Caleb love uh arguably if not the best backcourt in college basketball those two guys are very good if you want to call it a sleeper Notre Dame I mean I love Dane Goodwin the way he operates they got some veteran guys it should be another interesting competitive year in the ACC conference Applause foreign Applause North Carolina theyre coming up right after us well get you to the dean dome for UNC Wilmington and North Carolina and after that the nothing but net crew will recap the first night of college basketball a lot of games going on in the ACC theyll be live from Chapel Hill 11 pm Eastern Time right here on acc Network impressive that that crews on the move they were here for halftime and before the game and now over to Chapel Hill luckily an easy Drive right down the road you know you look at that ACC poll Duke number two you know Blue Devils youre going to give them respect because of the history and obviously on paper they look really good with the transfers like Ryan young who just scored in the Freshman you just never know how its going to blend for a new head coach and yet early sample size against an asun team its looked pretty good out of the gate yeah and I think though the big thing is they got to get back full strength so you can have your unit on there and he can figure out his rotations in particular for the new guys The Freshman adjusting to college ball its just a different feel and certainly thats a work in progress Ill tell you whos been impressive though Mike Marsh for Jacksonville hes done some really good things Applause great hands has continued to play hard on both ends would you take a look at his numbers efficient really every time hes touched it uh good things have happened and a pretty efficient night for him hes got 15 points to lead Jacksonville and you know for the Dolphins obviously you would have loved to come in here and shock the world on the first night of college basketball but Jordan Mincey knows this team has one goal and one goal only thats to win the asun tournament get into the NCAA tournament they fell just short a year ago made it all the way to the championship game and lost itd be the first time they went dancing since 1986 and the fact that this teams even thinking they have a shot to do that shows what Jordan mincy has accomplished in just two years on the job Ill say it again buy stock now and Jordan Mincey he is doing an outstanding job with this Jacksonville program we already talked about it they extended him after the first year of what hes done they are going to be a tough out NBA son foreign s swiped Away by Ryan Young hes making a big impact on both ends of the floor tonight the transfer from Northwestern how do you not love his energy the way he plays attacks the game Ill tell you who loves it this Duke coaching staff and thats what they needed thats what you want your older guys a veteran guy uh doing right on cue Ryan young delivers again all right Applause contested three it has not been easy Duke really dialed in on defense to do second half and that was an emphasis again in shoot around they did not want to give them open looks but I think the key thing is again on the defensive blast Jacksonville wanted a better offensive rebounding teams and theyve done a nice job in this second half Applause the one of 17 from three if you go cold in this building it can be very Unforgiven I know personally I didnt mean to go there on it youre kind of looking at me sideeyed and I know how you are partner and youre pulling up the old YouTube video I wasnt bringing up the box score Brad Hill dunking on my head it was my second college game but youre right it is one of the most difficult places to play and I think whats gotten away from Jacksonville defensively theyve been unable and give credit to really Jeremy roach and Mark Mitchell in that first half at the end they went on a little mini run and kind of blew this thing open Applause that might have been the best look of the night Jacksonville still cant bury it they do get the offensive rebound though oh Hearne thats their best shooter got a really good look and the struggles continue one of 19 from three now for Jacksonville John Shire elects to take a timeout somebody lost his shoe it was a sophomore Jalen Blakes Dukes dominance continues in the opener comfortable for John Shire and this Duke team to start this era how about the fivestar freshman in his Duke debut Kyle filipowski a doubledouble well hes been impressive right here finishing with the left hand I think this is what is going to be key for him his ability to stretch the floor is impressive but playing defense I think that allows John Shire to be versatile with his lineups he has had an impressive debut as you talked about efficient double double you cant ask for more if youre John Shire and staff from your freshman dick a roster thats been completely overhauled in the off season Jeremy roach whos still on the floor the lone returning starter from that final four team a year ago for transfer seven freshmen one of them Mark Mitchell hes had a huge night 18 points he and philipowski leading the way for this highly touted freshman class and Ryan Youngs done that a couple times tonight where hes made a nice crosscourt pass again unselfish sharing the ball seeing the double team coming and they make a beautiful pass over to the Freshman Mark Mitchell and Jay that was uh not uh one of his strengths but Mitchell really has shot the ball well from Beyond The Arc I love his versatility I think he can be a guy that can be a really good Defender for this Duke team but he has shot the ball well tonight John Shire when we asked him to describe Mark Mitchell as the Freshman checks out of this game to a huge Roar from the Cameron crazies he said you know hes really unique its unorthodox everything about his game is unique but it works trust me it works and weve seen that tonight and I asked Chris Carey what does he remind you of anybody that pause and he said we went way back I dont even think you were born he said no Stacy Ogman the plastic man thats who he reminded him and I cant take credit for it and I said yeah he kind of does same type body uh wiry a good handle really versatile and he has been fun to watch how many kids on the court are watching at home know that name not enough a lot of us basketball heads definitely remember oh yeah stick man Stacy Ogman heck of a player for that UNL play the team Applause foreign Jacksonville has only mustered 12 points in the second half talk about that Duke defensive lockdown in these 17 minutes but Jordan Mincey knows look this game is going to continue to prepare his team theyre already battle tested this is just going to make them better again you look at them they are going to be a very good team and the asun and I wouldnt be surprised to see them in the NCAA tournament remember they were in the championship game last year after being picked almost dead last by a lot of folks they arent sleeping on or sneaking up on anybody this season a pick number two in the asun and again hes got a lot of nice pieces Music well basketball is back in the ACC and football rolls on week 10 this Saturday on acc Network a loaded slate it starts at noon Pittsburgh in Virginia Boston College NC State and then Prime Time Florida State at Syracuse thats all this Saturday on acc network over lap season is here in the ACC we got Hoops we got football Applause Jaden shoot does just that but misfires and that is his real last name the Freshman getting his first action another attempt Miss fires again thats the best name in college basketball shoot John Tire had a little fun with that he said oh no pun intended he can shoot it in theyre going to rely on him to continue to get better and he gets those open opportunities like hes had he said look he shot the ball really well in practice shoot comes from Yorkville Christian High School in Illinois theres a couple of Illinois natives as well the proud parents of John Shire Jim and Lori Shire John the youngest of three children from Northbrook Illinois suburb of Chicago how much pride they must feel watching their son at the age of 35 it is head coaching debut of his alma mater here at Cameron Indoor Stadium yeah and when we talked to him I sensed a calm and a cool Collective guy again weve done two of his games where he filled in for Coach K he seemed relaxed and I thought it was very interesting when we asked him the advice or the conversations that hes had with Coach K and he said look dont be too hard on yourself and he said look you know guys Im so competitive Im a guy that wants to make sure everythings perfect and Coach K said look the pump the brakes a little bit things are not always going to go as smoothly as you want to stick with the process and I think his staff as well too he talked about the staff that he has put together and I think thats going to be an important part for all these young men out on the court the development all the young talented players that they have finally the lid comes off from three thats Jacksonvilles second triple of the night more than 20 attempts thats a nice find though by Jill and Nesmith now again he hasnt gotten the assist but he set guys up for some pretty high quality looks they just been unable to connect but hes been in the paint trying to find guys and fortunately they just went cold in the second half two jobs overall how would you assess this Duke performance in the opening to this season well it started with Jeremy roach he was impressive he set the tone I talked about it at the tip he needed to be the leader we talked about him being the lone Captain uh he set the tone defensively we talked about it Kevin Nolan the best player for Jacksonville he took that assignment on but offensively not only did he score he set his guys up I think philipowski was impressive but Mark Mitchell he raised some eyebrows in this one right here totally his versatility uh look the veteran guys you know what they are Ryan young was impressive but thats what he does thats what he was bought here for but the two young guys Mitchell and philipowski those two guys really impressed me in this uh performance for Duke foreign Applause I think the big question for this Blue Devils team is look they came out and took care of business today when they face adversity when they hit adversity for the first time this season with a new head coach and John Shire with seven freshmen and four grad transfers playing together for the first time how will they respond to that thats what Im curious well I think they need to get healthy and again a lot of that has to do with practice time together those endtogame situations if you dont have your key guys out there and theyre trying to play catchup becomes very difficult and I think it shows up in those close games endtogame situations defensively offensively what are you doing those one or two possession games I think as quickly as they can get full and healthy I think thats going to determine how fast all these guys catch up and see the progression as the season goes on yeah and that helped again according to John Shire should come sooner rather than later both guys nearing 100 percent Eric Lively and Derek Whitehead the top two top players in the class of 2022 certainly saw flashes tonight a promising season even though Coach K is not over on that sideline this is still Duke basketball the Cameron crazies have been loud theyve played like we expect them to play and it all started with obviously the crowds you talked about it the energy in this building but defensively in the second half they were impressive trying to get one more bucket at the end of this game battling through Christian Reeves another one of these talented freshmen out of Oak Hill putting the cherry on top here in the Duke opener this is just great work crowd loving that second and third effort offensive rebound take the hit and finish Applause well the John Shire era has started with a win do dominant in their home opener the first of many for the new head coach here in Durham impressive performance they took care of business the other thing Ill say Jeremy roach is one of the best guards in college basketball not just the ACC its going to be fun to watch him operate All Season college basketball is back for Malcolm Huckabee Im Jay alter it continues with North Carolina lets get it to Kelsey Riggs
