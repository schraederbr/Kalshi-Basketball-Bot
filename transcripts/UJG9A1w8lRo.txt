season they have and uh theyre going to have to figure it out quickly because even tonight they got this is a difficult Florida State team their next game theyre on a Road to Duke and cant get there end dur them until you take care of business in tah hassle so it should be a tough hardcore game away we go Florida state starts with it in the white here at home in front of a great crowd expected from the Tucker Center Baba Miller a lot for Jaylen warley on the reload was met by PJ hall and then nearly turned over theres J Watkins for warley couldnt get it to go and haul the rebound they had warley on the lob early just couldnt get his hands on it and well PJ Hall of course an ACC Player of the Year candidate as you check out the starters for the Tigers Joe Gerard and Chase hunter part of that great back court warley had the block on Hall and chy Wiggins is short back into the starting lineup after it was Dylan Hunter getting a start they trying to match up with all those Florida State length and Watkins and green are the top two scorers for the Deep NS I bet you PJ Hall hadnt had his shot blocked by a point guard at The Rim in a long time maybe never not a lot of 6 s point guards D green starts the scoring call it 20th game part of this high low offense for Clemson and its an offense top 15 in the country according to kenpa gerardi 15 a game gets it back from Ian shefflin number two in rebounding in the league and he can step out and stroke it as well sheff great job there just stepping into a shot he doesnt shoot a ton of them but he shoots a really good percentage from behind the yard its only a 10th made three and if he can knock down a couple tonight itll go this afternoon it go a long way for this the Tigers Junior from Georgia one of the most improved players in the confence its a foul that goes against Clemson and its on PJ Hall Florida State switches this and they didnt switch this time and shefin makes him pay doesnt Shoot Many but he really is an effective threepoint shoot I dont know if theres a better Rebound in the ACC to him right now he justel goes for it every time only behind Armando bon in the league in rebound but hes running away with it with the offensive in the rebounding FL St coming out that win against Miami they led by as many as 16 points in Coral Gables and they never Trail in that game Jaylen warley the point guard you mentioned playing a lot better recently and hes got a bucket constant press hes not a shooter but he can get to the rim at 670 post up smaller guards you saw them try to get the L for him earlier and at his size hes able to challenge bigs with his length Philly native coming off a season High six assists against the kanes against the constant switching of Florida State and all the length that Leonard Hamilton always has it forces a Joe jard turnover it does I I think bounce passes against this team is a no no if you dont get open get a chess pass I I think bounce passes just take too long to get there and theyll run right through those stop Brad Brownell in his 14th season three trips to the NCAA tournament we would both say it should have been four trips to the NCAA tournament hes got a great Squad this year they were off to their best start in 15 years and one of the last unbeaten teams in the country Clemson here switched to the zone you and I talked about this green hits a deep BL from oala hes the one guy you got to find you got to know where he is you got to guard him at the logo why zone why does that work and why do you expect to see it from funon because theyve theres no secret Florida State struggles from behind the threepoint line and Hall with a slam high percentage shot there to get yourself going but no this Florida State team is just they struggle from threepoint line in general and the one guy you know is green you got to find him green blew a tire got it free to warley and kicks it out to Baba Miller its only been 2 Zone according to Synergy from Clemson this year Watkins with a followup and part of it is because state is dominant at getting in the paint finishing and thats where the majority of their points come from just getting at the basket getting to the midrange shots and scoring just like that and the NOS meanwhile only 33 fromes three this season Hall plus a foul and a chance at three for PJ Hall PJ Hall has to stay out of foul trouble because this floa State team likes to switch when hes so good on the offensive end you dont want to switch because of this reason right here he buries your your guards or your wings on the perimeter buries him inside just finish it over you cant do anything but foul senior from spart andberg on the wooden award top 25 midseason watch list coming off a career high 31 and 17 in that double overtime game Tuesday against the jackets hes had an AllAmerican type of season and thats why you have to feel so confident that this Clemson team will figure it out to the corner and Baba Miller played a great allaround game Rec ly lobed underneath for Watkins Gerard goes diving for it but hes out of bounds on the Baseline four minutes in we expect this to be a great one nolles by one Music early Auto Owners ures your car because sometimes something Hunter went for a careerhigh 26 and had the winner here at the tuck yeah he has the ability in him you know this team needs it because Florida State put so much pressure on you hes the one guy that can handle the pressure create for himself and his teammates there as you see him again with the game winner career high 26 he struggled a little bit early just needs to hit the reset button relax go out there today have some fun the game is there this team will need it but he helps he needs to help sh up the defensive end of the floor for this team overall when we chatted with Brad Brown L today he said weve definitely lost a bit of our swagger no this but yeah hes absolutely focused on the defensive side you have to I mean this is a defensively statistically this isnt a brad Ron team theyve hung their head on that now this team is so much better when the offensive ended the floor but they quit defending they said bad defensive habits yeah and it and its just been inconsistent its not just been a 40 minutes of bad basketball all it takes in this league is a FIV minute stretch or a 10minute stretch just hadnt put 40 minutes together on a defensive end in conf in conference play yet he felt like they had good enough defense to win against both Carolina and Georgia Tech but Georgia Tech did go for 15 threes and in both those games Clemson really struggled from Deep sheins got it underneath and has it blocked by Miller yeah they went on those those two home games against Carolina Jordan Tech they were combined four of 39 from behind the threepoint line no matter how good your defense is youre just not going to win a lot of games shooting that poly from behind the threeo Watkins gave it up to warley Clemsons bench is in consistent that the pass landed out of bounds warley on the drive and a chance at three and Brad Brownell is steaming back yeah coach brell knows every possession counts and you definitely if that ball if he stepped out of bounds and then he turns he gets an n one thats a big play in the game I mean that thats not even close yeah thats not even close that is a missed opportunity and that is a huge swing Brad Brownell is in the ear of Trey Sans the referee yeah thats a Miss call there it makes you worse you were hoping for the officials that it would they wouldnt score in possession but you get of all things they get in and one so you get a foul and a free throw Bell give me a break I need to catch a break thats how it feels in coaching right yeah so claps it down by four five minutes in and Joe Gerard sets up shot for the Tigers how far extended Florida state has Clemson starting their offense Florida States been a top five defense in the league in ACC play Gerard kicks it shein rises air balls this one run down shot clock doesnt reset and turned over warley picked it and lays it in you saw it from the start there with Florida States defense men theyve extended pressure they know when you drive theyre going to kick out and its going to be imperative that the front line of Clemson Tigers chony Wiggins and chefin and PJ Hall going to have to knock down perimeter jump shots and Hall seated right now hes got one foul RJ Godfreys been in the game hunter got stripped Godfrey muscles it up for two Godfrey brings a level of physicality to him when he comes in and you need that strength and size and depth something coach brell told us he wanted to get back to twoo as well just his bench get his guys going give them some confidence so so they dont get wear down yeah he felt like maybe his guys were tired at times during this stretch and that he didnt trust his bench enough though he does have Hall ready to return right now green got sheflin in the air and will shoot a couple those are frustrating things for a coach you do a good job of keeping them in front and you often tell you guys we the second guy got to Music jump he is not happy with himself there he knows did his job stayed in front of the ball and just elevated off a shot fake so Darren Green to the line 41 from three this year number two scorer for Florida State and like Joe Gerard a marksman both guys with more than 300 career made threes and both now been doing it for 5 years in the college Applause its a lot of jumpers there buddy thats not a Mike Monaco pregame list right there thats not you thats you dont think I can make that N I dont think you can get on that list okay thanks Gerard gives it up crowd wanted a walk Josh Beetle red shirt sophomore backup guard into the game for the Tigers and the regalia on the road Beetle now walks with it its turnover for Clemson there third one thing about this Florida State Defense its just difficult to simulate it because theres so much length it isnt just guarding the ball its just everywhere you look its a 65 66 68 Applause guy I just swarmed over and you got to have your head up and you cant dribble with your eyes down you got to know the rotation and help is coming when youre playing against the simers you got to drive to Petry Florida State goes into the bench here and they bring on one of the guys you mentioned off the top Primo Spears 23 in white his 10th game of the season a multitime transfer this time from Georgetown hes getting 11 a game bottom of your screen man drive the pass you got to drive against this team of pass vice versa here against Clemson just get in the paint both of these teams do a really good job at The Rim when you drive you got to look to pass with both of these teams traveling the call on Taylor B Bowen talented freshman he is 6 10 from Vermont so its Hall Hunter Gerard Beetle and Godfrey the five for the Tigers downed by five seven minutes in on the road here at the tuck look at the high low there for PJ Hall B Bowen picks up a foul jockeying with PJ hall now PJ Hall is so physical when not high low if you dont have it theyre looking to throw it over the top and if you help from the weak side like that theyll skip it hell just keep his feet moving and seal the angle and theyll throw it to him in so one thing for the state has is fouls theyll continuously rotate bodies they have at least 15 fouls than they to designate the PJ Hall Beetle on the Baseline out of bounds from Chase Hunter brells got to be happy with that execution because you know Florida State Baseline out of bounds they run this Zone match up and he sent more bodies than Florida state had and stole the lay up there theres Chandler Jackson sophomore Guard from npis who loves to get into the midrange C cor tipped it out oh Bowen swirls it out and Jackson follows GS have got a rebound Clemson Jackson did drive warley and all of these guards Primo Spears they go to the offensive glass youre accustomed as a guard you dont always have to box out Hall Rises too strong Jackson Soares for a rebound and draws a foul on RJ Godfrey in the process Clemson struggle percentage wise but theyre going to have to take those theyre going to have to take the bigs out of the paint then itll allow the guards of Clemson to get in there and finish three offensive rebounds already for Florida State and the lead is five for one of the hottest teams in the ACC Jackson around the corn screen the lob and the foul underneath goes against RJ Godfrey sends us to a timeout Florida state has the lead on the Tigers and Chandler Jackson that follow at the rim for the nolles NOS have won seven of their last eight and that has been Capp by a slam and a rivalry win for Florida State at Miami and Jamir Watkins on the head of nor Shadow and then chamir the BCU transfer was not done even after the game ended he threw some shade at Matthew Cleveland on Instagram who of course transferred from Florida State to Miami its pettiness at the highest level and Im here for it I love it I mean thats one of the small qualities that I have I dont know if you noticed it but I believe me I noticed whats better than the dunk or the IG post I I like the post I got to go with the post and I mean its like a 1 a and one Music B Big Time stuff from jir Watkins and Florida State here at home now ahead by five RJ Godfrey and Ian shein both have two fouls for Clemson you mentioned for Florida State they can rotate through all the bigs with all the depth that Leonard Hamilton has but those two sit right now for the Tigers a little bit shorthanded here in the first half and now that puts a ton of pressure on PJ Hall as they going to look to get the high low action with him here get him moving and try to get the switch Dyan Hunter skip it for Josh Beetle who attacks and draws a foul middle ball screen there and and its difficult and what you do is youre trying to get FL the stadium rotation because you know you they switch which they will now you get the ball to PJ Hall hes going to seal if you can cant throw it over the top they skipped it there Beetle did a great job driving that close out and thats how you get offense inside and out that way thats when the guard opportunity to score they helped too much on PJ Hall and you get that you either shoot the three or drive the close out that time he was able to draw a foul Florida state with how much it switches against PJ Hall and the high low offense how do you think they match up and do you think they attack the switches really well as a team well they do and I think you Florida State too is the lineups right now this is with Primo Spears out there there this is their smaller lineup but when its warley hes 67 he does a better job of fronting and has a little bit more size to help him spars right now operating for Florida State Taylor B Bowen by a hand off for Jackson Corin sets the screen for the Georgetown transfer Primos Spears who is bouncing loves the midrange thats his shot going left to right he loves his right hand more but if he can get to 15 17 ft you almost counted four points away now from a th000 for his career hes just his transition and its taken him a couple of games and hes a big part of why this team is taking off here he is in transition and Gerard commits the foul that time just catches it ahead and Gerard tried to make a play on it but it just just what he does he comes in and trying to stay in drops but and dont avoid the switch he just eats up the space and walks in the one and thats the Dilemma this team put you in if you know when you got a guy like PJ Hall you dont want him up in the ball screens risking fouls you put him in drops and keep him around the basket but thats thats allowing Florida State to get to a strength and thats just getting in that paint so Gerard to the bench with his first over there with shefflin and Godfrey Midway through this first half Spears with 16 in the win against Miami on Wednesday jayen key 33 and white into the game is a big replacing Corin as Jackson hoverson heads Jacksons had an impact in this game already with a couple of baskets here and and hes a guy hes another one of those guys thats coming in hes only averaging Four Points hes you look at his stats they dont blow you away but if you follow Florida State and you know its just its its its your number its your day any different day they theyre not relying on one guy to carry him at 20 points a game its just play hard defend and let the ball find you on the offensive in Wiggins with the shot clock widening down gets the roll and the second three for Clemson we got ATT track the threepoint shooting of the front line of Clemson its going to be big and as expected now theyre going a little bit of Zone I think theyll play more Zone we you and I talked about this you need to protect PJ Hall and challenges flid State team to start knocking down some threes again just 33 from three for Florida State but Spears knifing into the midrange again Spears goes diving for it against Josh Beetle you mentioned threes from the front line all four threepoint attempts are from The Bigs and Hunter to the rack and Chase Hunter with his first points Applause today he has that ability as we talked about putting it on the deck you attack kick it out thats just got to be the game plan all night all afternoon against this for St te just drive the Gap Drive the pass and let its ball you basket then you pass nickelberry guy who can shoot it against the Zone confident cant hit hes another one of those guys I think hes coming at any moment and knock down you cant look at his percentages he can knock down two or three threes in a heartbeat Applause heres Wiggins Paul comes up to get it hes been so good with this shot pick from the top of the key this year but PO poen with the Applause block and thats the problem that this Florida State Defense presents again shot fakes the center he drives then another Wing comes over for the second time blocks a shot its just something that you just cant simulate that Applause couple of screens from Wiggins and Hall Josh Beetle still with it directing Music traffic high low what there for H faces up on gainy Hall with a hook and Hall runs it down and looks like a foul is called on the floor goes against Taylor B Bowen Paul on the drive B bow and the SWAT hey coming up next our basketball triple header rolls on with Virginia taking on Georgia Tech and then Kyle filipowski and number seven Duke host pit at Cameron indor to cap the day well KY filipowski has been great this season we started thinking yes its January 20th who would be the early contenders for ACC player of the year philipos is on the list PJ Hall is absolutely on the list and so is our Davis yeah all three of these guys having outstanding years and with the injuries Duke had to deal with roach and Mark Mitchell filipowski has put that team on his back and I dont know where Carolina would be without RJ Davis as good as any guard in the country Darren Green short Jack Clarks into the game for Clemson five and regalia sixth year senior NC State transfer second game back after being out a month in a half with that pesky groin injury that hes dealt with the last couple of years yeah hes been practicing some so its see if he can get his legs up under him cuz he can stretch the defense as well soing Joe Gerard but he missed it he didnt match up here warley tough pass the handle for Deontay green back to his feet mad scramble and a held ball in the arrow points in favor of the Tigers guys are on the ground fighting hard for it and turn over there for warley just left his feet this uncharacteristic for a guy who has one of the better assistant turnover ratios in the Applause ACC those have only turned it over a couple of times here in the first half theres Chase Hunter Clemson down by five and he draws a foul on the drive thats why I say he he needs to be more aggressive because of there he drives it uses his body cuts off the angle when youre placing it shot blockers like that you see him go gets his body into his Defender he cuts off the angle from Watson from Watkins so thats all he can do was foul getting to the line and shooting free throws when youre struggling from the field just a way of getting your confidence and getting yourself back on track fifth year senior coming off 18 against Georgia Tech that tied a season high for Chase got to the free throw line quite a bit he been quiet scoring against both Virginia Tech at Boston College yeah he knows the message for him is stay confident relax lets go have some fun been productive the talents there but theyre going to need a solid performance out of him today this this is going to be with the pressure and the size issues that Florida State present his skill set his best game is needed Miller aive for green against a Clemson Music Zone not many teams can put a 611 guy in the free throw line that can attack the middle and throw alive and avoid the charge and B Miller just does so many things that just dont show up on the stat sheet like pressure opposite team point guards like that why is he playing better over the last four games I think its because hes had a full season you see there he comes in and I think thats a good job of the officials of not taking the Char not calling the charge there and he jumps to the side throws a lot but you know he played 15 games a year ago and then this year he comes in and now hes played 16 17 games so you know its essentially a full year for him Clark knocks down a corner three and much needed for Clemson thats where the threes are going to come from the guards got to creative in his front line Clark has that in his game and so does chy Wiggins warley a little floater no and then Wiggins clears him out for the rebound at threepoint shots have come from the big guys Clark at 61 is attempted one Wiggins W Hall one one shefflin a couple all tried to tip that out but warley runs onto it warley cant lay it Applause in Gerard with a mismatch against Green but he turns it Applause over got to give it up get it get it back green and if its on Hall its his second and sure looked like it was that is two on PJ Hall committing the foul on Deontay green and this is this is just what we talk about Florida State wearing you down on the offensive men Florida they dont shoot it great and they dont try to CH take a lot of shots they just constantly attack the paint dont need that foul right there right no its its youve heard me say this as many times you and I work together is guys like him are invaluable to their team and hes got to do a better job of his experience of protecting fouls and protecting himself and he was at The Rim just wall up you know you got one and you got two teammates on the bench already with two with two fouls and then now youre forcing your coach to put go deeper in the bench but risk it leaving you out there and he cant with five minutes to go in the first half yeah Brad Brownell one of the most strict coaches in the country if you get two fouls in the first half hes not typically lenient in letting you play so Halls out joining shefin joining Godfrey and BOS Lia fifth year senior transfer from UNC Greensboro who only averages 5 minutes per game 33 is into the game which is good they need his five minutes right here in the rest of this half to keep it going and Clemson usually relies on their defense their defense has to step up right now so many their Frontline guys in in foul trouble man thats just where getting Jack Clark back is just so big to have him back this game he gave it up for Wiggins walked with it another turnover from Clemson Wiggins got to slow down a little Music bit shed to turnover there but two possessions ago he came down and took a quick shot quick shot sometimes are just as effective from a defensive standpoint as a turnover wiggin out d Hunter into the game and Clemson again sets up in the zone B some time allows you to rebound as well just got to keep that ball out of the middle though that thats a spot you dont want the ball to get to In the Zone Watkins no dice from deep and then a foul goes against BOS Lia on the rebounding action as Clark when soaring got to get that rebound and this is why a lot of coaches are reluctant to do so Play Zone because who you have to block out can come from anywhere but you when the shot goes up you got to hit a body you know Florida State theyll send four guys to the glass one1 for C Corin 78 from the line for his career hey tomorrow afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball double header starts in Raleigh at noon Eastern with number four for NC State against Duke then a top 25 match up its Louisville and Carolina at 200 from Carmichael right here on accn and the ESPN Aven so its a split for Corin and the lead is five for Florida State at 5 and one in the ACC all alone in second after NC State lost earlier today Carolina by the way survived against BC light it got free and got it from Clark great job there being patient letting shot flaking letting the defense fly by and finish Applause it Spears spun it out and Dylan Hunter the rebound Joe Gerard is still scoreless here in this first half 61 Baba Miller on him and Gerard wants a clear out wants to go to work gives it up on a skip Beetle Rises cant connect good drive there good find Beetle hesitated there should have caught it off the catch and just went up with it Miller all alone cant knock it down and Clark Rises for a rebound and BOS Lia is grabbing at his right arm and in a lot of pain this is the last thing Clemson needed with it front Court already shorthanded well check on Bas Lia when we come back threepoint game in the first Applause half exploring all night driving now up for the rebound and he was grabbing at his right arm after this yeah a little bit of Friendly Fire there you see see Jack Clark comes over to get that rebound and hits him in the back of that shoulder and uh hes in a lot of pain trust me for a guy thats had multiple shoulder surgeries you dont want any issues with that they are painful so laa on the bench and RJ Godfrey 10 and regalia comes back into the game with his two fouls with shefin and Hall sideline PJ Hall has played 13 minutes and scored five points in this first half and Ian shefflin only six minutes of action in this first half and yet the Tigers just trailing by three gford set a bunch of ball screens try to force some switches no finish from Dylan Hunter Baba Miller pushes Tom house is Into The Game 12 in white bottom left of your screen as Miller cops it up Hunter threw it at Clark and Gerard rescues it Clark attacks and the follow not there for Godfrey and its offensive basket interference from the Tigers you got to applaud the effort though created to turnover thought the pass was a little late to Clark and responded a droven and you want garrey attacking the glass need that type of effort you live with that yeah you live with that thats just its a mistake but you can live with the effort Spears turns it over Dylan hutters running Gerards calling for it he hoists and hits Joe Gerard has entered the chat with his first points late in the first half to tie this thing up at 28 and Leonard Hamilton needs a time out well take it with him hell step aside and then back in 30 seconds story of ACC play for Clemson has been this theyre the best offensive team according to kenpom in League Play in the ACC but you see there that third line confoundingly only 29 from three I I dont I dont I never understood it I I just theres so many good Shooters there its just one of those thingses they just inability knock down shots and I think thats part of it is its affecting your defense and theyre giving up 81 points and 49 from the field and 42 from three in ACC play its just I think thats the most surprising thing of all offensively for their part shot it well from three in this first half four for eight tied at 28 as Miller goes driving for two heres length he doesnt take much he turns the corner its one dribble hes right at The Rim first points for the sophomore from F yeah you got to get him going east and west Beetle kicks Clark cant connects Miller got a piece of it and rescued by Florida State inside a 9 seconds till Applause halftime prior to the timeout Florida state had got a little sloppy with some turnovers green tough shot Gerard the rebound Gerard Motors ahead too strong and Clark cleans it up now thats one thing you can do against this Florida State team when their guards going in rebound and go to the offensive glass when you secure the rebound you can get out weve seen that a bunch of times you can get numbers you just got to get out and attack the rim and finish so even for a team in Clemson that doesnt play at a typically fast tempo its open for you you have to push you dont want to go against their set defense you know you need some easy baskets and if their guards are going to go in there and try to get offensive rebounds and their their defensive balance is off you got to punish them key had it pop out on a gorgeous setup from Baba Miller see the experience Applause here Gerard just knowing just take one shot 4 second difference so they wont get the last shot but battle back with our team being in foul trouble and I think hes going to keep this and didnt run the ball screen and attack the switch and he does switch on to Joe Gerard a step back cant knock it down Miller the rebound for Florida State House with three Stripped by Beetle and to strong from Godfrey to close out the first half just what we thought it would be two teams Clemsons coming in with a level of desperation Carolina and trying to keep Pace with the heels who already won away we go with the second half as warley starts out out alongside Miller green Watkins and green the five starters for Florida State heres jir Watkins leads the team in scoring rebounding and assists found Miller and a foul away from the ball on the rebounding action and get that on Deontay green this is second for Florida State so I and Chapan only played six minutes in that first down PJ Hall picked up his second with a little over five to go until halftime starters for the Tigers as well and Chase Hunter at the Music controls Hall comes up to get it and a face up on Deontay green and PJ Hall going to work for two at Five Points and three rebounds in the first half and DJ Hall starts the scoring in the Applause second Watkins directing traffic the VCU transfer skips it for Darren Green and now warley Stripped by Gerard and a foul goes against jayen warley he picks up his first Halls been so effective this year in all facets averaging 20 and seven Leonard Hamilton wants an early timeout just over a minute into the second half with Clemson ahead by two early timeout to start this second half for Leonard Hamilton after a tightly played first half Florida state had led for essentially the entirety of the first half and forc Clemson into seven turnovers and thats business as usual for Leonard Hamilton and his defense Clemson we told you in ACC play theyve struggled from Beyond The Arc but knocked down four triples in that first half we told you about the foul trouble for PJ Hall and Ian shefflin meanwhile we do get an update on BOS Lia came out of the locker room with ice and a bandage wrapped around his right shoulder and he is out for the remainder of the game with what Clemson is calling a shoulder injury for the fifth year senior backup big still no Rand off children with audio so folks you are stuck with me for to be determined amount of time Rand says the fans watching need a raise heres chy Wiggins rising up and he buries a triple chy wigin second three of the game and now thats five of 11 from long range for for the Tigers and like Randolph talked about in the first half its the front line for Clemson producing the threepoint attempts and they have knocked him down Le is five now for the Tigers on the road Gerard shoveled for Hall who lays it in time for Clemson they turn looking for an answer heres their top scorer jir Watkins slicing and scoring over Hall just the second bucket for jir Watkins who had been held to two Applause points Joe Gerard orchestrates and sends off PJ Hall with a mismatch shot clock winding down on Chase Hunter sheins got the point guard jayen warley Ono Paul the catch shefflin is pushed and a foul with 1 second left on the shot clock goes against Baba Music Miller Miller with the push in the back de Shon and a fresh 20 from the Tigers was sort of a choppy first half in that regard a lot of fouls a lot of whistles and 3 minutes out of halftime here Chase Hunter to key it in finds Gerard driving dish Hall too strong and Deontay green rips down the Applause rebound Miller thought about it instead Florida State sets up a half court offense with Worley such a good job controlling things green the follow a no and shein comes down with the rebound leard Hamilton was telling us last week that he didnt feel like they had been in an offensive flow yet this season told this today feels like theyre getting closer to it Hunter will count it as two its goal tending on Baba Miller so its a 92 Run for the Tigers since halftime in these last three and a half minutes and Florida State trying to get into a flow offensively Jaylen Worley leads this them in this game with seven points and Darren Green right behind him with six Watkins driving on Hall takes the contact plus a foul third foul on PJ Hall and Jamir Watkins with a chance at three two you can tell Hall trying to go straight up there but he does get saddled with his third so its 1621 to go in the second half Hall back to the bench and RJ Godfrey with two of his own enters to replace him and a big assist to rph there when that foul was called he held up the three fingers good teammate though he has been muted here trying to help out with a reminder he says they still cant stop biller checks out and Taylor bull Bowen replaces Applause him Randol made the point that Florida States got all the fouls to give they can keep running bodies at you theyve done that against Hall so hes out with three Watkins couldnt stamp the threepoint play the lead is five for Clemson gfre attacks couldnt finish through green warley gives it up for bu Bowen and now Watkins warley moves it green connects second three for Darren green hitting at 41 from long range this season Dylan Hunter with the floater good answer from the sophomore guard and Chases younger brother of course hes got a big role here in year two with the Tigers foul is called in the post and thats on RJ God so that is three on Godfrey about a minute after he came into the game to replace Hall after his third foul trouble again for the Clemson front court is this new year make a re Beck and Tallahassee good one going here between the Tigers and the nolles saw Darren Green knocked down another three Joe Ds been doing this for 5 years in the ACC and oh yeah originally he was calling this game hes laughing about it right beside me but we cant hear him Randolph ch with a bunch of his own and I know if he were on right now he would say something about he only got four years and some guys nowadays get five Joe Gerard and the Tigers up by four on Darren Green and the nolles some of the best Shooters in this entire conference couple of guys with more than 340 made threes throughout their illustrious careers glad youre with us s through some audio issues here here from the Tucker Center but a great one going between Clemson and Florida State Jaylen warley to put it in for the nlls as they run green off the screen being harassed by Dylan Hunter an excellent Defender who stuck with green Holland Godfrey on the bench with three fouls a pop for the Tigers so shefflin and Wiggins in in the front court and Jack Clark doing his second game back from a groin injury gave some good first half minutes chefin couldnt handle de feed from Gerard so its warley turns it over Gerard in transition pulls up cant knock it down but an offensive rebound from Clark and then he turns it over warley Off to the Races and hes going to the line for a Applause couple so turnovers on both sides and orley after giving it up in transition earned it right back and took the bump from Dylan Hunter Randolph was talking with Jaylen warley at practice yesterday from Florida State and he pointed out to Jaylen something about being ready on the catch and having your feet in a position on the catch to put yourself in a better offensive position Rand was saying before the game that he noticed even at shooter around today the jayen had really put that into effect see what Worleys done over his last few games sharing it more better assist to turnover ratio Leonard Hamilton said to his sh around today hes playing within itself pass for guy hes really happy playing within the construct of the offense so he the parts Primo Spears replaces it meanwhile Joe Gerard to the bench for Clemson who will roll with Beetle Wiggins Hunter Clark and shefflin top two scorers on the bench for Brad Brown Ls group here on the road in the early minutes out of halftime Hunters got Corin switched on to him and Chase hunter lost Applause it now Watkins sets up for Florida State around the Corin screen Watkins moves it to the corner for Spears back out bull Bowen cant connect but he got fouled by shefin so its Ian sheins third fouling a jump shooter from Beyond The Arc and he looks up in disbelief Taylor B Bowen a guy whos only knocked down two threepointers all of this season as a 61 freshman and chevlin committed the foul Randolph just pointed out to me its the second time that sheflin is fouled a jump shooter as well hes still working hard here after shefflin got in the air on a shot fake from Florida State back in the first out but Brad brownells going to roll with him with his three fouls and again RJ Godfrey and PJ hall both sitting with three already B bow and the Freshman from veratos just one out of three and sheflin clears it Clemson trying to get back into a good group here offensively theyve CED it up three times in the last buck Applause 30 Midway through the shot clock trying to initiate the offense Hunter going oneonone with Jackson shefflin got a seal in the Applause slam he and sheflin having a breakout season got the positioning on cam Corin and now back to his zone for Clemson good hands from Clark and off of the flexion Florida State Midway through the shot clock Clark and tipped it away and the fouls going against cam Corin here heres a look at shefin getting the post positioning sheflin coming off with career high 20 points Tuesday against George Tech go along with 15 rebounds and four assist so Clemson by three inside of 14 minutes to go in the second half Dany is out on Chase Hunter Hunter off the bounce caught it in the air and tried to finish and Drew a foul fouls on Chandler Jackson Brad Brown L maybe trying to settled Chase Hunter he lost it on the way up caught it and then got hit on the arm so it is two shots for Chase Hunter creeping up on a th000 points himself mention Primos Spears is knocking on the door so to his Chase Hunter the fifth year senior from Applause Atlanta he makes both and the lead is five for Clemson after the Tigers trailed by as many as eight to the nolles in the first half and again a zone for Clemson theyre just joining us entering todays action they had only Play Zone on 2 of possessions All Season Florida State a team that hasnt shoted great from threepoint range All Season shot clock at six for Spears shefflin clears another Applause rebound probably exactly what Brad Brown l wants to see by going Zone there forcing Florida State into that kind of shot sheins calling for it hes got the mismatch with Spears they go high low sheflin the catch and the Finish Brad Brownell has talked about it this year how he has fit his Personnel to the offense so with a group as loaded in the front Court as they are theyre running so much high low and even without Hall in the game it pays off there with Wiggins and sheflin Lead at seven for the Tigers shot clock winding down and Watkins spins out of three Florida States got as many made buckets as turnovers here in the second half and overall just two for 12 from three Hunter on the rip through and he gets fouled again well PJ Hall and Joe Gerard seated right now so Chase Hunter leading the show along with Ian sheflin and the Tigers up by seven on the road in Tallahassee back in Tallahassee getting ready for the Under 12 coming out of it look who we found Rand chers you have a headset on I uh had two different headsets on now Im just down the one we can hear each other everyone can hear you we missed you uh what did we miss while we were without hearing from the well I dont know I was in the back with my friend right here eating uh eating eating reent species right here behind me no I think Clemsons done a heck of a job just getting the ball in the middle of the paint goinging the high low and when FL St tries to help out theyre skipping it getting it inside and theyre also setting ball screens early attacking the switches with their bigs on the guard on Florida State guards and theyre just controlling the paint right now and thats not an easy thing to do against the Florida State team uh can you never do that to me again please oh youre Mike Your Money Mike no problem get out of here you had he had it easy I was enjoying myself back there I could have were passing notes like were in elementary school I know 2x he fouled jump shooter it says meaning yeah meaning you knew it was shefin so I was saying thats the second time tonight he fouled a jump shoot still going to help you out man I appreciate it I very much appreciate it hes in the game with three fouls Chase Hunter starting to heat up a bit here in the second half and now lead is as large as its been for either side Clemson up by nine Midway through the second half what do you want to see from Florida State offensively well I think again they just have to stick to their identity theyre not changing anything continue to put pressure on the rim and get in the paint draw fouls and attack the offensive BLS sh CL winding down on Baba Miller and he does just that attacking the blast and drop foul on Jack Clark yeah thats just they just come in waves theyre going to continue to drive you and attack you and its its PJ Hall is not there theres no shot Blocker on the floor and hes 611 and when he drives it theres not many people that can block his shot anyway so thats something B B Miller can do at will so Miller to the line just two points so far in this one for Baba Miller from mayorca good on the first here next gymnastics meet right here on accn and the ESPN app is tomorrow afternoon when pit squares off against number 19 Clemson from Little JN covered starts at for Eastern reminder this is just the first of our three games mens basketball triple header here on this ACC Saturday shefin the rebound thats Miller Applause splitz whoevers producing that I think is Virginia Virginia next plays out the rest I think its j alers and at Georgia Tech yeah theyre not that game wont start floridia State never let you never let you start on time theyre going to drag this game out so that Virginia Georgia Tech guys dont worry about it have fun on the app well get it well get you maybe in the second you guys are starting on the app no doubt about it you dont want to be that group playing behind this Florida State team they just junk the game up and they compete in the way their Style the play just going to stretch the game out a lot of fouls they draw a lot of fouls theyve had 24 fouls in this game and add another to it is primo Spears went driving Florida State hasnt had a made field goal in 5 minutes of game action it is a lot of going to the rim and trying foul but thats what Bells them out I mean its just that theyre going to drive you so yeah theyll have lows without scoring field goals but they get to battle through those moments because theyre going to get to the free throw line now with them they want the right guy shooting this is not a great free throw shooting team and theyve been really inconsistent with that Primo Spears one of the very good ones on this team at 80 hes sitting on 999 career points and that was the fourth foul by the way on Ian shefflin so he goes to the bench with 1032 to go Primo Spears a split so lead is at seven for clemon and now Joe Gerard draws a foul on Baba Miller and thats his second so shein with four how long you think he sits with the lead I think youll protect him to at least under five but everything was playing well I think hes the X Factor for this team he just does so many different things was forced into playing centered this afternoon with the foul trouble with Clemson had just so consistent and solid every foul the rest of the way means free throws on both sides with 1027 to go Joe Gerard one of the best free throw shooters in the country at 91 is good on both manto man for the Tigers watch gainy in the ball screen and driving it Jackson midrange no Parks been aggressive rebounding hes made an impact hes done a great job coming in just knocked down a couple of shots early in the first half and you need his depth six rebounds at 13 minutes for Jack Clark Five then regelia Off the Bench Gerard for Hall and now Josh Beetle shot clock at five Paul wats it hes got Miller on on him Beetle drives instead and a tie up keep it at this end of the floor Jackson did a great job helping off his man in the corner when you do that on strong side you got to get it and he did if not its an easy pass to the corner 4 three but sometimes spacing isnt great you heard coach branell yelling at his guys stay stay deep in that corner and if you dont get deep you allow that strong side guy to help not be able to punish him so 1 second left after the arrow kept it with Clemson Gerard lets it expired thought it fully reset well that sometimes youre just like Im not heing a 60 footer messing up my percentages what do they call that in the NBA a grenade its a grenade dont throw me a grenade from 60 ft and I have to launch it man you know kind of like things youll do to me sometime thats the kind of stuff you do to me oh yeah you think so yeah you did it to me tonight I did you shut me down 10 minutes man not by choice youre powered down Im getting Tex saying are you doing this game alone Randolph alive Watkins slicing and Music finishing Watkins leads this team in so many categories and scoring assist and steals o good cut by Chase Hunter and then Ted Valentine jumed in and called the foul on Baba Miller so thats three on Miller he thought he got a clean deflection yeah you you want Baba Mill in a passing Lane if not with his length challenge to shot it in the air dont want to get your third foul reaching so Chase Hunter back to the line its really monitored the free throw shooting from here on in I mean Clemson back Fort Chase Hunter is a 87 uh free throw shoot and Gerard is 91 and its a big difference in the starting back court of Florida state which is in the 60 so saw the note flash there off the scoreboard Clon today 11 for 12 at the line Florida State today to your point just 10 of 17 yeah and Hunter makes both and thats what back qu to Clemson is can be efficient picking their moments to score but really just taking care of the basketball and make sure your team get a good shot Darren Green off a screen elbow jumper contested by Hunter and then it belongs to Applause Clemson a lot of respect full court pressure here its a dead ball Florida States going to look to extend their defense here is that the road map back into this for Florida State extend full court pressure and try to force turnovers well you have to because youre struggling to score against this Clemson defense in a half court theyre theyre understanding that green is their best deep shooter theyre finding him and the other guys you just got to back off and even Primo spear is on the court right now and hes more of a midrange shooter you just got to take care of the basketball you cant turn it over let this floa State team get out of transition Gerard back out for Hunter late shot clock for Chase Hunter entry for Hall and the foul is going to go on Darren Green who wrapped up Hall the First on Darren Green see watch with clinson early theyll getting the ball screen knowing that Flo States going to switch and lets see if coach ham counters that because Paul is getting a guard on him and hes just too much of a physical mismatch for any guard even guard at Florida State size so set up your offense with the first first thing that you do if youre Clemson grab Brown L summoning a ball screen so that you get the switch and then you come back around and get a mismatch with your big guy on the guard yeah and you notice theyll run that high low action and they want to do it from their High post he does a great job of walking his Defender up the lane and then he can throw the high low so if you help on the wing they just skip it and he just seals his man and they thr it inside Hall misses on the front end Lord theys got it down by nine and green saw the opening and gets the roll I think you saw BJ Hall a little late on that that play I think if youre coach Rono youre happy with that you didnt wanted him picking up a foul coming over late to rotate that would have been his fourth if hed gotten near late you need him in the game right now Su stay in his lead the no set up their press a team that presses nearly as much as anyone in the country fifth most in the frequency with which they do here comes the ball screen now you saw that time CL State didnt switch it so Halls got a big on him Dyan Hunter knocks one down its great job by Clemson execu their offense that time ran the drag ball screen Florida state did not switch it got strung out a little bit and couldnt get out to Dylan knock down the jump shot Dyan hter wraps up Darren Green and commits a foul 10point lead for Clemson inside a eight to go in tallah has its bow time hey sweetie hey Mom I land at three match up punishing those switches and now they got Florida State scrambling here you got to you know not often can you get this defense in rotation they got them in rotation they punished him in knockdown shots but I think the biggest difference this half is they dominated the glass theyve out rebounded Florida State 12 to3 in this second half and they plus 13 for the game that doesnt happen very often with this Fu team with their sides and their guards rebounding and but this is a game Clemson had to have two and four in a conference Road game against the one of the hottest teams in the ACC and here you go to Duke you know this was you never want to say its a mustwin game six games in the conference play but from a desperation stand Point Clemson needs to get this game Darren Green at the free throw line out of the timeout good on the first yeah for a team in Clemson that earlier this year ranked as high as 13th in the country net had been in the top 10 and in this slide right now but they have had close games even in their four ACC losses games that could have swung the other way certainly Tuesday against Georgia Tech heres a long ball for Josh Beetle on the the inbounds and Beetle gets his own Miss great job there punishing the pressure getting the ball over the top and thats what you want to do against pressure he wants to beat it and score and you dont always want to beat the pressure it didnt set up against this half court defense Spears through some contact and its a foul on the floor it goes against Josh Beetle its his first when youre talk about beating the pressure and then how Florida States probably going to defend this for the remaining 729 we said it they press you about as much as anyone in the entire country and thats just part of their identity coach am talked about it he said hey we want to I coach my guys on defense and I give them some structure on offense but I let them play but here you got a guard and just something that coach ham has designed and he needs healthy bodies to do do it and one thing that makes this team unique is that they have different guys like now usually Primo Spears backs up Jaylen warley but theyre in the game together right now and congratulations to Primo Spears on reaching a th000 points for his career career that started at Duane continued at Georgetown and now here at Florida State look at the high low action again with PJ Hall its just going to be too easy there with Spears on him Hall muscles it over him and its saying keep feeding me yeah just keep feeding run the middle ball screen theyre going to switch and hes going to punish the switch now theyre slowing the game down theyre going to come back in that zone and theyre going to identify and find green that was left open for Spears one of his hot spots yeah be at the top did not want to slide over and take the ball he saw green sitting up in the in the slot wanting that three ball and he left it open and great job our Primo Spears driver so lets talk through this and see if the ball screen comes at a switch or not Clarks up to get it now Gerard a deep one knocks it down what happened was Watson Watkins realized that that they had a guard on PJ Hall he tried to threeway switch it and they were late getting to Gerard and he punished him for three Watkins lobs it behind cam Corin and its a Florida State turnover yeah theres not much Spears can do there you just hope helps coming and BJ Hall gets it that late that time they will switch up he getting out late to Gerard and fourth in ACC history in career made threes was coming up on Dennis Scott entering todays action and now the lead is 11 for the Tigers Flyn Hill alone Gard driving on Corin turns it over his fourth turnover Spears in transition had it roll out and haul the rebound Gerard Callin for it Beetle keeps it and finishes love the aggression by Clemson they get numbers theyre still taking advantage of the pushing it now theyre falling back into their Applause Zone and as we talked about it before at shoot around this is you know you got to you got to challenge this fla State team this way Watton six of three only the fourth made three for Florida Applause State no Run and Jump just P cour pressure once you get it in Chase Hunter you identify that now again they know they know that theyre switching it you see again another Mis miscommunication Gerard oh in and Applause out Watkins moves it for Spears Gerard the rebound inside of 5 minutes to go and its a 10point lead for the Tigers I see no r no reason for Clemson to switch their action just continue to stagger away and try to get PJ Hall and some high low action in the middle of the floor hall sets a screen warley didnt switch it so its Corin on Hall and no foul called yeah they mixed it there they missed theyre trying to switch to guard on the PJ halling thats how Gerard has gotten the last couple of Threes I think they missed Beetle there turned over by Watkins right to Joe Applause Gerard very costly for Florida State trailing by 10 in the second half with Florida States offensive struggles this afternoon you feel like right now they have to dig deep right now get themselves back in this game and then Beetle turns it over after Worley had switched on the hall this time yeah there wont be enough possessions Clemsons going to you know Take the A out of the ball so you cant wait till under two minutes so you got to start digging in right now and down 10 4 minutes to go you got to get a good possession here try to speed him up create more turnovers like you just did there but wheres the offense going to come from at the key right now byan chap returns with 402 to go after sitting for the last 6 and 12 minutes with the four fou Miller the screen for green got the fly by cant Applause hits and then warley and Watkins went reaching for it and its a warley foul 10point Clemson lead on the road spurred by a big second half in Music Tallahassee Bravo you use the theres so many ways he can punish you tonight he hasnt settled at all I mean he sometimes when he goes out and shoot threes you feel you feel like hes doing you a favor he knows this Florida State team is going to switch hes taking those guards inside as you see there shaking his head like you cannot guard me and theres not a guard in the ACC or anywhere in the country that can stop him when he gets near the basketball its what hes averaged this season in points rebounds assists and blocks the only player in the entire country with a stat line just like that I mean hes playing at an allamerican level and hes the heart and soul and the glue to this team I think its just its been so consistent I think a year ago he was injured and he hobbling around on one leg just showing his toughness and this year hes finally healthy and hes just showing you what he can do and and when you play a game like Pro State they theyre going to force you to play Off Script you know your plays are designed you got to sometimes you just got to put the ball in your guys hand to say he guys is go play and Clemsons answered the bell and theyve done that for 30 36 and 36 minutes and 15 seconds so they see if they can play the last 346 and close it out pretty good on the Fly M there is J Beetle misses the first not bad I mean I went the way for what you expect private school we excelled in in athletics and academics childrens Mike monar Tire crew with you and Beetle misses B so still 345 as the mathematician told you in a 10point game heres Primo Spears hes got sheflin on him Spears off the bounce KN in and missed it great defense there by PJ Hall being able to challenge the shot that foul Spears was looking for contact there Beetle and the foul what a take by Josh Beetle and what a second half hes had great job breaking a press he kept his defender on his hip he intended to pull it out but the lane was so wide open he turned the corner you could tell this is taught Shield Watkins off jumps into Baba Miller so he cant block the shot finishes with the left delay there and had a chance at a and one great job there a great second half by Josh Beetle guy who was in a car accident in the preseason suffered a broken nose a concussion hed been playing well but then he was out for 3 weeks because of that came back had to wear a mask coaching staff thought he was maybe putting some pressure on himself but they think hes on the uptick now and today he has matched a career high with 10 points off the bench for the Tigers green gave it up for Miller move for warley back to Miller Applause HS great decision there bar warley caught it again knowing Baba Miller was on his left just one more pass and when Miller decides to step into a shot hes never going to see his Defender hes going to elevate and finish right over Applause top theres Gerard still with it with a shot clock down to 10 now Hall spins out of three Spears hits the gas pedal and then turns it over Florida state has been frustrated I think the previous possession he was trying to do that but he missed the lay and this time they was expecting him to go lay that up and just a little too much on it and Baba was expecting him to throw to L six of the 11 nolles turnovers have been in this second half for State last possession did a really good job of guarding the ball and pushing it out so they cant get to this high low action they want to get the ball in the middle of the screen floor and try to get get the high low PJ Darren Green fouls Josh Beetle goes back to the line where all season hes just seven of 15 including two of five today hes got a careerhigh 11 hey tonight 10 Eastern after this triple header the nothing but NE crew breaks down the day in the ACC with highlights Plus analis of every mens game and then a look ahead to the coming week right here on accn in the ESPN app a dozen for Josh Beetle tied for a team high with Chase Hunter got to go quick here you dont have to R the shot but you got cant wait long you got to attack Watkins draws a foul on sheflin whos done with 210 to go only 18 minutes from Ian shein one of the best rebounders in the ACC and he departs with 210 remaining if theres a step that this team can take I think its with those guys and some of the fouls I think Ian sheff and PJ Hall have to understand how important they are to this team and its great to have some depth and have guys like Jack Clark be available to him now and garrey coming in and and Chanty wiggers but those two guys need to be on the floor quite a bit and and and even the Ford coach brell the option of having one in the floor at all times and the other guys kind of shuffling and out of the lineup theyve had foul trouble issues doing this ACC play is something they need to sh up they get back to the team that we know reach the potential that we know they can be if they can finish out this game two1 to go up by a dozen what does it do for them for the rest of the year winning uncomfortably like you said you have to do here I would say this you never wanted to say this was a mustwin game but it really really was a difficult game must game I mean youre two and four in the ACC and coming into Florida State who as well as theyve been playing and then youre going in to do and thats not two games that you go in expecting to go two and0 so youre hoping one and0 and you prefer to get the first one now and it alleviates pressure for that game even though you play them all but you can ill afford to go two and six to start ACC play and get back in it and break the press as we tick under two to go with Clemson up by 10 Hunter nearly gave it up at Mid Court Halls calling for it face up on Baba Miller Hall spinning Clark nearly followed Miller pulls up for three cant hit and it belongs to kson its not over and and Clemsons got to try to press and force him turnover the problem with FSU is just their free throw shooting and their guard play they have all three of their their guard point guards on the court and PJ Hall can break the Press if needed and so can jack Clark so this difficult line up the pressure so many handlers on the court and one thing Id say about this game is too is refs going to check and make sure we need to want to take a look and make sure that they got the call right is FS we know FSU team is real but youve heard we talked on the practices and they coming in early and watching them practice they were upset getting on the guys they felt as though there was a little bit of complex you can see Stan Jones on the sideline jumping on those guys and he was jumping on them in practice telling these guys to get ready this team is coming in here with the level of desperation and give Clemson some credit they did but this will serve as a wake up called in a coaching moment for that TOA State group well they get right back to it Tuesday theyre at Syracuse a game you can watch on ESPN 2 and then home next Saturday Carolina comes here to the tuck for Florida State yeah I with the way theyve shot the ball from the perimeter I we you know I can assure you going to Syracuse Syracuse were going to see or is ran a lot of manto man and change things up but I bet theyre going to play quite a bit of Zone when we get up there think so oh Im pretty sure all right lets have a look at this the officials went to look initial signal was Clemson ball and from this does that still appear that its last Touch by Primo Spears to you I think it is I think its going Clemson think they got it right the first time and this is one thing I wish we could do in a game I I I wish we could have someone designate someone in scores table that has the Monitor and we can speed this up theres too many youre using this time its an extra time out and it happens so much that you know coaching wise you dont always need to even save timeouts because you get extra ones in minutes like this well its a good chance to remind you that we will get you to Georgia Tech as soon as were done here still 133 left on the game clock for the Cavaliers and the yellow jackets with Jay alter and Malcolm huckerby standing by Jay and Huck I told you guys no TV time for you guys Florida States playing in front of you buddy forget about it Joe Gerard gets fouled and hes going to the throw line 6 seconds came off the clock hey lets go back to Syracuse for 1 second there mentioned maybe some Zone yet again for the orange yeah how about quader Copeland today knocking down the game winning free against Miami just his seventh career made threepoint shot and its a gamewinner at the buzzer its one of those things its just its why winning is so hard you know you get out you throw that analytics throw all the data out just great shot he lined it up just great Drive Great kick its amazing what confidence does when youre shooting the basketball and hes a guy who doesnt mind drawing the ey of his opponents no he will talk he was talking at the free throw line with opponents during the game as well and he backed it up with a game winner deficit a dozen for the noes and Watkins got bumped and fouled by Clark let me give you another one in the TC for your deakes deari man Santo returned Wake Forest they won convincingly he was on a pitch count today they said it would be about 10 minutes was 11 and he still knocked down four threes what does he do for Wake four I think with that rotation they were already a back court strength is in the back court but with punis and bopy Miller and HRI now you add him in Im sorry hey hun Al H and so having that three guard lineup and then have him in sanso come with that depth and hes just an offici efficient shooter hes a great threepoint shooter and what a luxury yeah you know Im not going to jinx it so dont get me talking about it now Im just going to ride this wave with the decks until it gets to a certain point then Im going to come out there and talk trash to all you guys to Joel and Boo and you know coach beheim in there Studio Hancock all these guys yeah Im talking trash to all of them Im just going to sit quiet wait my time and then Im going come and talk trash with you guys Clemson breaks the pressure again and Darren Green commits the foul so 110 to go and Clemson trying to get back on track having dropped four of its last five so big win gutsy win Clemson has to get back to defending they did that tonight theyre going to score points but defensively tonight and more importantly they answer the bell with the toughness and rebounding theyve dominated the seminal on the glass they plus 15 winning is hard but winning on the road is really hard and not many teams have come in here and will come in here and get Applause wins let me ask you this about their defense as Brad Brownell said to us today at shootter around we need better habits defensively he said we havent been as smart as I would think that we would be and he said were struggling to guard the ball you got the midweek by and then you get Duke next weekend what do you do to fix those things are those things fixable or is your personnel your personel well the mental arrows are sometimes like scouting repord ER its just saying hey example Mike Monaco is not a jump shooter so we dont need to clothes out short to him so if you close out on him and he drives you those are the mistakes that this team has made and keep guarding the basketball and keeping it out in front of you is just something you have to do you theres so many drills you can run and theres so much you can do end of the day you got to step up and you got to do it if you want to win in this league some of that is an issue and I think some of even with for a guy like Joe Gerard I mean youre talking about playing zone for minutes and and we go to another this about the last thing this game needed told you is a clock issue with a minute left in a 10point game yeah its its one of those things I wish someone there would just you can blow the whistle and but before the refs get over there they would have already looked at it kind of told them where the ball went fouls on whoever and speed it up its just and I get if I was coaching I would do the same thing just go to the monitor gives me a chance to it gives me a free time out and these are longer than usual timeouts I Music mean big game here for Clemson on the road trying to get that third ACC win hey while were pontificating about all number of time next year can I get one off my chest too about the net oh so the net right it the coaches in this league are are fed up with it and I think rightly so in a lot of ways and theres a lot of issues with the net and how they dont know exactly the formula that goes into it scoring margin is capped however many points you win by at a certain level it doesnt Factor anymore into the net rank they take a second off the clock here so instead of a minute left theres 59 seconds left so scoring margin is capped on the net but efficiency isnt offensive efficiency defensive efficiency coaches in this league are not pleased with that and its part of the frustration for them and Clemson knows that from last year and what happened as Hall gets fouled and I think thats something that as you think about a Wake Forest team that is scary like they were a couple of years ago or a Clemson team that last year wins 23 games overall and 14 in the ACC right I think that is something worth saying here about the de not because I dont want to get fired I love my job and I think no C no no Im just expressing what the coaches feel its frustrating because again I think the the best way I can describe it without everyone you know blowing my Twitter up and saying things I think its we need to figure out the formula so we can explain to coaches so coaches can change their schedule so they know how to schedule games now you cant control scheduling games and teams lose but theres a way of do I load up and play high major teams or do I play a bunch of low major teams and beat them by 50 you know you talk about sportsmanship and so many things of that nature and um it brings into a lot of things I think the main thing the coaches want to know is what do I need to do to help me schedule teams so I can win and I think thats the biggest disparity for them do I schedule other power five power six whatever conferences I need to do or do I schedule you know as many low Majors as possible and beat them by 30 or 40 so uh I I think thats the simplest way I can say it that from a coaching perspective of that why they want to know what to do arguing with fans about it and all the analytics I get out of here Im not doing it but I think I think worth going off topic a bit on that as hson turns it over up by nine here 40 seconds to go Ls race back up court with warley to the corner a three in the air two strong from Watkins and then Hall nearly turned it over Hunter the exclamation and that should just about do it here at the tuck so Clemson comes on the road and gets back on on track fork in the road game in Tallahassee and the tigers are victorious again tough greedy win by Clemson he came in they wh stood the foul trouble that they sustained early in the first half came out dominated the second half inside got their bigs going took care of the basketball controlled the paint which is not not easy to do against Florida State team great job by the CL Titans 7867 is the final and Clemsons got
