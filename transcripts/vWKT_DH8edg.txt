The Tarheelss and the Eagles NC Central at 1 and three coming off their first win of the season just two nights ago trying to shock the world and shock Hubert Daviss Tarheelss who win the opening tip And heres Ken Evans the junior from Kansas City transfer from Colorado State at the point Along the baseline attacking the rim and being fouled is Caleb Wilson North Carolina Central going to play a lot of zone here tonight trying to keep their center Cory Carvey out of foul trouble trying to contain this front line of North Carolina and North Carolina saw a lot of zone in that game against Radford the other night So got some real good reps against that two3 zone But Caleb Wilson along that baseline Doug the combination of he and and Vasar the way that they have played in tandem has been so good Its been vintage North Carolina two bigs high low basketball in and out on the second on the offensive glass Jiren Stevenson and they bring it back out And I get the sense Chris in watching the first three games of the season this Carolina team really fits The parts fit together And thats what you talk about with the two bigs in a classic Carolina way One of the new pieces weve talked about number 44 Luca Boavox the junior from Montenegro Five of 19 from three coming into this game So hasnt shot it as well as I think everybody expected but he is starting to heat up and he will not stop shooting Harvey on the turnaround No Wilson the rebound and he will dribble up every opportunity he gets Be hard to go oneonone against that size of Vasar at 7 ft The Bucks has it knocked away The Eagles have the basketball and the foul is called against Carolina Yeah thats the one area turnovers have been the one one real issue for North Carolina and its its in the vein of you know kind of careless like Boabotss there just kind of dribbling into traffic and then dribbling it off his leg And if this were practice yesterday here at the Dean Dome as Latimore knocks down his first shot from the floor For every turnover yesterday in practice as we saw Chris Carolina ran and thats one of the big points of emphasis for Hubert Davis early in the season Weve got to take care of the basketball High post BSR Stevenson cut off back to Basr The Arizona transfer misses his first shot One and done for Carolina Here comes Deontay Johnson Allconference point guard for NC Central Engage Latimore is going to be defended differently with the numbers hes been putting up lately Well especially with the guys around him Theyve had a hard time scoring outside of Latimore and Carvey Theres one of the guys whos been struggling to start the year Kyrick Davis a senior from Americas Georgia Carolina going end to end quickly as they do And weve got a foul 1744 to go here in the first half Two areas where North Carolina has excelled to start this year Doug in transition Their ability to push and thats the one area with Seth Seth Trimble out you take that you know that other ball handler off the floor but their ability to change ends and that guy has been outstanding changing from one end to the other They have been really fast in transition And then their offensive rebounding theyre averaging about 15 offensive rebounds a game They had 16 offensive rebounds in that win over Kansas rebounding about 40 of their misses That team in 2017 that won the national title rebounded 41 that led the nation So they are right there in terms of the rebounding team that Hubert Davis was looking for Pressure broken Good recovery by Basar to swat it out of bounds Hes been a differencemaker for them You know theyre protecting their basket Certainly on the glass Hes played with an edge cheering Cory Carvey creating space Sandy lays it in Hes the one true big on this roster for Lavel Motton He is And and thats you know thats a little bit of why theyre in so much zone so far this year trying to keep him out of foul trouble Well hes a legit 69 Played two years at the junior college level I think was at Morehead State last year and transferred into North Carolina Central this season Off of the Basar turnover the Eagles give it right back Carolina gets it with 1723 remaining in the first Well defensively NC Central has struggled so far this season Opponent shooting 41 from beyond the threepoint line Evans spots up Here comes Gage Latimore Leads the Mak in scoring at 24 points per game Wilson with a head of steam right down the lane He has it blocked Evans throws it up and Caleb Wilson throws it down He just hunts that dunker cheering spot And Evans has gotten so good when he gets to that point in the paint knowing that Wilsons going to be there and just throwing it up by the rim Johnson pass handling the basketball beautifully and finding Carvey for another layup And you blink and cheering Carolinas got it in the other basket at the other end Pogabox makes it 107 and thats on a made basket And Lamel Molton yesterday in practice I mean he could not have stressed it enough Its not just on misses Carolina they are pushing off of made baskets cheering Johnson with the basketball The lone returning starter for NC Central been a couple of years at Maryland Eastern Shore a MAK rival of NC Central Harvey denied And here come the Tarheelss again with numbers four on two Offensive foul against Bayasar And that takes us to break after his first personal Theres a viciousness to Caleb Wilsons dunks music He is bringing the hammer Putting some stank on it off of the pass from Ken music Evans And the history just oozes out of this building Its a thrill to come in here every single time Chris it is every time I come in here get get goosebumps Its one of the iconic buildings in our sport Number of moments that have been had in here You cannot write the history of college basketball without the Smith Center And before it Carmichael Auditorium now Carmichael Arena which is home to the womens basketball program Every chance I get I walk through that building again to get the sense that this is where Michael played This is where Big Smooth played This is where Worthy played Very cool to be in this basketball environment Nearly 5 minutes gone here at the Smith Center with Chris Pollola Im Doug Sherman nonconference game between regional rivals North Carolina Central from nearby Durham here in Chapel Hill taking on the Tarheels And here comes Caleb Wesson Look out below I mean how many breaks has he led here tonight And and North Carolina Central refusing to stop the ball when Caleb Wilson has it in his hands He has one thing in mind attacking the paint in the rim Shot clock down to seven Tough shot for Kyrick Davis Offensive rebound Back out to Johnson the allconerence point guard Dangerous pass Dunn gets blocked by Beasar his second of the night cheering Somebodys got to stop the ball and I mean thats a heck of a move but its also defensively you just kind of lunging Thats not defense You see that in a bull fighting ring but thats the thing that has impressed me the most Doug about Wilson When he gets within 3 ft of the basket he is going to dunk and he will go through your body to do it Well his game against Kansas was really the coming out party for the country to realize Everything youve heard about him is true 24 points seven rebounds four assists and steals Only Walter Davis Michael Corin and Kobe White in the history of Carolina basketball have done that And that was just his second collegiate basketball game traveling violation Fletchi Aquaro with the turnover Deonte Johnsons got to take that to the basket I mean oneonone He got himself into the paint Nobody at the basket Just just attack and go to finish Throwing that out to Kletchi He doesnt know what to do with it out there on the perimeter Derek Dixon the freshman guard from Vienna Virginia to Zayen High the red shirt sophomore big from San Antonio have checked into the game for Carolina Heres Wilson on the wing Jonathan Powell has also come in number 11 in white Wilson off the hesitation Nine points make it 10 points for Caleb Wilson to start this ball game Carvin first miss from downtown Wilson attacks the ball wide open JP Jonathan Powell for three Thats the mo for the West Virginia transfer He can shoot the basketball from deep Nine unanswered points for the Tarheelss who take a doubledigit lead as they are playing a an HBCU a historically black university in NC Central He said Actually before my basketball trajectory took off I did think about going to an HBCU DCU But once it became apparent that he was one of the better basketball players in the country he changed his direction a bit Hes a very serious student He has a plan with his mother that once he leaves Carolina presumably after this year to go to the NBA he will start taking classes online and hopes to have his degree by the time hes 30 Vladimir Johnson Good close out by High Carolina with another rebound Dixon wide open for three Tequo Carpenter dribbles up and hands it off to Johnson for the last time we saw Deontay Johnson Wednesday night in the win over Division 2 Bluefield State He went flying into the basket stansion at their home arena and uh he left the game for a while Came back in Seems to be no worse for him Makes a great pass there Karby gets it back out to Latimore Two to shoot Going to have to fire and Molton joke with us yesterday saying you know if the layup had gone in Johnson would have popped right up could have been fine There he is fighting for the basketball Gets it away from Caleb Wilson Central with it Vladimore lost it on the way up applause and gives it back to Carolina Third Davis Lavel Motton is he is an institution in this area Grew up in he was actually born in Boston but but grew up in Raleigh Was raised by his mother and his grandmother went to Enlo High School in Raleigh then ultimately to North Carolina Central So hes coaching at his alma mater He won two championships as a player at Central Hes won eight championships as a coach there Hes had a lot of offers to go elsewhere man And hes just so loyal Hes loyal to that school to this area Hes so well connected Hes an institution in this area Hes a good man right there Lavel mot and you know when he was a start enl high school in Raleigh he would come to this building and watch practice because hes cousins with Donald Williams the former Tarheelss great and so hed sit in the stands and watch Dean Smith run practice and he would play pickup with the Carolina players He told us a story yesterday about being on the same pickup team with Michael Jordan and he said nobody wants to be on Michaels team in pickup because hes going to get double teamed in a close game and pass it to you and expect you to make the shot and if you dont make the shot thats trouble Well one time he did get the pass from MJ made the shot and the best part of it for Lavel Motton was MJ immediately screamed at a boy bell like wait a second you know my name It is amazing the stories he has to tell It is Well he he is hes just a good man and hes really going through it with with you know the finances and cheering the economics the way they are in college basketball right now You know North Carolina Central was the only NAK school to opt out of of the players share So you know hes having to deal with that cheering but he has stayed true and loyal to North Carolina Central and to this area and hes really really well respected cheering Twotime MAK coach of the year in his 17 years as head coach four times Hes taken his alma mater to the NCAA tournament Grant Hill came and spoke to his players earlier this season made a donation to the program and you mentioned his mom Hattie McDougall Little under the weather Couldnt make it to tonights game but is watching at home Hello mom Your sons team is down 19 to9 Caleb Wilson fouled on the shot Hell head back to the free throw line Second foul on Cory Carvey The one player Motton cant afford to have foul trouble on as the freshman out of Holy Innocence Episcopal School makes the first This is our Tuesday mens basketball double header The man at the line Caleb Wilson in number 18 North Carolina will host Navy 7 Eastern And then Donnie Freeman and Cayenne Anthony lead Syracuse music against Monmouth Both are also available on the allnew ESPN app Ryan Archie into the game One of the players Revel Motton had hopes for coming into the year Could be maybe their number three player and contributor on the offensive end He gives it back outside Battle for three Those are the kind of shots that you know theyre going to have to hit here tonight Carolinas not helping I mean theyre allowing Archie to just kind of dribble You know its interesting with with Seth Trimble you know obviously you lose that other ball handler alongside Ken Evans You also lose his rebounder I mean he was their leading rebounder in that Kansas win Had eight rebounds Hes hes one of the best rebounding guards in the country and then obviously his leadership You just feel horrible for for Seth Trimble fouryear player going down with an injury like that And again if theres good news they expect him to be back around the holidays somewhere around Christmas or New Years And that would align with the start of ACC play for Carolina They open up conference play on the 30th of December Heres Latimore number 11 in black is averaging against ACC opponents this year 22 and a half points per game Against Virginia and NC State 20 and 25 points with his foot on the line Carvey misses and here comes Caleb Wilson Shows you how much Lavel Motton needs Carvey in the game with the two fouls He keeps him in the game You were mentioning Gage Latimore Its quite a story I mean he only averaged 10 points a game at Division 2 Seat Hill last year Now he did shoot a good good percentage but to come out of the gates he gave NC State 20 gave UVA 25 and then goes for 38 the other night I mean he is just hes filling it up That 38 is a program record in the Division One era NC Central moved up to D1 in 2011 Up above the rim again is Caleb Wilson 13 points for the sensational freshman cheering Well the last time out in the win over Radford on Tuesday he only had 13 points and 14 rebounds Detel with some foul trouble Good answer at the other end by Archie Copen State transfer who put up some good numbers last year Has yet to find his rhythm for Central this year KEN EVANS who has been setting everybody else up has his first three points of the night Thats the other area Doug Carolina has not shot it well yet from three as a team but you know that its in there You know Jiren Stevenson Jonathan Pal havent shot it well Luca Bovots has not shot it well percentagewise yet but you know its coming Left it short Another good sign for the Tar Heels tonight Theyve made nine baskets Chris They have nine assists JSR hands it off Stevenson gives it up to Evans That pass there It was You understand the basketball on Tobacco Road And its its different in the MAK than it is in the ACC but they care just the same They sure do And theres great tradition at North Carolina Central basketball tradition Were talking Lavel Molton has his number retired there Sam Jones And theyre at you know Centrals at this point in their season where they got to make money You know they they got to go out and play these by games So I mean theyve played this will be their third ACC team theyve played in five games cheering Well he calls it the money tour We are on the money tour at North Carolina State at Virginia at North Carolina Still to come trips to Dayton Penn State and Kentucky Foul on the shot and heading to the free throw line Jonathan Powell And this is the nature of being a low major division one team where you have to raise money to help fund not only the basketball program but the rest of the athletic department And so every school negotiates a different number And the presumption from the big boy is that youll come well pay you part of our gate but were pretty much assured of getting a win And thats the tradeoff but physically it can be terribly demanding for Lavel Mottons players And he specifically pointed out his one big guy Cory Carvey who just potentially takes a beating as the only big guy trying to match up against bigger taller faster stronger players Well it impacts how you practice because youre not able to practice the way you want to because you have to preserve your guys you know playing against these these bigger stronger athletes youre playing against at this point in the season and the season just got started 10 to shoot Just over six minutes to go in cheering the first half From the right wing Battle makes his second triple of the night Give him eight points Well an attending practice here yesterday in the shoot around this afternoon Little high low action This time its Wilson who delivers the pass Theyre just putting one of those bigs in the middle of that zone and then just turn face and throw it up to the rim First two points of the night for Henry Vas are the Arizona transfer Spent the last three years in Tucson now flourishing Coach Shawn May the assistant on staff for Hubert Davis spending a lot of time to help develop that game Roundo Battle says I can go inside as well Hes got 10 points to lead North Carolina Central Hopefully this gets Battle going is one of those guys that you know they were hoping hed be a little bit better Its been a slow start to the year Stevenson misses Wilson swaps it into the front row Well North Carolina Centrals been in a two3 zone for much of the night North Carolina just plopping those bigs right at the foul line and then just turn face and lob it up to the rim That is tremendous size on that front line 610 Vasar is a legit seven feet cheering And hes got an edge to him You know theres a little bit of an edge that Vasar has shown in the early part of this year And you know he is sunbathing as Battle now has 12 points The former Evansville ace Basar is a type of guy who tries to dunk absolutely everything Hes looking to dunk on your head You said yesterday that his cheering and applause most favorite dunk of all time came in the exhibition game when he dunked on one of his opponents He really has like you say an edge about his play on both ends of the floor Well I think Doug you know he was thrust into a starting role last year at Arizona when Mo Kas got injured at the beginning of the year I I think coming here to North Carolina I think the added responsibility and the added minutes He only played about 21 minutes a game last year at Arizona The added minutes its all been good for Henry Vasar cheering Hes taken on that responsibility been an emotional leader and hes been incredibly productive to start the year Latimore misses the runner Wilson grabs another miss cheering And even in those 21 minutes per game for Arizona last year he was highly productive Nine and a half points five and a half rebounds All Big 12 conference honorable mention for a team that went to the Sweet 16 And dont look now Hubert Davis is not going to be happy about the ninth turnover committed by Carolina turned into points at the other end by Archie Up above the rim again its another assist by Evans give two more points to Wilson applause 15 in counting for the 610 freshman from Atlanta cheering Vladimore blocked They have done a good job Carolina has holding him in check Vlatimore went for 38 points two nights ago He is stuck on three so far tonight here in Chapel Hill North Carolina And the Eagles of North Carolina Central are hanging around Theyve already got a careerhigh off the bench from Rondo Battle with 12 What are the Tarheelss not doing that allows NC Central to stay close Chris Well I the Battles hit some shots with some contested shots I I just theres a little bit of a malaise that has crept in with North Carolina towards the end of this half You know you build those those types of leads and just a little bit sluggish here to to put Central away And I think Centrals done a nice job Doug of taking the air out of the basketball Wilson is putting together a performance of note 17 points eight rebounds so far Oh and its almost all dunks Heres Latimore Hes a lefthander driving right Aquaro off the back iron Its another rebound for Wilson That is his ninth Closing in on a double double in the first half Good look from the corner Basar throws it down Central Timeout NC Central A good answer coming out of that last break by North Carolina This has been a prototype Carolina break this year Nice penetration Two feet in the paint by Evans Really good find over the top Stevenson keeps his discipline in the corner to take that three And then you clean up the offensive glass there with Vasar You know thats where Doug theyre getting that spacing on the break by running those wings to the corners Youve got threepoint shooters that have a gravity to them and then youve got Vasar and Wilson crashing the offensive glass Its been a good formula so far this year A roster construction roster retention are such a big thing in college basketball now Carolina last February added an alumnus in Jim Tanner class of 1990 the new executive director and general manager Third turnover by the Eagles Gives it back to UNC ASR has it poked away Another turnover by Carolina Sloppy Youre not going to be able to float that You got to put a little mustard on that and assume that Vasar is going to be able to catch that Just too soft a pass Aquar Basar Taps it out Carolina the basketball Powell is fouled by Ryan Archie Central Ryan Archie Thats his third Third foul on Ryan Archie the red shirt sophomore out of Win Park High School Clinton Maryland He will go out I think the the zone for Central has made Carolina take some time taking some air out of it in the half court And on the other end Centrals been willing to take that shot clock down under 10 each possession and its just kind of taken some of the you know the sense of urgency taking some of the air out of the building Its some of the life towards the end of this half out of out of Carolina a little bit But if youre Carolina you cannot allow that to happen You have to combat that No question Were now getting into an area a psychology of the game Doug that I think all coaches are dealing with Yeah Ive told coaches for decades now I would never trade places with them applause and cheering Well this is one of the ways you can energize your team is putting on a little fullcourt press after the free throw and a nice execution of that trap Powell Wilson Evans Bayasar and back into the game number 44 Luca Bogots whos had a quiet night so far Just over a minute to go in the half Evan splits the double team goes down the lane and lays it in A beautiful move for the Colorado State transfer applause Well he really developed at Colorado State under head coach Nico Medbed now at Minnesota and Ali Faro Manesh who you remember from his NCA tournament heroics for Northern Iowa back in 2010 cheering and Ken Evans really took off in last years NCA tournament and found himself as a coveted person in the transfer court I thought during the exhibition the two exhibition games I thought he was thinking too much understandably so Hes making a lot of money Hes here at North Carolina which is you know no slight to Colorado State Its not North Carolina Hes playing more instinctively Hes getting better and better and it is his show now especially with Seth Seth Trimble out of the lineup VSR seemed to grab a little bit of the jersey and got caught doing it That is his second personal foul So now Felicia will head to the free throw line Senior from the Bronx He started the season opener for NC Central at North Carolina State Now coming off the bench for Label Mo That is his first point And like so many players in this day and age hes a twotime transfer Played his freshman year at Austin P cheering and then his sophomore year at Maryland Eastern Shore This is his second year in Durham at North Carolina Central Timeout called by Powell with the shot clock off 24 seconds remaining in the first half Two and a half minutes They they have put it back on Central Bogots Evans Powell Wilson and Henry Vasar The five on the floor for North Carolina Evans facing the two3 zone Evans attacks Howell No air ball Basar tries to corral 3 seconds Two seconds The heave from midcourt comes after the horn and they will head to the locker room The Tarheelss with a 15point lead cheering Thought Central did a nice job getting back too Doug Keeping Carolina out of transition Well see This first five minutes will be interesting to see the energy that North Carolina music comes out with Lavel Motton and his Eagles all in for Onyx tonight on a special night in Chapel Hill But all in check only three points He came in averaging well over 20 and had 38 two nights ago for the Eagles We have a foul call on the block shot by Wilson The baseline official Les Jones is not the most popular person in the Dean Dome right now Well theres a travel first and then Yeah I like the call but he he had to walk in order to get to the spot Caleb Wilson the coookie and coplayer of the week in the ACC sharing both awards with Virginia Tech Supernova Neo Abdul cheering who put 33 on Providence Weve got a lot of bright freshman stars in the Atlantic Coast Conference right now We sure do How about Mike Brown Jr in that game cheering against Kentucky Cookies for the crowd here at the Dean Dome off of two missed free throws by an opponent People just love free stuff There were hot dogs flying over us in the first half They could have been giving away pencils Free pencils People would have gone bananas Sloppy pass Stevenson able to recover Davis nearly took it away Good recovery to find Bogots for three Been a quiet night for the junior from Montenegro Hes got eight cheering Has Carolina done anything special defensively against Gage Latimore tonight Chris No I I just think I mean you saw the shots Doug He was hitting against Bluefield State deep A lot of them contested and hes a good shooter Hes not that level of player and and so I think hes come back down to earth a little bit Theyve had a number of different guys on him and they have they have certainly played him farther out than teams have played him so far this year And as he mentioned us yesterday after practice for NC Central in the game against Bluefield State it was the first time this season he has stepped out well beyond the threepoint line And with that Carolina has as you said extended its defense tonight Nice lefty finish by Cory Carvey Hes a good player Carvey Hes really skilled Really good size and length Good feel for the game Six points three rebounds He comes in averaging 16 points and nine and a half per game cheering The story continues to be number eight in white Caleb Wilson Give him 20 So much of North Carolinas ceiling this year will be tied to how good Caleb Wilson can be And you saw it in that Kansas game when he went out in that first half in that game They were not the same team Another rejection by Carolina This time the help defender Jiren Stevenson leads to a wide open three Quickly back the other way The Eagles get it to Davis who tries to back his way into the lane up and over Bogavots Its an air ball Kyan Evans has his pass deflected out of bounds And again Hubert Davis is livid on the Carolina sideline at another deflected pass I mean first of all you shouldnt leave him Obviously confusion defensively but how about I mean the dribble pulls up sets his feet and he is showing you the entire kickback here tonight Good ball movement to find Evans stepping into a three Bogots gets the long rebound Heres Wilson again They close out a little better and he gives up the basketball VSR high low Wilson kicks it out and the foul on the pass from behind Thatll go against Rando Battle the second You know the one thing with with Vasar hes hes incredibly skilled Hes been very good tonight in that two3 zone at the foul line but hes also been really good so far this year on a short roll and and a lot of it having to do with his size He can just see over the top and hes a very good passer whos got great vision because of that length Evans down the lane hangs in the air He was hit in the head and well head to the free throw line to shoot two Well Saturday morning at 10 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be at Pit to get you ready for another full day of football with a 2hour pregame show right here on ACCN and the allnew ESPN app Foul number three on Cory Carvey has Evans at the line Carolina once again playing without it senior leader Seth Trimble who suffered a broken bone in his left forearm back on the 9th of November Hes expected to miss roughly 6 weeks give or take So that has him coming back around Christmas or New Years which if that is the case allows him to be ready for the start of ACC play on December 30th against Florida State But they will be without him against Michigan State against Kentucky against Georgetown and against Ohio State probably A lot of big nonconference games They certainly would love to have him applause Well you never know Doug Like this is one of those things Guy goes down you you can sometimes find somebody Obviously theres going to be more minutes for other guys Who steps into that void Sometimes you can find someone I am wondering are we not signing casts anymore like why is his cast just you know blank white We were not sharping that thing up anymore I agree with you and you strike me as the kind of kid growing up on Long Island By throws it down as a kid on Long Island you went through several casts Several casts and you get them all signed You know some people write dirty things on them and you got to laughter cant go home with that I think we should bring that up to Vladimir pulls the trigger over Basar for three Well he is as confident as they come Basar fouled at the other end And if that is on Carvey thats his fourth Heres the clean cast Youre right And I had seen that yesterday and today It didnt even occur to me There needs to be stuff drawn on it I mean just just a blank slate there I mean you theres a lot of ways you can go also digging the stylish specs on on Trimble Indeed Chris that was the fourth foul on Harley as the spectacle Seth Trimble looks on Look at those things Thats a stylish man over there Ive been impressed by what weve seen the uh two games and then couple of practices we have attended that hes still very much involved very much in a leadership role in a cheerleader role and hes able cheering to keep himself in shape because the bone that is broken is in his forearm Its below the elbow So he can run and do other things so that when the cast comes off whether its clean or not he should be able to have a pretty quick recovery after that How inside Wilson passing up good shots for great shots Just cant cash it in Already on a double double Wilson lost it on the way up and then the foul comes in the lane Carolina dominating in the paint here tonight against NC Central 11 rebounds mean that he now has double doubles on consecutive games The first freshman to do that for Carolina since Dron Sharp five years ago And it seems like we could spend the entire two hours talking about all of the different people within Carolina basketball history that he has already put himself up along He is what every NBA front office is looking for you know that guy that you can plug in to any position and the offensive numbers there obviously pop but but what he does defensively and the versatility that he gives North Carolina the ability to to switch out and guard really any position Hes just got you know hes got so so many winning intangibles that you know a player of that level to come in with its incredibly impressive Well if you just read his words on paper you might not fully gather the type of young man he is but he says Im here to make myself a legend and win a bunch of games I mean who says that coming in But at this point just four games in you got to think well hes only going to be here for one season almost certainly but would you count against him putting his name up in the Raptors with the other guys Maybe recovery by Wilson cheering Nothing but net from the corner for Jonathan Powell the threepoint specialist from Centerville Ohio Hes now got nine points He and Vasar both have nine to go along with Wilsons 20 And I know Im probably getting way ahead of myself in terms of hanging banners in Raptors four games into a career but its really ridiculous some of the things hes done offensively And I do find interesting over five minutes gone here in the second criteria to get yourself honored up in the rosters To be honored youve got to be a first or second team allAmerican or ACC player of the year or final four most outstanding player MVP of an NCA championship team or win an Olympic gold medal applause Could he do one of those things He could certainly do a couple of those things Now hes fouled on the way to the basket Latimore caught with his hand in the cookie jar And thats the thing Doug like you say well hes doing this against North Carolina Central The fact of the matter is he did this against BYU in that exhibition game Went toetotoe with AJ Debatza and then was the best player on the floor for the majority of that game You know he and Darren Peterson in that Kansas game So he has done it against high level competition applause and hes a really hard worker We havent talked about his passing that much but hes a very good passer His coach calls him an elite passer Who got shooter No Who got shooter North Carolina Central picked to finish fifth in the MAK this year Tough sledding inside once again for McFarland 13th rebound for Wilson Carolina gets from one end to the other just as quickly as anybody Well and a lot of it has to do Doug you youre a lot of times youre as fast as your as your first big down cuz that big is is drawing everybody to the paint and is flattening out the defense And the one thing that Carolina when they have been at their best in transition and and you know Ive had the opportunity to scout Carolina the two things that you were always that kept you up at night was how fast they were and it started with their bigs and then whoever was you know playing point guard for them and then their ability to offensive rebound But theyre bigs Whoever that first big is down is running right to the front of the rim And those guards have their head up and they are looking And when you say you have scouted them youre talking about your days on staff at Duke Yes So you were able to say to Coach K These are the things we have to do cant do must do against Carolina Yeah and he would listen uh rarely but after having just picked up his fourth foul knocks down the midrange It was those two things transition the glass and Tyler Hansbury who was in my time the player who dominated his scouting report more than anything He is the eighth and most recent applause Carolina player to have his jersey retired here in this building Zayen High now with five points off the bench for the Tarheelss Yeah its going to be tougher with players not staying around typically as long We saw differently with Armando Bot and RJ Davis who did stay much longer but the way college basketball is now we may not have another retired jersey up there for quite some time That doesnt mean theres not going to be talent coming through Chapel Hill And you talked about it Chris in the first half As we take a look and show you some of the requirements to get your jersey retired here at Carolina you feel like there are elements of this team that are classic Carolina Yes no question cheering Hyo out of the secondary break big to big passing dominating the offensive glass the speed and the ability to shoot I mean that you know that was the other thing like you know whether it was Harrison Barnes you go down the line and they always had that guy that in transition much like this version of North Carolina that was running to that line and ready to fire And Ken Evans has done a nice job pushing pushing the tempo pushing the floor playing with his head up cheering Its where you go down the line whether it was Tai Lawson Kendall Marshall I mean during the years I was over there I mean it just the like they were playing on ice skates Looked cheering like from here Evans was the last to touch but the officials confer and say the Tarheelss will keep Coach Mottons on the other side of the cheering floor Yeah thats what I thought I saw too Lay on could have challenged Pal gets beaten The help defender comes over and picks up the foul The personal against Zaden High is his second I dont know about you Chris but I when I see a player who really excites you like we do out of Caleb Wilson I I try to think who does he remind me of And I dont know if you have anyone off the top of your mind who you say Caleb Wilson is similar to cheering You sound like you have somebody Well no Im going to refer to Roy Williams who was asked this question and he says Marvin Williams and thats not just the basketball component Thats the way Marvin was on campus with other students outside of the basketball facility Get out Get out Yeah I I see a lot of similarities I mean obviously its high praise Marvin Williams what was he number two pick in the draft I mean he he was terrific But there are you know the versatility the the size the length the athleticism Theres a good look at the freshman guard Derek Dixons first three points applause I asked Juber Davis yesterday the same question Does Caleb Wilson remind you of any former Tarheels And he said really no Hes one of one But then he thought about it and says there are elements cheering of what Harrison Barnes had going on as both a player and as a student here at Carolina And thats pretty good praise being compared to those two types of guys And that will continue for Caleb Wilson This is Ryan Archie Hes played a bigger role off the bench tonight for the Eagles than he has the last couple of games only got into garbage time on Wednesday in the win over Bluefield State cheering But again he put up some big numbers at Coppen State on the Mak All rookie team a couple of years ago Went for as many as 26 in a game Perhaps he could emerge as the number three scorer this year for Lavel Mutton There he is Try it for the steal Knocks it out of bounds And that takes staff Four of seven in the second And all four of these threes from four different guys So it shows you the you know the number of different shooters that they can put out there at one time Came into this game have not gotten it going yet but this is one of those games obviously a huge differential in opponent but this is one of those games you hope maybe you come out of this getting into a little bit of a rhythm shooting the basketball How big a part of Carolinas offense does its threepoint shooting need to be Well I think its designed you know the spacing is is designed with those shooters in mind and and obviously if teams have to guard those perimeter shooters its going to help your spacing driving the basketball etc Another good look from the corner Powell missed it Dixon turned down the contested three Drives and finds the open man on the right one Good decision there as Jiren Stevenson sticks it for his first three of the night They really got to get him going You know he can go really quiet He He is one of those guys He can be really loud or really quiet He missed practice on Wednesday because of a rolled ankle on Tuesday against Radford Practice normally yesterday and he did come back into the Radford game and finish with 15 points So you got the indication he was going to be okay Coach Davis says hes just fine How drive and dish tries to reverse but missed it Here comes Archie Stevenson was just sizing him up cheering Now he gets it back End to end A rim run after a block shot Five quick points for Jiren Stevenson I think if youre Hubert Davis what youre looking at looking youre looking to get from Stevenson youre looking to get from Pal for them to be the same guy every game Consistency Okay Heat Heat Jiren Stevenson was a top 50 recruit a couple of years ago out of C4th High School in Pitts North Carolina Spent his first couple of years at Alabama playing as a parttime starter for Nate Oats Now he is home in his hometown of Chapel Hill and showing signs here in the second half that its a good move for him He is showing a little bit of life You know he he and Jonathan Pal have the reputation as shooters And when you see yourself strictly as a shooter if its not going in you know the question becomes how do you impact the game in other ways cheering And I think with both those guys they havent shot it as well at the start of this year And its taken a little bit of their juice you know a little bit of that confidence Takes the bump and will head to the line Farro with the personal foul This is our Tuesday mens basketball double header Caleb Wilson and the 18th Frank Tarheelss will host Navy at 7 Eastern Then Donnie Freeman Kayen Anthony and Syracuse take on Monmouth Both are also available on the allnew ESPN app as Vasar shoots two In the most recent mock draft put out by ESPN Vasar was projected as a midsec round pick He could be here longer than that And you see guys come back to college now with all the money thats being made in NIL if youre a second round projected pick Often times you come back and make more at school Either cheering way he has continued to emerge as an NBA prospect Foul off the ball 16 foul on the Eagles The next will put Carolina in the bonus Third foul on Jonathan Dunn Logox returns and Stevenson takes a seat the hometown boy whose mom Nicole Walker Stevenson played on three ACC tournament champs for Carolina The legendary head coach Sylvia Hatro son takes a seat Tell you what the turnovers so far have cleaned up dramatically after Carolina coughed it up 10 times in the first half And you know I will jinx them here None so far in the second half Chris corner three Dixon and the follow slam by Vasar cheering Nice push by Evans to start that nice run to the corner by Dixon and then theres that big BAR cleaning cleaning up that offensive glass once again Well in terms of rim running big and Wilson check every box They get out and go Well they do because they they know theyre either going to get it from the guard or they assume a miss and are able to clean it up Thats amazing Before he got here to North Carolina Vasar had not had a game with more than eight rebounds 7 feet tall you know had played two years had not had a game with more than eight rebounds and the added minutes and you know hes a more mature player Hes Hes That has not been a question mark here so far Well hes got 12 points 11 rebounds so far today Bogots and one cheering You love seeing him put it on the floor Hes a strong driver and has shown the ability to finish Its another guy whos just I think hes going to continue to get better as he gets his feet under him a little bit more We we mentioned it in the open I mean he he got here late in the process Hes coming from a new country He was talking about how the game is is different here You know hes hes used to a lot more structure when he was playing for SC Derby back back in Montenegro More sets Hes got a lot more freedom in this Hubert Davis offense So youre adjusting to that and then of course you know didnt know if he was going to be eligible found out right before that opener So a lot of stuff off the court that you know I think for Bogots has been hard to adjust to but as you can tell hes starting to get more comfortable and hes now got 11 points Chris and this his second start in place of the injured Seth Trimble back to a pass I think the recipient Deontay Johnson saw the help defender coming and took his eye off the ball lost it out of bounds and Carolina takes it back How about the combined effort of Wilson and Vasar 33 total points on 11 of 13 shooting and 24 combined rebounds Here is Vasar Evans leaves his feet finds Dixon spotting up in the corner for three cheering applause the willingness to share it You know weve made the point the number of assists I mean they come in averaging 18 a game and and tonight has been no different Carolina has 25 made field goals so far tonight 18 have been assisted Wilson was just waiting to block that shot His fourth rejection 35 points 12 rebounds And Ill tell you what Chris ACC teams so far this season have a combined record of 50 and six and are beating their opponents by an average of better than 23 points per night And theres been an emphasis around the conference both stated and unstated amongst coaches and players that we need to win by larger margins in games like this The net is something that they feel like other conferences have manipulated by doing that And the ACC has made a concerted effort to say we have to outscore our lesser opponents When you have them down keep them down And that is certainly what Carolinas doing tonight after at Cameron earlier tonight Duke did to Indiana State Whats your impression so far just a matter of really days into the season about what we are going to see this year in the ACC Yeah I think the league is is better than it was last year Now the bar wasnt uh wasnt that high to to to climb over but I I think the league is better I mean you know we saw those three teams in the top 25 I think NC States going to have their shot to to get up there Wake Forest with some of the new additions Nate Kise played really well in that game against Michigan the other night cheering I think they have a chance to to be better perhaps than people thought You know Virginia Virginia Tech So theres theres a lot to be optimistic about with the league this year though And Ill throw Florida State and Syracuse in there as well as teams that should be better this year And so the middle of the ACC should be able to support those top teams and make it for a much deeper league than weve seen the last couple of years Dixon with another three Hes got nine points off the bench for UNCC You know you were making the point about having to win by you know a bigger margin for this league It starts with winning games though in the nonconference I mean I you know probably needs to be doesnt need to be said but the fact of the matter is this league has not performed well in the nonconference I I think the SEC ACC challenge like it did last year will give us a good barometer of where this league is at versus the competition This league has not performed well in the nonconference Fact of the matter And the the best way to go about improving your stake for NCA tournament selection is by winning games this time of year And then you know look if youre winning then we can talk about the margin Well in the upcoming ACC SEC challenge Carolina will play at Kentucky Tuesday December 2nd 930 on ESPN And last years conference challenge was an utter disaster for the ACC and another area where it can only go up Luca Bovots listed at 66 215 lbs Couple of free throws give him 13 points on the night And now he gets a nice round of applause as Isaiah Dennis freshman from Charlotte comes in for the first time tonight Also out there James Brown sophomore forward from Aurora who gave a couple of good minutes against Radford on Tuesday Zaden High is back out there We also have Jaden Young the former Virginia Tech Hokei out there playing guard Latimore for three Now he may wind up getting another good scoring night against an ACC opponent but it uh is all going to come late Hes up 12 points High a little strong Theres Vladimore He is not shy Hes not very confident Its funny Lavel Motton said uh of his star guard he reminds me of me And Lavell was a great player 1600 points He has a banner of himself up at the home arena at North Carolina Central And actually his former head coach at NC Central Greg Jackson agrees with Lavel Motton saying Yeah this Latimore kid reminds me of you This is Jay Slack a red shirt senior from Fort Worth at the free throw line applause and cheering You know its a statement about where things are at You know Latim Latimore starts the year the way he has and the immediate concern is who is trying to reach out to him in his DMs from other schools I mean the the MAK and LL was telling us this yesterday the the MAK gets ransacked as a lot of you know mid to lower major conferences do In this era of the portal the MAK just gets ransacked Well as Motton told us yesterday as a a Quaragu blocks the shot theres Carpenter He said Ive got an AllStar team Problem is none of them are still with me And he listed five really good players who have transferred elsewhere for money And again North Carolina Central is the only team in the MAK that did not opt in to pay its players They just dont have that kind of funding at that institution to be able to do that But leaves you at an even further disadvantage than you already were at And so Gage Latimore with a quick start to his season Likely will have other opportunities if he so chooses here Sunday afternoons ACC Network womens music basketball double header at 3 Eastern Georgia Tech host Jacksonville and then Florida State will host Indiana in Tallahassee Both are also available on the allnew ESPN app Zen High gets a pair at the line Hes now got seven points This is Ryan Archie with the basketball being defended 40 ft from the basket Goes by Dixon Loses it Gets it back to Carpenter 8348 High low Brown tries to corral it and he was fouled Surrounded by three Eagles Nice little pass over the top there by Zayen High You know thats thats the other area Doug The one position that I think Hubert Davis is looking for that backup big you know in a tight game if if Vasar gets into foul trouble or you got to get him a quick blow who can you trust to come in and play behind Vasar And and I think its you know certainly between Zayen High and James Brown Well both were top 100 recruits who up until now have played limited roles One out of two from the line for Brown who at 610 240 lbs would love to continue to see a bigger role this year Contested three Nicely done by Young whos out ahead The deflected pass though slows down the break It goes out of bounds Carolina will keep and have it when we come back 352 remaining in regulation Its all Michael Auditorium to see his uncle Walter He never wanted to do anything but play for the Tarheels Both of his parents played at or attended an HBCU I asked him today did he ever consider going to an HBCU And he had a big smile on his face like No here This is all I wanted to do He wanted to be a Tarheel And he has been a Tarheel for decades One of the alltime great players in the late 80s and early 90s Long NBA career He feels like that roller coaster has a really good chance of going back up and this could be a special season if all goes according to planet And again to me it feels like Chris the pieces fit and theyve laid the groundwork for what could be a really really good season here in Chapel Hill Yeah I would echo that I I mean I give Hubert a lot of credit He had a plan this off season They wanted to get better defensively on the glass and shooting the basketball They identified those players they wanted to go out and do that and and they got them and then they added a blue chip talent in Caleb Wilson on top of that So they they did what they needed to do and I I I give them a lot of credit because they cheering were ahead I think offensively of where a lot of people expected their ball movement Its an unselfish team the high low game Theres a lot to like And again this team hasnt even scratched the surface I think on how good they can become shooting the basketball And again the two things Hubert Davis said that they are working on most critically here in this early point of the season when the balls in the air go get it and dont turn the basketball over Those are the two things most front of mind for him They had trouble holding on to the basketball in the first half Tonight have been much better cheering in the second half Zero turnovers here in the second half Zen High putting up some good numbers here in the second half Hes got 11 points But one thing that is different around here is that there is no longer a JV basketball team for the University of North Carolina Its been an institution that has meant so many things to Hubert Davis and before him Roy Williams before him Dean Smith Marcus Paige former Tarheels great had been the most recent head coach of the JV team Its an opportunity for people around campus young men around campus to play for the Tarheels Dennis from the corner his first three points of the night applause But because of the changes in the NCAA the JV team is no longer And Yubert Davis said Yeah cheering it stinks He wishes they still had it Big roar is because the bench has been emptied at the next stoppage We will have four fresh tarheels coming into the game for the first time There they are Number 40 Ivon Mlovich cheering Number six Elijah Davis the coachs son Number 32 Evan Smith applause And number 25 John Fullbrook get an opportunity And a nice round of applause for the second stringers who head to the bench in final 216 cheering All right you were a big time scorer at West Point If you were on the floor at applause the end of a blowout and one of the guys from the end of the bench was on the floor did you encourage him to shoot Did you make sure you passed him the basket Yes Good Absolutely Its the right answer You got to do it cheering At this point if Im any one of those four guys who just came in anywhere inside half court Im sure laughter I think thats the way to look at it You got to do it Teo Carpenter cant get the roll and the rebound for Elijah Davis cheering and applause I will say too having played at Army and we played a lot of by games and Ive been on the other side of a lot of these as well I I know what these central kids are going through Round of applause for the effort put forth by John Brook Its a Its an amazing lifetime memory to play in a building like this but cheering it stings I mean nobody wants to lose like this And as we talked about early for schools in the MAK this is the norm They have to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars through these buy games to help support the entire athletic cheering department And it comes at a cost But like you said on the other side of it you can say Hey I played at the No I played guitar heels No question And on the flip side John Holbrook can say I scored a point in a big win over NC Central cheering He could phrase it That team in Durham cheering Durham laughter cheering little runner cheering Justin Edwards couldnt connect Young man who came from California as a walkon earned a spot on this roster and is serving as the backup to the point guard Deontay Johnson this year cheering Off the window for two Evan Smith a product of the North Carolina junior varsity program applause Youve tied it all together stoppage in play cheering to get some more subs in for NC Central Caleb Ellison gets an opportunity to play the final minute Number zero in black Also out there Bangga Olubi number nine in black Cameron Daniels is number four for three No Slam has it ripped away by Evan Smith applause and cheering And the junior from Charlotte gets a nice round of applause for his effort Jack Ill tell you what a shoot around today Chris We saw the camaraderie on this UNCC roster stands out They clearly are connected and very much like each other Yeah They cheer on each other for every single play every single shot every single made shot And if theres a miss shot cheering theres a teammate or two or three ready to pick you up Yeah You know it its its always interesting with with cultures with locker rooms Doug It It always starts at the top with the best players And you know we were saying about Caleb Wilson earlier always with a smile you you were talking about his personality his impact on campus and then how hard he plays And then Seth Trimble the leader he is and Vasar like it starts with those guys at the top And I I think it has carried down throughout this roster and everything other than the injury to Treble has been great Were only four games into the year Theyre going to be 40 They will face adversity at some point but they do seem to be in a very good position right now cheering Jay Slack at the free throw line once again in a little bit of a fouling contest here in a applause 46 point game Lets not turn it into Bradford game Cardio shot 40 free throws Thats a good point cheering Thats a very good point Four points for Slack Now which of the deep bench reserves is going to get up a shot here The fans are shoot shouting for their own personal favorite Elijah Davis No How about that cheering 9751 after the put back by Isaiah Dennis cheering And the same goes here for the Eagles Get a shot up 6 seconds 5 seconds cheering Edwards trying to get his own and he is fouled go Well from here Carolina will play Tuesday as Navy comes to town for a 700 tip off on the ACC network I dont know if you have any comments about the Naval Academyys basketball team Well I was hoping its good to see North Carolina playing the softest of the servicemies laughter I dont know if Hubert would say that right now No Im certain he wouldnt Hes the most classy a guy that I 9753 Another virtuoso performance
