in midtown Atlanta our referees tonight Lee Cassel Tommy Mory and Jen harness tip is won by Georgia Tekken the white jerseys Northern Illinois from the Mac in the red jerseys coach bner shared with us Robert that they really dont have a star player its really the star is the team so look for them to move the ball they love a lot of cutting off the basketball they run some Princeton stuff Duro SD me the foul his first the two players to look for Kean Williams and David quit they two leading scores Williams 19 a game quit 17 a game so far Georgia Tech after the early foul sees 12 on the shot Music clock down to six down to two shot clock violation did not get the shot off in time to start the game NIU led by seconde head coach rashan Bruner berno excuse me 10 and 23 formerly an assistant for six years at Arizona State three years prior to that at Florida so hes definitely got a great coaching lineage that he comes from that well get into later but this teams got a lot of road games ahead of them this is its not going to get any easier after this Robert I mean Georgia Tech on the road and then theyre theyre going to be on the road for a long time as they turn it over but the big thing is the difference between the team team like Northern Illinois and a Georgia Tech is that at every position Georgia Techs going to be a couple inches taller so so their centers are going to be 67 not 7 feet their guards are going to be 6 foot not 64 or 66 in the case of Georgia Tech see the yellow jackets starting lineup Debo Coleman iss tied from the scoring lead on the team 12 and a half a game sophomore is taking a big step forward three from the left wing is up and in for Debo Coleman yeah great knock down by Coleman but it was set up by the great Roll by Rodney Howard you get the pick and roll on the move when he rolls hard that sucks in the help and allows that threepointer to be wide open in the corner kesan Williams their leading score kicks it out for a threepointer its off the mark by koit and the rebound track down by dbo Coleman Yellow Jackets will push three on two driving left Baseline reverse L blocked Away by duroi one on Three and traveling olawa shun Doro syi out of nowhere erases that basket and thats so valuable when players got a wide open layup and it just gets erased good drive by Lance Terry but here a Sydney transfer from St Bonaventure and an offensive foul how about the defense early by Northern Illinois I mean they get a shot clock violation huge block and then a great charge sto send me again yeah and right there thats a block he slid underneath him that that in in in real time it looked like nothing but a charge but in super slowmo he was already in the air and he slid underneath him so tough call if youre a Georgia State uh Georgia Tech fan rather third turnover already for the Huskies three on one running the lane and filling it Rodney Howard rocks the rim how about that touch pass by Devon Smith with a left hand only is special Rodney Howard bck 611 senior from yup salani Michigan a transfer from Georgia in his third year at Georgia Tech now it makes it so tough to play against is that Georgia Tech plays about four different defenses and they switch it up whether they make or Miss KO Off the Mark again rebounded by Williams well they had a twoonone on on the weak side they didnt see it working his way to the round nice move underneath and laying it up no good second chance opportunity here off class still no good and eventually boarded by the yellow jackets who are on the run in the white jerseys to the rim Devon Smith off glass and in there a great move by Devon Smith but Northern Illinois frustrated because zarq Nutter was wide open that whole possession they they missed it when he finally got it he missed it inside Northern Illinois needs to be able to score on the easy ones if theyre going to hang tough here on the road three minutes into the game 0 for four from the field for Northern Illinois with three turnovers Georgia Tech comes in 20 Beat the division 2 school from the Atlanta area Clayton State to start the season last Monday then a good road win at Georgia State another school from Atlanta uh by two on Saturday looking for their first 3 and0 start in seven years Northern Illinois 1 and two they lost to a division 2 school to start the season Illinois Springfield lost in Northwestern and then beat another D2 School Purdue Northwest on Monday yeah talking to coach berno before the game hes he highlighted his teams inexperience and I think you saw that on the last play Robert where a Defender fell down and they had a five on four and they were slow to find that open player long three is no good by Xavier Amos back up and in and the foul sarq Nutter Jersey strong for zarq Nutter jco transfer from clar and goes up high and then look at this got hit about four times and one inside another Newark New Jersey product scored a crew High 20 against Purdue Northwest in just 20 minutes in their last game cant complete the threepoint play though the foul was on Howard his first Sturdivant all the way to the rim floats it up no good fight for the rebound comes away to the huskys this is Caleb Thor who into the game nice feed underneath missed the shot but hell go back to the line zarq Nutter theres another great cut by zarq Nutter he goes back door they find him and then he tries to get underneath and and thats tough to go up if Rodney Howard just goes straight up he doesnt get that second foul he almost was straight up but he came down a little bit with one arm and you got to credit sarq Nutter hes playing physical early hes going through contact hes seeking it out hes got a knock down free throw coach passer told us that Rodney Howard at 611 is really their only true post player hes already got two fouls less than four minutes into the game yeah and they can go small and and play a more traditional Princeton style Center when they run their Princeton set two steps away from the basket with Javon Franklin coming into the game but in in ACC Georgia Techs pretty small I mean you look at Duke they theyve got potential three seven Footers they can play together just as one example traveling called on Kyle Sturdivant Applause mil see the travel on Sturdivant another turnover for the yellow jackets Georgia Tech scored the first seven points of the game three in a row now for zarq Nutter and Northern Illinois now this Zone that theyre playing now looks a little bit reminiscent of a temple matchup switching junking and up so sometimes the best thing to do against is just run your man stuff another five straight points as he attacks the rim fearlessly no fear little little delayed pressed by Northern Illinois try to shorten the shot clock nice take to the rim follow Jam for the yellow jackets Javon Franklin make it look easy 67 senior from Little Rock transferred in from Auburn this is his first year at Tech breaks a modest 5 NIU run nice feed by KO underneath couldnt hit the bunny and rebounded by the yellow jackets he didnt need the dribbling side just go right up with it threepointer blocked Outlet stolen away three at the other end frantic action offensive rebound and a Applause dunk did the right thing as a big guy you run right to the rim if you dont get it relocate to the other side thats where a lot of those long jump shots are going to end up deflected itll stay with NIU officials as a big guy you can make your life easy if you run the floor hard sometimes look what I found Big Time Jam jvon FR expectations this season which is something Georgia Tech has done consistently Under head coach Josh passner you see this year they are picked 15th thats also last theres only 15 teams in the ACC the other the pre season poll deem that they would finish last but theyre off to a 20 start looking to make it 30 here tonight yeah and when youre when youre picked in the bottom half of the league whether its middle of the pack bottom you know you ignore it right you just try to get better every day you try to focus on what your program values are and you worry about that later in the season one thing Ill point out is who had St Peters ranked in the top 10 last season so at this time of the year were all just giving you our best guess especially in the era of the transfer portal guys are transferring down levels guys are transferring up and that chemistry takes a long time to Jael and thats what these nonconference games are really for you kind of get to know your team you improve on some weaknesses you get that chemistry going you try to get a feeling of what your teams going to look like heading into the conference season which starts early and earlier now the ACC season starts in just a couple of weeks offensive foul another chart I mean is he good or what on the defensive end Ola shun doru sinme again a great defensive play he slid outside the restricted area and hes moving his feet and doing a good job getting there first or at least first enough to get the call I mean that that was another great defensive play but to your point Robert these games are are important but they dont have the same impact in terms of your postseason as obviously the conference season and talking to coach passner he wants the ACC to go to 28 conference games he wants everybody to play twice and he said every time he brings it up in a meeting they basically laugh him out of the building Maxwell fumbled the pass in transition staying with it awkwardly throws it up followed up and in Jaylen Moore who picked up that last offensive foul with the follow quickly the other way tough finishing transition Duro Sydney blocked Here Comes Georgia Tech the other way bodies on the floor behind the play Applause wideopen three Kelly followed up and in athletic move by Devon Smith spectacular just in the unbelievable ball ball control and body control he just hung in the air and somehow flipped it in off glass rejected and a foul and Devon Smith showing you why he was the number 63 National recruit coming out of high school look at this Floating Action Kell first thats looking like Justin Jefferson last week at Buffalo unbelievable body control foul on Miles Kelly is Music Applause first Amos to the line tough free thr shooting so far for NIU heres our Monday college basketball double header Florida State host mercer at the Tucker Center in Tallahassee 630 Eastern then number seven Duke host Beller man at Cameron indor both are right here on acc Network and the ESPN app bman is no pushover they beat Louisville earlier this year they are from Louisville and they won their conference tournament last year the Atlantic son I I got news for you it doesnt matter Duke is the real deal holy field this year DQ Whitehead still injured but how about you havent seen Kyle filipowski play yet hes a sevenfooter with guard skills can really shoot it can dribble excellent job defensively and missing another layout did everything but finish KO has really struggled so far turnar around Jumper in the lane followed up and in again you usually when youre playing a high major team and youre the mid major its hard to get the easy shots its hard to get the layups to get the free throws to get the calls and Northern Illinois has been getting to the free throw line getting layups but theyre just not converting KO their second leading score is 0 for four three of them from Beyond The Ark hes got the green light yes he does hes now over for four from Beyond The Arc somehow NIU The Rebound in traffic turned away Georgia Tech interior D has been strong wide open its Kelly and theyll reset getting downhill Devon Smith boy really some fights for these rebounds and it goes out of bounds will send us to a timeout Under 12 to go first half Georgia Tech with the early lead 17 to8 on top 178 and a big part of that has been their attacking of the offensive glass Northern Illinois needs to put a body on some of these guys Devon Smith a spectacular putback as well as Javon Franklin with a couple its not good enough to just jump and go after the ball when youre playing a team like Georgia Tech you got to find them and put a body Georgia Tech six offensive rebounds already in this game three of them from jvon Franklin in just about 4 and A2 minutes hes got six points three rebounds and two blocks hes been a Difference Maker in a short amount of time after coming in for Rodney Howard who picked up two fouls now Northern Illinois is winning the foul battle early theyve only fouled once and theyve drawn five fouls but when guys are Waltzing in for for uncontested dunks and putb sometimes its better to just face box out a guy and get a foul to break up that Rhythm NIU has gotten some open looks though theyve been around the rim a lot theyre only three out of 17 from the field so far 18 but they have gotten high percentage shots even the threes theyre missing a wide open yeah in a lot of facets of their game theyve played well and zarit Nutter has been kind of key to that for them hes hes drawn a number of fouls right there he drove into the paint physically and hes kind of set the tone for his team not backing down to an ACC team on the Music road set play off the inbounds durosinmi pounding his way into the lane well off the mark and the rebound Tracked Down in the corner by the yellow jackets will push Davon Smith kicks it out trailing the play Kelly a three its Applause good Kell Miles Kelly Five Points and doesnt get any easier than that being the trail guy as a guard when they get that deep penetration from Devon Smith you just walk into a top of the key three thats easy NIU almost four minutes without a field goal kesan Williams hasnt really gotten going so far and hell Applause travel right here look how deep Devon Smith gets kicks it out to mil Kelly Bott thats easy money I mean come on Robert you can make that shot this wi wide open Miles Kelly 37 career threepoint shooter and thats the ninth game in a row going back to last year that hes made a threepointer shooting almost 60 in that span from Beyond The Arc missed an easy one underneath and a beautiful back door cut out of the Princeton set absolutely beautiful everything but the finish and Josh passman told us that they work on cutting the same way they work on rebounding shooting its a big part of their offense and thats exactly what he wants was an easy layup they werent aable to convert is that bringing a little extra holiday cheer that Princeton cut bring that it got me as excited as the dunk earlier I mean that was a great cut Noah former Princeton tiger all IV League a 37 career threepoint shooter with the Tigers coach pner talked about how they had to run that Princeton offense or those principles here because they had to give themselves an advantage where other teams in the league might be a little more athletic or have High Flyers right and its that and the Player Development where he said were not going to necessarily beat out Duke and UNC for every recruit maybe once in a while but not regularly so theyve got to play a different style and then when they get guys in here they get them better and if you look the last couple of years with their NBA players he puts his money where his mouth is he gets guys to the league from Georgia Tech he said weve got to be fivestar player developers theyre very intentional with their their workouts and make sure that theyre very efficient and they really work on a lot of conditioning cardiovascular make sure the guys are in great shape yeah I dont love that stuff though you know all that cardio no thanks Music and he talked about how much experience it takes to play in their system especially defensively because they mix up their defenses a lot and thats one of the problems they had last year they didnt have a lot of experience and they just didnt execute the defense as well as they did in their ACC title year two years ago Coleman buries the Applause three Deo Coleman again the beneficiary of a great curl that sucked in the help and then he was able to pop back for a wide open three hes great basketball by Georgia Tech he shot 41 from Beyond The Arc last year Zion Russells in the game now for NIU step back three Kean Williams couldnt get it to go Georgia Tech up 17 stop and pop bang Sturdivant his first three of the game and another timeout yeah now Georgia Tech rolling shooting threes in transition everything going well here at home for Georgia Music Tech Yellow Jackets on a 130 run NIU has not scored in over four minutes as ran berno trying to write the ship a little bit here for NIU what do you think theyve got to concentrate on especially at the offensive end well theyre theyre not getting the same penetration on cuts and off of the dribble as they were in the first 10 minutes of the game so the last four minutes or so theyve just been moving the ball side to side so theyve got to get back to penetrating and then looking for each other off that penetration do a good job hatching on kesan Williams nius leading score a lot of deflections 10 on the shot clock wild shot got it up on the rim and a foul on Anthony Crump yeah what Georgia Tech is doing right now theyre playing a match up zone so youre youre trying to run some Zone Concepts against it and youre getting frustrated potentially youve got to play with the mentality that youre running a mantoman offense in my opinion against a matchup Zone and know that theyre going to switch most exchanges and most screens yellow jackets on a 130 run to blow this game open to a 20point lead Jaylen Moore into the lane and Crump the rebound coach is calling for the Huskies to move the ball Zone D has NIU off balance crazy shot rebounded easily by the yellow jackets threepointer in transition well off the mark and rebounded by zarq Nutter who has five of nius eight points he takes it to the rim followed up no good and a f will step aside Georgia Tech on an extended 130 run looking to move to 3 and0 on the Music season its just a fact of life in mid major basketball youre going to go on the road quite a bit how about this road trip eight game road trips seven states eight conferences about 16000 miles NIU played at home on Monday their next home game December 20th 36 Days in between games of note theyre going to Fort Meers after this theyre going to both Idaho and Gonzaga but not back to back theres 10 days between those two games so theyre going to fly to Idaho fly home and then fly back out to eastern part of Washington 10 days later oh you know that uh guys like Anthony Crump are begging for that extra leg room get them the the exit row heres Saturdays week 12 ACC Network college football games noon Eastern 7 and3 Duke has one three straight theyre going up against 6 and4 Pittsburgh and the day is capped off with our ACC Network Prime Time matchup a couple of six and four teams Wake Forest and Syracuse in Winston Salo NIU now two out of seven from the free throw line on in six minute scoring drought the shot is up and in for sturtivant you know theyre just showing their inexperience and and they in addition to that were banged up they had some illness and injury issues and you know talking talking to them before the game that shows up as they needed that one it shows up mainly in time and score right shot selection at the end of halves and what coach berno wants to do is use those 4minute mini games to get better and whether youre tied or down 20 you can still do that the rest of this game Kelly could not answer two NIU players fight for the rebound KO just his first three and ended a 1 15 Georgia Tech run that lasted over 6 minutes moving the ball around here could have got out of their offense a bit for about six or seven minutes qu step back jumper Long rebound track down by Crump hell kick it in for a left corner three he rebounded but it was a great play by Trump he Tracked Down The Rebound he looked opposite right away and got another open look oh to the rim blocked away here comes NIU KO lost the ball and a foul here another monster block by NIU Xavier Amos great play not to give up on that fast break he a very highly regarded recruit the Chicago sometimes ranked him as the fourth best senior in Illinois last year at a Whitney Young High School of Powerhouse program in the windy city 68 freshman they have very high hopes for him just very very poor free throw shooting for NIU two out of eight in a game theyre really struggling to score this be just about a 10point game if they knock down their free throws to the rim and easily laying it up and in Miles Kelly seven points you see that ACC Guard height Miles Kelly 66 got the length simple cross got all the way to the cup KO fell to the ground and a jump Music Applause Music balloi right here two guys going to the floor all over Kyle Stant gets the tie up David Koy in the first game of the season against Illinois Springfield scored a career high 31 points he transferred in from a junior college in New Jersey in that game Noah he was 12 out of 29 from the field he shot 203p pointers in that game he did make six of them as a chance for a threepoint play for NIU I mean did your eyes just light up that he had what is whats beyond green light yeah you love to see it the 20 attempts but how about this move right here nice step through big guy showing his ability from the outside Anthony Crum hes a guy who as a as a forward he can get the ball off the off the rebound on the defensive end and push it himself and thats going to be so valuable in MA play for these guys to have a versatile big but yeah you got that right 20 attempts going to take you to shoot 20 times I mean you would have liked it to be the most your coach wished it was four yeah headed back the other way Zion Russell blocked away oh blocked again and a foul interior defense for the yellow jackets Debo Coleman his second Howard did pick up his third foul on the last possession its a great attack but an even better block by Devon Smith up top I mean hes the type of athlete that he can play at the next level whether its overseas or somewhere here but also he might get an invite to an NFL combat I mean thats what he reminds me of its like such a special athlete where they go hey can you play corner like like thats what hes reminding of in terms of his range and also his leaping ability I mean hes had four spectacular plays where hes just gotten off the ground not only high but in a hurry hes 6 one he he took that off the top of the square was hit his head zarq Nutter the only NIU player making free throws hes got seven points now to lead the way for the huskys now if youre looking back at passers Key metrics you got to think about the free throws made to opponents attempts and they are not where he wants to be so far I mean NIU the reason theyre theyre hanging around is that theyve been able to force the issue and get to the free throw line now the next step is knock him down right its one thing to get there you got to convert when you get that chance problems getting it in plenty of time on the shot clock and the yellow jackets will set up the offense and a foul Crum is first not wise just foul the entry pass thats a passing position in the offense for Georgia Tech so you make it a little difficult but if he beats you there to the Elbow you let him catch because hes really looking to be a pass right there no need to pick up the little Ticky tack foul under the basket wide open Maxwell lays it in Tristan Maxwell the son of 13year NBA vet Vernon Maxwell who won two NBA titles with the Rockets back in the mid 90s gets on the board for the first time hes a junior from Huntersville North Carolina NIU just one field goal in the last 9 and2 minutes soaring for the rebound Jaylen Applause Moore Moore taking it Coast to Coast geia Tech really is a lot of interchangeable parts out there a lot of guys who can handle the ball and play a lot of different positions wide open three theyre going to have to play small ball in ACC I mean theyre going to have to play that way with basically four or five guard concept but so far the huge run by Georgia Tech put him on top theyre controlling things here at home with 355 look to go Josh passner in his seventh season leading the yellow jackets and not only have they develop players theyve developed excellent defensive players and of course uh Moses Wright in the league Jose Alvarado whos hes become famous for kind of his defensive play where he hides in the corner and then he Sprints behind the point guard and steals the ball and if you were watch watch in the NBA the other night he had a great headtohead match up against John Mor where he really went Adam who you know John Mors becoming one of the best players in the league and Jos Alvarado stood up to him and had a great play against him defensively got in his face a little bit so that all starts here at Georgia Tech learning how to become a great defensive player and and guys even guys who go undrafted are are valuable at the next level because they play so hard on the defensive end strong take to the rim by Franklin and eventually a foul Music Grump is second Robert Lee Noah Savage our entire ACC Network crew with you from Atlanta Georgia where Georgia Tech has led throughout have led by as much as 22 they havent shot a free throw yet robt they have zero free throws theyve given up 11 attempts to Northern Illinois unfortunately nis only made four of those 11 theyre also shooting 177 from the field as evidence of that defensive prowess that Georgia Tech has shown so far Devon Smith will shoot the first free throws of the gameo fou3 E barwin just into the game his first foulon line two shots for d for Devon Smith one out of one this season missed the first Saturday morning at 1100 am eastern the a CC huddle crew will be a truest field in Winston Salem at Wake Forest University get you set for another full day of football youll also have halftime shows and pre and postgame shows throughout the day at 7 get a complete wrap up of the afternoons games and theyll get you set for the prime time matchup Syracuse and Wake Forest on acc Network at 8 so right here on acc Network in the ESPN app your guys going up against Wake Forest yeah started the year six and ODS at the orange unfortunately have lost four in a row our bow El but love to finish the season strong thats for sure another block do not enter around the rim Kelly wide open three offensive rebound for Moore and he lays it in and rashan berno will call his third timeout of the game no no timeout look at Zahir Nutter well three different players could have blocked that yeah and I think he got a shot to the Head from somebody there but hes standing in the game thats what we highlighted before is that when youre playing against a big athletic team you need to drive looking to kick it out looking to dump it down you cant drive for yourself against the length of the Georgia Tech High arching three for KO athletic rebound Jaylen Moore Devon Smith down the lane Aly missed the dunk rebounded by Hunter Here Comes NIU the other Applause way KO stolen Music away and it was a good move just a better pickpocket Maxwell with the steal excellent job not giving up on the Applause play give and go excellent passing wide openen three and Williams the Music rebound and theres guys open for Northern Illinois but its just hard to see over the length of Georgia State or Georgia Tech rather Nutter two Tech players fighting for the ball and its Smith with it it Devon Smith is going to have a big highlight like a rim rocker before this games over I have a feeling hell score here with t Nifty floater hes doing laps right there went all the way around the Baseline came back out Lo like Steve Nash on that play just run in circles till he was open flipped in a a 10ft floater seven points now for Smith quick fire three almost banked it in Almost Doesnt Count unfortunately Here Comes Tech the other way Smith Nifty dribbling and theyll reset with Miles Music Kelly strong take and a score Jaylen Moore and Josh passner will call a timeout biggest lead of the game let see how Georgia Tech likes to play they didnt have anything in transition pull it out low post play Easy Money Down Low for Jaylen Moore and if youre the smaller team you cant go for those steals in the post you got to make it tough but then play behind if you go for a steel against a bigger player theyre going to be able to drop step and get right to the rim but Jaylen Moore Josh fer told us hes on the same trajectory as the Moses right potentially didnt start playing the game until he was 13 a sophomore in high school looked like he may have got hurt on the end of that last play but he was a football player till he was 13 and for a guy to not start that late like most guys out here they were playing on a sponsored aou team with you know free sneakers by the time they were 13 He thats when he started playing and its remarkable and the ceiling is so much higher for him he grabbed at his abdomen after that play you mentioned Moses right I mean Moses right was a he wasnt even a nonh heralded recruit he had basically no other division one offers four years later hes the ACC Player of the Year unbelievable development yeah Josh fer actually credited running that Princeton stuff and be able to use him inside outside with a big part of his development and being able to become the player of the year bucket for Amos he has three points down low wide open layup is up and in for Miles Kelly Music good pass by stance about a 3 second difference between the shot clock in the game clock bad turnover Tech on the Run four on two Sturdivant attacks the rim blocked shot clock is off now Sturdivant rolls around no good and IU clears the glass can hold for one 8 seconds left three from the top of the he is good nice shot there for Caleb Thornton half court shot and a little bit of momentum there for NIU as they get a three to go at the end of the half but a dominating first half for Georgia Tech they did a good job sharing the basketball getting open shots both in transition and on and half court and Georgia Tech basically doing what we thought they would do taking care of business here at home 43 to 20 Georgia Tech with a halftime lead halftime Sher s thats seven out of 35 from the field seven field goals 10 turnovers yeah they they were the aggressor early and Tariq Nutter kind of led the way with that aggression but you know on his way to four turnovers and the shooting has just been bad overall Kean Williams needs to get going one for six and they left seven easy points on the board with the Miss free throws Smith stops on a dime and a defensive stop for NIU to start the second half what do you need to see from the Huskies as they try to make the long climb back into this game well Im sure one thing that the coaches want to see is just more talking on the defensive end I mean there were there were times were sitting next to their bench where you could hear the bench talking more than the players you want the players to be louder than the coaches on the defensive end and then just knock it down on themselves you know you know play little fourminute spurts and dont worry about the score just try to play well and execute just like that penetrate kick knock it down sirq Nutter has played well he has 10 points to lead all scorers thats what you got to do there theres no 15point plays you got to get back two and three points at a time over a couple of minutes as you said four minute increments between timeouts so stopping a threepointer for NIU to start the second half Debo Coleman was quiet in that first half so was Lance Terry and another stop for the Huskies to start the second half now remember the first couple possessions of the game Northern Illinois was great defensively they had the the shot clock violation they had a charge drawn and right there they forced the hard two and got the rebound that was great defense wide open under the rim for a dunk sarq Nutter has 12 points 50 run out of the locker room total breakdown by Georgia Tech though nobody home going back to the first half an 80 run now for NIU Applause give and go stolen away and a score here would probably lead to a Georgia Tech timeout and it was great scouting on the other end because they read that it was an isolation handoff move and you could hear hands hands hands and then he put his hands up and knocked it down KO leaves it for a teammate with nine on the shot clock KO a three its good but I think he was out of bounds before he shot it what a tough break that is yeah brutal for them but you know because he got the wide open shot the whole bench was excited he knocked it down so you know you got your whole team rooting for you that gives you a lot of confidence shooting the basketball Devon Smith to the rim Debo Coleman a three Georgia Tech has not scored to start the second half in Two two and A2 minutes its about the third or fourth time that Devon Smith has gotten deep into the defense and found the guy behind him thats a great plays when you look behind you inside for another Applause score five makes in a row for Northern Illinois Duro Sydney as first two of the Music game now a 100 run spanning halftime to the rim and a blocking foul zuro SD me his second so weve seen this a couple times they get into Princeton action but they clear an entire side out so its basically an ISO play but without the ball so you have your choice of coming around you can get the basketball you cut back door and Kyle Stan did a great job selling that cut cutting hard but they do it a little differently at Georgia Tech leaving that whole side open St ofan to the line 58 on the season there you go you got it you still have that power Robert 58 Ian no no no no 58 I mean thats its not like hes 9 that guy never misses that was your fault please Ive been around long enough to know an announcer Jinx know these kids are you know 18 to 22 years old theyre up 23 at halftime they go to the locker room they think oh the games over the coach tells them the games not over yeah but its just so hard for that mindset to stay there of course you got to keep the competitive fire even if youre up 20 right you got to still execute you got to contest shots and and the defense just hasnt been as good in the second half for Georgia Tech heres a matchup Zone pull up jumper good zarq Nutter is having a game he has 14 points as NIU has suddenly hit six shots in a row almost the steal from behind loose on the floor four onone break its to the left side to the rim laying it up and in you see you see Anthony Trumps versatility at 68 he led the break he he did it like a point guard great execution and Northern Illinois trying to come back here I love carbonation I I I bathe in carbonation every night Robert I mean he said hes never had a coffee hes never had an alcoholic drink ah what a life what a limited life and he also wants to live till hes 130 well I think the no soda may help him in that regard man those last 30 years are going to be rough man Im telling you thats a bad plan and games like this may shorten his lifespan as well as nius on a 14 to1 run going back to the first half never easy for a coach 11 to one this half if I was one of his players Id be like if we win the national championship youre having a Mountain Dew with me to the rim and a foul its CAU on kesan Williams will send us I believe to a Music timeout not a timeout that last time timeout with about the 1620 Mark was a coach call timeout Georgia Tech keeps the ball with a 13point lead nius defense has tightened up in the second half down to three on the shot clock Terry in trouble desperation three shot clock violation what they did well there was even if they got a little bit out of position their hands were were in passing lanes and they made that really really tough great defense and another just end to end defensive stand and you see the shooting in the second half five for five versus over for five for Georgia Tech and its been the zarq nutter show in the second half for NIU hes already got seven second half points almost nine but hell have a chance to go to the line and I think they found their goto guy here tonight yeah and Ill tell you something Robert as a as a player who played some of these power FES conferences on the road in these you know mid major playing on the road I dont think we ever called an ISO against an ACC player so that shows you the confidence that they have in zier Nutter where they said get the ball in the mid post and just go get a bucket that is supreme Confidence from your Music coach Nutter made the first free throw Applause missed the second and rebounded by Maxwell 15 points now for zarq Applause Nutter long twopoint shot and sarq Nutter the rebound yeah Georgia Tech going back to that Princeton series and S a little bit for long twos KO flips it up and Applause in it is now a 14 to one run this half and 17 to1 going back to the first Applause Music half just a 10point lead now stolen away no number stopping pop he got it how about the confidence David Co man we said he has the Ultimate Green Light he shot 20 in a game earlier this season and one on three no problem seven out of seven from the field to start the half whatever coach berno said in the locker room needs to bottle that up and a foul its on Koy its his first he almost got that steal but he just ran into him at the end with the body it is now a 17 to one run to start the half for NIU which they only scored 20 points in the first half theyve already got 17 here yeah and a little bit of that is you could tell their body language was a lot better coming out in the second half first half they were down on themselves then they loosened up started having a little fun Coleman step back long jumper and a foul against Northern Illinois Duro SD me his third Music Applause and dor simy thought he was boxing out legally but the ref had him with a little bit of contact to the Face Georgia Tech not getting those easy looks at The Rim like they were before tough shot in traffic rebounded its on the floor and its tied up the arrow will favor an IU its more great defense by Northern Illinois as Doro simy that time coming off getting his his foul right here able to go vertical he jumps backwards a little bit and doesnt commit that foul that a lot of big guys would Northern Illinois had seven field goals in the first half they already have seven in the second half weve played about 6 minutes and 15 seconds a complete 180 from that first 20 minutes look at those numbers and a kickball stays with NIU 19 on the shot clock it seems like theyre playing with house money in the second half right and in the first half little tense putting pressure on themselves and then its kind of like when you go YOLO and have the mentality all of a sudden the ball goes in a little bit more you cant you cant play tense on the offensive end Applause KO couldnt finish rebound out of bounds to the Huskies and what a move across the middle by David Koy and almost able to thread the needle inside finally a missed field goal but qu who averaged 31 a game in Junior College last year starting to come alive hes got eight Applause points here he is 10 on the shot clock Trump offensive foul they wanted the coaching staff wanted him to pass it back to KO yeah and you see the confidence that Northern Illinois has in their players as as coach ran berno saying get it back to our best player at the moment David KO and just take him hes saying go you know hes not saying lets call a play hes saying take him youre playing well and thats why hes so frustrated he want that ball back in number 11 on red third foul on Crum will go to the Music bench well NIU has caught fire from the field a travel georia Tech has one point in over seven minutes and you youre seeing several times Robert that its The Scouting Report its they knew the back door was coming they knew that the look back was coming and then nothing was open and that caused the travel but Georgia Tech has to get back to just seeing a little bit more on the offensive end cuz they are missing a couple guys that are open Devon Smith went to the locker room with an injury is holding his lower body Devon Smith went back to the locker room whos played well so far KO step back three difficult shot there its rebounded by Terry pushing in transition down the lane Jaylen Moore came up short rebounded by NIU Huskies on the Run filling the lane zosi blocked kicks it out regains possession three from the Applause corner and a whistle on the loose ball thatll go against the huskys right here pretty good move and then blocked right in front Javon Franklin but you go to you got to see whats in front of you you cant make your mind up Im going to shoot my jump hook and if theres a big athletic guy right on you you dont have any advantage spray it out to Shooters eight minutes into the second half Georgia Tech has one points since halftime Devon Smith is now back on the bench and he was really the Catalyst on the offensive end and defensive end in the first half for Georgia Tech nice pass down low for a layup Javon Franklin off the nice feed Kyle sturdivan has just been that Steady Hand for Georgia Tech and they played on that championship team hes a veteran just kind of does a little bit of everything finally a field goal for the yellow Applause jackets tough lefthanded Runner out of bounds off of two Georgia Tech players Under 12 to go here at the Thriller Dome 4637 Georgia Tech with the lead SQ Nutter already with a double double 15 points 11 rebounds theyve been sharing the basketball getting into the paint David kys been good for midrange and how about this gutsy 3 looks at his own bench says I got you coach knocks it down showing why hes a big time score at the jco level 30 points a game hes got the UL green light and theyre all theyve all stepped up their game in the second half but the next step that I I know that this coaching staffs looking for is a little bit more looking for each other theyre still missing some open guys on penetration where they could kick it out but theyre taking it Applause themselves left Baseline jumpers rebounded by Coleman Georgia Tech led by 26 in the first half and that will put Georgia Tech at the free throw line Russell has second remember they only shot two free throws in the first half Northern Illinois completely won the foul battle this is going to be important the rest of the way any drive any cut any post or theres a bump thats a scoring opportunity for Georgia Tech to the line Miles Kelly who has not scored in this second half in fact Georgia Tech has only scored three points as a team since halftime Kelly adds to that total well have another special ACC pm tomorrow with the crew will be in Winston Salem North Carolina to get you set for a big college football Saturday and theyll have the latest from around the conference for Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app 11 points now for Miles Kelly a sophomore from nearby Stone Mountain Georgia about a half an hour east of here came in and averaging 12 and 12 a Music game inside for Nutter good defense there by sturdavant Rise And Fire for three halfway down for Amos nearing the Midway point of the second half Georgia Tech trying to reextend that lead Kelly way off from rebound well you see the difference with Devon Smith not getting that deep penetration that threepointer was about 4T deeper than one the one we saw him knock down in the first half Russell confidently shoots the three could not get it to go now NIU has gone cold as we hit the Midway point of the second half oh for their last seven from the field started this half seven for Music seven start of on High dribble floats it up somehow gets his own rebound and then turns it over Music KO we set up the secondary break I had my money on that thing going up Robert he was thinking about just looking for an opening yet too big of a Defender oh oh my goodness oh my goodness right here drive across the middle return to cender what a block turn to Rose C Javon Franklin says take this back where you got it from Full tender no no no no no no bench thought so no no no no Javon Franklin sixth year senior from Little Rock first year at Georgia Tech came in leading the team in blocks KO off a screen well short on the air on the threepointer and the bench thought that the ball was blocked right well they thought either he got fouled or the ball was blocked because theyre saying hes too good of a shooter to shoot a airball off a flex action down screen that you thats like a layup for a guy like him so rest werent buying it though NIU is not scored now in 5 and A2 minutes the momentum has been stalled see if they can get Nutter back involved hes defended well he flips it up board cleared by Franklin other way for dunk Lance Terrys first two of the game but Devon Smith back in the game what happens assist easy dunk for Lance Terry that shows you the value of Devon Smith its not only about his offense and his great shot blocking rebounding for a 61 guy he makes it so much easier for everybody else hes like you Robert you you make it easier for me see if kesan Williams can get involved he has turned away five on the shot clock Crump lost it on the way up Devon Smith got it yellow jackets on the Run Smith accelerates to the rim scores it a Applause Music foul Devon Smith little stop and go no help and one easy money for number five in white whos been spectacular all night long big time recruit out of high school a transfer from Mississippi State second year at Georgia Tech 10 points for Devon Smith junior from Loganville Georgia about 40 miles east of here so Georgia Tech weathered the storm they are now on a 90 run strong take and will earn himself a trip to the free throw line Xavier Amos after a timeout Georgia Tech saw the lead strink to seven theyve pushed it back out to 16 fantastic show that team went to the final four all three players averaged at least 20 points a game that season and the star of stars Kenny Anderson who was just electric yeah and he hes always in the conversation for one of the greatest high school players ever its always Lou all cender Kenny Anderson LeBron maybe throw Marberry in there he played it so Kenny Anderson played at Archbishop Malloy high school for famous coach Jack Curran who didnt play freshman he didnt start freshman so Kenny Anderson had to sit the first quarter of every game that he played as a freshman and despite that he set the New York State scoring record with 2621 points points that stood for nearly 20 years until it was broken by who Sebastian Telfair cousin of Stefon Marbury so it all comes back to your Yellow Jackets here at Georgia Tech Bobby kremens the 75yearold coach heavily involved in that documentary as well ACC Legends coming up after the conclusion here five points now for Xavier Amos ends that Georgia Tech run nius missed its last 12 shots from the field Music and remember Bobby kremens got Stefon Marberry because he he went into his kitchen and said Im going to give you the ball and that was after your Syracuse boy Jim beheim said Im not going to start you as a freshman so thats not what the marber wanted to hear and that was why Marberry came here over Syracuse great lineage of New York City point guards from Kenny Anderson to Stefan Marb and more recently Jose Alvarado here at Georgia Tech Applause you see those guys there couple of them back in the mid and early 90s and then more recently alado marber as you said a huge star here at Georgia Tech went onto a terrific NBA career 10 points now for Javon Franklin third Team all Sun Belt last year was Franklin Music extends the lead back to 16 just been a such a hot and cold half Northern Illinois 0 for 13 since that hot 7even for seven start Quake couldnt get the roll out of bounds to the yellow Applause jackets also Northern Illinois five offensive rebounds versus Zero from toward the tech in the second half I mean I dont know what they did in that that halftime locker room to get themselves gassed up for the second half but they got to do it before the game starts next time because they theyre completely different basketball team than they were in the first half Devon Smith has made a difference since coming back in offensive rebound for Debo Coleman he came up short with the fo back Applause husky down 16 trying to make one final push Williams has been quiet buries the three seven points for their leading score kesan Williams who averages 19 a game he was all ma honorable mention a year ago 23 starts averaged 16 a game after transferring from Tulsa its his second year at NIU Music oo oh nice move Kelly came up short though on the reverse layup yeah a little Steve Smith move along the Baseline the Fig spin Williams looking to heat up hell shoot a three long rebound run down by Nutter Georgia Techs got a lot of work to do in terms of their defensive rebounding we saw them working on it today and shoot around but theyve given up a lot especially those long jump shot rebounds three would not go but another offensive rebound taking it back to the rim blocked ball saved back in bounds to the yellow jackets who will run four on two Kelly all alone for three out of bounds to Georgia attack you see Scot pil Gordon Robert in at the college level you got to know Tendencies if you take a look at this spectacular block down low another angle from underneath weve seen how good Javon Franklin has been all night for Georgia Tech but when Northern Illinois is running back you cant just run to the paint youve got to make sure you locate Shooters and Miles Kelly got open in transition turn and shoot the rebound cleared by the Huskies rwn berno in just his second season with NIU nice feed down low and drawing the foul second season with the Huskies they were picked last out of 12 teams in the Mac preseason poll they won just nine games last year this is a team that has four winning seasons in the last 25 years these kind of turnarounds dont happen overnight yeah he weve talked about a little bit but you know you spent time under Billy Donovan at Florida spent a lot of time at Arizona State under Bob Hurley and he played for Bob Hurleys dad Bob Earley senior at St Anthony in New Jersey so hes got all those coaches to draw on and create his own style here only in the second year you know its going to be a work in progress but he says so far hes happy with where they are our next all access the ACC life Premiere Sunday and features Virginia Womens Soccer Louisville volleyball and Syracuse mens

school number three seat football youre always re for the orange man telling you number three overall seedman soccer tournament big three there for Coleman and that thats going to be the onew punch all year long Miles Kelly and then Debo Coleman theyre not a big team but those are big guards at 66 and their length and their their ability to stretch the floor needs to show up especially in ACC Applause play yeah theyre theyre going to be outsized certainly in a lot of ACC game so the versatility and the chemistry is going to have to be on point for Georgia Tech they force a turnover Coleman on the Run feeds it ahead Look Out Below Miles Kelly with 13 in a Northern Illinois Applause timeout the length has to show up in terms of tipping balls and getting it ahead great look ahead Miles Kelly send it in games right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Josh pner in his seventh season at Georgia Tech after seven years as the head coach at Memphis hoping to guide his school to a three and 0 start now both these teams are part of the Fort Meyers tip off so theyll both go to Fort Meers theyll play in different brackets next week Georgia Techs next game is against Utah on Monday and I will play Sam Houston in Fort Meers on Tuesday so they they both go on a run that could be the championship this could be a preview Williams strong take to the rim nine points for kesan Williams they need to see more of that for Northern Illinois heres their leading score coming in been a little quiet tonight under four minutes to go Kellys had a good game hes the leading score for the yellow jackets with 13 Coleman down the lane Coleman from short range scores see that attention to detail in terms of Player Development they work a lot on their feet and that means pivoting they work on on things as simple as pivoting and at the end of that drive he was able to Pivot two or three times without traveling and the other guy who does a lot of that is Rick patino you see how much better Iona got with him but its those little details that help get get guys so much better here at Geor attack nter strong take Franklin cant believe he picked up the foul but he did its his fourth and it will send us to a timeout 306 to go Georgia Tech up 17 play of Devon Smith hes really been the story of the game 10 points 10 rebounds four block shots for a guy whos only 61 had that beautiful floater but when he went down with an injury and went to the locker room briefly Georgia Tech was a different team and when he came back in had a beautiful assist and then the A1 flexum Young fella hes been spectacular for the yellow jackets hes been a catalyst not only with his passing but just his energy and his athleticism hes tied a career high with those six assists as NIU goes to the line down 17 Robert Lee Noah Savage former Princeton tiger and along with our entire ACC Network crew with you from mamsh Pavilion in Atlanta Georgia Tech appears to be on its way to a victory its third straight to start the season zarq Nutter is the games high score now with 16 points hes been really well you know right from the start hes very aggressive and hes certainly going to be an impact player in the match turnover I mean a foul I should say on Kean Williams thatll put Georgia Tech at the line we talked about the ACC and Georgia Tech being picked last out of 15 teams on the preseason poll the conference is very top heavy this season yeah and a big part of that is that so many people came back right Armond Bott back for UNC Caleb love back they added Pete and an a 610 transfer from Northwestern and then Duke again has the top three recruits in the country which they did just a couple years ago when they had Zion RJ Barrett and cam reddish so theyve just completely reloaded and theyre huge so when theyre fully healthy even though they lost the number one pick and AJ Griffin and Trevor Keels and Joey Baker transferred away thats what Duke does they just completely reloaded and theyre young but they are really talented I mean they have probably three of the top four picks as of now on their team Virginias going to be better Miamis going to be better I mean its murderous Row in the ACC it just is there its its its AC what do you expect its NBA guys on every team its its its just not an easy night anywhere on the schedule Terry tried to go Michael spectacular move by Michael Jordan there in midair uh did not work out as well for him as it did for MJ as a score at the other end for zarq nutters got 18 ACC coming off a big year in the NCA tournament North Carolina went to the title game beat Duke in the final four should be another great season of ACC basketball a foul against NIU and remember Robert last year Wake Forest was one of those bubble teams and I I talked to Steve Fort last year and he was pleading my case his case to me saying I beat UNC I I had 15 wins in the ACC like that should be enough to get in is when you do your work in a tough conference like the ACC and I think coach Pastor kind of echoed that where hes like he wants a longer conference schedule yeah I Ive never heard that thought 28 conference games he wants to every team to play every other team twice yeah uh he said hey why not yeah I mean they looks you know theres no bad losses quote unquote in your conference uh but it was a theory Ive never heard before but certainly an interesting one he says the other coaches just laugh at him but he doesnt mind it be a familiar phe for for Mac fans also on Virginia Ben vanderplas excellent stretch four transferred in there and hes going to fit into their style of play really well 68 guy can really stroke it so as always in todays era youve got the additions by freshman but also the transfers to keep track of and NIU will look to compete in the map annually a one bid league but a competitive league as David Koy has 10 points in their preseason poll Kent State was picked number one Kent State lost in the title game last year Toledo was pick number two Toledos off to a terrific start this year they won the regular season title last year in the ma Davon Smith won and then a follow Jam Javon Franklin Above the Rim hes got 12 hes also got five blocks and thats his 10th rebound a monster game Javon Franklin double double his first as a yellow jacket ninth of his career foul is called against Mo and it will put Crump at the line dont forget when were done the premere of ACC Legends looking at the 1890 Georgia Tech final four Applause team now as you highlighted they had three guys who average 20 points a game on that team next year the sophomore year for Kenny Anderson he averaged 26 a game yeah so talk about a great freshman 20 and then 26 freshman sophomore year the best fact that I found out about that team when I researched it today was that in their game to go to the final four they beat Minnesota they scored 93 points as a team those three guys scored 89 points in that game thats unbelievable the rest of the team had four as its another dunp for Javon Franklin one minute to go Applause Music Applause here Russell missed it at The Rim Georgia Tech up 18 with about 46 seconds left to go and this is the start of an eight game Road Trip for NIU theyre off to actually going to stay here in town till Saturday then theyre going to fly to Florida and then they have that 16000 m road trip before they play a home game on December 20th long three another strong rebound for Javon Franklin and what should be Georgia Techs final offensive possession coming up here stura fouls and I can tell you Robert as a as a player you may not appreciate if youre in Northern Illinois that road trip now but thats where some of your best memories with your teammates your coaches thats where a lot of istry grows the off the court stuff so that that scheduling that tough schedule was I think a great move for their program for their development where they are where they want to go last year they won their season opener at Washington try to pick up a couple wins during that road trip Hunter and that should be the final shot of the game clock winding down Georgia Tech will improve to 3 and 0 for the first time in seven years the final score Georgia Tech 6 68 and NIU 50 Georgia Tech leads from tip to buser had some great performances Devon Smith was huge Miles Kelly everybody got involved Javon Franklin with the monster game they got that balanced attack that coach pner told us about and they took care of business here on their home court Georgia Tech improves to 3 and0 NIU Falls to one and three both teams will head to Fort Meers so
