campus at BC on Monday they are six and three at home Wake Forest two and three on the road one and two at neutral sites story for them has been outstanding play at home theyve won 14 straight and Lawrence Joel Coliseum as we are underway the tip is controlled by the Deeks with Ty Appleby having the basketball its the screen from Andrew Carr theyre Stout up front with Carr and Matthew Marsh in the corner to Monsanto Carr engulfs the rebound and the putback thats going to be a huge key to the game in Boston College keep car and Marsh off the glass and Monsanto as he attacks the basket tonight with with offensive rebound which is going to be key eagles with three guards Zachary Ashton Lankford and Lankford Jamar and Makai Ashton the brothers from Worcester Mass 45 minutes down the road from Chestnut Hill princely Bay impressive freshman from Minneapolis finds Ashton Lankford heres the three by post with one on the shot clock its a good look for post he faded on that shot but thats a shot he can make and a shot he needs to make for Boston College to prove offensively yeah thats going to be a huge part of their game the eagles need to be much better from the outside a wild heave by Monsanto rare misfire for him and Tom are keys to the game what are they well right now there is no question that Wake Forest has got to create open threes off their driving kick game not only Appleby but theyve got to make the next pass and we just saw it when Carr got the rebound theyve got to Rebound in this game against Boston College and deal with the physicality for Boston College theyve got to be able to defend the three thats not their strength its going to be very very important and they have got to limit their live ball turnovers out of bounds with a lemon to shoot for Wake Forest the efficiency offensively for that man Steve Forbes hes one of the better offensive coaches in the nation Earl Grants defense has got to be tenacious theres no doubt about it they get great spacing on the break whats the step back here with Carr for a three a play we could see later on especially in any type of late game situation steal by Zachary in the open floor and he finds Ashton Lake for a good distribution by Jayden Zach you know I said this to Jayden Zachary today hes one of the best coast to coast guards that Ive watched this year and Ive watched a lot of basketball certainly in the ACC tactic gave it up perfect I praise Zachary with his 27th steal thats number one on BC its only shooting 37 percent idrith with the drive and a foul the hands of Jaden Zachary are so good because hes strong hes physical thats a great reach and monsantos got to be stronger with the ball but look at Zachary the eyes are up hes seeing the defense I talked to him earlier today team the defense I talked to him earlier today he sees the defense very early when hes pushing the ball up skip pass by Hildreth out of bounds Mildred part of this offense that has been so effective in Steve Forbes since coming over from East Tennessee State an impressive resume while impressive is that sweater vest right there all right he didnt even have to change clothes from being outside fortunately it wasnt rated too hard Steves a great great coach Ive known him for 30 plus years since he was at Barton County he has come up the hard way never a silver spoon in his mouth and has done a fantastic job a lead base slices through the lights gotta dunk Prince you gotta dunk that Prince Ellsworth strong drive to the cup with the left hand great drive he averaged four and three last year hes one of the most improved players in the ACC Cameron hilders no doubt about it really really strong physical attacks The Rim the three by Ashton Langford is too strong a league Bay with a rebound to Demar Langford and langfords been one of the better BC players the last three games as a foul is on the Deeks I saw Matthew Marshs first okay watch now as Demar Langford makes this catch okay he gets the rebound I want you to watch his eyes Okay finish through the contact okay dont drop your head dont just ease it up there see it all the way through its a huge huge part of it getting better at scoring at The Rim and you had an interesting observation about players not finishing on layups earlier at shoot around but his numbers have been much better the last three games oh hes effective now hes good he you know what hes got for a younger players got a very good shoulder bump uh theres guys in the NBA dont have as good as shoulder bump as hes got to Great contact and create some separation when he goes to the basket the trouble is sometimes he Fades too early on his shot you like what BC is doing picking up I love it I love it I mean this is this is one way to create the pace of the game without without allowing them to come down and get comfortable in their driving kick game Zachary against Carr height differential for Andrew Carr that one against the 61 Jade Zachary Post in the pose for Ashton Langford he got flustered and a bump goes out of bounds Earl Grant formerly at College of Charleston eight games under 500 a piece hes still rebuilding a culture in Chestnut Hill but you know what I like about both of these programs especially with Earl and his staff are doing theyre getting better I mean theres theres a player development plan at Boston College and thats why hes going to win he had it at College in Charleston thats why he had the success that he had there he left that program in fantastic shape and Pat Kelseys done a great job with it there and thats the sign of a great leader thank you shooting is in short supply early for the Eagles one for five for the field and theres a three by our Spotlight Player Ty Apple dont quit youre not gonna be able to go under the pick and roll on Tyree Appleby you just cant go under hes got too good a vision it was like giving him a layup right there seven for 81 on three pointers thats 45 percent Lankford skips it to his brother Makai Zachary off the dribble at the foul line see thats the shot that Zachary has got to be ready to shoot Zachary never really gave himself a chance to make that three and thats the kind of play Boston College has got to have what a place by Applebee to Marsh now this is where this is where you need a basket right now its early in the game but you need to establish youre going to go inside get some movement get a foul or get something into that paint cannot take a a jumper early here coach Marsh is 40 for 45 for the field oh hes so good around the bucket I mean hes strong he rebounds the ball he creates space in there bumped by post gets doubled by the big men and he picks up contact well well give him credit because they could have called the travel he shuffled his feet but hes going to the line exactly what they had to do all right Grace C on ESPN here we go Tyree Appleby sets up like hes going to refuse to go to his right Zacharys caught in his shoes Tyree Appleby pops it behind the line of the screen and look at his eyes this is what Im talking about with responsible Freedom hes pushing hes changing speeds and Direction Marsh is running the floor he finds him eyes were up the whole way thats where he has improved so much his delivery of the basketball John is so much better than what it had been the last couple years at Florida and thats if hes going to continue to be the efficient guard that hes been inside the ACC for Steve Forbes hes got to continue to play that way foul before the break Matthew Marsh she has two so an early foul trouble for the Deeks and you saw him he had a birds eye view of Appleby when you were coaching at Georgia why has he got better well I think hes playing efficient I think hes hes become a much better extension of what Steve Forbes wants I think he feels a comfort level from watching him play and what Steve does is he starts to get away from it a little bit starts to try to do too much he pulls him back and I think thats important what a pass on the break by Kim eldrith who goes coast to coast and finds Monsanto that was easy yeah no question about it and and when you look at Davion Bradford in the game now when he runs like that thats what losing 40 pounds will do from you hes dropped 40 pounds since transferring from Kansas State to Wake Forest Apple be the corner three Bradford there he is theres your put back he has four points off their bench well John that wasnt the lob that he was that he was asking for from BJ Mackey today and asking why is he getting lobs but hes finding a way to dunk the ball he keeps playing like that hes going to get some lops hes going to get more minutes Elite baby for three and thats a nice development for BC they needed that very much so when he lines up like that because hes their the best player they have in the middle of the floor when you put him in the foul line situation when he can stretch that back to three hes really gonna take steps Ive been really impressed with Princes Improvement in the last month well he comes with an impressive resume out of high school at Minnehaha Academy a Minneapolis as it goes out about its busy ball yeah when you think about the guys hes played with Jalen Suggs Chet Holmgren its a lot of talent in Minnesota he played a great Au program for buying stamp Brian Sanford and he hes uh hes really come along I mean hes you can tell he was the last guy off the floor today John he was working with the coaches after the Walker was over Wake Forest was coming on the floor thats when he left thats impressive McLaughlin with a ball hes been excellent off PCs bench Zachary the drive gotta shoot that youve got to shoot that Jade and shoot the ball does a great job of getting to the rim he had a layup he had a good look and he hinders the progress of Hildreth past half court and draws the foul see this is an example he does Jaden is a Jaden Zachary is a very good straightline player okay hes there just score with your left hand youve got the man beat all right take it into Bradfords body okay take the foul Music thats frustrating for a coach isnt it well because I really have a lot of respect for him uh he won a national championship hes from Salem Wisconsin Donnie Tyndall did a fantastic job with him in junior college and Earls done a great job with him here three by Hildreth and the rebound for McLaughlin McLaughlin one of the top men off ACC benches this year but hes a real winner hes from South Forsyth Georgia they won a lot of games I think they won 1718 in a row at one point uh hes made himself a much better player and I think hes going to be a legitimate threepoint shooter for them and a steal Eagles get it back Ashton Langford to TJ Bickerstaff who checks It Off the Bench and the foul line jumper off the mark what Id like to see TJ do with that just take that thing to the basket and create a collision at The Rim put the pressure on the referees to make a call and just go out hes got to play with more confidence Music dribbling by Applebee will be at the Baseline finds Davey and Williamson he can score Runner no good Applause good drive again straight line drive with man what a womans basketball matinee double ahead for you tomorrow on ESPN on the app Aaliyah Boston to number one South Carolina hosts 144 Missouri at one Eastern and its the Tobacco Road robbery game between number 11 NC State number 22 North Carolina should be a terrific afternoon of Hoops on ESPN thats four highlevel teams tomorrow afternoon yes please four highlevel coaches as well what a season thus far in womens basketball on the mens side The Narrative nationally is its anybodys ball game and I think thats exactly why I think its truly the case yeah because everybodys got to go on the road in League Play so just checks in for BC and the rebound put up and in by Devin McLaughlin yeah see thats where where Mason right there wide open hold your follow through Mason stick your Landing dont fall back shoot that ball with confidence its been a great pushback mclaughtons seven points per game and 17 minutes Hildreth outstanding pass to Bradford the Kansas State transfer we got a foul on the Eagles well Cameron Hildreth is uh absolutely a steal recruit for Steve Forbes okay hes done such a fantastic job and and the bottom line he drives it a straight line great cut eyes are up makes the pass right into Davion Bradford all he didnt get was the Finish but but Hildreth is a problem a real problem word that comes to Mama watching everybody on this wave team is Savvy well crafty exactly and Cameron Hilger to go from averaging four and three a year ago to being over 12 now I think hes the leading rebounder on this team yeah I mean thats a big big step Steve Forbes was telling me today he credits his one of his closest friends Nick nurse uh for Cameron Hildreth because Nick when he was playing a coaching in England and the air ball by Bradford Cameron hildreths dad played for the Brighton Bears who Nick nurse coached before he was in the G league in the NBA and because of their relationship thats how he ended up with Steve Forbes what a story what a great friend I need some friends like that should have called on Nick nurse a little bit more right Stephen Nick go they go way back to the cornfields of Iowa way back Applause blocked and overzealous for the pass and a turnover Eagles have been pretty good with a basketball this year 12 Turners per game but your old Grand told us the key to this game is limiting live ball turnovers no question and this is not a good turnover but at least its a turnover okay I liked it because it was off of a cut which they need to get and it was an opportunity to set their defense the live ball turnovers are where wake is fantastic Wake Forest is riding a 310 the scoring drought were averaging over 74 points per game Applebee her car gets doubled by Madison and McLaughlin the defense by The Eagles car though takes advantage over McLaughlin you know what he did John he kept that ball up the entire time he didnt have an outlet he didnt force it but he never dropped the ball where BC could strip it from him clocked it off the pass for Bickerstaff and a baseline foul so BC is shooting 30 percent Wake Forest 54 four point deficit for the Eagles transfer an impact early for the day well he really didnt for a guy of 40 percent of his shots or threes all right hes very comfortable down here he does a great job of not forcing the ball he keeps the ball strong he keeps the ball high if he kept that if he if he took an uh uh I tried to Pivot across he would have never got it off he kept it strong he went up he finished through the contact it was moderate that made a great play thats what theyve got to have around the bucket from Andrew Carver hes been fantastic they didnt expect that much offense from him at least for the first half of the season but double figures in 10 games is productive for Steve Forbes heres Mason Matson who needs to get his offense going for the Eagles yep thats a good strong catch you know any ability to get Mason mats you just get it just get another step closer to the bonus our our rule the thumb we wanted to be in that bonus both halves all right by the 12 minute Mark every chance we did every chance we could and Zachary Off the Mark with a threepoint attempt when Zachary scores BC is successful theyre 40 when he scores 16 or more in 18 against Notre Dame January 3rd that was a season High pretty much won the game for the Eagles well when hes playing with confidence I think hes an X Factor for this team I mean he might be the X Factor for this team agreed Williamson flexion Here Comes Zachary in transition great block Williamson did not get a great jumper up there he just kind of cast it like he was open Applause when William said sipping into it when hes getting good lifts you know basically I mean hes so comfortable shooting on a spotup shot and thats whats got to happen see theres no real lift here all right great clothes I mean a great closeout by Mad City all right he jumps when he jumps gets his hand up all right locks it with the right hand fantastic doldruth thats blocked again by Madison oh my goodness not known for his defense not known for his black shots for sure Demar Langford Zachary now to Madison Eagles patient offensively good look for Matson falling back again thats where madsens got to step into it he hops into his shot okay and when you hop into your shot you gotta still get great lift with your left foot and when he doesnt get that lift he Fades early the ball is squared its just its just not going in hes just got to go a little bit more compact but you know what who needs offense when Jaden Zachary is blocked in shots theres the offense okay dont fall back go straight great followup by post keeps the ball high doesnt bring it down all right great job of Madsen jumping when he jumps he had the verticality that went straight up all right we must have a hidden wingspan in there that Madsen has he must be in that plus five category that we didnt recognize she keeps it in his back pocket three stretches like that that helps their defense its gonna make those guys think about it second foul moments ago on Zachary in the long distance shot by a guy who loves to hit the three Monsanto he has amazing range he does and thats thats where he showed it all right and he was challenged he followed through he knocked it down high level shooter and the quick pose capitalizes in the post that was quick post came across that lane great finish all right show it was in his stance the whole way Bobby Clinton good luck for him that was wide open and thats the way Forest offense perfectly executed absolutely absolutely when they get up they dont need a lot of passes they just need to get the ball reversed they need to swing it what wake does a phenomenal job of is they get to their spots when theyre going to get to the corner they get to the corner they dont cheat it and they cut hard they cut purposefully and how about the ferocity on defense by Andrew Carr so their defense turning it offense Appleby off the dribble flustered by post Monsanto brimming out hes one of the hottest Shooters of the country could attempt to save by Bobby Clinton Music how about hildren setting up Clinton I love it he moves hes got a great feel okay he came over and played at Sunrise Christian its a very good sign another guy that understands the game you can tell hes been well trained in his past before he came to the United States I love his feet I think hes going to be a really really good shooter uh for Wake Forest his as his career goes on and certainly as this season goes on equipment averaging four points and three and a half rebounds post gets cut off great pass Matson do tomorrow Langford it sure was what I like about Madison right now hes playing basketball hes missed a couple of shots but hes getting assists hes getting blocked shots that will play well in the video session wont it oh he needs it he needs his confidence because I said to him today Ive said to you today when we were at Georgia he was in Cincinnati we would damn game plan for his threepoint shooting yeah that was we were afraid of his range we were afraid of his ability to make threes that was a revelation here comes with Kai Ashton Lankford in transition missed opportunity against opportunity hes got to make that play empty possession Appleby fakes the three Clinton got it wide open for Bobby Clinton last nine points for Wake Forest a bit on threes thats static disparity BC One for seven from Beyond The Arc and we have a timeout idiot timeout but Bobby Clinton has been instant offense again and heres Tyree Appleby okay makes a great kick out gets in the paint had a pullup difference between those that have a little number next to their name and no number not very much theyre having points with Tom Karen Im John me to Perell and cam Hildreth part of this Wake Forest offense which is ultra efficient well he gets a lot done hes tough hes physical he could score uh he can drive the ball when he adds the passing element to his game hell be that much of a better player because its in there I dont think theres any doubt about Steve Forbes said the same thing today steel they trap at the steal but then take it away for a moment by quit post but out of bounds up close to mikayash to Langford moments ago an empty possession exactly see here you get into the paint go buy Applebee dont broad jump and take the layup take one more dribble and go by the defender and then youre getting a clean layup the broad jump is so hard you got to be perfect on a broad jump Andrew or Marsh rather finds Hildreth and the floater is good oh is he good hes good somewhere the Brighton bears are proud to be watching this guy tonight somewhere live streaming would you say Brighton you know Brightons down the road here in Massachusetts were talking a little bit further away from Massachusetts across the ocean AdSense three Trading on Seto a rare Miss hes good in transition but the better play for Monsanto would have been to drive it Hildreth has got so much strength I mean he credit the weight program that they have there gets in that straight line see he almost used the shoulder bump he didnt quite need it he goes up and heres one thing a lot of young players do they get that close they dont extend and finish their shot gilker did just like that they are so good in their Baseline out of bounds plays if getting rollbacks slips uh Steve Forbes spent a lot of time with one of the better baseball out of bounds coaches in the in college basketball and Bruce Pearl and he certainly took some great ideas from him and added his own wrinkles to it because hes phenomenal and out of bounds place and its off the hinges for BC foul on Quint post heres our big 12 sec super Tuesday doubleheader we start with the sunflower showdown in Manhattan Jalen Wilson at number two Kansas taking on chiante Johnson number 11 Kansas State at seven Eastern an Oscar shoot way in Kentucky owes Georgia both games on ESPN and the app and they should be outstanding Music get the ball screen now the Lanes open now the lane is open for Appleby thats when hes at his best great dump off to Andrews car and girl Grant flummoxed by what hes seeing a nine to nothing Run for the leaks and Ty Applebys having his way with the BC defense Applause Music tie Appleby outstanding well I think hes so good he got the random ball screen here late in the clock all right the roller car gets into what we call the alley his butts to the Baseline the defense loses him they step up which is not what Earl Grant wants Earl wants to guys to step across not up and another turnover Applebee athletic how about that thats a tough finish my goodness thats a tough finish he got air on the ball Im not a big finger roll guy but that one was beautiful hes putting on a clinic showing you why hes a possible ACC Player of the Year a league Bay looking for the hometown bow see thats the one you dont need and so and and Prince is going to be able to make that shot you dont need a one pass three to break the momentum that they have right now at wake car why not everything else is going right for the dicks this is where youve got to get to get a ball inside okay he just called a timeout see if you can if you can stand the tide to the four all right attack the Zone get the Zone overloaded foreign Applause run Ashton Langford snaps it thats a good answer thats a good answer if theyre going to see The Zone continuously theyre going to have to play through the middle get the ball swung out find a way to overload it Master Langford leads BC in scoring 123 per game only is 123 and 47 attempts Apple beat a car hes feasting why is that happening well because hes in the role and because theyre because theyre so concerned right now about the shooters of wake that something was going to have to give tonight all right theyre on the shooters which is what theyre supposed to do but its basically a two on two game in the lane because theyre going after Apple being the ball screen boy they are so fantastic on the offensive end when its going in the right direction good seal good finish Lankford stay with it strong cant finish did the hard part come on guys reward him with something thats a couple plays at The Rim give them a foul youre calling for a foul I am calling hes right here and Id be calling if I was over there three by Jamari Monsanto Bickerstaff goes up and theres contact well one one thing Steve does he changes defenses when you call it time out went to the Zone got the steal great thanks very much Talon long first time for BC thus far as Steve Forbes offense has been phenomenal shooting 55 as they double Jade Zachary there you go now its overloaded there you go weve got to find a way to attack the middle a foul on Ty Appleby was that a good call uh yeah yeah uh I think one thing I love to do against the 131 is go in there and seal the middle man all right because youve got to make you cannot let the middleman here in the case of Carr just be a oneman Zone okay and thats a good foul because youve either got a seal and play there or youve got to catch the ball at the foul line all right and then space everything down to the corner because once the ball goes into the middle of the floor okay now its basically becoming a 23 Zone a 131 basically becomes a 23 once it hits that middle and now you can play out of it and thats where you have a chance to run an overload by bringing somebody across in a Flash the Eagles have left a lot of points at the foul line this year only 67 percent as a team as Zachary hits two just got to stem the tide its a 15point game with three minutes left in the first half its a long game the hardest thing for players to understand youre not getting it all back in a couple of possessions you just cant have empty or live ball turnover possessions Applebees Nifty to car car has been a handful on the post well hes whats so versatile in the sense that that he can play Four he can play five hes very comfortable around the rim he makes threes hes playing with really really good purpose for boys certainly is with 13 and five already unlocked in the jump car tries to keep it alive hes doing it on both ends Applause great pass again Appleby I could say it a thousand times he plays with his eyes up now thats somewhere where hes improved so much and that looks simple but when youre dealing with a couple of Defenders all right hes not thinking about scoring hes thinking about making a basketball play and thats so important lets see if Langford gets something here going to the rim CJ Pena on the floor for the Eagles Off the Bench for Earl Grant double Pena nice beneficiary pass CJ Pena is an important player hes older hes been around he looks pretty tough to me and he can make threes in a driving kick spotup type of action if they get it especially against the Zone excellent pass by Devin McLaughlin Applebee driving a glockton with the board Here Comes Makai Ashton Langford oh boy he slices Applause you know what he did Johnny kept his eyes up he scored it with his left hand he kept his eyes up he finished with his eyes youve seen that throughout his games this year hes not finishing and well enough with his eyes well what he likes to do oh boy another one car cars just right now theyre just theyve got a middle game theyve got a baseline game and when youve got a baseline game in the middle game like they have right now where Carr can float in and out of those areas they got five Shooters on the floor right now John thats what makes this this team so hard because you can get hooked up on your man quickly good luck for Jake Zachary Nails the open three and an answer after the car dunk but Carr has 15 first half points wow hes doing a great job now okay as you drop into this defense you drop it into the Zone where is the man on the Baseline offensive foul says Lee Cassell on cam hildred a little momentum for the oh no question again and take open threes dont hunt threes all right great job great look by hildred thats why this young guy is going to be such a good player because thats not an easy pass but he plays with his head up hes an unselfish player and cars doing a great job of getting lost behind the defense you see with a 72 run Zachary open three CJ Pena its a good three though John thats a good three he can make that three its a wide open driving kick three and they track down the loose ball rebound now thats their their strength is not threepoint shooting at that time right there Jaden Zachary rather than driving the defender hes got to swing that ball to Madsen for him to either be able to shoot it or make the next pass bow on chin Zachary and we will take a timeout as the Eagles Try to claw back in down by 12 is Saturday January 21st a little bit of everything this month on ESPN ABC ESPN Deportes and ESPN plus I love this right here John theyre bringing the pressure theyre not in an allout lets trap uh that theyre in a situation where theyre making them take some time off theyre not letting them get comfortable and heres where theyve got to Bear down and not allow car to get behind the defense and not lose somebody like spotting up high like here right now we have with Monsanto uh steal by Chaz Kelly first action for him to paint you for the reverse weighin Kelly the painting in transition thats a good play they over penetrated it great hands great finish paying just going to bring a lift I I know we got 20 seconds but he did a really good job of coming in here bringing some toughness to the game as Chaz Kelly she has made four of its last five shots Applause holding for the last shot of the half watch car get to the Baseline up will be the take rebound to BC Here Comes Kelly just shot but a boost for BC on both ends of the floor well they did a really good job of coming back and and again theyre going to get open looks the matter is dont shoot them quick but wake has got this is a great time personally help us a little bit if they tend to do that last question is there anything you do to to put some pressure on the referees to get you to the foul line well we havent got there yet so I mean I guess we got there twice and I hadnt scored probably the first time in a long time we havent you know scored at the free throw line we got to get there because uh were good at that all right Steve thanks very much good luck thank you Wake Forest with a 10point Advantage as the Eagles have the basketball tomorrow Langford over to Jayden Zachary from 12 but he Nails it so BCs good offense booming continues right there its like thats it they reversed it they played through the middle or played through the post get it out textbook pull up jump shot by Jaden Zachary now if youre a grant the locker room at the first half what are you telling your offense well we got to keep we got to keep Wake Forest off the free throw line if if Boston College can keep them from getting open threes and lock into that but not put them on the foul line because theyre phenomenal retro shooting team theyre gonna be right back in and then one opportunity for cam Hildreth hell go to the line our halftime stats headlined by the threepoint shooting of the Deeks Eagles missed nine but plus two rebounding Edge for BC well then thats going to be key in this game and and they dont get a ton of offensive rebounds that everyone that they get just adds to the bonus of where theyre at with their rebounding but this is an important Play Because Sugars got the drive the bucket and the foul so right away theres a foul committed by Boston College and we played 45 seconds if I was on tomorrow Langford Eagles were their Originals starting five The Langford Brothers Quentin post Jaden Zachary and prince olige and a steal by Ty Appleby who was ubiquitous presence throughout the first half and a kickball lets revisit our keys to the game Tom okay well the bottom line is theyve gotten some open threes mansanto has not had a lot of open threes theyre doing a really good job of guarding him and and he cant start hunting him the rebounding game has been very good in the sense now wake has got them at the at half they had him 2416 on points in the paint obviously thats an advantage wake if Boston College has got to continue to defend tough doldrith misfire and a foul on the Deeks thats on Andrew Carr who had a terrific first half of 15 points yeah and that thats the kind of thing dont just defend the threepoint line the way that they are but Im sure part of Earls message at halftime and video at halftime was how theyre going to make sure that they take care of of Carr or Marsh in that alley and how they dont give up easy rolls to the rim the marsh was quiet not so much with tar though to Langford quick on the fire I think so I think so I mean youre right in this game the strength of his game has now come off screens catching shoot threes early in the clock you know this is a team when you got Demar when youve got Makai when youve got Prince get the ball into the paint all right and then make the driving kick which will free up more space for post once they start reversing the ball now you got a chance to get Post in a oneonone you dont need put threes and you also have three fouls on quit post and Applebee converts very good play hes getting great jump on his jump shot he releases it at the top of his jump did a great job of using the backboard he had six first half assists proving wise a strong candidate for Player of the Year in the conference well hes efficient I mean you could be theres no question thats where his game has turned so much nice play by Prince nice nice fight he and Demar Langford are the best on the BC team in my opinion of making plays in that tank whether its a straight ahead jumper or turnaround jumper thats a nice play we talked to a mature around today whats the next step he Prince a league Bay has to take to become a better player dont hunt threes do be it be a be a legitimate guy cant get beat off the dribble like that cant be late on the switch gotta keep the dribble in front of him dont settle for jump shots dont make your mind up early that you have to score Let The Game come to you what great penetration by Mildred because we have a collision at our table Im sorry as a referee collides with Tom Applause hes Pacer Toms gonna play you okay Doctor here right at our table Music so get some help from cam Hildreth then coordinator of game operations Matthew Conway we might have an ankle roll here John yeah Justin Porterfield unfortunately colliding with a table good job on your part Tom to help the cause well Im not responsible for knocking over this curtain dont worry about me to help me are you okay oh Im fine okay he had I think he got his he got his ankle caught in the chair he did and hes gonna have to leave and Applause well Im gonna stay here with you John they dont want me refereeing on this game Im just gonna stay right here with you and well trust me too and handle it boy tie Appleby good Hustle but then Justin Porterfield just doing his job wides with our table yeah he did he did watch his ankle watch his ankle hits gets it caught I hope its not the knee I think its the ankle my goodness Im not a doctor and I didnt stay at a holiday in express last night but youve seen enough ankle injuries in your lifetime to know that thats dicey for Porterfield but theyll teach you that officiate it Ive collided with a ref but never from the TV table so but the table broke his fall unfortunately his foot got caught in the chair we certainly hope hes okay so its lead Cassell and also Tony Henderson Im gonna go with hes gonna get it taped up Im gonna go with hes gonna be back I think hell be by yeah all right I think Paul brazo and and Brian Kersey they they they raised some great refs now in the ACC those are tough guys all brazo former assistant at BC great guy great guy Brian Kersey as well they do a terrific job Brian Kersey retired from officiating it it wasnt a plus for officiating but it was a plus for the ACC and running the league theres some really good coordinators of officiating in the country Mike eats Terry Weimer Brian Kersey those guys do a great job so whats it like that kale now with two officials as Chaz Kelly misses well yeah lead Cassell and Tony Henderson in the jump ball that was not the shot that you need coming off of a dead ball timeout like that good job going for the basketball two hands on the ball thats just a good hustle basketball play and Im sure Steve Forbes is going to be happy that mensado was inside of that because I think he is way better than a guy thats got four offensive rebounds than 16 free throws Applause Music Applause been there well Ive got to get a better look at it I thought personally they were going to call Carrie on Appleby I thought he I thought he put the ball I thought he put the ball in the center of his hands but well get a look at it here he comes off the ball screen see I thought the ball stayed in his hand right there all right but he went into the body 5050 call as Matthew Marsh has called for the foul his first the drive by Victor stop but out of control at the hoop yeah now you see you got to come to two feet right there and go up and power it you cant shoot that ball with a left hand with your eyes dropped Andrew Carr that was made 10 of his last 11 shots Applause what an addition to the portal for Steve Forbes coming out of Delaware a league Bay finds Ashton Langford got it great three great job by Prince didnt Panic got the ball delivered an on time on target pass to Makai Ashton Langford in the corner that thats the kind of three you want Applause Ashton Langford the only Eagle in double figures but a counter by Wake Forest and thats how you enter or counter a three in the corner you come back you get a straight line drive you go to the basket Sam Hildreth he has been a load Applause erth Prime candidate for ACC most improved player deep three by Ashton Langford what happened you dont need that you dont need that brief is he open yes but its a 12point game get the ball reversed play through the paint then you get the kind of plays that he just got in the corner on the print at the pass from Prince Chaz Kelly in transition drops it off for a Lee Bay missed opportunity for BC no such thing as a 12 point bucket no no and that was a tough play he went up strong good defensive positioning there verticality page Away by Damar Lankford brings us to a timeout the kai Ashton with a three wow like this like look at Prince he goes to it he looks its not there makes the kick out wide open banged it great play Makai Ashton Langford fans enjoying the action at Connie Forum this is giving him a little bit to cheer especially the last minutes of the first half Tom crean inbounds for Appleby and Wake Forest car on the step back for a threes up ripped it to the basketball whos had limited minutes for the Eagles in his first year in a BC uniform well theyre searching right now and hes got Davion Bradford inside so got a chance to get up in the Picker roll I like this roll hard get to the alley thats a good play thats a good three and a nice play Applause the ball they got into the pick and roll crediting for the screen Applause eight for nine you saw for Andrew Carr and seven rebounds lower leg injury for Tony Henderson Justin Porterfield is on the floor as an official with Lee Cassell so you wish Tony Henderson the best is he collided with the scores table moments ago and Hildreth the fade away three that was outstanding wow hes as they would say he is in his bag and I didnt know that was in his bag I didnt know the step back pull up three was part of his game but he is going to be a player in college basketball for Wake Forest 14 points and four assists Chaz Kelly misses the three the rebound for Bradford Yep this is right now keep understanding theres a lot of game we dont need to get out of character BC put some stops together come down get the ball inside get the ball inside out make place Applause thats a difficult team to defend Bradford and hes got it thats a really good play by Hildreth I didnt think he was going to make that pass after the shoulder bump he didnt he couldnt create the space made the pass to Bradford basically the second half of the Florida State game Steve Forbes just got Hildreth in any isolation that he wanted here comes the turnovers rearing their ugly head Appleby quick trigger but the rebound for Williamson and the drive Baseline my goodness what a play by Ty Appleby Applause Music Applause he missed the three he got the kick out the old Tyree Appleby wood he just shot that again okay this one got it Brent to the rim hes going to get a threepoint play hes playing so effective he changes speeds he changes hands hes playing with his eyes up hes finding different people hes got extremely quick hands that was a great finish and the bottom line with Appleby hes all over the floor all right thats a play in the past he could shot it again he recognized who he had on him drove it to the rim gets the end one and they build the lead back up to 18 thanks to a seven to nothing run they matched their largest lead of the game now its their largest lead at 19 yeah you cant we dont need okay if Im were BC we dont need those quick threes from Chaz Kelly what we need is to continue to move the ball and if Chaz gets it off reversal great in the defense look to get something in the paint that creates that creates traffic twin post does three fouls hes on the bench hey triple drive by Ashton Lankford and an offensive foul yeah thats thats where Makai has got to take one more dribble and that situation probably come to a two foot jump stop and go up but he would be such a more effective layup maker such an effective layup maker he comes to that jump stop or it takes one more dribble whatever it needs to be and then especially when hes driving on the left side with his right hand dont spin the ball get it high up off the glass great point on your part youve talked about that the shoot around spinning the ball is detrimental for him well it is you know he he gets there he does a great job of going left three by Hildreth are you kidding me in the contact my goodness what a shot by cam hildren I tell you what Steve Forbes I dont know what he got Nick theres for Christmas but Id probably double it all right because that is thats a great friend that finds you Cameron Hildreth this guy uh he he you know what thats a tough shot not a great closeout the presence of mine to be able to hold his follow through to stick his Landing all right when hes being run out in the corner thats not an easy shot youre in the corner youve got the guys at the end of the bench standing right there with you thats a heck of a play seven points shy of his season best third Wake Forest player with a triple double he did it earlier November 26th against Hampton at home in a route now utilize post youve got him back in here you go get it in the middle good roll thats a good play Music its in the Cincinnati transfer not bad all right a challenge shot but hes going to the foul line but played through the played through the middle yeah what a womans basketball matinee double header we have for you tomorrow on ESPN on the app the Leah boss to the number one South Carolina they host 144 Missouri one Eastern then its the Tobacco Road robbery game between number 11 NC State number 22 North Carolina should be a fantastic afternoon of Hoops as it always is on ESPN well and going back to our referee with Tony Henderson hes been dealing with with some things uh in that lower leg injury I feel bad for him and if hes back there watching the game right now were pulling for you to be back out here certainly are that was a rough Collision right next to you at the scores table here comes the kai Aston Langford punched Away by Appleby good Hustle by Ty Appleby doing it both ends of the floor floor and a happy reaction from the Deeks they should be happy yeah salute cam Hildreth he hit that from Brighton and England to complete the fourpoint play now thats a scrub I dont know he might be he was pretty good today Ill tell you what he is Steve Forbes is a heck of a basketball coach yes he is and he has done it the hard way hes never been handed anything Ive known him since he was at Barton County Community College Applause Music Applause and it was better followthrough and he got lifted he shot a jump shot there he stepped into it on the Move shot a jump thats his first three of the game the six for the Eagles I Wake Forest has made six of their last seven shots and theres a three for Damian Williamson well the passing is just contagious it starts with Applebee but Hildreth is doing a fantastic job wake is always in movement right now and when they get into the pick and roll game they challenge you to decide who is going to take the roll man and they always make the next pass tonight time theyre shooting 71 percent in the second half Ashton Langford short Hildreth the board what theyre doing is theyre getting great ball reversal theyre getting two three reversals every time which just keeps spreading because because Boston College is on them but theyre playing the game up high all right what a drop thats an Appleby good finish how does he knife through the defense well because he keeps the dribble alive he keeps his eyes up hes very good at changing speed and changing direction and he doesnt pick the dribble up early in the paint thats a big difference Applause hes a tough riddle to solve for any defense Quentin posed back in with three fouls Aston Langford just hoisting it will yeah we dont need this theres still a lot of time theres 10 minutes left what you need is to keep getting the ball reversed get an inside out type of three you got to get to the foul line youre not gonna win this game and come back in this game youre shooting jump shots Eagles eight trips the line theyve made seven of them dildren finds cars had a great night a Davion Bradford and a foul says Lee Cassell on Mason Matson about what Appleby does here the eyes stay up very very good at changing direction doesnt pick the dribble up early uses the board and thats a great example of shooting a high reaching layup right he got the ball high up off the glass not a great board lamp but he didnt short arm his shot and he didnt pick his dribble up early cant stress that enough how many shots are missed because guys pick that dribble up too early 47 points from that Trio and really what you have with Carl at 15 and a half hadnt missed a shot hes just out here happy to be playing hes not trying to have his career night hes just playing basketball theyre so poised at that offense thats so electric but efficient at the same time well they absolutely share the ball John and that that sounds easy all right theres a lot of coaches in there right now today around the country right now theyre watching that film though and their teams didnt share the ball the way it needs to be should be shared with each other and and and right now whats happening for Wake is they are getting lost in the game because they just keep moving the ball and it doesnt matter who scores it and Appleby sets the tone because of the way he can get to the rim because the way he can make threes but the way he continues to be on the attack which frees people up youve got to bring help to it Ashton Langford at the line Steve Forbes what was your reaction well deserved well deserved I thought it was a great get uh for Wake Forest uh what he did at East Tennessee State was phenomenal uh Steves a survivor man I mean hes just done a fantastic job and the same thing say about Earl Grant Earl is one of those coaches hes built his way up hes built himself as coach no one gave it the pedigree was that nothing was handed to him right you know they worked their way up and I think that comes out in both their teams and I know its not going great for BC right now but wake has got a hungry attacking basketball team Relentless Fearless NBC needs more of that the Mantra from Earl Graham from day one has been pretty not pretty well and and theyre getting better but but the problem becomes now thats not there that pass was not there and you know what started the whole thing Johnny didnt have his eyes up they brought the double team to him and he thought somebody was there he couldnt see it yeah program will get this thing turned more people need to come to these games this is a great atmosphere all right its a great atmosphere lets hurt them with those students on campus theyll be back on Monday well youre right theyve definitely cranked up some energy in the building and they cranked up the heat Ive been in some places that served with hockey when I was coaching in Milwaukee at the Bradley Center and we were in a in a building that also had a hockey team wed have to call its 6 30 in the morning for them to get the heat turned on so it would at least feel feel like 68 once we got there in the afternoon and they did it every time they were wonderful to work with but like this is a great environment in here it is it really is its just not theres just not as many people as should be but this team is going to get better Applause but a 24point lead for the jigs feels like Sarasota in there your own town Im not quite going with that but uh I dont I dont work well in Sarasota I can get out and run be on my bike do some of those type of things Im happy sitting right here I I got it because its not real warm outside no a winter day in New England thats for sure quit post double and he cant capitalize well thats a play where he probably didnt have the shot because the way they defended it but he needed a receiver to get into his vision instead of standing at the top of the slot Applause Appleby Clinton goes Baseline hildra thought about now he takes another one now had to beat the cam would have hit that one he wouldnt need to get Steve to get him out of the game and head straight to the 7Eleven to buy some lottery tickets for me to hit that one Dunkin Donuts do they sell lottery tickets I know were in a Dunkin Donuts area Cumberland Farms is a big area okay too there you go I know youre familiar with those in Bristol Connecticut oh yeah Williamson and the rebound for mcglockton so both teams struggling at the moment well no guaranteed part of Steves conversation that the TV timeout at the eight Mark is going to be go through the paint now theyre starting to settle for threes skipping a pass Madsen he Nails it there you go hes lined up it was an Inside Out Pass good skip pass both teams uh are very good skip passing teams Wake Forest had breakdown drills in it today and we have a timeout so Mason matzo with two threes off the BC bench Eagles Trail by 21 they have never LED in this one in Chestnut Hill Music I love it I love it heres why because he knew his team was starting to settle and think that this game is over he called the timeout early in the Florida State game because it was a game where they were just kind of going up and down the court not a lot of purpose he calls the timeout and the Wake Forest area that that Florida State game they went 17 of the next 21 possessions getting stops now again different time in the game Steve did a great job of getting their attention and my guess is he got it on this one as well theyve been scoreless for the last 3 15 Williamson can he snap it no he does not open three open three so thats not a bad play they went through the paint they ran a little bit of offense as coach you can live with that Miss three for eight on threes in the second half eight for 21 for the ball game a glockton and that will bring us to a timeout after the Wake Forest foul aim today for NC State and uh I think its that two of the last three games that hes gone in and played fantastic and hes a hard hard matchup and he and hes doing the job Clemson great example of a team thats kind of growing old together yes they are guys like Tyson Chase Hunter theyre getting better and better theyre a team they basically are playing I believe one transfer theyve got good freshmen but theyve grown old together which is important they remain undefeated and they will play Wake Forest this upcoming week that should be a great one at the Joel Mildred to Appleby air ball Tracked Down by McLaughlin Here Comes Zachary one man fast break yep good call good call you like the block I do well I like the fact Hildreth loves to get back and draw charges and hildreds is really good at it all right but thats a great call because he nipped him on the side so yep and uh its a good call but thats where you got a conference is thick well if youve got Clemson coming into wake on Tuesday night the students should start camping out no later than Monday morning right like get in there and and be excited about this team and what theyre doing is Wake Forest it was not just tonight I mean theyre for real that that offense is for real and that connection that they have together is for Real no question and they had 8 000 against Florida State the other night what a pass Mildred to Appleby they are a fantastic combination and thats how you get momentum back all right because the players sometimes dont understand how long the game is well the coaches know how long it is and a team can get back in it if you let your guard down and thats a great play by wake especially for Applebee after missing the three if a Kai Ashton langfords on the bench for BC after landing awkwardly you see trainer Nick collado working on him on the far side so Chaz Kelly mends the point for the Eagles and the hook by Quentin post and he had that Quentin post had that right away hes very good over his left shoulder he keeps the ball high Id love to see him cover more ground in the post on his dribble but just go up and shoot the ball play through Quentin post youve got time youll get some threes out of it just dealt with foul trouble he has three that was his first bucket of the second half he has eight points and a foul on the other end against the Eagles but Makai asks in Langford out of the ball game with an injury thats not good it comes down oh yeah gets his foot caught in there hopefully he can come back from that whether its Tony whether Tony Henderson whether its Makai weve had some foot issues tonight some some tough Landings yeah if you just join us through our two officials because Tony Henderson unfortunately collided with a scorers table and suffered a lower leg injury he remains we believe in the officials locker room we hope hes okay lets just lead to cell and Justin Porterfield as the officials well knowing that he missed the game because hes got plantar fasciitis and missed a game the other night to come out here and battle it certainly we want him to get better but that thats a thats a thats a straight Trooper now for uh or Brian kerseys referee crude coming out here and playing hurt one blemish for Wake Forest theyre only 50 percent off the line Chaz Kelly too strong Here Comes Appleby oneonone with Jaden Zachary the hop skip and the finish by car finally Andrew Carr he is terrific in the post see as a coach thats a clip if Im around Grant Im cutting that clip and I know Madison lost his shoe but they got three chances at a layup right there because BC didnt Sprint back and get side of that play and try to grab the ball okay you cant play all right based on this scoreboard okay this is where just get back in the play okay come on Prince come on get back in the play thats not going to play well in the video no and it shouldnt it should that doesnt mean theyre going to get the ball but you got to get back and get in the fight all right they got three chances it they at no foot shots and they make you thought they had a boost at halftime trailing by 10 theyve got the 18point deficit 10 and now its its a 20 with a league day misfiring Applause Music but BCs got to learn to do okay players have to learn to do is when somethings working stick with it lets not jump out of character and start shooting quick threes or getting threes off the move when thats not our strength is you allow a team like Wake Forest whos threes are not only a strength but theyre ball movement and their driving kick game is what creates it theres a good pass by Chaz Kelly The Freshman from Houston to post more what youre looking for absolutely absolutely and the bottom line is you dont rush the game five six minutes ago just keep letting it happen Tim Hilder is so under control he always makes the right play and a foul on Chaz Kelly youve remarked throughout the game that his floor vision is excellent and hes just composed well he is theres theres no doubt and I think hes gotten better with his vision filter tests throughout the year and again great guard play is contagious it really is you know when youve got great guards and Ive coached some everythings a lot better everythings a lot easier when you dont it gets way harder and Tyree Appleby sets the tone for this team with the ends well Steve Forbes sets the tone but Tyree Appleby sets the tone with that ball movement and hildreths and score he could deliver the ball and he looks like a guy that they enjoy playing with him post out of a mix for Earl Grant TJ Bickerstaff comes back in Bickerstaff has been quiet zero points four rebounds he only averages seven points per game but as BC moves along as theyre likely going to drop to two and five in the ACC they need bicker stop to pick it up though they do he needs to play with some confidence I mean he said from such a great family his grandpa Bernie bicker staffs one of the favorite people in basketball Ive ever met uh his uncle JB this guy wins uh his dads a phenomenal coach DJ is is certainly a better freethrow shooter than what hes shown at PC when you look at his numbers at Drexel just play with confidence go to the basket offensive rebounded trust your jumper in that lane trust your shot General thats yeah absolutely for the Eagles game its its part of his game now the old days he used to rely on that too much now thats become a weapon for him thats step back three good choice didnt have numbers now make the clock your friend all right take some time off the clock get this thing down to about 10 run some type of action put the game away that was the ninth threepointer of the game by Appleby for Wake Forest they averaged more than 10 per routing leading the ACC Bobby Clinton and he advantage hes number 10 for them a little thing but its a huge thing Bobby Clinton was ready to shoot the ball he was in the slot his feet were down he was ready to shoot the basketball Earl Grant takes a timeout its been a balancing act for BC but what about this at halftime now that thats a fivestar recruit oh theres no question theres no question I dont know how long it takes to train like that BYUs theyre gonna have to get back and take him off the line take away that transition game of Gonzaga last three wins have only come by a total of eight points John Peter Burrell is always from an Ithaca College Brad exactly Kevins a big fan of yours and its a good guy thats a good guy clearly the Harvard of Upstate New York thats what I heard and now you just verified it absolutely dont listen to anybody from Syracuse Ive already had a big win today over Colombia which I know doesnt sit well with Dallin cup but uh Tommy Hammer could Squad with a big one and theres a three for Jayden Zachary and those have been in short supply for the Eagles as their second half up with 39 percent for the field countering Wake Forest is 56 percent now Jaden Zachary is certainly a capable shooter didnt have his best night nice turn around nice turnaround what a night for Andrew Carr 21 points yeah he just fits what Steve Forbes does so well did a great job at Delaware defense in their tournament loss to Villanova last year when he put up 16 its in Carr hes a fighter you know what he is hes industrious thats a great thats a great term thats a great term he doesnt hunt shots but youve got to guard him in the lane you got to guard him in the postman you got to guard him with range and hes a problem as he comes up with a rebound still working hard but taken away by Zachary they are Relentless Wake Forest now theyve played well into doing so much of it without Marsh theres another three for Zachary and really the the crazy thing is damari Monsanto had three points tonight hed had 11 threes as we said in the open great Point eleven threes in the last two games and theyre up 22 with damari having three points if you came into this game and told Earl Grant that hed have three points hed take it no question no question about it thats uh thats that speaks to the the the overall play that they have with Wake Forest and how everybody is convinced that the best way to help this team is to make your teammates better looking ahead at next Saturday a Tobacco Road rivalry matchup on the ACC Network at five eastern its the second game of that college basketball doubleheader before that FSU admit at three youve got North Carolina hosting NC State and that is always a fantastic matchup that concludes the night for Andrew Cara well deserved Claws from Steve Forbes and Company now well deserved for the entire group really was they stay true to what they needed to do to be successful tonight Carr did so much in carrying them in the first half Appleby did a fantastic job and Im going to go back to this damari Monsanto a guy that makes a lot of shots never let if it distract him tonight from what they were trying to do now Forbes is emptied his bench saw that graphic seconds ago put up our crack Productions look at Monsanto in the corner look at him standing look how happy he is for his teammates thats the guy that had three points tonight all right we just saw me standing in the corner leading the cheers and thats what youre always looking for thats when you know youve got a real strong program so from pillar of post Wake Forest has dominated BC loved working with you John led by 10 at halftime it was a pleasure time love working with you as well look forward to more in the future and we thank our producer Russ Kenner director Mike Baker and our outstanding crew as Wake Forest approves to 135 and BC drops to eight and ten lets set it back to the studio Kevin kozu so lafonzo Ellison
