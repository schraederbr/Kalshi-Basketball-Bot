win against Clemson on Saturday one at the foul line with 1 second to go Virginia Tech coming in at 13 and seven and five and four in the ACC Duke winning the opening tip and we are underway and usually its a heck of a basketball game when these two get together here on the wing heres McCain gets it up top for Proctor he was the star on Saturday nailing those foul shots with 1 second to go filipowski off the window and thats going to spin out Mitchell has a block by ly kid its a big defensive start for the 610 senior ly kid Couture and padulla in that backourt both absolutely deadly beyond the threepoint line for the hokes absolutely are OB but lets look to see if Virginia Tech tries to get the basketball inside to put Kyle filipowski in some tough positions try to get him in foul trouble early there Shan padulla lost the handle on that but it was tipped by by Duke with 46 on the shot clock Duke coming in at 15 and four 6 and2 in the conference they have moved up to number seven in the pole after that outstanding victory over Clemson Padulas got to get a shot in the air on the Run flips it up there and He will draw the Applause Music foul first possession Kyle filipowski tries to challenge ly kid gets away with a little bit of a double dribble on that possession but ly kid not giving up on the play coming over getting the shot block ly kid has grown as a player here for Mike young as we see sha padulla whos also one of the most improved guys even though he had a breakthrough season a year ago continues to play great basketball this season padulla number four in the ACCC and assists and 39 beyond the threepoint line he comes in 14point shy of 1000 and Mike young likes to joke about him hes all gas he has no breaks but he did also say that he played his best point guard game of the season last time out look at the Duke starting line of filipowski very quiet Saturday against Clemson just nine points we talked about McCain just named the ACC rookie of the week Tyrese Proctor the man who iced Saturdays win at the foul line ice water in his veins hitting those two with 1 second on the clock and I know theres a lot of controversy about the foul well talk about that tonight Virginia Tech their starting lineup coutur padulla and kid they score most of the points for the hokes who are the best shooting team in the conference since ACC games got underway theres kid open underneath hell slam Applause it and a 4 nothing start for the hunkes tonight a great find from Sha padulla being patient but even more importantly ly kid being patient allowing the shot blocker to fly by and finish him with two hands Mitchell up top Foster with a pull up pop and gets that one to go kayb Foster playing about hour and a half from where I coached him in high school at oakill Academy a little bit down the road and this is what he does he is a knockdown shooter has struggled a bit but he gets his confidence going he can be special kid on the high post filipowski will spend most of the night leaning on him in the corner here comes Collins now on the drive and baron gets the easy one in close great recognition by MJ Collins seeing the shot blocker coming over the easy dump off to Robbie Baron who played one of his best games as a hokey last time out against Georgia 10 14 points nine rebounds for him hes typically around six and four so really came alive getting that big victory H 50 points from their front line guys from the four Court in that win lullah gave it up there Mitchell will collect the loose ball and here come the Blue Devils and a very quick strike on the opposite end by filipowski and thats something that can get filipowski going an easy bucket most of his opportunities are difficult to get he gets an easy one there that should get him going just nine points four rebounds against Clemson he was just off that entire game and on the cup heres Couture for the dunk thats not something that happens every day it doesnt happen every day but it did happen here a week ago and he had something to say to me afterwards because I simply asked him hey old man can you still dunk he show me twice now tip to filipowski getting that downstairs it does eventually come free mcain cant hit the short Applause jumper so the Hoke up by four Virginia Tech 10 and one at home so to your point its not just Duke they give headaches to on this floor theyve done it to a lot of people kid swooping into the lane to the left side filipowski really stayed home nicely and harassed him and he could not connect this sevenfooter squaring up on the basket now spinning still working hard and drops in a bucket and you can see the emphasis by the Blue Devils to try to get filipowski to basketball in space allowing him to work oneonone versus ly kid Mike young not going to double team filipowski he does not want to give these shooters from duke wide open looks vull with the drive and kicks got an open shooter and all next Collins whos had a difficult shooting career here Virginia Tech but knocks down that one easily and sha padulla who normally makes plays getting buckets right now finding his teammates doing a great job sharing the Applause sugar Mitchell to make a move he gets to the paint back outside Foster got it a threepointer on the money that confidence is going for Caleb Foster he got it midrange with was able to knock it down early and just like that he knocked down a three ball were talking about a 40 threepoint shooter getting his confidence going on the road down a freshman eight points a game maybe off to a big night tonight we shall see on the entry heres kid this is a good battle tonight filipowski and what a nice move that was off the window and a oneonone battle as you mentioned OB Mike young feels as though ly King can score against anyone they want to put Kapowski to test on that block telling you what neither one of these teams turn the ball over very much so there arent going to be a lot of stoppages in play tonight well Virginia Tech has played great offense as of late and theyve gotten off to a great start here on their home floor today Mitchell trying to drive on Baron who stayed home and the ball came free tough defensive stop there heres padulla Collins will he hit it again not this time and again hes had a devil of a time shooting it since coming to campus got off to a quick start with a Music triple long one again Foster he Nails another one from threepoint l k the Foster has it going right now three for three from the field knocking down two threes and this Duke team is different Obie you and I saw them at Pittsburgh when all their guys are hitting from the outside they are special Couture gets open to stra th Couture coming in at 43 at the threepoint line filipowski on that spin loves that move and hits another one well I can tell you right now flip probably has more production already before the first media timeout we cant even get to the media timeout because its been such great basketball action to start this game remember he took a shot to the throat here at the end to the victory last year by Virginia Tech big rebound by McCain quickly on the Reach In by Couture he commits the foul 1238 to go and a quick moving first half and weve had a number of great highlights to start this game off MJ Collins dropping it off and showing his goggles hes got the vision to be able to find teammates and hunor with the strong finish here in the castle that to him goes into his phrase it says we dont turn the ball over here that alone that sharpness from his team is helping him sleep at night guys he goes around practice saying exactly that over and over we dont turn the ball over here MIT with a kick out Jeremy roach whos coming off an ankle sprain a couple of games ago will drive it the short jumper left it on top of the rim young give him a second try here and the threepointer On Target by bror always the best time to shoot the three ball for offensive rebound the defense is collapsed into the painted area so youre normally going to be wide open and when Ryan young steps into the game you have to be accounted for where he is every time hes going to the offensive glass filipowski getting out for a breather he was working hard inside the paint potit will draw the foul and weve got another media timeout coming as theyre moving so quickly here 17713 an official time out and its not Virginia T by a nose either its an OB I dont make statements without receipts when I said this is the toughest place to play in the ACC that is because Ive done the research Ive talked to Armando Bott Ive talked to Reese beakman Miles Kelly all the guys around the ACC thats NA Dukes environment is unreal but its fun to play in Cameron indoors you enjoy it you enjoy you love going in there being uping player its not fun trying to come into the castle getting the win Duke has found that out firsthand how will this one play out tonight oti got hung up in the lane tossed it to Mid Court good save by padulla shot clock is at two they do swing it for the corner Baron in and out unable to hit it that would have lit this place up it really would have especially after the way that play started out looked like a busted play end up getting a very good look from a big time shooter in the corner Foster With A Little Fall Away off the front iron so Lokis 10 one at home just 1 and4 on the road but they have some very tough road games coming up in fact tonight begins a terribly difficult stretch for them which might determine whether they get to the NCAA tournament or not buta fouled on his way through the lane here with 1106 to go Obi as you mentioned I mean it is January 29th so I can start talking about the NCAA tournament Ive been against it the whole month of January however the Hokies do have two quad one opportunities this week of course Duke here on their home for Theon night and then they travel to Miami on Saturday so two qu one opportunities big week for the Hop gor trying to get Applause closer nickel on the drive and a loose ball taken away by the Blue Devils their defense has been Stout early leading 1713 McCain in for a basket Jared McCain The Freshman on a hard drive to open up a sixpoint lead for the Blue Devil Jared McCain the ACC rookie of the week showing that hes more than a shooter OB we watched him make big play after big play Saturday against Clemson he was the guy that brought them back in the midst of that second half when they couldnt get anything going offensively pulla trying to get started hes chilly out of the gates and a 10 nothing run the last three plus minutes here for the Blue Devils Kowski back in after getting a breather heres young young going in strong on PO but cant finish rebound plucked away second effort McCain there to grab the Music rebound boy already under 10 minutes to go in the first half you talk about flying by shot clock and four nice pass for young hell finish it tyes Brock is showing off his goggles as he gets into the paint drops the dime and the Blue Devils have responded we talked about how Rowdy this crowd can be but the Blue Devils have responded you talk about the Run nice F long jumper on the way but too strong by Barrett and right now its all Blue Devils pedal to the metal long one off the front of the iron wt drop for McCain padulla strong move draws the Whistle the reach in foul by Jared McCain this game started off with the bigs going at and Kyle filipowski going off the bounce using his strength and his size to finish over L kid however Len kid up to the task to go right back at flip and is able to get a basket with the left hand but its not only about the bigs tyres Proctor dropping dimes allowing Ryan young to get an easy bu and showing off his goggles a little bit too hes got the vision as well obul the junior out of Oklahoma and coming up next on ESPN its Texas taking on number four Houston thats at the Moody Center as soon as we finish up here which I think is going to be in about 11 minutes given the pace of this one OB who says that the young people have cut the cable we walk outside after shoot around today Nate Stevens right is in line at noon noon today at noon today to get into this game with a tip at seven he says oh this must be the notorious d o he has been watching OB this will go the other way how about Nate whos in undergrad here as a sophomore there he is he was here at noon time today it was about 35° out there my man Nate and he didnt even have on a coat look at him hes got his hoodie on but hes throwing up his VT and he is locked in excited about this game and we can tell you that Nate is an ESPN Watcher because he knows all about our broadcast well hes a great kid and passionate to put it mildly young just picked up his second foul padulla steps back no and hes off the mark early on thatll go the other way its Duke ball here leading 21 15 Hunter C OB weve got a great officiating crew on hand tonight there Valentine leak C and Doug shs as we get an opportunity to look at the line at 515 if you go up front you see Nate Nate Stevens jumping up and down trying to stay warm hes been outside thats right Nate find the camera as youve done so well Nate only a sophomore here showing his spe oh great play by pulla defensively but back to the Blue Devils will work it around and in the corner roach will connect for a three thats the guy OB Jeremy roach has played great against the instate teams from leeburg Virginia hes had success against Virginia Tech hes had success against the University of Virginia 22 points in his first game he ever played here and last year went for 19 points and 11 assists against the Hans hes not been able to practice a lot lately because of the knee and then the ankle injury but can always make a difference in there jumping to the other side of the iron beautiful move by l k Mike young told us hes old school he wants to see his guys playing with two feet in the he will throw the basketball inside to his big man and allow them to score the back by the way Mike young wearing a great suit tonight nice to see the suits for some of the coaches coming back little bump here Foster Applause no so the expensive threads are making a Music comeback approaching the sevenminute mark b top Nicholls Another Touch for lin kit averaging 14 on filipowski those two banging nice move there by Collins but the reverse wont fall for him 2417 Duke trying to add to that the blow by by roach that ankle looks pretty good ah yeah hes coming back a little gimpy though OB it looked great on offense but often times things hurt a little worse on defense yes and a whistle here with 649 to go he was he was grimacing coming back the other way you want to talk about development ly kid has great dick by to on the This Is Amazing by the way this is the last 100 meetings between Duke and Carolina coming up on Saturday they are separated by 45 total points thats incredible it absolutely is incredible and OB I can go back to the time when I was playing and even before that watching this rivalry would of course Dicky V on the call talking about the Duke North Carolina match up you always think about the receive Wallace Jerry stockhouse game at Cameron Indoor but going to miss Dicky V on the call but know that of course hes locked in 2617 Duke batted away and picked up by padulla H he need a run nice defense on the other end by McCain that was a great play by Jared Mccain not allowing that pass to get through getting back as mentioned of course the 19 annual dig by tal Gaya on May 3rd 2024 and he get opportunity to win a chance to go hang out with Dicky V at his home the house on the ranch oh come on man thats the way to roll believe me the great dick by to he miss him so much Collins with a jumper on the way hes had a nice first out he really has hes drawing with his confidence now in his sophomore year a fulltime starter normally takes on the toughest defensive challenge but has added some offense for the Hokies here as a Blake its really been the Duke defense thats been the biggest star so far here tonight they really have Mitchell working hard banging against nichel and traveling with it so Tyler niichel made him move those puppies and speaking of the Duke North Carolina rivalry this the young man that played in that rivalry a season ago Tyler nickel who was at University of North Carolina transferring up not known for his defense but stands his ground on that possession does a great job forcing Mark Mitchell to the Trav yeah typically makes his name Beyond a threepoint line pulla swings the pass for kid kid cant finish the play yeah accs leader in field goal percentage doesnt normally miss him up that close 66 got number one in the conference as we quickly approach the 5minute mark already filipowski Brock thir back to the big swung underneath Mitchell difficult angle no wins it back filipowski looked like he just wasnt expecting the pass he was not and had an easy one off to find from Mark Mitchell but give the hokes credit after the Blue Devils built the lead you see Mark Mitchell getting inside but Virginia Tech doing the job defensively even off the offensive rebound K filipowski unable to Coral that and get the easy bucket Collins wants to work again battles rattle home oh be thats the sweep the floor right to left pull up midrange I like from MJ Collins his confidence is Sky High right now hes only shooting 30 for the year and 23 from three but hes been a star for them in the first half Mitchells going to clean that up with a stu back is good by give Mark Mitchell a lot of credit for continuing to play Jeremy Rose gets to the rim unable to finish it but as the shot blocker comes over thats the best time to get the offensive rebound and the easy put back so Duke by seven hoki with the ball taking on a top 10 opponent tonight and they head to Miami theyve got FSU coming up on the road theyve got North Carolina on the road Collins again hes feeling it that foul is going to go against Virginia Tech and thatll be against 14 the 69 senior MJ Collins who made the game winner against the Blue Devils a season to go sweetens the floor right to left with the cross and knocks down the midrange jumper and then lets him know I am him get me the rock MJ Collins locked in ready to go and this one playing with a lot of confidence another gamewinning shot on this Florida beat Duke June January 23rd last winter pulla coming out for a Music moment coming up on four minutes to go here blackburg on the spin and the shot is going to roll in lot of iron there by proor but gets it and we talk with John Shire about the difference and Tyreek proor really over the last four to five games he simply says hes got his swag back hes playing like the guy that finished the season a year ago for the Blue Devils Colin again not this time batted around heres Proctor round the back hes denied McCain filipowski looking inside and a slam by Mitchell and we watched the Blue Devils work on that action alone and shoot around today the interior passing Kyle filipowski showing off his vision dropping the DI to Mark Mitchell who gives a Blue Devils an 11o Music lead Kev we look forward to that cuz its coming in just a couple of minutes the way this first half has been played at break neck speed and here we are with 315 to go before that break heres padulla whos over four from the field and a cold start for a key guy for the hoks Collins in the corner hes been a different story entirely and keeps it going with a threepointer but hes been the guy offensively for the h Dukes had a great job for padulla and hunor the back court that has the most Firepower for the Hokies but MJ Collis has picked up the slack on the offensive end so hes already into double figures bror shot clock inside 10 filipowski asking for the ball but Mitchell gets it on the high post and fires that one out of Play Obie Seth Greenberg talked about KY filipowski and his passing ability you see here on this short roll catches it and immediately knows where to drop the dime to Mark Mitchell who finishes off with the dunk and John Shire told us he is most impressed with Flips ability to pass the basketball thats a very underrated aspect of his game Seth was just talking about that as we come to you from the house the Seth Greenberg built Collins down to potit potit wants it I love my man SE Greenberg but this is D Currys house Im going tell you that right now I would agree with that my man DC built this place one of my favorite alltime players growing up I love I love watching him Music play filipowski drives it into a barricade he threw it away picked off by Couture great defensive Rotation by Hunter Couture whos trying to get something going on the offensive the floor Collins draws the attention potit lost it though hes begging for a foul Applause there Bowski over the top thatll go the other way thats on Applause Mitchell Duke the big guys got tangled up no call here but lets watch a little bit of handh holding going on here OB the guys are still connected on their way down the floor Im not who the guilty party is on that Im just glad the officials didnt see that there no stoppage of action as poti takes a break pH palski stays on the floor but guys get a little tangled up lets doy do 90 seconds before halftime got him again door and theres C another dunk for him I like that OB but thats the one you dont even get the calluses on your hand you just flip it through real quick Carmelo Anthony style and it has worked well for the h just like the mens basketball double header itll be Louisville in Syracuse at 700 eastern then Duke will take on Notre Dame at Cameron indor that is all next Wednesday on acc Network Obie guess whats going down in the Notre Dame at Duke game that will be myself Jim bahim and West Durham in The Crows Nest at Cameron indor wow not not a lot of space up there for the three of us inside taken away by by the hokes and theyve got a bit of a run here at the tail end of the half finishing the half strong is something Im sure Mike young is talking to his team about and more importantly getting good looks another one by Collins MJ Collins who came in averaging just six points a game he has been on fire with 13 and hes been the guy that theyve probably put their weakest defender on and he is made the Blue Devils paay to the tone of 133 points on that one and H doing the job defensively picks up the offenseive foul on Prop lets go to Angel why I remind you while MJ Collins is having a night coach young said that is their biggest strength that it can be anyones night on a nightly basis anyone can step up and he said thats whats most encouraging about this group going back to Georgia Tech their front Court had 50 points shooting 68 from the field now is the back courts time 3229 they have closed the gap in a hurry these hes have heres Ken up high Couture thought about a three Baron from the corner and its around and out with 22 seconds before halftime which is going to come maybe quicker than any first half that you and I have called All Season this has been a race Obie and its been a Sprint not a marathon long one by roach too strong that was too quick also fortunate to get that one back gets it back step back another triple got this one he nailed it and thats the end of the half he just wanted two for a dollar he shot that quick a little 7 Seconds way too much time on the shot clock but big time three he plays best against teams from his home state of Virginia and this time just a little friendly chat to Robbie Baron letting him know hey great defense beats good offense to so ready for the second half Foster with eight points for Duke Collins 13 guy who came in averaging six filipowski with six points but none in the last 13 minutes after he got off to a good start yeah give Virginia Tech a lot of credit for honing in on him but they Duke had a number of guys get going as they try to get hun coutur look to start off the second half still not able to get it going from Beyond The Arc well Duke has dropped two consecutive games here over the last couple of season so trying to break that skid and theyre going to get a down low for a quick strike from Bowski just like that you see by Design John shy wanting to get the basketball into filipowski hands close to the basket he gets an easy layup and thats something that can get clip going here in this second half similar to how he got going in the first Kad got bottle up for a moment hell knock that down he has six points so he is eight away from reaching 1000 career points but all of his points iously have come from the free throw line so his first field goal on the game and give the Blue Devils credit for the way they bottled up the backourt of the hopus Mitchell will swing it for Proctor back for Mitchell to the paint shot clock to five Foster drives it no so the hook hes trying to cut in just getting started in the second half heres padulla again hell scoop into P Shan padulla set the tones passing the basketball early dropping dimes but hes showing now hes going to be aggressively trying to score here in this second half the incredible Pace we saw in the first half is it what both sides want it absolutely is both these teams want to get up and down the floor however they also both these coaches want more defense being played in this fast pace foul here against the HS first Shan padulla rejects the screen and watch The Crafty move to go to the left hand and finish inside to be able to get the bucket not putting in the outside hand giving Caleb Foster who has size advantage over pul an opportunity to block then kid his first foul McCain strong move inside for the Freshman Z Jared McCain OB Jared McCains confidence hes built to to play for the Blue Devils hes the guy that John Shire talks about we have to be cocky when we go on the road and Im not calling Jeremy Kane cocky even though he is I want to make sure to let people know hes super confident good flipping that up and a whistle with 1743 to go number 30ss danger gray theres a couple adjustments from both sides starting with Duke Co sh said despite them having the sixpoint lead he was not happy with how they finished the half on the defensive end he said we were very uncharacteristic in the last few minutes giving up too many looks at the rim for Coach young he said the difference between their starting finish theyre taking care of the ball and he actually was happy that guys were in a defensive stance he said I like that we got four straight stops to end the half thats what we have to do to carry over in the second absolutely Angel and when you consider those stops to end the half it would have been a one possession game had not been for the three from Jeremy Roach headed into the halftime locker room but you have to be happy about your defense if youre either one of these coaches because these are two High octaine offens fourpoint game filipowski MTI trying to stay with him plenty of contact filipowski gets it back and now he draws the foul as he hits the deck they are letting him go in that lane theres no question about it and filipowski will be at the foul line where two really struggled on Saturday remember they missed 12 foul shots in that game one of put it at the foul yeah and you see KY filipowski trying to go through the contact but I love the fact that he doesnt look and look for a call he goes after a Miss shot comes up with the offensive rebound but you talk about the free throw woes filipowski was five for1 on Saturday and if he misses this one theres going to be bacon flowing through the castle guard and here at Castle col now the opponent in the second half misses two in a row no bacon yet so the bacon on hold and 40 to 35 Blue Devils and by the way Obi when I call Jared McCain cocky its the thing I love most about him Collins will drive it scoop it and two more I dont know where theyd be without him no hes been the guy offensively for them you can see the level of confidence that hes playing with especially here on his home floor we talked about the advantage Angel mentioned the numbers the difference between Virginia Tech with their scoring in their turnovers at home one on the road okay went for the save somehow did Back to Foster and he loses it on the dribble opportunity for the hokes on a triple to tie this ball game Collins well you can tell hes hunting shot every time down as hot as he is Music an inside in the shove by filipowski will be his second person let me to contain the 69 senior second team foul against the blue devs check in for two number three Jeremy roach so the hookies to put it in from the Baseline 13 s overall 5 and four in the AC CC facing the number 17 in the country tonight Baron on the dribble and a reach and a foul and another one here on the Duke Blue Devils number three go against Ro fou of the half and a 13 foul of the Music Applause half adulla wanted that triple heres Collins Music again filipowski with a touch both feet in that paint drops it in and a whistle two thats tough to guard right there theres not going to be a double team as of right now so Kyle Philip house going to have his opportunities to play one onone with Mala peti and you got a CH this one up to Philip palsky the officials allowing both guys to be physical and you love that all you ask for is a consistent whistle weve seen that on both ends of the floor theyre allowing these guys to play Applause tonight sevenfooter from Westtown New York cant complete the threepoint play but 4237 the Blue Devils and on Saturday as duke was winning down the stretch in the final second against Clemson his team the hys was knocking off Georgia Applause Tech well guys if coach Yan looks a little trimmer its because hes been disciplined in his new years resolution to take down a couple of pounds well has he been disciplined well let you know after the break you might want to stick around for this Music one theyre going to love you he said well it started with dont eat everything in sight anymore just stop doing that and but I think he looks great well isnt that always the greatest motivation when your wife tells you that you look bad in this outfit and sure you know what other way to get you discipline Couture getting in close hell draw the foul as he went in strong hes had a couple of dunks already in this game H Couture a noted threepoint Marksman thats going to be roachs third foul so the Duke captain in some trouble here with a ton of time remaining in the second half yeah weve talked about how important Jeremy roach is to this Duke basketball team Couture 89 number three in the ACC at the line well have a super Tuesday triple header this week on ESPN in the app number three North Carolina and Georgia Tech will start it at 7 Eastern then its number eight Kansas hosting Oklahoma State night capped off five Loyola maramont and Gonzaga this is the time of year for college basketball I mean his conference play were starting to get into the hard accomplish play teams are starting to the the cream is starting to rise to the top were seeing great basketball as we get close to February and thats going to be an Music offensive and thats a huge foul for a number of reasons as roach picks up another foul John sire has talked to us about how important he is as a senior Jeremy roach playing injured for being in this environment before now picking up his third foul we talked about also how well he plays against his instate teams native from the state of Virginia Collins bobles it and the turnover right back to Roach lining up a long one for the swish is McCain thats the guy OB if you if you look back really over the last 10 11 games Jared McCain has been the Conant for the Blue Devils buta got a good look certainly for Applause him close to look at MCC first eight just about eight points a game look at the last 11 but OB and its not just that if you go back to the game on Saturday vers Clemson he had three steals down the stretch as Rose picks up his fourth foul its been three fouls that quickly for Jeremy roach as Rose points to John S who tells him hes fine keep him on the floor but give the hes a lot of credit this backto back offensive fouls that they have drawn on charge Mula does a great job stepping in absorbing the contact still number three on roach there 45 Applause 539 a hand off for Couture off the fake shot clock to 10 ni go back for padulla way down hes just off tonight but it comes back for Couture hell fire it and thatll drop down good Shooters roll and OB thats number 300 thats the 300th career three threepoint field goal make for Hunter Couture the alltime leader in Virginia Tech History also leads in games played out for roach and straight on absolutely buried in thats why those fouls were big because you have to find a way to keep roach on the floor especially as this game goes down the stretch the dou with a drive and kick and a slam by Applause potin something medulla is doing very effectively tonight hes dishing the basketball he absolutely is fourth in the ACC over 4 point one assist per game and he is showing off his passing ability here tonight pooke away young got it back off for roach Proctor swings it and the pain but working really hard to drop in basket Duke back up by six filipowski getting ready to check back in at the scores table vidula lays that one up and in pretty play with that left hand his underrated quickness you see sha padulla go from 0o to 100 real quick OB he can change directions get to the remnant very crafty around the basket Proctor with a triple yes sir tyres Proctor the 65 sophomore knocks it back his danger zone when you got these three 40 threepoint Shooters on the floor for the Blue Devils Thea trying to answer but that didnt touch anything and a guy who shoots that typically very well 39 has just been a yeah not able to get the three going but look at this the quick change to get to the rim to finish with the left hand even in slow motion you see Shan padulla recognizing the shot blockers coming over and able to finish get a bucket but hes going to have to take a break really quickly to gather himself Im sure he wont be over there long had some great games in January 26 against FSU 32 against Clemson and 33 against Miami and another whistle 1203 to play 31 Robbie bar thats his second the foul will go against the hes and Robbie Baron will pick up his second young dribble down lays it in tell you what Ryan Youngs one of those guys who just comes in and plays his role hes a terar to try to keep off the offensive glass but you see hes able to make smart plays to help his teams try to win games Baron lines it up and seses it in a Music Trey Music 5549 now this place has been a bit of a house of horrors but the Duke Blue Devils they dropped five out of six here Proctor swings it for the corner roach again and that a rattle Hall Obie I asked Jeremy roach earlier today what is it about playing against teams from the state of Virginia 23 points in the ACC tournament last year oh slamed in by po 23 points against Virginia we talked about 22 here as a freshman 19 and 11 last year he says when you play against the home state you feel comfortable you got to put on against these people who grew up watching you play du made nine out of 14 beyond the threepoint line Philip psky trying to get in close with draw the foul Baron thought he got all ball on that he was pleading his case but itll be a personal foul on him 15 foul so 1047 to go here in the second half Duke on top 5851 we going to talk about the secret of game when we come back OB Duke was involved its in recognition of the fourth annual this game is no secret Showdown where they were actually wearing the shirts only today thats in honor of Coach McLendon who coached the North Carolina Central team back in the 40s that team was so successful that his players only went in an opportunity to play du but they believe that they could beat them as well now mind you this team was banned from playing in the NIT and the NCAA tournament due to segregation however both sides were able to organize a secret game that was conducted on a Saturday North Carolina Central wound up winning that game this game however is no secret and its really cool that they are tying in that history especially with us moving into Black History Month guys awfully nice touch indeed du on top here 5851 absolutely the angel and also know that John McLendon was the first black coach to ever be hired at a predominantly white institution when he was hired 22 years later at Cleveland State is ky Philip Houses at the line with bacon at stake shooting right into the castle gone two only one for three at the line and its the second time hes teased them by making the second end but you go back talk about the secret game you also have to give a lot of credit to to do to go over to North what is now North Carolina Central and play that game certainly both teams heating up jind Tech made five of their last six Duke seven of their last eight Mator getting bottled up by Philip psky shot clocks down to seven heres Collins has 15 points K left it short didnt touch a thing and here come the Blue Devils working on a 5951 lead the first half was played at incredible speed there were very few fouls and not a lot of turnovers Duke has really been owning the glass here and underneath an easy stuff for young and another beautiful find from tos brocker as he just walks away shaking his head this time he doesnt show his goggles hes acting like hes been there before OB so 10point Advantage now for Duke heres Couture Airborne got it he spun it in through the foul hell be at the line yeah Hunter Couture on that back cut hes been dangerous and this is what happens when youre such a shooter teams often get out and try to deny you catching the basketball Mike young does a lot of great actions to be able to get Hunter cout to those opportunities and how about this dime from TY proor to Ryan young the Finish over the top no celebration this is just what I do you know I know theres a lot of talk about that foul at the end of the Clemson game very little talk about that young man stepping to the line with one second to go his team down by one and Ice waterer in the veins he drills them ball Obie great friend of mine by the name of rased Wallace once said Bal on lie if it wasnt a foul youre not making two free throws with 1 second remaining on the clock batted around itll stay right here 920 left in the second half lets go to Angel hey guys we his teammate jar mccan said like LeBron James would say I knew hed make those free throws but one thing that John sh said though that hes playing with a Swagger that he hasnt seen before in these last five games hes able to play with such confidence because hes been there hes worked for it I know that were going to see a lot more of that after the break we got a timeout and Duke on top here in the building they have had trouble winning it a lot of people do look at this weve got all the colors in the rainbow three AP top 10 matchups should be something else as you mentioned this is the time of the year for college basketball to shine absolutely is when you consider the fact that in the ACC you got really the two teams that have traditionally carried this league and now sitting at the top of the league going at it on a early February matchup you got to love it and you love this match up between Kyle filipowski and Lyn kid weve seen these guys go at it from the tip and just like that filipowski picks up his fourth foul that was the goal of Mike young early to go at him in this game to see if they could get him to get in foul trouble and as he lowers the shoulder he picks up the offensive against Lin kid so out he comes with nine minutes to play so the Blue Devils losing 18 points9 rebounds a game in the All America candidate Couture with a blow by went with a left hand and lost the Music Applause Music Applause handle roach has been a hot hand great thins right Winer yeah and we have to remember roach not 100 so doesnt have that normal burst oh that one would have got this place rocking Tyler Nicholls able to knock down that three ball OB there roof might come off this place 6154 and Proctor will slow it down a little bit takes some time young up to set a screen Crow wanted to walk there McCain shot clock to seven young looking for help now has to do it himself and he lays it in and draws the foul Ryan young underneath with a really strong move but a great luxury for John sh to have Ryan young in his fifth year now youre talking about the transfer from Northwestern coming over and as Kyle filipowski picks up his fourth foul able to step in and play in this Rowdy environment and yet not be phed a big play for Ryan young young is undergrad degree in Northwestern pursuing his grad degree at Dukes famous business school cant convert there and again Duke not great at the Line Tech is not Applause missed Mulla spins it up and in and a foul two Shan padulla looking for a threepoint Applause play Shan padul is so deceptive setting guys up you dog fight between these two in this building every year it absolutely is and you consider the fact that the Blue Devil are one and five in their last six trips to Castle Coliseum they have had a struggle trying to get wins in this building a lead right now however you look at the foul trouble for Duke their two leading scores Kyle filipowski and Jeremy roach on the season both saddled with foul trouble roach back on to the court shot clock at five roads driving the paint and oh it hovered on the iron young got it back he scores again over a year ago Ryan young had a much larger role for this Duke Blue Devil team we saw this type of production from him more often than not his role has been decreased this year however he is showing that he stays ready to help his team win kid on the span cant stick it and a whistle with 703 to go and Duke opening up the lead staying ready Brian Young watching from the sideline however stays in place as that ball does everything but go in for Jeremy roaches Brian Young with another offensive rebound and two more Second Chance points to add to his tag so McCain the 63 freshman at the line kid heading to the Applause bench Jared MC 85 at the foul line which has been a trouble spot last couple of games for Duke but he sinks number one yeah he and brocker have been able to take care of business at the line and coming up next on ESPN Texas hosting number four Houston thats at the Moody Center as soon as we are finished here from blackburg and number two coming for the rookie his name ACC rookie of the week 6756 so many people OB see his Tick Tock dances and hes a social media star they see the personality and The Smiling they dont realize that he is a dog when he gets between those four lines as competitive as anyone youll find it sure is coutur with the kick B couldnt finish it got hung up on the rim and he missed that one too Mitchell hustling to the corner and potit got two great opportunities but he could not stop Applause it proor puts it to the deck couldnt spin it in itll stay on this end itll be du ball Tapped Out by the Hokies Duke by 11 inbounded for roach roach With A Little Fall Away no OB 605 remaining this is the time Virginia Tech has to make a run adulla you could tell coming off the hand its just not been his night from threepoint line hes still twopoint shy of a th000 for his career but thats a tough shot and again Mike young gets a lot of confidence in Shan pad to make plays but thats a tough shot Mike young talked to us about their shot selection how it can get a little out of whack at times they just five for 20 Beyond a threepoint line young with a kick long one coming offt Target by Applause Music McCain under five and a half to play Pula off the dribble even a short one not going poti great job keeping alive heres Couture yes with the triple boy did they need that how about the presence of Mind of Elijah moti the offensive rebound hes falling down but still knows where to find his shooter well talk more about it in 30 Music seconds not another clock drain you need drain weeel a three and peti coming off of a career high and a Virginia Tech High of 18 points of Saturday against Georgia Tech and hes getting strong minutes down the end Mike young showing a lot of confidence in his Reserve Center roach back out for Proctor five minutes to go he goes around the back a three thats not there young crashing to glass and a second effort roach to penetrate no that glance off the iron and a foul here against Duke young pleading his case but a personal foul of 449 left but it just shows you how important it is to have veterans Jeremy roach attacks is unable to finish Brian Young on this one feels as though hes going to be able to get the basketball not a lot of contact on that foul right his fourth fou right his fourth fou but Obi he has been spectacular you think about what hes done throughout this game for Duke coming off the bench with Philip hsky in foul trouble now Ryan young also in foul trouble with those four fouls hes going to go have a seat so itll be potin at the line the senior from Reedsville North Carolinas 75 that rattles out and filipowski coming back on now yeah this is the way I mean if youre going to get back into this game youve got to be able to capitalize on these opportunities at the line filipowski now back on the floor if Im Mike young who is a thousand times better Coach than me but Im sure hes going to try to go at filipowski right now to get him to pick up that fifth foul oti missing the pair yeah that cant happen and hes trying to come back you cant miss two at the free throw line and we talked about the hes who started out nine of nine now they missed their last three opportunities at the free throw line to tight d p gets by him anyway and lays it up and in that second charge was a Dandy obob this is a different guy that we saw against Arizona early in the year Tyreek Proctor has grown throughout this season we normally see that from year to year weve watched that happen from November to January making big plays coming off the game winning fou shots against Clemson game before that he had 24 against Louisville on the road at Louisville right filipowski found himself open didnt shoot it McCain shot clock a factor now down to two rebounds going to be tapped out its going to stay with Duke here with 347 left and another timeout Duke still up by 10 here in blackburg well guys take a look at this now Virginia Tech 6 for 21 at the threepoint line its such a big part of the attack for Coach Young but from the backourt with the exception of Collins who was outstanding in the first half but second half has been rather different story for him theyre just not getting big threepoint shooting theyre not on Saturday this same you know Virginia t hoki team made 12 threepoint field goals in this building and right now coming into this game theyre first in the AC in ACC action and field goal percentage and also shooting 38 from Beyond the threepoint Arc filipowski back in playing with with the four fouls tough shot but he makes it and again its just so much time I mean if youre going to allow him to play oneonone Philip house is going to win that battle more often than not when he doesnt have to worry about smaller Defenders coming in smacking the basketball away Ken backing down and he makes a very difficult shot but these two guys again Duke is in the scenario right now where they can play bucket for bucket especially if they twos going into the post area theyll take their chances walking out of Castle Coliseum would they win if they do that and walking is I think the pertinent phrase because theyre taking their time now theyre going to run some clock its a very different Tempo very different style of game in the second half from the first half which was over in the blink of an eye filipowski lost the handle and lost it out of play you see the difference there with Robbie Baron coming over now youve got a little bit of a double team action as we see on the prior possession Kyle filipowski gets great post position and his is able to play one onone with no help against ly kid gets the fall way to go but the help wants a turnover on the last possession Collins trying to come back to life but it just hasnt been there in the second half for him not like it was in the first 20 well he also went straight to the top of the Scouting Report when they went into the halftime locker room and they paid a lot more attention to him when you score 13 first half points against the Blue Devils John shy Chris Carwell theyre going to put your name at the top of the board we got to stop that guy thats the man and theyve done it proor roach gives it up beautiful pass and a slam by Mitchell and now Virginia Tech just running out of time on the home floor Duke continues to play awfully well particularly on the defensive side tonight Duke rising up to number seven in a national poll today they gained five spots Baron way off Target yeah Mark Mitchell got a piece of that one OB thats a block shot give Mitchell a lot of credit for not giving up on that getting out contesting that shot so again the Blue Devils to bleed away the clock in a building that has been so tough for them to win in but tonight a different story for the Duke Blue Devils on the verge of picking up the 16th win and thats going to roll home Proctor with another basket and the fans starting to head for the exit Proctors numbers may not look as impressive as they have in the last few games but his Flor game has been spectacular as L kid is able to finish it off with the dunk but tyres Proctor has had this whole game in control its been his playmaking its been his passing and its been his shot making as well 7563 Duke in command with a minute 10 to go and well have a top 15 Big 12 womens basketball match up Thursday night on ESPN in the app Madison Booker a number 12 Texas will battle number 13 Baylor very balanced attack by Baylor coverage beginning at 830 Eastern right after the Pro Bowl game skills Showdown so the Duke Blue Devils with a nice lead here with a minute 10 to go a timeout by Mike young trying to find his way back into this game but time running out on the Hokies but Obie this is a big deal you consider this Duke Blue Devil team went to Atlanta lost to Georgia check in early December in their first ACC game John sh will tell you how much this team has grown since then now they also did lose darres brockner in that game and lost him for a couple games after that but he will tell you how much this team has grown since that time and even going back to the loss at home against Arizona Music Applause trctor weaving his way to the offensive zone and a tie up kid fouling roach minute two on the clock number Music Applause three foul so it certainly looks like the Blue Devils are about to improve to seven and two in the conference just days before their first showdown of the season with conference leader North Carolina and Duke about to make it three consecutive wins and roach will sink the first one youre talking about Proctor Tyrese Proctor and his overall numbers but you look at the numbers and tonight the 12 points maybe not as impressive as the career hot 24 at Louisville or even the 18 in the gamewinning free throws Saturday at home against Clemson but you also look at the five assists to only one turnover and the way that hes had command of this game and you also throw in the fact that hes done the job defensively one minute to play against Hunter Couture and Shan pulla Baron with the strike to make it 7765 the pressure here by the hokes but under a minute and unable to get the Applause turnover Proctor so steady with the basketball and the Duke fans who made the trip here to blackburg begin to rise up and cheer tonight theyve not been able to do that very often in this building in recent years but theyre doing it tonight turnover up ahead for Collins and Collins will slam it emphatically but the second half n comes up gy here hes in some pain hes going to take a seat around mid Court yeah Collins going down right now an official timeout MJ Collins after the slam now gripping that leg but I am hoping and praying that that is a cramp that is the leg that he took off he jumped off of that left leg to dunk this home and hes played a lot of minutes throughout this game super excited a lot of adrenaline flowing and you see him pull up on the way back lets hope that thats just a cramp oh hes having trouble getting up even with help you talk about different ends of the spectrum remember last year he hit the gamewinning shot here to beat Duke and fast forward a year later very different on the scoreboard trying to trying to stretch that out walking off thats a good sign cmj Collins walking off under his own power and he had a he had a great after he was the guy offensively for the hokes in the first half of this game sure was and this is a team that does not have a lot of depth in the back court so MJ Collins very important to this Hoke team as is Tyrese Proctor after coming back from injury has led this Duke Blue Devils team who now won 11 of their last 12 games the only blemish in that stretch is a loss at home to the pit Panthers and theyve got North Carolina coming in on Saturday yep well theres your final score Duke on S and one in the month of
