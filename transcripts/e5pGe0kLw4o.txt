and they got to let it fly so mama gives him a Scouting Report before every U game and he better be listening cuz Mom knows basketball well fmas Great Danes are in their Road purple uniform Syracuse in the home whites and the orange of the basketball first in the hands of their Hofer transfer point guard jquan Carlos lampin who is a good passer out of that high post area has his pass kicked Syracuse will keep with the shot clock at 20 its always a luxury to have a big thats a good passer forces you to have to guard cant just leave your big in theide the paint now his production in recent games has dropped off hes been dealing with a lingering back issue dequon Carlos in the starting lineup gets the first two Applause points off of the Davis bucket Amari Marshall Byron Joshua dear Langford Jr the former Boston College Eagle who has played here in this building a couple of years ago getting the start along with Kai Briggs and Justin Neely quickly back the other way jaquon Carlos wraps it around Lin couldnt handle the pass great back door look and the reverse layup by Amar Marshall thats the game plan for you Aly they want to try to score in the first 8 Seconds of the shot clock and if they dont score in the first8 seconds then they want to try to score in the last 8 seconds and youll know in the starting lineup tonight for Syracuse fivestar freshman Donnie Freeman not in there he did not practice yesterday he is available tonight but we dont know any more beyond that so he is on the bench at the moment standing up applauding for his teammates and hoping to get into the ball game theres Freeman averaging nearly 13 points and nearly nine rebounds a game thats fifth most in the ACC they certainly could use that production here tonight well hes already had four double doubles in his young career outstanding Talent top 10 recruit in the country a year ago outstanding get for three Davis has his pocket pick by Langford great D quickly the other way and its Byron Joshua the grad transfer from all corn State gives the great Dans the 42 lead Joshua is the keys a quick point guard hes going to push Tempo every time he gets it serus has got to get back in corala basketball the defense and make you all when he playing a half court CH who has been in a shooting slump lately with a running H Applause shot three ball banked in by Kai Briggs canat Briggs is the best shooter for you albony he has no confidence I know conscious rather and a lot of confidence at 46 on the year from Beyond The Arc now plays good defense against the Freshman Elijah Moore Post entry too tall for lanin thats the third Syracuse turnover in the first two and a half minutes cant go under the screen you got to chase him over freshman mistaken hey Briggs with the shoulder shrugs some yeah doesnt matter is three did you ever Bank in a three at wake you youre offended by that question arent you no no no I didnt care if it went in I wasnt struggling I was happy it counts the same yes I did I did I did more than Applause once foul inside will send dear Langford Jr to the line as mentioned he played three years at Boston College scored 643 points in the ACC last year transferred to UCF and played in the dome a couple of years ago and as his coach Dwayne killing says great attitude always plays for the team never for himself and he gives you a physicality and a versatility on the defensive end of the floor and hes physical enough to get to the glass like that ton of experience in big games and hes familiar hes been in this building before last time he was here he was uh teamed up with his brother who was now playing professionally over over in England the kai Ashton Langford and for that trip their parents made the drive from wil Massachusetts but they are presumably watching tonight from Applause homes just got a play well right on Q over the top the alyu in the Slam by Jer Davis they tried early to run their offense through lampin in the post wasnt successful I think theyre going to try to run it more for Davis Davis also has more of a size Advantage inside Bosa pulls it back out Marshall step along the Baseline and the pullup from the south paaw is good no need to use the glass that time for Kai BRS hes physical and he loves that step back creates a ton of space for that nice move Lefty Jay Bell makes it he has been in a shooting slump only four points last time out at Notre Dame when as a team Syracuse did not make a single threepointer theyve got their first here tonight great sign C Bell C1 goes through hes shot 42 from three a year ago off to a slow start only shooting 26 behind the arc great to see the first one go down score Davis Going Up Up and Away weak side with the dunk got a great game here orange down two you all but hes coming to play Music Music the I Music I Music Music youre watching the ACC on ESPN back in Syracuse the orange hosting the Great Danes from U Albany and Syracuse with it second back your head coach Adrien red ay and you know this Randolph you are a peer of red ay he was such a great high school basketball player coming up in tolentine in the Bronx that he had National media attention back long before high school players really got that sort of attention and he came here and had a marvelous fouryear career point guard for Jim beim he did he and I are in the same class and I grew up knowing about him before I I got a chance to play against him and growing up and hes got a chance to play against him before College in the DC New York basketball games we would have he was always a big guard a Marvel that his size and then we met another guy out of Memphis named Penny Hardway that was bigger than he was Syracuse with the basketball down by two they have trailed by as many as five shot clock down to three as Davis spins and Banks it in he has seven points to lead all scores or six rather excuse me great job by Davis being patient the double team isnt coming they planning on double teaming lampin and leaving Davis oneonone if they continue to do that just be patient he keep scoring like this hell Force rotation hell have to start trapping Applause them rggs gives it up Marshall for three off the back iron red Shure Jr from Montclair New Jersey unable to give you all of the lead once again heres Elijah Moore had a couple of big games before struggling last time out gets his own Miss and sticks it in my guess at Notre Dame once you put up 20 plus games all of a sudden the opposition looks at you differently right oh and particularly now hes going to draw more attention because theyre missing a couple of guys in JJ Starling and Freeman right here early in the game so hes shot to the top of the scouting report and so after Moore got his first two points quickly back at the other end a chance for a threepoint play for Marshall who was a third team AllAmerica East Conference player a year ago and you see Donnie Marshall or Donnie Freeman rather checking in for the first time so thats good to see again it was in question yes and so now about 5 and A2 minutes in Syracuse gets its leading rebounder and top freshman on the floor youd like to see Syracuse start attacking the rim theres no shot blockers on the floor right now for you albony and theyre settling for a lot of pull up jump shots just take the ball to the basket your bigs dont get it theyll clean it up on the glass Carlos played well had his best game last time out against Notre Dame by the way that foul was on Davis his second and so he has been replaced by Freeman whos got the basketball now got to go to work with five on the shot clock rising up lampin now Applause Amir Lindsay with the Miss well one area where Dwayne killings harped on during their shoot around here in the dome last night where he thought his team would have an advantage as Bell puts it back up and in was between the tops of the keys he thought the great Dans were going to be faster in that part of the court and they have it shown itself early in the game Syracuse is caught in these mismatches sometimes theyre not matching up theyre trying to keep Lan Lin matched up on a non shooter but in transition he just has to match up on a body Marshall step back three tough shot out of bounds untouch back to the Applause orange its a settle shot there for you albony you I think the size you look at the length of lampin being inside you tend to settle a little bit but now hes out of the game and the lineups a little smaller yeah Peter movich the 68 freshman from Serbia into the game bounce past to Freeman who has it poked away another orange turnover Byron Joshua a purple blur to the bucket but he missed the Applause layup more no look movich oh gets the roll Freeman did a nice job to lay off the ball as it hung on the iron great job by Moore there didnt settle for the midrange that time got to the basket Force rotation my storage with the easy Music lay circus now with a smaller lineup Billy to switch but they got a communicate good drive and dish it results in a layup by Langford catch and shoot more no Marshall pulls down the rebound we have seen it so far tonight one thing you albony will do theyll turn you over theyve got two of the top three in the americ East Conference at forcing turnovers Amari Marshall and Byron Joshua both average two and a half steals per game well theyre creating some turnovers already and and theyre playing at a pace cuse has four turnovers here early they want to get this game out in transition this is the style of pace they want to play they feel like they benches deeper multiple guys averaging double figures they feel like they pinches deeper and theyre getting healthier they have only four players who have gotten into all 11 games so far this season but they are rounding into a healthier roster Carlos Applause misses Marshall kicks to the corner back out to the perimeter NE into the paint he passed it into the Syracuse bench for the first turnover of the night committed by U Albany the orange with a onepoint lead over the great Dans here at the JMA Wireless Stone C Music B 7 Music Music down coming up at 9 Eastern over on ESPN the 30th annual Jimmy V classic rolls on with the second game of the double header number 14 Michigan squares off against John caliper in Arkansas a great night for a great cause to donate to the Jimmy V Foundation go to vorg and when you mention John caliper that during the media timeout a threepoint shot by Syracuse at 1610 was reviewed it was seen there was a foot in the line it will be two shot excuse me two points so one shot one points coming off the board Lee cell comes in out of nowhere so you got the explanation there new thing in college basketball but anyhow DK grew up in Amherst Massachusetts huge Minute Man Fan and he was a ball boy back in their Heyday when coach C was there then did wind up playing a sophomore year as a walk on at UMass coming out of the timeout beautifully set up and theyve got Freeman on the board great call by coach alri coming out of a timeout when youre struggling as as Syracuse is having lost four of their last FES you got to start playing a game within this game designing plays and being creative on on your OTAs and your Baseline out of bound plays great call there by a traveling violation against Justin Neely the 2022 America East Conference rookie of the year joining the Great Jamar Wilson as well as John yachty Joe Primo and Jonathan beagle whos now at Richmond as you ALB players who have won americ East Conference rookie of the year Lucas Taylor has come into the game and he connects on his first shot attempt so wheres Syracuse going to go tonight and going forward for buckets especially with Starling sideline well you just saw Lucas Taylors a guy he averaged 14 points a game and hes also familiar with this league committed to wake for us and was there freshman here in college so hes familiar with this league and coming in with the reputation as a three and D guy he more than capable of filling his shoes providing some well Carlos averaging only four and A2 points per game hes able to get to the basket he has shown the ability to score on his previous stop at hofra and coming off his best game so far in an orange uniform his first two points come on the driving layup here tonight Music Music Music The Freshman Donnie Freeman has provided a spark coming off the bench tonight for Syracuse the orange in the midst of a 60 run to open up their largest lead of the night were talking going in to that timeout wheres the offense going to come from and almost immediately three different guys score buckets the first thing arrey told us yesterday at practice was he needs guys to step up Applause Freeman with a block shot and then the great danses commit a foul and this is a game where Freeman gets to he wont get overwhelmed physically justs to use his length and athleticism as he there comes across and blocks that against the glass well it is something how he shot up the recruiting rankings as a senior Paul biancardi repeatedly told me last youre not going to believe how much better he is now to become a top 10 recruit the highest rated recruit at Syracuse since Carmelo Anthony Movic scores for the rebound and pulls it back out to Carlos and here is Freeman I saw Freeman early in his career when he started at St Johns College in Washington DC before he ended up at IMG Academy hes another freshman more with the reverse L I figured you get that St Johns College DC wasnt going to let it thought so DMV Applause guy nean six to shoot into the lane loses his balance and the foul called against Syracuse Adrien ay not so sure I thought M stage did a really good job of moving his feet being pH physical nes a handful because hes a post driver he attacks you in a post like guards do on a perimeter hes going to turn and face you and drive you got to stay in a stance and slide andb its just one step too late or maybe its a little too physical there well Dwayne killings was expecting for Justin Neely to be the the centerpiece of this U alany team two years ago coming off being the conference player of the or Rookie of the Year but hes missed the better part of the last two seasons with a knee injury and with that he got out of shape hes still not 100 back to where he was in terms of basketball shape but what a wonderful piece to have back for Coach killings in the Danes this year cant say Applause enough about his play and what he means to this team as a center its just a nightmare to match up with but he has his hands full tonight with the length and athleticism that the ORS are going to to throw at him Kyle cuff Off the Bench with a Applause three another thing thats been a common theme for the oranges this year in the back court chase down the ball movich has a great looking Freeman with the flush the bench of the orange has come in and really l a fire to this team everyones contributing the defense is Applause active the only starter on the floor right now for Syracuse is the point guard jquan Carlos the three by cuff a moment ago his first made three of the Season as I starting to say one of the common themes for Syracuse this year at four in four they have lost all four games against Power conference opponents they have beaten all of the mid majors Applause as the bucket is made by qualek in their four wins over mid major Syracuse is only won by an average margin of six points per game M stovich continues to develop and offer production Off the Bench red a challenged his group and hes challenged all of his guys I asked him who needed to play well he said everyone and everyones playing well right now theyre active theyre rebounding theyre pushing theyre sharing the basketball and theyre making shots on Q cuff with his second made three on a nice look by jquan Applause Carlos got a lineup out there now thats allowing them to be active theyre not playing with the traditional big Lins on the bench playing with their four men and they giving them more Mobility the ability to guard ball screens better go go go using that 220 lb frame Demar Langford gets wherever he wants on the low post you got to recognize the match up there you got to go Applause help Applause dis Joshua his coach says hes the backbone of our group he buries The Big Three doesnt lack for confidence you got to engag the basketball theyre going under some of these screens daring them to shoot the guards will take those shots and heres another one of the Great Danes who has missed time he missed the Georgetown game with the right shoulder injury and thats really the only time the the Danes have been blown out so far this Music season foul called

can be used specifically tonight against a smaller team like you Aly well they came out in the first few possession tried to play through lampin and it didnt work they were forcing the ball they turned it over then they go to their bench Freeman comes in my storage comes in now they get more athletic they get faster they able to set their defense theyre forcing turnovers theyre getting out they got 16 points from their bench scrap production chance westrey now making his third appearance making his Dome debut the Auburn transfer now getting healthier Adrien ay going deeper into his bench here late in the first half and now an 183 advantage in bench scoring for Syracuse and its been done with the starting point guard largely on the floor Jon Carlos although hes on the bench now hes got five assists setting up all of that stuff thats his strength this Vision had over he average over six assists at hopster coming here theyre expecting more of the same he as the rest of the orange he gotten off to a slow start on the offensive end of the floor and when you lose your best offensive player that tends to happen but theyre coming out full of energy the balls moving quick turn over here Amar Marshall goes end to end off another live ball Syracuse turnover Amari Marshall 1D team preseason American East player and he talked to us about his name yep so he know his moms watching and everyone calls him Amari its a mar and its a mar although I tell you what both he and Demar seemed unfamiliar with the legend of Randolph childr but I reminded him quickly only only telling them that I would shoot him out of that zone that was all I said to him just that youre like look at this old man and I am I told him every bit of that terrific ball movement from the perimeter Taylor found the big man lanin who never came down with it the touch pass leads to a dunk really good passer for a big you got to force him to become a scorer when he gets the basketball hes really has his head on the swivel looking for Cutters and Shooters at all times great pass by the big man Davis gets beat to the bucket tper qualek with his second made field goal the transfer from St Josephs qualek is knocked down to threes know as a pick and pop big youre not expecting him to put it on the floor great job there driving a close out a Long Island Lu in high school which in these

already got 10 assists when they are averaging 14 per game so far this year everyones aggressive and you want to tell your guards attack continue to attack and be be selfless with the ball and theres no shot blockers they dont have anyone to alter their shots inside so drive it when rotation comes you spray it to the corners and guys are getting open looks no rotation comes theyre finishing at The Rim so great first half so far by the orange had a chance to uh chat a little bit with Kyle cuff yesterday Kyle cuff Jr his father you may remember was a really good player at St Johns back in the day and he played here in the dome played against the orange three times and uh I asked him did your dad ever tell you any stories about when he came here to Syracuse what it was like to play in the Dome the two words he said was crazy cold he got it right thats what I thought yesterday when my plane landed but no hes bring so much experience and credit to him for staying I mean didnt get a ton of playing time a year ago and then you know when there so many guys will jump in the portal and its not a starter this year but just shows you he gets an opportunity here rewarding coach AR for his trust in him and allowing him to get off come off the bench and contribute and remember he started his career at Kansas but his time with the jhawks was undermined by a devastating knee injury that until this year he wasnt fully back conditioning wise big to Big taking advantage of that size lamin the assist and another dunk by Freeman great job by lamin just using his size playing Bully ball insid waiting on a double team and I dont know if you Alman has the ability to play him oneonone but going forward I dont know why you would double him his vision is amazing for a big guy Alon a six

SC back into the game for Syracuse tough drive down the lane Miss shot by Briggs Here Comes Syracuse Carlos always with his head up finds Bell in the corner good close out Bell goes by him Carlos from wide open no Marshall looks to go end to end but then weve got a whistle and a foul and Marshall is holding his head as he is slow to get up J Kuan Carlos just does a great job pushing tempo great

shooting goes hand in hand when youre knocking down threes free throws at all its just a confidence thing shot would be good but it is off the Iron by Amir Lindsay well the bench for the orange providing the spark here in the first half tonight Elijah Moore part of that orange with the lead over the great D we send it back to the studio in Applause Bristol for I e e for ser Music Music each El e thats Music Music Music for for e for e been my am Music AG wait see double Applause Tripes e us the beautiful Campus of Syracuse University here in central New York Krauss College in the foreground the JMA Wireless Dome lit up in the back 4734 score hes Randolph children Im Doug Sherman you know you can say it its okay you couldnt help but throw that in right they show me that beautiful shot I got to describe it all right we started the broadcast talking about Eddie lamin and while he only has two points in that first half you could still feel his physical presence out there in a lot of different ways right yes we talked about him controlling the paint its not just scoring he only has two points but his offensive rebounding and his passing is key I mean he gets his hand off here from Carlos use his physicality just overpowered guys inside theres Little Resistance look at the vision touch pass here spreading the love the Davis you come in double too late Freeman gets the lay here the division here late shot clock giving Bell and one to Clos the half we talked about him early he has to continue to to man the paint and its benefiting everyone because now everyones clogging the lane hes drawing extra help and everyones chipping in 10 Syracuse players played in that first half nine scored led by Kyle cuff Off the Bench in only 5 and 12 minutes he was perfect 10 points on three of three shooting hit both of his threepoint attempts and this is a Syracuse team thats on the year among the worst in the country shooting the three ball they didnt shoot it particularly well only two for eight in that first half but cuff made those two y alony with the basketball first got a couple of paint touches to find the wide open three and the great D missed f Justin Neely left it short Neely needs to knock that shot that shot down if the if you or he wants to get back in his game because hes trying to pull lampin away from the basket hes got to knock down a couple of shots if he wants to do so Carlos Moore Bell Davis this is lanin the five starters here in the second half once again Donnie Freeman coming off the bench tonight for the orange and again JJ staring the uh second leading score in the ACC over 19 points per game out for another 3 to five weeks with that broken left hand Amari Marshall in amongst the trees for the reverse layup coming out aggressive attack in the basket I thought he settled early in the first half shooting threes good to see him come out the second half and attack the rim heres Chris Bell thought about it now uses the screen from lanin who rolls Bell pulls up along the Baseline no Mar Marshall didnt settle here just driving using the rim for protection with the reverse lay they need to get him going Joshua Neely Langford Marshall and Briggs same starting five in the second half for the great danses in their Road couple uniform Syracuse with numbers Advantage if they push Carlos keeps the dribble able to lay it in I think cardos can do that more youre playing him to pass his vision is great he sets everyone up and I think he needs to be a little bit more aggressive looking to score and then itll make it even easier for him to pass they need guys to score the basketball to help out particularly right now with JJ starlings out Marshall is you know Carlos is capable of scoring twice in high school at Thomas Jefferson High in Brooklyn he scored 90 or more points in a game 92 and 90 in consecutive games Im not kidding Id need to see that thats impressive I dont know the level of competition thats imp one player hes the alltime leading scorer in that schools history had of Sydney Green Jim McMillan Phil sers Leroy Alis three first round picks hes the all time as a six foot guard wow thats impressive I mean I if it was two or three games its impresses but one game yeah he put 90 on Transit Tech put 92 against teachers prep so again I have no idea the level of play but in a whats that a 32minute game it couldnt have been high lets just be clear but still no its impressive nonetheless I mean scoring 90 in a warm up before game is tough to do in a warmup line thats impressive with his vision because hes such a big Time passer and set his teammates up so un selfish for a dynamic scorer or capable scorer like that he was a twotime all CA defensive team member during his time at HRA University hes got the basketball now off the Miss free throw theres that Vision youre talking about another easy two for Davis whos into double figures with 10 just run the court and hell find you Applause RS no Elijah Moore has it nicknamed choa he gives it up Briggs picked his pocket and he is fouled by Carlos who got back to stop that easy Applause layout yeah just run the lane Davis right down center lane Carlos rewards him for running even more there you want to give it up and go run running in traffic didnt see canai Briggs strip Music him womens college basketball coming up the Shamrock classic Thursday 700 eastern time its a star studed Affair between Connecticut and Notre Dame we dont have enough time to list all the stars are going to be in that one R off but I know Hannah hadala shes hard to keep your eyes off of when shes on the floor on defense yeah shes one of my favorites to watch just flat out scores in a bucket but thatll be a great game must see TV there as she averages over four steals per game on top of scoring what 23 24 points a game Elijah Moore from the corner jier Davis rips the offensive rebound away and lays it in Davis also provides a level of physicality and interior scoring allowing the orange to just control the paint one and done for y Albany again here comes Applause Carlos falls for the screen gives it right back to Lin who Jackson lays it Applause in Carlos was trying to tell lampin to just post Applause UPS has a step on more and puts it in great job there by Briggs rejecting the ball screen as a guard defending it you got to force it into your help Aly LED early by five used a seven nothing run but then the Syracuse bench came in gave a spark and the orange had been up largely by double figure since Carlos has been in the middle of most of it continue to get down heel to the rim we talked about it theres no shot blockers no reason to pick your dribble up get downhill Force rotation if it doesnt come just lay it Carlos gives up the foul got a piece of Demar Langford nice pick and roll action here by Carlos and Lampton Syracuse coming out strong here extending their lead in the second half Music Music the e Music we

in Syracuse the near Steel by Byron Joshua but itll stay with Syracuse at this end 5741 the orange led by 13 at the intermission and this is shaping up to be the first lopsided win for Syracuse this year they beat Cornell by 10 but otherwise all these mid major opponents have been able to hang with Syracuse why has Syracuse been able to get some distance so far tonight from you Albany well they havent won a game since JJ starlings been out and right now theyre defending is forced guys to step up theyre playing theyre getting minutes we talked about cuff hes only average four minutes a game he surpassed that in the first half so sometimes its just about getting an opportunity being challenged and this this bench and all these guys are stepping up and theyre answering the belt and nine different orange have scored so far chance Wester got in and played a couple of minutes in that first half as well for Adrien ay its amazing what happens to your confidence too when you know youre not coming out of the game yeah you know sometimes you know you you think about if I make a mistake you get tentative sometimes with an injury the positive can be that youre going to go to your bench and its going to be like hey guys youre going to play and you know what this is the second game in a row including the loss at Notre Dame over the weekend where Jake Bon Carlos continues to look more like the version of himself that they expected when they got him out of the transfer yes hes starting to get more comfortable a lot of times you want to tell these guys theyre leaders in other in other schools and they come to a new school and they take their time to adjust and you just want them you know to get get aggressive from the jump you know you have so much experience doesnt care if youre new or youre not just do what comes now two in lead Carlos Davis and lanin the three guys who fit that bill the profile for Syracuse this year all played well here tonight Frey came on last possession a knock down of three and ooo Elijah Moore on the beautiful feed and the bucket by Peter Applause movich timeout U Applause Albany The Freshman are having an impact here Freeman won possession before this time more drops to Dime to my storage Syracuse is trying to run away e Applause Applause right Applause Applause Applause Music go go go yeah yeah Music Music back in Syracuse where JJ Starling averaging nearly 20 points per game is sitting out his third straight game since breaking that left hand he was coming off a screen in practice before they flew to Tennessee last Monday and he knew immediately said he heard a snap and so uh hes got another 3 to five weeks before he is scheduled to possibly be back said the biggest problem is that he does a lot of things lefthanded he eats lefthanded he drives lefthanded he said when he started driving righthanded last week he was afraid hes going to crash the s well its sad to see him out I mean its its just difficult to replace your best player 20point game score I mean there so many stars around the league you look at Notre Dame Marcus Burtons out and Louisville has been devastated with their injuries as well and its just fortunate for him he gets to come back and its just a hand injury so hell be able to keep his conditioning up throughout so when he gets cleared he should be able to have an immediate impact which leads us into what we have seen out of Syracuse tonight not in the first 5 minutes of the game but since great balance good sharing this mans been in the middle Carlos has himself eight assists and distributing the ball and everybodys contributed in different ways yes everybodys having it the balls moving theyre getting a lot of ball movement body movement ton of assist they have 16 assists on 28 baskets here and theyve dominated the paint as well and thats the key we talked about it you have a physical size Advantage theyre plus 30 right now in the pink Chris Bell at the free throw line coming up at 9 Eastern over on ESPN the 30th annual Jimmy V classic rolls on with the second game of the double header number 14 Michigan squares off against John caliper in Arkansas a great night for a great cause to donate to the Jimmy V Foundation go to vorg Im fascinated by Michigan and its ability to play two seven Footers now who are both doing very very well in this day and age you are hard pressed to get one big guy on the floor at any one time how are they doing it as well as they are yeah theyre theyre playing to the theyre better players and share the basket ball and you dont try to force thee golden is just such a force inside on both ends of the floor hadnt lost a game theyve won seven straights since they they lost to the deeps oh second game of the season in Arkansas is looking for a big win yeah they seven and two and need a need a big resume boosting win so should be a great matchup thats scheduled to tip off at the top of the hour over on ESPN you have Vlad golden transferred to Michigan from FAU part of their great team a couple of years ago and then Danny wolf who is an all ivy league player also averaging 12 points per game a seven footer for the Wolverines Applause Donnie Freeman theres nobody on the U alony defensive side who can really get him a problem when he just faces up right yeah he wanted him to face it just drive uses athleticism dont have he doesnt have to play with his back to his basket quick First Step Lindsay though could not finish Great Dan keep it Griggs for three around it out Bell clears to Carlos two free throws up coming for Carlos as the Great Danes have gone cold on the offensive end their last field goal was almost 4 minutes ago this is an Albany team that has had some good wins so far this year they beat Sienna which is a big deal in the capital region a couple of hours East of here thats called the Albany cup probably their most impressive win was against a Columbia team that was receiving votes in the AP poll last week until that lost and they won at Dartmouth the Dartmouth team that beat Boston College this year so this is a very capable group for Dwayne kellings well hes getting healthy theyve had a ton of injuries he has not had his entire team available to him yet and hes still his missionaire and reddish yep who assist as a three and D guy for his team and when he gets everyone back theyll theyll challenge in the America East reddish he is out with an injury right now suffered a knee injury in practice 8 days ago and he is a fourthe senior of big piece for you Aly well dear Langford at only 64 can be effective in the paint buy ball at his finest B tough into the game fighting for the offensive rebound taken away by U Albany Lindsay gets it back left alone the free ball is Applause good I thought in the last possession Carlos could have laid it up hes just so unselfish Applause he had 19 assists in a game last year for hwon I can see it I mean hes always heads up always looking for a teammate bell with a chance for three the Junior from conquered California now into double figures and its been a nice bounceback for him after a couple of cold shooting games he puts the lead back to 21 for Syracuse got a Chris Bell sighting its a great sign if youre an orange fan and one this are you ready the big super go I love competing against Music them e super it I love against them the Marquee for Thursday Showdown cant be big enough to fit all the stars between Yukon and Notre Dame top 10 Showdown that you can only see on ESPN 700 Thursday weve talked about Hannah hadalo we uh shouldnt leave Paige Beckers out of the discussion because its so good to have her back and healthy and and running things for Gina and you cant forget fudge you cant forget miles Centron just start up pun stars and lot of high level basketball there should be a great game Lucas Taylor comes back in for Syracuse Chris Bella after completing the threepoint play sits down having scored 11 points all the numbers so far lean heavily towards Syracuse rebounding 3218 points in the paint 4620 bench points 273 in they go to Justin Neely I thought Yu alony would play more Zone I thought they before this game got to 20 and before they run out of time I I thought they try to give it a little Zone to see if they can get back in for Syracuse team that struggled from behind a threepoint line e Syracuse turnover turns into three points off the fingertips of Damon strand first points of the night for the Junior from Playfield New Jersey thats how they want to play they want to get active with their hands Music create deflections and turnovers and get out and transition Freeman back to Carlos out there with tff movich and Lucas Taylor Freeman from the head of the key hes got it well if he starts knocking down threes forget him you cant guard him because at his length and size he knocks down his second three start closing out to him behind a threepoint line then he starts driving you and thats the only thing thats his game is lacking is a consist consistent three ball coming in hes only three of 19 coming in he already has two yeah perfect two for two tonight just past the midpoint of the second half shot clock at three Lindsay stovic he clearly shed the Albany rebounder even though he is pleading his case to Lee Cassel saying he hit me in the head first who me what did I do who me theres no way you can see him extend the right arm here before he grabs the ball you got to elevate big fella now movich has played well Off the Bench tonight hes a guy who signed with Syracuse in August he has he looks good active on the defensive end getting the passing Lanes now you already he heating up behind the threepoint line Amari Marshall out of relle Catholic in New Jersey now with 12 points he was an 1100 Point score in his four years of Varsity same M moer as Tyler Roberson the former Series 2 standout Carlos always looking to pass it Freeman had it poked away Lindsay up ahead strand Applause it nes left a lot of points out there tonight he has you can see the length with with Freeman and lampin and Davis has bothered him inside sped him up a little bit Carlos Freeman let the defender fly by and then throws it down and weve got a stoppage as one of the U Albany players Demar Langford Jr went flying into the scores table and I believe we have a timeout now called by Syracuse well step away and right back to the Dome after this m Music Music 7455 Syracuse over its inst State rival y alany just under 9 minutes to go Randolph childis weve talked a lot the last couple of days about the makeup of the Syracuse roster in this day and age when the threepoint shot is such an integral part of the way basketball teams are constructed whether its Syracuse or anybody else in the country is there a point in time in a season if youre a coaching staff that says you know what this isnt going to be who we are this year can you get away from from taking as many threes as maybe the analytics say you should take if youre just not making them that much well I dont think that the orangs are playing in the analytics because they start in their lineup they you know like today they started Davis and they started lampin neither one of those guys are threepoint Shooters and so you have to adjust to your personnel at some point the orange come in shooting 26 by a threepoint line nobodys going to sit there and continue to knock to shoot that many threes when youre not making them and it may change the way you have to play you got to play through your post you got to drive it you can control the the paint in many ways off the dribble of play St and theyre doing a great job of it good Hustle by Lin to get back defensively he deflected the pass but it was right to the Great Danes who pull back to within 15 points Taylor draws the contact and gets the roll Lucas Taylor the senior from Rolling North Carolina with a big shot and now weve reached our under eight media timeout so well step away again Taylor coming off the bench part of what the oranges used as a formula to open up this big 17point lead Music e Music to oh Syracuse 76 U Albany 59 and uh there are a couple of areas that have really gone in the favor of Syracuse so far tonight they have and we talked about their struggles from behind the threepoint line and you asked how do you counter that this is how you counter it they got 50 points in the paint they got bench product 34 points from the bench theyve only hit four threes here tonight they only average five a game so theyre right close to their average and this is the way theyre going to have to play can they find consistent contributions from their bench when they get back into ACC play will they be able to succeed without having much of a threepoint attack I think theres a lot of teams in our league that are struggling in EAC that are struggling from the threepoint line and its a daytoday its a game to game thing you know youre going to have a gameer two for youre knocking down shots but when youre not a great shooting team I mean youre going to have to figure out ways and then when you if you know if you watch the better threepoint shooting teams they still try to control the PLT they still want to get the ball at The Rim the force rotation you watch a team like Alabama great as they are shooting Threes And as many as they shoot they want to dominate the paint making a push off the turnover air Lindsay who has provided a nice spark Off the Bench with another three ball its one area they felt they could attack the oranges in transition and with this big lineup with Davis and with lampin in they want to put lampin on nearly and sometimes in transition they cant match up behind the back to Davis I love thaty Lin he sets the screen with his rear end kind of just sheds a guy and then throws a no look nonchalant bounce pass right on the money well hes essentially a a playmaker when they get in in a half court we talk about Jan Carlos as the point guard but really thats what Lankin is if Im scouting against him I would make him a score Im not helping sweet move by Marshall and he will head to the line after the Applause foul I like the little hip cheat yeah the middle ball screen is always tough to defend you come and help and just keeps his eyes up Mar Marshall getting to the rack with the left well if you Albany can get healthy and stay healthy led by this guy Amari Marshall 13 ball conference last year you know they were picked to finish seventh preseason in the America East Vermont number one UMass l number two Albany is now a decade removed really from when they were one of the dominant teams in that conference but kellings continues to build and you I feel like the pieces are here that they can finish much better than seventh this year theyve had their injuries early if they can stay healthy therell be a force come Conference tournament time in the America East to get a tournament bid I I I think you just always anoint Vermont as the champion because they just dominated in the recent time UMass low probably had the better team a year ago and I called that conference Championship game with Rob Lee and we both were impressed with you match low but also you ALB he coming theyre talented enough to win the league as well now they been to the NCA tournament at the division one level as Davis is fouled Al hes been there five times but not since 2015 all those came under former head coach will Brown and those might or some people might remember back in the 2006 NCA tournament against Yukon they were on the verge of becoming the first 116 upset they LED Yukon by double figures well into the second half before the uh the Huskies came back to win the game hes super excited about what where this program is going the new facility and and the investment in the program the nil and and with his coaching pedigree in background hes been around and worked through a lot of great coaches from shakka to wjo we talked about him being a ball boy for Cy of course with Kevin aliot uton a great coach with a lot of knowledge and American East conf ATT is going to be fun to watch and wed be remiss if we didnt mention his long run as a temple assistant under Fran dun absolutely youre right hes got a great list of mentors that he leans on and we cant forget the most important one his mom who gives him the Scouting Report every game absolutely and she was spot on today she told him you had to get L get in foul trouble and they hadnt been able to do so yeah I dont know if we can get a a followup text to felma but she was spot on make it a threeman booth next time absolutely her Great Dan closer than theyve been since the first half they were trailing by 13 at the break the orang has let their foot off the gas theyre not defending with the same intensity Lin just spins around Langford for the layup theres just no answer for Applause him Marshall left it short big offensive rebound and stick back by Applause Langford you got to stay home hes just been so effective in passing the basketball that when he passes it you finally stay home and now hes he finishes the basket and thats not just for a big guy thats for anyone you start passing the basketball to the open guy it itll help you become more of an effective scorer good stat line for lamin so far six points eight rebounds five assists just the one foul and only one foul and theyve attacked him he was the focal point of the for you you all when he trying to attack him on the defensive end kept himself out of foul trouble done a really good job of moving his feet altered some shots they know hes there inside but in the offensive end as we talked about it isnt just his scoring I dont think hes a guy that you can rely on to give you 20 a game but hes a bigger guy that allows your guards or score its almost when him and jquan Carlos on the floor together Carlos can be a little bit more aggressive in a half court I think he can push it in transition but in a half court he needs to become more of a scorer because lamin is going to theyre going to play inverted let their guards attack the rim and it Lan and space bigs with his ability to pass and dribble hand off and ball screens on the perimeter so well I think its safe to say lamin feels better tonight he had scored only a total of three points in or 11 points rather the last three games in limited minutes yes as he deals with some back trouble and during practice and shoot around he is constantly receiving treatment extra stretching as well but he has moved pretty well so far tonight looks good moving the ball well scoring when he has to but hes going to have to become more aggressive and look to score because as he get in the conference play teams are going to stay home and theyre going to scout him and say hey you got to score points and then if he can start becoming more consistent as an offensive player with his ability to pass the basketball and look out Elijah Moore back into the game for the orange along with Donnie Freeman the two freshman for red ay Carlos by the way is in double figures with assist hes got 10 helpers to go along with eight points back out to Freeman is it assist number 11 indeed it is and Freeman is a perfect three for three from distance tonight he had three threes coming into tonight hes got three tonight its the orange dropped back into their Zone which I dont think they run enough of I actually told ay that hes probably because were not rebounding out of it R I was going to ask you what his reply was as nearly scor well most head coaches just listen anyway they dont want to hear anything kind of surprised he didnt just walk away well hes going to point to that possession and say thats why Im not running zone were not boxing out were not rebounding out of it nice driveing here Freeman in close freshman to freshman the assist to Moore I love the way the recruiting is going with the orange you got to love the ceiling of Moore and Freeman Red is building something special here lets hope these guys can stick around and see it through NE from the midrange yeah the uh recruiting the last couple of years has gone back to where its been accustomed to around Syracuse coming in next year sadique white he is number 16 in the ESPN 100 Ken Anthony Carmelos kid is number 36 along with Luke pen from Australia Aaron wack from Milwaukee if you can keep Freeman a second year if you can keep more if you can keep certain pieces in place the trajectory is up yeah you better hope he cools off from shooting threes like this cuz if he starts shooting like this that wont be an option well he went for 23 against Cornell closing in on that tonight rattled home by neing Great Danes now with four players in double digits once again hanging around but do they have enough time to make another push 90 to 77 orange in the middle of that zone traditionally in Syracuse Zone that everyone tries to emulate that middle that free throw line area is thats on going to come up and guard get open and hell find you Freeman knocking down a Trey ball tonight hes got four and he also can do that everybody your Applause Applause thats for Applause Applause I Applause some Applause Applause Music thank you guys Syracuse up by 13 Doug Sherman Randolph chis here at the JMA Wireless Stone big performance coming off the bench tonight for the orange freshman Donnie Freeman 22 points nine of 12 shooting multiple dunks a perfect four for four from the threepoint line hes done at all use his length on a defensive end of the floor got a block and in a game like this its really critical for him because he gets to play even a bigger like right now he can play multiple spots even can go down play the five if needed well heres Saturday afternoons ACC Network mens basketball double header old rivals Syracuse and Georgetown Square off for the 100th time 230 Eastern and then jir Watkins in Florida State take on two lane in the second game of the Auto Nation Orange Bowl classic in Sunrise up ahead to Chris Bell and hes fouled great job there by J Davis they got lucky and almost turned it over great vision to throw it ahead of the defense and Bale takes the contact and finishes you know its been 45 years now since John Thompson lit the match that was the greatest college basketball rivalry in the 80s and 90s between Georgetown and Syracuse not the same anymore but uh anytime they get together people of our age certainly think back and remember that when Manley Fieldhouse closed couple miles from here they were on a 57 game winning streak trying to close it out perfect and Coach Thompson brought his Hoya in beat him and Big John said Manley Fieldhouse is now officially closed light the match what a personality what a legend I was fortunate enough to be recruited by coach Thompson and and youre right that was just an amazing amazing rivalry and college basketball misses it were you a hoya fan absolutely I was you had the gear I I had everything yeah who was your guy for the Hoya oh wow uh so many guys I I love them all from Mark Tillman to Anthony to you name it I mean David Wingate I cant say all this and Im Im sitting here but I grew up in Washington DC like youre youre an orange guy I had to you know I dont want to go against beheim and well the battles and you got my guy mol here I told you what Sherman was I grew up watching Sher as in Sherman Douglas Sherman Douglas of course are you kidding me they had it going and anytime Georgetown came to this building or Syracuse went down to the Cap Center it was mustsee television and a hot ticket it was awesome it was a Flatout War it was awesome so anyhow its good that both schools in spite of the the fact that Syracuse course in the ACC now georgetowns still in the Big East that they keep it going and everybody understands its not the same and probably will never be the same again but its still pretty cool to see those two Brands together absolutely absolutely its just you cant tell the story of Syracuse basketball or Georgetown basketball without telling it about each other so again thats coming up on Saturday on the ACC Network pressure broken Chris Bell going to have another chance for a threepoint play good to see Chris Bell get it going he needs to see the ball go through the net as Syracuse gets in a conference play it hasnt just been from the threepoint line hes been attacking the rim and when youre struggling as a shooter you need to do a better job of getting to the line hes got five free throws here going to the line for his six just seeing the ball go through the basket does wonders for your confidence yeah hes got 17 points without benefit of a made threepointer and thats not his strong suit you usually dont see that of him its its usually get it from behind the threepoint line or he doesnt produce so credit to him for making an Music adjustment Mari Marshall cut off along the Baseline Justin nes had a nice second half hes got a double double the length of Freeman is going to be a problem for him yes that time hes hes at the center spot now and putting him at the center now hes able to move around up and back in the zone move his feet against guys trying to penetrate because thats what Neely wants to do to bigs drive him but hes not not going to get by Freeman in his quickness and length and athleticism so theres jquan Carlos Big Time performance tonight from him yeah eight points 12 assists coming off the eight points seven assists last time out against Notre Dame out of bounds off of Davis the last to touch and so you Albany will keep it with a minute 28 on the clock hes got to make that front of that one and one though hes been perfect tonight but hes got to do it I got to I got to get on the general for that what point guard he had a great great game tonight double digit assist had a chance there to get a double double strand with his second made three tonight you called him the general youre in the dome and you called somebody not Sherman Douglas the general you know why I said it I just said my guy Sherman douis is shers watching I dont know if he want you to he knows hes my favorite I know for some of you all its the Pearl but for me its Sherman Douglas man thats who I grew up loving yeah its one of the great debates Pearl or Sher and of course Sher backed up Pearl as a freshman then Pearl after three years went off to the NBA and with Sher stirring the drink they made it all the way to the final four and very nearly beat Indiana Im not sure if Pearl stayed for a senior year they have that same type of year Sher was the one who changed that team to be able to do that but Pearl was Pearl he was one of one a hes no question about it he epitomized New York while the other one epitomize the DMB its a good point Carlos with a double double 10 points 12 assists Freeman gives up the foul as Neely attacked him again whats the ceiling for number one and one this year Well if he keeps shooting like this then you have no shot of him walking on campus next year thats I guess that show thats thatll sh it up because thats the only knock youre going to have on this game and theres things hes got to improve on hes got to get physically stronger his mechanics arent bad I think he can do a better job of getting ready to shoot when he know the balls coming hes not going to go 4 four from behind the line a lot but hes definitely capable of making shots yeah its been an easy 22 point point and six rebounds tonight for Freeman fou given will send Carlos back to the line but he can continue to get improved with his ball handling as well I think on the next level hell project as a three and so guarding and defending on the perimeter see coach coaching his freshman up lja Moore is going to be good as well I mean hes fun to watch shes freshman are talented they both have finished the year double figure scores and Moore came in averaging 8 and a half points a game Freeman nearly 13 per Applause game and I think Moore is really critical for the group because of threepoint shooting no foul no foul as Bale gains his confidence the next guys got to be Elijah Moore got to be pleased if you read Archer with per today you hadnt taken advantage and put away a team all year and well we wondered last night during practice this morning during shoot around watching this team where the points going to come from and then theyve got 102 on the board exactly so there are some options Freeman now with his new career high in his young Syracuse career with those 24 points and that I will give it back to you Albany with 17 on the clock everyone shipped in but a ton of assists the balls been moving everybodys moving it theyre getting off of it moving bodies moving the ball when you do that you dont care who scores it just the open man scores it and you do that you become hard to beat and again JJ Starling will come back at some point in January his teammates pick him up with a victory today for red autrey the team improves to 5 and four with a 10285 victory over you Albany great performance for the orange I thought def
