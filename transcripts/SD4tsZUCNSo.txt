things up for Noah Savage our entire crew behind the scenes Mike Monaco saying so long to get you out to South Bend Marquette Notre Dame John Chavi and Fran pashilla on the call we get you from Brooklyn out to Indiana kind of a wild shot Marquette the other way and its colic the George Mason transfer Prosper behind his back no he did not travel he did not travel I watched this pivot foot dont like that early John zombie friend for Schiller welcome here God ESPN2 Marquette and Notre Dame playing for the first time since 2013 a series that started way back in the 19191920 season oh historic John Im old enough to remember coach Al and Digger whos here today nice pass good beat inside as Goodwin finds lecheski 22 here in the early going size advantage olmax Prosper banging down lows Goodwin on him to get our own hand off and Mitchell thats a little short loose ball and a foul on Notre Dame all right we talked about distinct contrasting Styles opposites attracts take me through the distinctions of as well absolutely the chocolate smart is going to play 10 guys because of that pressure Notre Dame seven at the most you got a young Marquette team a veteran Notre Dame team and of course Tempo Marquette wants to get up and down to get this guy going cam Jones and Jones selecti drills that three hes one of the best Shooters on their team including David Joplin who comes off the bench for that John I think hes one of the more underrated players in college basketball right now offensive fouls they get cormack Ryan now you know what they did right there they got Cormac stuck between the sideline and mid court so he basically had four Defenders on him watch theres the Trap hes stuck and we had a term for that when I was coaching kind of calls him idiot corner its hard to call Cormac Ryan an idiot because hes a started at Stanford exactly exactly but my point was dont pick up your dribble in that part of the Court thank you Bob no kolek with a great pass for you godaro but he couldnt put it home and now Cormac Ryan the other way and not quite able Applause to finish really interesting John cormack Ryan Tyler kolik quarterback with the Prep School in Massachusetts Tyler from Rhode Island they played for the same AAU team Middlesex magic which by the way has produced guys like Duncan Robinson and Pat connaughton former former Notre Dame great so these two guys know each other well and this kids originally from New York New York City man like you yeah I went to went to Collegiate for a little while and he could shoot it and its been red hot his last three games 14 of 19 from three for quarterback Ryan and one thing Notre Dame does well they knocked down free throws and they play loose and thats because of their coach good cut Applause time John if youre in Mike Brays top seven you love this because youre not coming out Applause hesitates Scoops it up and is it what if chuck could tell us before the game hes a scoring Savant hes a sophomore averaging 16 a game and he will be hurt from this season in the Big East Applause hangs and couldnt hit Applause and now kolek the other way drops it for Jones Applause short Goodwin rebounds here comes the Irish Notre Dame down three Applause this team does not turn it over they move it well they share it well and they play with good Tempo and that is usually slow to get a great shot nice Cut lashesky absorbs the contact and hell go to the line and shoot two and they use all they use 23 seconds on that possession and to Mike Grays point in practice yesterday and then today dont panic we will get good shots great looking on the chesky career is 76 percent freethrow shooter in Notre Dame on the season at 816 from the line thats fifth nationally coming off of a nice week a couple weeks ago where he was the ACC player of the week in fact first five games of the year he averaged just a shade under 20 points hes a guy that put his name in the draft and this is his fifth year as covet year and he waited right up until June 1st to tell Mike gray he was coming back Applause well it gets inside off the glass and good Ill tell you when youre a great passer like that the more you attack and score the easier those passes are he is as good a passer as uh anybody youll see in the country Yuri Collins at St Louis also right in that mix two pure point guards Applause Ki as they get it out and now Notre Dame trying to move the ball clock winding down Applause collect inside off the glass and good two more for Tyler colon Im telling you John the more he does that the easier his passing opportunities are going to be when we used to guard passers first we used to make them score that way JJ styling highest rated recruit in the Mike gray era freshman and a three will go Jay Wertz another one of those veteran players transferred from Santa Clara Jones puts it on the deck and then a kick out little Zone here early by Notre Dame Marquette found that Rhythm early versus man so a change up inside and a nice some cut for me Gandara well you know what you love about that kid he gets better and better he played 38 minutes total as a freshman prior to shocking arriving in Milwaukee and hes getting to the point now where hes a threat shooting 63 percent from the floor good luck inside lacheski two for him I think were gonna have some scoring today Mr zombie with five 1310 Marquette John zombie Fran pashillo here from the Purcell Pavilion styling step back got it thats JJ Starling came into college known as a very good shooter was able to knock that one down yeah the last McDonalds AllAmerican that played here Demetrius Jackson nine years ago Mike Grays got another good one knocking it down JJ from Syracuse New York PC on ESPN welcome back here in South Bend Purcell Pavilion Notre Dame and Marquette and a good start time to 13 here in the early going we see Marcus Hammond checking in the transfer from Niagara Return of the Mark I can get down with that sprained MCL in the preseason until Miss time in fact the first seven games of the year and he helps what is a pretty thin bench the thinnest bench in college basketball less than 10 percent of their minutes before Mike break come off the bench and Marcus Hammond remember when Blake Wesley left early for the NBA they needed another guard and he fits the bill really good player in Niagara Blake Wesley ended up a wanted done first round pick of the San Antonio Spurs Marcus Hammond who had one division one scholarship offer coming out of Cardozo high school and that would have been Niagara and three very good years in the Mac they definitely need his Moxie and experience foreign pulls it down Applause and where that race on there Goodwin out there really good shooter Dean Goodwin and I like this young big kid Lubin Ben Allen Lubin in Notre Dame thats the lead two really good freshmen out on the court right now for Mike Bray so we talk about experience but theres a difference between experience and talent those two guys have talent and the lob is Jones flipped it up and they get the Throwdown and were tied up at 15 and theres that depth we talked about right now with Jones out there Ross Joplin three really good young players Jones only a freshman out of Columbus Ohio right there by Trey works Mike gray calls him a calming presence Applause staying in that zone Jones kicks out Ross third time Marquette Clintons shot clock get down a little bit and that three right there from David Joplin hes been 46 from three so far this year another one of those guys that Shaka told us before the game he scores like he breathes young man from Milwaukee only a sophomore this is a really talented young group uh Notre Dame looking to play a little bit more of a plotting Pace certainly a slower pace Hammond picks up the dribble steps back and then misses all of it out of bounds and it belongs to Marquette our Under 12 timeout here in South Bend and Oxford good then youre ready 11 29 to go here first half Shaka smart and Marquette on the road signed with Notre Dame at 18 and so far in the early going losses to Purdue Mississippi state of Wisconsin but a really good win at home against Baylor yeah they they just absolutely manhandle Baylor it felt like a guarantee game when you watch it Scott drew said were usually on the other end of a Beatdown like that the impressive thing was Shaka smart played nine freshmen and sophomores and you see Notre Dame showing Zone and sometimes theyll match out of it sometimes theyll stay Zone Smarts second year took Marquette for the NCAA tournament in year one great fit here and hes home in his home state nice good look inside and Joels able to find Joplin for two I love this Sean Jones man I dont know how tall he is 5 10 my friends in Columbus raved about him Lincoln Gahanna actually its Gahanna Ohio Lincoln High School I spent a little time in Columbus John I know it theres that pressure so far Notre Dames done a good job of handling the pressure in both the full court and the half court Applause Starling swings it and now Lubin backing down trying to go to work on Joplin and gets it to go well we look at Ben Allen Lubin Franny from two points hes 737 you saw why he was really patient right there caught it made sure there was no double team went to work oneonone probably could have articulated that better but his twopoint field goal percentage is 737 I think he got it nice move getting inside for the deuce olmecs Prosper anything over 70 is pretty good yeah it is and he plays with a lot of poise uh fits right in young man whose parents emigrated from Haiti nice cotton trying for the tip cant get it cant get it again they got numbers Jones hesitated and then had it rejected and now Starling looking to push styling full head of steam left hand would fall nobody back and its Jones for the easy two Applause Sean Jones is one of those guys that I remember Shaka having at VCU also known as a pest Goodwin kick out lucchesky Applause Jones saves it but right to Hammond good hands there and cam Jones knocks it out of bounds JJ Starling I think it was JJ got all the way to the basket couldnt finish and then nobody back five wide shirts and a half Gordon and the youngster from Columbus gets out in front is there a better human being than it may be but not many better than Shaka smart we got a chance to talk to him before the game great role model mentor and a really good fit back in this home state as I mentioned oh hes definitely enjoying the connection with this group of young men success in his first year hoping to continue that Applause inside words he absorbs the contact drawing the foul hell shoot two Trey wurtz from Charlotte North Carolina averaging a little over 11 points a game Notre Dame all five of their starters everybody would stand to reason but all five starters average double figures Applause a reminder more college basketball and ESPN2 in the app doubleheader starts in Chapel Hill North Carolina will host the Citadel at the Dean Smith Center at seven and then its number eight Alabama taking on Memphis Coleman Coliseum franchise will be there for that yep and uh Tom Hart and I and they will not be number eight by the time I get to Tuscaloosa after that impressive win in Houston yesterday and John Penny hardaways Club went to Atlanta and knocked off a good Auburn team give them their first loss and it goes and kicks out Applause Ryan and thats Off the Mark lechesky tracks it down thats out of bounds itll stay Notre Dame all right so number one went down Grand Priscilla whos the best team in the country I think right now UConn is the best team in the country Virginias right there but if you ask me if they played today I think Tom would beat Virginia its early but with Danny Hurleys team is doing it scores is uh reminiscent of some of the teams I had to play against when I was coaching at St Johns in Providence that is a dynamite Yukon team right now with a lot of weapons inside and out you seen them yet John a little bit on just on on TV and they went and lasted Florida the other night ride kicks out the buzzer the shot clock winding down Machesky knocks it down good defense Rolex hesitating picks up his dribble nice pass speed inside igadaro its fouled as he tried for the twohanded stuff well theres Digger Phelps its V week here at ESPN will be partnered with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research game changing research that helps saves lives so you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research and then that gentleman we just showed of course you go thats Digger Phelps maybe the greatest coach to coach here at Notre Dame and Digger beat his battle with pancreatic cancer you see on his uh right lovely Linda got a chance to visit with Digger yesterday and today sharp as ever yep and I know Dickey Vs watching at home Dicky B pretty much leads uh Irish blue and gold daughters attended here his sonsinlaws football players Applause with 10 in the early going and the first player on either team the double digits Notre Dame keeps you they keep the ball in front they do not pressure but theres a an Achilles heel hes got a foul in the defender fighting over the on the screen take a look watch now hes gonna navigate this screen and knocks down Stevie Mitchell and so its already a one and one the Achilles heel John for Notre Dame this year is defensively they are not great theyll be able to score with most teams they play but uh in order for them to have the kind of success I think this team can have its going to have to continue to get better at this end so they score it and they dont turn it over thats it but they dont turn you over right so theyre not getting three points off of that exactly quarterback Ryan zigged when Goodwin thought he was going to zag a turnover and just the second uh the Irish Applause seven to go here in the first half Purcell Pavilion John shambi and Fran for Schiller Mitchell getting a piece of the paint looking for some help as he kicks out Music Applause Joel spins inside and the Irish with the rebound Here Comes styling Applause we see pit right in as a freshman with this veteran group and no call and now theyre saying it hit Starling and out of bounds gonna be Marquette basketball nice job by the Freshman Ben gold out of New Zealand number 21 he goes about 611 he held his ground and as he deflects this ball and blocks it take a look as it comes down it hits star starlings foot out of bounds Jones hesitated Golden Child the loose ball goes to Notre Dame Irish with the ball up a point I think this tempo right now favors Notre Dame Marquette certainly wants to make this game ugly and get up and down the floor but Notre Dame has controlled the pace out of bounds itll stay with the Irish thats what we call John youve heard me say this many times that deflection doesnt get a steal but it forces Notre Dame to take the ball out of bounds 12 on the clock and we we use deflections as a measure of defensive intensity Shaka wants 32 a game he had 38 against Baylor foreign two for him and hes got four but again good Pace by the Irish bullet quickly up ahead he used the rim to Shield off Mist got his rebound put it back up and in he is a good player former of 810 Rookie of the Year at George Mason recruited by Dave Paulson there and boy nope Marquette really lucky to get him last year pure point guard its your impression of JJ Starling so far really like him he doesnt shoot the three ball well enough just yet in terms of the next level but hes a very talented young man and and uh certainly has all the attributes of a play for what Wesley from a year ago good win over shot it off the glass cut the other way down a point under five to go here first half Womacks Prosper can hit gold rips away the rebound and then they get Dan Goodman with the foul really good effort by The Freshman we talked about New Zealand and he just stayed out after take a look theres the shot watch him work in the lane dont really get a great block out on him and then he just reaches in and Goodwin gets him on the arm and Ben Gold sold it pretty well Applause Music a foul got him on Prosper but I didnt see it relax Prosper Prosper is asking for an explanation right now I just thought it was two guys going after the ball but uh hes gonna take a seat thatll be his second second yep I I understand why he was disputing that call with James breeding yeah just looked like two guys going after the ball neither one had an advantage but James breedings made that call ten thousand times Applause you can shoot this Ross little hesitation what I like about Marquette for a young team they dont take bad shots Applause oh man a little Razzle Dazzle and hes got seven if I mentioned Earl the Pearl to you yeah right right a little spin move hes appropriately enough but I use Razzle Dazzle and you followed up with Pearl Monroe exactly were going old school right we are you know why right because were old yeah exactly Applause works stit and now Marquette the other way Joplin Little Euro Step could get the scoop to fall David loves to score and he does it well but I think you got to give that up early and get out in front I thought he tried to attack two Defenders but uh Shaka is going to let him play with confidence no question theyre trying to turn the corner and colic anticipated and intercepted the pass Applause see that John they play fast but they dont rush nice really good luck Colette with an easy dish to egadaro who throws it down thats that pick and roll IQ that I told you this kid has Pollock is a coach out there season great vision words from Dean and an air ball Marquette leading it by three 231 to go here in the first half told you about cam Jones remember this kid hes only a sophomore he can score it take a look metal Mark lemon did he put that ball under his jersey Music the joy of movement coming up at the half we will check in on a top 15 matchup Maryland and Tennessee underway plus the new rankings are coming out on Monday coach and Fonz are going to go with their top five and Marquette threepoint lead on the Irish what do you make of this lead yeah Notre Dame doesnt have size at the Five Spot and no Rim protection and marquettes really taking advantage 22 of the 31 points left have come into paint I dont know how you remember those numbers Ill tell you what its crazy they dont get anything off their defense they dont get to the offensive glass they could spread the floor out absolutely Tyler kolik hes a young Ernie D Fran what do you think hes still looking for Marvin Barnes though my idol hey now now youre overdoing it said that was my idol Ernie D but uh Hey Providence Rhode Island hes from Cumberland Rhode Island his family is a bunch of Providence fans and they will go back to Providence on December 20th as he returns home Ernie D that was my guy I would go out in the park and throw those behindback passes sure Seth did the same thing by the way fons talking about size at the Five Spot they could use a young Alfonso yeah a little short and he draws the contact and hell shoot two Applause this is basically this young man going to the foul line we mentioned before he only played less than 40 minutes as a freshman and hes the only player at Marquette on the roster right now thats played more than one year at the school and hes a junior John and its a lot of growth in his game he goes six nine two fifteen Shaka smart in his second year bench in the NCAA tournament last year Bacca played his college ball on Kenyon Ohio yep all right Ohio Athletics Applause kept by four Applause good health defense by igadoro Goodwin hasnt gotten a lot of clean looks styling they had a rebound pulled down its a 70 Marquette run right here a lot of that I think is because of the depth of Marquette they keep running in young young fresh bodies this kid can score Jones cant hit gets deflected right into the hands of the point guard nice job by Ross he couldnt get a control of it but he kicked it out watch this here hes like Gretzky behind the net Joplin spinning kick out political shot and that one tips and out of bounds it belongs to Notre Dame Monday Night Football coming your way week 14 itll be the Patriots taking on Arizona and it comes your way at eight Eastern five Pacific playoff implications for both teams itll be on ESPN ESPN Deportes and the ESPN at the Mana cast on ESPN2 coverage begins Monday night countdown at six solid half court defense not a ton of turnovers words inside Scoops it up tipped out Starling hangs cant hit but hell shoot two foreign Marquette couldnt control it ball tipped out and JJs going to get a chance to shoot a couple of free throws we mentioned hes from the Syracuse area Baldwinsville New York but last year he played at La Lumiere Academy which is here at Northern Indiana and got a chance to get away from home and of course the closest to South Bend probably didnt hurt the recruiting he was a teammate of a Young Man by the name of Chisholm akpara who is now a freshman at Harvard John remember that name chisholmak Para will be a terrific ivy league player they were teammates last year you will get all things Ivy League this year during the season really yes and yeah by the way James Joness team is outstanding played Kentucky well yesterday without their leading scorer Joplin puts it on the floor nice and then to tip igadara over the top and he tipped it home and okay 30 second timeout Marquette has extended the lead to five hey Im Adrienne solgar and I reinvented the suitcase I love to travel but I can never stay organized when you get to your hotel you open your suitcase and everything goes everywhere thats why we created the carryon closet a revolutionary suitcase that keeps you organized on the go the carryon closet has a patented builtin shelving system compression straps to save space and an even One Time Magazine best inventions of the Year oh and for every suitcase sold we saved 229 plastic bottles from going into our ocean learn more at soulguardcom on the defensive end Chaka smarts group and they emphasize deflections not heard of right side up six I feel like were doing like uh the count of Sesame Street right exactly but that is that measure of intensity we talked about and it has picked up and right now holding Notre Dame at 29 Points Notre Dame shooting 37 percent the hands are active styling swings at Goodwin cant hit halftime now good job by colic he recognized the clock theyre going to get the last one good first half for Marquette on the road Applause wouldnt go Music a good opportunity for igadaro Marquette at the break leading in 3429 time now to send it back to the studio or halftime report John Brickley Seth Greenberg and lafonzo Ellis gentlemen take it away folks next first half a doubledouble yeah but I thought that uh marquettes half court defense outstanding Notre Dame only four threes in that half four for 12 and uh you know this Marquette team has lost three games this year by a total of 11 points they went to Purdue and went Toe to Toe with them for 40 minutes so far a good 20 for shotgun thats a pretty good Purdue team by the way good cut and find as colic with the dish to Stevie Mitchell great setup right there you saw the passing ability of Pollock excellent Applause Starley gets inside and that one rolls out Applause Coke is like when you have him at the point hes as comfortable as an old shoe take a look at that right there he was always known as a shooter in high school John and uh last year first year struggled a little bit hes doing so much for the team you cant ask him to do everything great right now going back to that first half on a 141 run theyre back to colic we talked to Shaka smart and he was saying nobody works harder on their shooting I think colic and its not like hes throwing up bricks I mean hes shooting 40 exactly three oh this is a great start Mike gray might need an early timeout right here and he or he may just let his team lets see hes going to call it yep that was quick timeout Notre Dame and the lead has ballooned to a dozen a fast start for the Gold Eagles here in South Bend in the second half this holiday season give your family the gift that keeps on going oh yeah first play of the second the second son out of time out take a look he gets behind the screen he can knock it down at a 40 clip omax Prosper getting to the rim John and a quick start by Marquette exactly what Shaka smart was looking for there you see a young man from Cumberland Rhode Island who started his career at George Mason and then on the transfer circuit Providence his hometown Boyhood favorite team they went after Al Durham from Indiana and Shaka smart said fine well take this guy and hes been a revelation great against Villanova last year they knocked off Jay Wrights team twice in the regular season Ryan whoa almost lost his pivot eventually shot clock one yeah got to get it off and thats a shot clock violation Applause 4129 a reminder the Notre Dame women open ACC play next Sunday as they take on number seven Virginia Tech in Blacksburg over on the ACC Network its the only game on the schedule between top 10 teams should be a good one itll be miles leading the Fighting Irish with 16 points per game coverage starts at four my man Kenny Brooks always has a good team down there in Blacksburg did a great job at James Madison probably the easiest look hes gotten tonight in transition good find Applause Dan Jones little strong Cormac Ryan the rebound Cormac Ryans been quiet just one for three from the floor this team will not get out of character in the half court they will grind you and look for the best shot Applause sit down over the outstretched hand there cam Jones I dont think cam thought he was going to shoot it but with the clock low like that defensively you got to have a clock in your head as well that was quick huh nope Mitchell ball fake gets inside and then a loose ball its out of bounds itll stay Marquette and Cormac it seemed like he dropped this ball or bobbled it and it throws uh you see he had to pick that ball up and by the time cam Jones got a hand up it was too late hes not quite Pat connaughton terms of the elite athlete that Pat is but uh very similar style player and obviously he can get hot Pat now a terrific player for the Milwaukee Bucks wow cant jump wide open off the impact oh you need that when a teams making that run at home youve got to have that basket to stifle the crowd actually this crowd hasnt been too hard for Marquette to navigate today quite honestly and lets step back and the Niagra transfer drills that one again missed the first seven games of the year with a knee issue those are his first two points well he gives you instant offense he averaged 18 a game last year at Niagara for Greg Paulson the former Duke star Applause he hasnt been a distributor today in part because theyre allowing him to get to the basket and score and hell take it colics got 11 Applause Notre Dame down nine good win and Ryan have really been contested on the perimeter they finally for two more and hes got 15 yeah nice look by Hammond hes a threat to score so that drive opened up the chance for lucchesky look at that play oh they counted no outside Applause of his third its Marquette by seven were the ones getting it done were managing type 2 diabetes and heart risks were on it with Guardians join the growing number of people who are on it with the once daily pill guardians Guardians not only lowers A1C it goes

the ball ended up in his hands he tossed it towards the ceiling and twotime AllAmerica inducted into the Ring of Honor here at Purcell Pavilion Digger told us yesterday that every time he sees Bill Walton Phil Long says Digger you ruined my life that was the first loss that Bill Walton suffered as a high school or college player 88 straight wins at UCLA came to end on this floor Ray Martins here today at John shumates point guard of course diggers always here Freddie that was a decent Bill Walton impersonation yeah good one inside off the bottom of the rim and now Joplin and Marquette Golden Eagles the other way by the way our colleague Bill Walton is to me one of the three great college players in the history of the game we throw Bill Russell and Lou alcinder in there as well some would argue Oscar we could argue all day look at this good tip out tip down Joplin Corrals it colic to the corner cam Jones wide open yep assists colon he told you about Camp Jones Big East coaches know about him last year instant offense how about this 19 points in 17 minutes last year against Georgetown as a freshman watch inside now the block from behind by Joplin and then an easy pass right on the numbers look at that thats money cam Jones from Memphis Tennessee only a sophomore lets go solid Defense John not a lot of breathing room Notre Dame doesnt have a breakdown guard that sets people up shot clock winding down Starling hanging contested couldnt finish good good job of verticality there by igadaro good footwork excellent footwork by Prosper he got himself into the lane he was prepared and a nice job of pivoting this is how you dont run Defenders over watch right here Prosper turns away from the pressure takes the bump it and uses the offhand really well done for a guy his size one example right there John go ahead Prosper Andy and arrow they are a handful started his college career at Clemson hes one of those kids we run into during the season from the NBA Global Academy thinking for guy jtt down to Baylor Santi vascovi vescovy I think veskey thank you and his teammate Ben gold Ben gold today yeah largest lead of the game Marquette up by 15 1346 to go John chamby Fran for Schiller here in South Bend well heres the problem for Notre Dame defensively they are not going to be able to Speed the game up so every offensive possession now critical if they want to have any chance of getting back Applause right now theyre wavering to get good looks Applause Starling lost the handle out to Goodwin and thats a little short tip and that one put home by Ben Allen Luger he plays with good energy to youngster gonna be a very good player at Notre Dame Applause Jones handling here hell step back and fired Lube in the rebound here come the Irish down by 13 where do you see this Notre Dame team fitting into the ACC I think its going to be middle of the pack right now John I think they can get to the NCAA tournament the league is not strong at the bottom in the middle defensively for them to be elite its going to have to happen on the defensive end theyll score good Pass Joplin inside that one spins off and again another opportunity for Notre Dame to chip away at a 13point deficit Applause Lindas step in as a foul on Jones or on job son Jones so Sean Jones picks up the foul its a Notre Dame team that had a chance they really gave one away at home to Syracuse last week we certainly have the experience last year they were a tournament team through the switching dont mind switching at all five positions Val inside on Jones a couple of quickies lachesky hits the floor there was a switch we told you theyre free switching at five spots so Jones is working inside and see I dont know hes backing him down it aint good whos been quiet able to knock that one down with no question Notre Dames got a run in him because they can score Applause Joplin 31 goal Notre Dame with the ball down by 11 kicked up ahead Goodwin inside flips it up and in gain Goodwood right back in it Jacques got some young guys out there and hes going to let him grow up a little bit Jones Ross talking about Sean Jones The Freshman a couple of sophomores Applause shot clock under 10 cam Jones from way downtown hed have made that one here they come the Irish I think theyve scored three straight Applause Starling inside left hand just would not fall and Bray wants a foul did a frustrating day for JJ styling just two out of 10 from the floor Mike Bray looking for a call Irish at home down by nine introducing the new South band all right to watch this play watch David Chaplin and theyre judging whether there was a flagrant foul there lower left side of your screen and I think they have ultimately decided that Joplin all right what do you got we got a flagrant too David Joplin has been ejected from the game now they have different angles than we have these officials but uh a flagrant two is considered excessive uh he went uh he went below the Bell they had an angle that showed it so thats going to be two shots the ball and ejection from our angle we couldnt tell obviously its obviously a dangerous area its a dangerous play but its also hard it was hard to see that from our angle again the DV sport equipment over there they got various angles now thats two in the ball and so thats a pivotal play there you see David Joplin right there surprise me John I did I I thought it might be a flagrant one but its a severe play if youre going to swing below the belt we just couldnt tell from our angling I do think he has to leave the court and he is leaving its an 80 Notre Dame run Applause now experience team versus a young team lets see how Notre Dame continues to cut into this lead Applause Applause its inside lost his footing out of bounds seven on the shot clock it belongs to Notre Dame key play right now for Marquette seven on the clock they cant give up an easy one what we used to do here is we force everybody away from the pain do not let a white jersey cut to the Lane for some outside good win catch and shoot wouldnt fall take your chances good defense they didnt give up a layup well it gets inside back out at Camp Jones Marquette leading this one by seven as we close in on the 10 minute mark nice pass nice pass beautiful yep olmecs prosper and one watch his eyes watch igadaros eyes because hes looking to see where the dogs too late thats the end of that but thats okay he caught that ball took a few bounces to the middle and then he saw his buddy Prosper cutting along the Baseline Johnny pivoted terrific basketball right there by the two Big Fellas and a big basket because it cuts into the momentum this crowd has not really been a factor today lets face it nope Applause so the Irish down 10 10 to go we know JJ Starling is a guy that can get into the paint and make plays as you mentioned he struggled a little bit early good from the freethrow line but theyve only attempted 10 free throws in the game installing puts it on the floor there you go spins that one home yeah I like it the Jays not going keep going to the basket hes hard to keep out of the lane Prosper kick out colic tough nice defense Starling closed out on Jones and blocked it and this time Jones steps back and cam knocks it down you know what you call that amnesia Camp Jones with 18 telling you John he hes going to be a factor nice yeah back to cam Jones you look at the the win over Baylor the loss to Wisconsin he had 20 and 26 in those games no he hes uh hes a boring scorer theres no question hes a microwave nope dont like that shot helps Notre Dame get out and push it by the way that footwork on that last play by Dane Goodwin in the lane outstanding words throws it away Starling was not quite looking here at South Bend John Champion Priscilla Purcell Pavilion Fighting Irish at seven and two Marquette seven and three Applause gonna go back into post watch his eyes at godaro hes searching nice how about that is that smooth he was looking for a double he was looking for Cutters he still had the oneonone and he took the oneonone and that was smooth really well done thats poise Music Applause see Camp Jones has to know there that hed rather Starling shoot the three so hes got to commit all the way to lasheski which he didnt do and they got the easy one oh and cam Jones score it and hell go to the line wow Camp Jones having himself a night he scores like he breathes inhale exhale jumper is pure Music oh nicely done Christ the King Sierra Canyon coming up tomorrow and our game here Marquette and Notre Dame and Ken Jones has been excellent egadaro and prosper have both been good as well and colic facilitating end score yep six assists for Tyler kolik this is a team remember just a couple weeks ago blew out Baylor number six in the country by 26 I I you know you and I talked about this before the game and prepare for this game this is an impressive Marquette team Shaka told us they havent really put together 40 minutes yet although I think Baylor was pretty darn close but in a league that I think now has some ups and downs some teams not as good as we thought in the Big East Creightons lost four in a row a dangerous team Marquette and the futures bright and they love basketball Milwaukees job Applause so the corner words had it blocked shot clock violation that is energy right there and nobody has more energy right now than the coach who ran down the sideline after that 30second performance Applause lets see coaches quite get that smart did there that one blocked and out of bounds stay with Marquette yeah good recovery by JJ Starling that had that screen and roll again they have really teamed up well over the first year and a half together take a look right here hes open and here comes starling terrific athleticism nice job Applause Jones will try Applause and a fight I think what happened they had a tie up and the Notre Dame guy was out of bounds James frieding saying so it belongs to Marquette right now its about Poise for the golden eagles theyve been the better team for 34 minutes Applause two more for Jones hes got 23 I mentioned John last year in 17 minutes against Georgetown he had 19 so this is uh this is going to be a regular occurrence for him its the most threw that one away Cormac Ryan got three the rebound pulled down by igadaro hes got 14 thats a career high this is a kid we said earlier in the game he played like 40 minutes total as a freshman Shaka smart and his staff have done a great job of developing the Junior I just love the way the they play Confident but they dont force a lot Mitchell Inside released it back to home another man from Reading PA a lot of people thought hed end up in Villanova but they didnt pull the trigger and golden eagle fans are electric right now a 90 run and Marquette using that defense to try to turn it into offense but a foul first take a look at Stevie Mitchell only a sophomore remember this team is playing nine freshmen and sophomores and the young man from Pennsylvania who played a lot started as a freshman showing you what he can do right there how about the depth John you know you get guys tired Here Comes Ross Here Comes Sean Jones Here Comes David Joplin although Davids been ejected so hes off to the locker room Applause prosperch on a feed to Mitchell pulls in on five minutes to go and Marquette has opened up a 15point lead thats great Josh Mitchell two more and the lead is up to 17 great basketball they used the first part of the clock couldnt get anything they did not panic shock is smart I mean hes been getting down at his defensive stance and pantomiming every possession he is intense hes got to be proud of the effort that his group has had today watch this John this comes at the end of a long possession where they did not panic igadaro got the ball in the elbow and they just ran ran their offense and there you see Stevie Mitchell again impressive by the golden eagles Applause 7154 the golden eagles with the lead first time these two teams have met since 2013 it had been a while and youre talking about a rivalry where they played a ton and they just got a foul on Notre Dame as they get Dean Goodwin pushing off colic went down hard yeah Im old enough to remember the days of the independence Notre Dame de Paul Mark 10 Dayton Detroit The Titans with some guy named Dick Vitale coaching and uh coach Al and Digger Phelps that was must watch TV the 70s in the early 80s for Hanks couldnt hit and look at igadaro Music now barring a an incredible comeback this is going to be a great ride home for the golden eagles well they needed that one 403 to go here in the ball game and Marquette leads on the road bid Music in the studio still to come just past the top of the hour were going to see Jordan Pope and one of the many freshmen for Oregon State matching up coach with Texas A M Jordan Pope is part of the Oregon State rebuild hes got to deal with the Relentless pressure of Texas A M looking to trap and rotate off every ball screen boom friend well see you then all right guys thanks for spraying much great Council will Notre Dame alone here from 88 to 92 played for Pat Murphy actually came to Notre Dame same year as lafonzo Ellis and here with his freshman roommate Chris Fox Kavanaugh Hall Kavanaugh Hall thats right theres John Paxson 7983 so the alums come to check out some basketball and uh they may not be excited about this game but they have to be impressed with the job shot the smarts team has done today and this guy with the ball colic is a pick and roll Maestro how about this guy wonderful Sky wow 25 I I had a number of people at Villanova tell me about him last year and I saw for myself as we prepared for this game that kid he can really really really score Music Im impressed John yeah and this team theyve lost three games Marquette by a total of 11 they went to Purdue battled them the Wisconsin game last Saturday was a great game this is impressive this is a good young team are you kidding around Senator to go the other way for seven to go yeah Camp Jones the ability to shoot yes but just score I mean as you mentioned the line that Shaka smart used for this pregame a scoring Savant yes weve seen it Big East all freshman team a year ago unanimously yeah they wanted him this year to get to the free throw line a little bit more that hasnt been a part of the story here today but nevertheless what else you wanted to do I dont know well get you some cinnamon almonds up in The Concourse come on man Applause the problem with Notre Dame and this is going to be true the whole year is marquettes only got three turnovers today and Notre Dame just does not turn you over theyre theyre uh the defensive efficiency rating is the worst in the ACC and thats going to be the issue he had a comeback in games defense into offense correct theyre not going to be able to do it or at least right now they dont seem to to be able to do it I think the one thing you give Marquette credit for is I thought they really handcuffed both Cormac Ryan and Dane Goodwin those guys did not get open looks from three to get any confidence agreed yep Applause and itll try and hit Marcus Hammond will give them a lift off the bench theres no question Notre Dame goes seven deep right now Applause Applause out of bounds

scholarship guys wanted to go to gym and get shots up you go with them and you dont you dont have to shoot I want to apologize the key in it to sheriff now Caleb Kaczynski will check in did I mention Jonah Lucas RJ Wilsons in there dont forget RJ these guys really do bust their tail every day the Notre Dame at Zona into this one and as well Tom Campbell now the other thing the other rule here okay if if its over 30 seconds and you get the ball back with a big lead youre allowed to shoot dont take a turnover yeah right hate that and then under 30 with a big lead you dribble it out even if its the walkon all right startling the other way at the basket hangs and he gets found Michael Kennedy charged with that foul youre not getting 81 to go listen you know and I know youre not going to score easily on Michael Kennedy okay thats right young man yep senior six six and uh Good Feeling winning on the road especially in a rivalry type game especially for a younger team taking on a more senior
