told us that you cant be lazy with switches on Gibson Jimerson and we are ready to tip it off here in Raleigh North Carolina in the white it is the home wolf pack and in the left controlling the opening tip wearing the black jerseys with a white numerals and letters with trimmed in blue its the bilans out of St Louis as we are underway with medley running into traffic you know kick it out to Terrence harrover who had that big buzzer beater against Louisiana Tech NC State your first five on the floor of course we talked about the two DJs Burns inside and horn outside but theyre getting good music from jayton Taylor and Dennis Parker as well and throw in Casey morcel but youve got a good uh quintet yeah its a good steady offense I think thats one of the things that makes this NC State roster really dangerous any night you have somebody that can go for 20 so its obviously going to be a very very tough match up for St Louis but you see on that first possession St Louis goes do a lot of kind of dho dribble handoff actions uh and and then harrove you know started the Earth season because they had some injuries and some guys out had to play the center position so now hes kind of back in his natural position playing that 34 hes going to be a tough matchup St Louis in the first bucket of the night theyve got medley again dribble Drive almost has his shot blocked away and its Burns collecting the board for the wolf pack off and running with the other DJ in Horn deep downtown ball from the right wing and its collected by St Lou their first five on the floor we told you in the open about their big scorer in G Gibson Jimerson and they got a big n against Louisiana Tech from Terrence harrove Jr well talk more about that as this game progresses and a big night from their debut guy in Bradley e aaru who is a transfer from LSU and then played at Georgetown after his stop in Baton Rouge and he had 17 points in his debut contest on Saturday against Louisiana attack yeah and Ed a weo is very very athletic I know theyre more than happy to finally have him out there it kind of makes their lineup everybody gets into the correct positions that they theyre used to playing so especially him being able to guard DJ Burns and some of the size NC state has is going to be a big thing for St Louis heres Burns in the post and thats just why he hes so hard to guard he can catch it from the threepoint line hell back you down from there I keep calling him a point Center you know hes one of those guys that gets it in the post but he also becomes some type of playmaker so lots of cuts on the backside hes looking for the shooter so again it starts with DJ burns down low so theyre going to have to find a way to kind of slow him down I tell you he looks like a guy that could carry all of Santa sleigh including the reindeer hes a hes a big fell hes definitely a load down low I I would not want to be the one that hes banging against all night uh Ill definitely need an ice bath after that Im sure what money these guys are going to have North Carolina States strength and conditioning Coach Pat Murphy says hes one of those gymrats though that he works hard at it and he spends a lot of time in the weight room with him and you see early on Jimerson coming off that handoff DJ Burns really showing High trying to be aggressive on all that action because hes such a good shooter you cant give him that daylight so continue that if they can kind of keep and take away his air space its going to make a lot of things tougher for Jimmerson uh tonight just underway here in Raleigh its two to nothing bilans with the lead and the ball on the inbounds underneath their own basket heres their big score hes going to take it straight to the square but Off the Mark and collected defensively by the wolf pack heres NC State off and running they like to move rims out of there the three attempt there from Jaden Taylor thats the action they want they really like to push the ball Jaden Taylor making a play in transition Casey giving it back so theyre going to take those looks all night and and and after a while theyre going to theyre going to start to get knock those down midley nice pass dropped it in isoro he has a great pass little dump down in eoro just being strong physical finishing through contact little drop pass there finishing with the left hand going through contact getting a chance to get three would be interesting to see Scott if they will attack NC State and DJ Burns like that throughout this ball game to try to get him in early foul trouble as he picks up one Applause there theyve got a lot of mobile size they got a bunch of bigs thatll kind of go dribble hand off so I think naturally theyre going to get DJ Burns moving in traffic and its just going to force him to always be you know paying attention on that uh defensive end now its a freshman Bruce Jong on the floor the sevenfooter the center from China via the skill factory in Atlanta Georgia yeah that was no doubt go te felt like the ball was flipping there forever uh but thats one I think if he went back and watched this on film I dont know if that gets there I think that ends up being short uh probably got to let it go but great athleticism so NC shake with the bucket there courtesy of the goal tending violation so its five to2 bilin theres a big threepointer from the left corner from Terrence hardgrove the 65 senior forward out of East St Louis Illinois one a night he had against Louisiana Tech had the buzzer beater and then some you know hes running high on confidence right now finishing the game with 11 straight points so uh hes going to be in attack mode early on and have the utmost confidence especially shooting the basketball NC State cuts the lead in half with that pass going to take to four now just underway here from the PNC Arena 1621 remaining Casey Morel see the numbers bottom right of your screen there hes had a good season early going almost 14 points per game heres Jimerson Burns Taps it away and its MC State basketball a little bit sloppy there but again thats thats the style NC State wants to play I think theyre overh helped on this this side a little bit Jimerson getting those shots hes going to make a lot of those so you got to be careful overh helping too much but again they get it out in transition and those are ultimately the looks they want they want to get to the rim be able to push this Tempo Json jerson backs away passes to his left and its another bilon three this time its seon me The Freshman from slickville New Jersey 38 threeo sh that happens because of Jimerson you see the eyes that get on him DJ horn kind of has to come in hes coming off that curl almost like a double team and Jimerson just makes the right play to be able to find his teammate trying to go over Jong is DJ Burns a little strong on that attemp so its megley and Jimerson now here for the B with a sixpoint advantage Music jerson being shaded by Casey Morel and thats thats what I expected to start on Caseys one of those really good Defenders and a great play by Parker Jr pushing it able to get the rebound and put it back in again thats how they want to play you know obviously coaching uh talking with Coach Tate uh at the beginning they got to be able to handle that pressure and handle that defensive scheme that NC States going to throw at them because if they get out and they get in that track meet its going to be really tough night for him good hustle play there by vinc state heres John with a finish for the picans extending that lead now to six here with 1420 to play DJ horn slowing down the now is they work it inside the burns nice work by DJ burs on the Freshman Bruce John 12 to8 St Louis with the lead over NC States 1357 remaining here in the opening stand Music up great Terrence hardgrove Jr who had the game cty against Louisiana Tech scoring 11 points in the final 28 seconds including the game winner a threepointer I did the math that is uh like 25 seconds every 25 seconds hes scoring one point I Ill tell everybody thats listening if you havent had the opportunity to see this they were down six with 38 seconds left with Louisiana Tech at the line has a monster dunk followed by a three got to the line for two free throws and then hits a three at the buzzer to win the game one of the best close outs Ive seen by a player so if you havent had the opportunity go find it uh and watch it cuz its very very good stuff Burns missing the free throw and NC State unable to collect the offensive rebound so the ball is back with the bicin and thats the first turnover theyve had especially early on I think thats a big reason why they have that fourpoint lead is being able to handle that handle the pressure by NC state so they they just got to you know stay patient and and really pick their spots when they want to attack heres St Louis head coach Travis Ford the former Kentucky Wildcat was a great player in his Music day thats really good action NC State runs a lot of the Iverson cut side pick and roll again DJ horn just being patient with MJ rice and middle Brook setting a really good screen yeah eighth season for Coach Travis Ford the third most winning his coach at St Louis with 140 victories and there it is its just the pressure from NC State always being aggressive on the defensive end you just got to be able to take the take the ball and and be patient uh and thats one of the things that coach Ford is going to drive him crazy especially on the inbounds pass not being able to get it in and theres Kevin Keats who has the ability to really throw everything he can at you he has a very deep team this year and thats one of the reasons why theyre able to pressure as much as they do they can they can go almost 11 deep so they can constantly get guys in and out so if a little bit of fatigue kicks in you got somebody that you can put on the ball and really start the pressure again now all of a sudden its just a onepoint St Louis lead he s with MJ rice at the line making his first free throw of the Season he was 0 for three coming in of course MJ making his debut three games ago against Maryland Eastern Shore had 11 nice points there it was a former McDonalds AllAmerican started his career at Kansas and then moved Applause Eastward then cam Woods just being a little bit too aggressive in the passing Lane there able to get beat and then obviously drawing the foul but you know MJ rice and on the other side you get as a weo the the two guys that they both teams are just excited to have back you know away from basketball for a quick second but then theyre coming back so I know both of these coaches they add a different element uh to the game so theyre going to be big pieces especially going forward for both of these teams heres Larry Hughes now har Hughes II his father Legend at St Louis had great NBA career as Music well he would cost you up in a second Id tell you that his dad had some serious game yes yes Applause indeed heres that same action Iverson cut horn missing the threepointer its off the fingertips there of fin Middlebrooks just entered the contest M Brooks had 133 points and the loss at Old Miss 610 junr now back on the floor Terrence hardgrove for the bins coming in and actually it was going to remain with Inc state so it was not off the wolf pack in Middlebrooks he gets a reprieve nice flow there by horn but unable to get it to drop down and it was bilin basketball holding on to a onepoint lead here in righ a little Christmas vacation there for Hughes on the travel and immediately comes out and I think coach Forge just telling him to be a little bit more patient you know especially attacking and not getting in passes on that end the one way to really struggle against Inc state is not moving the ball you got to be able to move them side to side and then pick your spots Wolf Pack basketball ball a chance to take the lead here thats one of the first adjustments again NC State runs that Iverson cut side pick and roll and they were in what they call an ice keeping it towards the Baseline so not allowing it to come to the pick and roll another good hustle play and a great finish for Dennis Parker Jr the 66 freshman guard out of Richmond Virginia you love to see that kind of action especially from the the Young Bucks and I think they they theyve got four guys that really do this well obviously Dennis Parker Jr staron they just have high energy they clean up on the glass him as well as middle Brooks youve got diara sitting right there so they got those those four guys that really clean things up and just bring high energy for this roster so 1214 remaining here in the first NC State takes the lead Music 1413 Applause rice second foul on Rice bring up Michael O Connell From the Bench The 62 Graduate guard coming to NC State from Stanford started his NC State Career off nicely in the opening game against the Citadel with 14 points and again NC State just doing a good job ofing that basketball theres the athleticism from Music Z 1413 NC State with the lead here with nearly 12 minutes to play in the Music first a good look at NC State junr cam Woods who made his debut on Saturday out in Texas against Tennessee and despite the loss cam Woods really was a spark plug for Coach Kevin Keats in his first game for the pack nine points on two of five shooting two of two from the threepoint line and three of four from behind the line and was a great debut for this guy bravely as a waru for St Louis as well on Saturday as he dished in 17 points on six of n shooting from the floor against Louisiana Tech and that win yeah two guys that both these coaches are excited to have back you know obviously the ruling of the transfer role for them to be able to come back and play uh after sitting out I know that both of these teams are excited to have them and theyre both going to be really good players going forward both very versatile players as well and cam Woods for NC State and now at the line as a waro for St Louis looking to bring this game to a tie and he does sinking the back end Music Applause this is a little bit of Zone to throw in he stayed off a little bit B of A match up from DJ Burns and you know for a big guy DJ burns with good Court Vision nice ball handling abilities as well hes got 28 assists coming into tonights game 28 average hes got real really good patience for a big you know a lot of times when Defenders are digging in there or even trapping they they just want to get the ball out of their hands so quickly DJ does a really good job of just being patient lit in the play kind of take care of itself and then find the open guy DJ Burns to take another look and I think Casey was in good position if he had just kind of fallen down maybe he could have got the charge but it just shows the the power of as auro and the athleticism to be able to again absorb that contact and get to the free throw line as a with a nice frame out of Torrance California good free throw Music Applause shooter St Louis back on top Now by two 1614 and again looks like a two3 Zone active feet DJ horn getting set to check back in as he hands the towel off to Michael Applause oconnell in the tape of St Louis they didnt show a lot of zones so this may know NC States got to kind of adjust on the Fly uh cuz it hasnt been on the on film much so just being able to adjust uh and then again just DJ being DJ just give it to the big th down low let him handle the rest DJ Burns nice footwork there had a good career at winr near his hometown of Rock Hill South Carolina actually in his hometown of Rock Hill South Carolina even though he went to York High School and a 10sec call again just the tenacity of Jaden Taylor pounding the basketball constantly turning the defense the uh offensive player and just creating some of that Music Havoc Burns backing in on aaru soft hands comes up short and theyre letting them play oneonone you know coach Ford as Im watching him hes kind of telling them to stay home so obviously early on theyll throw probably a different looks at Burns but right now they really want to stay home and take away the threepoint shooting and theres that athleticism by EZ War I saw him in the in the in the layup lines windmilling and doing some crazy stuff so hes one of those guys really athletic and a big guy that can get off the floor nice drive in the lefthanded leay in for kissy Morel and hes evolved so much over his time obviously he starts at Virginia comes into NC State more of a defensiveminded guy but shoots the ball at a high level and especially this year just being able to put the ball on the floor and add a couple Dimensions to his game to make him a little bit harder to guard had a big game against BYU out in Las Vegas 28 points scoring the basketball from Morel again e aaru inside and the bicin really going at Burns right now down low as e aaru back to back buckets on high percentage plays he had the big flush and now they lay in going over DJ Applause Burns as a waru very athletic has a nice frame and quick feet too yeah its the second time weve seen a really good drop pass to him and again he just does the work and is able to get Above the Rim and finish that little drop pass is a little underrated you know a lot of people dont really think about it being able to split the two Defenders and and thats a thats a good skill to have for all those young guys listening so its Jaden Taylor at the line for NC State down by a deuce on the wolf pack as Jong comes back onto the floor so it looks like Travis Ford the head coach for the picans his strategy right now early I think is with E A waru to try to keep his legs fresh even though he just has one game under his belt you know not a lot of ingame experience experence obviously but substituting jongen for the second time tonight I think he wants to make sure that e aaru has enough gas in the tank to last all night against DJ Burns yeah and I think hes also trying to get a feel for him you know this is the first time hes able been able to see him you know get minutes so hes probably just kind of taking his time getting him in the lineup so that he could also see different lineups in the game so he can figure out the you know substitution patterns that he likes mle knocks it in back to a twopoint lead for St Louis with their seven and five record on a two game winning streak its another for megley here come come to 9 minutes to play here in the opening half bilin doing a good job so far of making it count at the free throw line yeah theyre just being aggressive you know getting to the getting to the rim being able to draw contact then just finishing anytime you can kind of get those easy baskets see a couple go in its really going to open up some things especially from a shooting perspective in the second half Taylor trying to pick up the screen there from Burns now its Parker Jr hes just a really good downhill player you know hes hes kind of out of what I would call The Freshman stage you know you come in here youre trying to figure out you know what youre going to do how youre going to fit in and again he just has a quick First Step draws a lot of contact and gets the rim so you know hes kind of entered that kind of sophomore stage that I would call you know hes understanding the game a little bit better seeing it through a different lens than what he might have when he was in high school well Scott you started your first game as a freshman so how long did it take you to enter that sophomore stage I guess uh in practice your first day right yeah I I think everybodys a little bit different you know everybody picks up on things a little bit quicker but I think one of the things that is going to allow him to pick it up a little bit quicker than others is just how hard he plays he always comes out and understands you know I may not be the guy tonight that has the 20 like I was in high school so just constantly bringing that energy is going to allow his game to evolve at a little bit faster Pace but I will say hell probably take some lumps in the ACC so once they kind of get in into the the me of that conference schedule it gets a little bit tougher especially the way he likes to fly around near the basket John at the line is a good free throw shooter as we see there JN who played here in the states in Atlanta Georgia after coming from China hes eight of nine at the free throw line coming into this game Applause lead is at four for the bilic basketball with NC State Baseline Drive and quick burst of energy there for Jaden Taylor he explodes to the basket the 64 Junior guard out of Fort lale transfer in from Butler just as quick on the other end for St Louis thats Tim dower with his first points of the night and dower has had some really good games this season uh hes hes very athletic again one of those guys that wants to get downhill uh as Jaden Taylor gets up a three uh but hes one of those again another added Dimension that you know they have those kind of three scores you know whether its harrove on a night whether its ezero on a night whether its Jimerson all night hes kind of that fourth guy that can kind of make some things happen for them eight games and double figures scoring Tim dower this year and hes really long in athletic so hes going to be one of those guys that can defend at a high level as well at the buzzer and its an airball there for St Louis unable to connect on that deep one Travis Ford has his team in the lead but its just by Music four in the Precision of healthcare every detail matters for thats ultimately what its about and hes going to be remembered uh by many of being a great basketball player as well as a great person NC State basketball trailing by four nice ball movement there as morcel finding the sneaky cut there for NC State coming in from Michael oconnell to cut that lead now to two for the bilans Music jerson collecting his threepoint try getting the offensive rebound and keeping it alive for the bicin is medley with the follow and thats the tough one as a player you know NC State guards for almost 30 35 seconds there pretty good defensive possession they just got to be able to finish that with a rebound and thatll drive the coach crazy and again heres where were seeing almost they want to you know stay home stay oneonone and DJ Burns able to get in the body of Zang and draw the foul so DJ Burns will go to the line Bruce Jong with the personal foul he averages 32 points per game has started a few for Travis Ford and burn at the free throw line 62 free throw shooter coming into tonights contest Le aaru the games leading scorer already in double digits of 10 checks back Applause on DJ Burns scoring in double figures in eight of nine games for the pack this season a good acquisition coming from win Applause University and yard is doing a good job you know obviously his first minutes coming in putting together good defensive possession in NC State doing what they wanted to attack get downhill score in and maybe not transition but because theyre attacking so quick be semi transition Casey Marcel trims that lead now for St Louis to one 2726 the bilic with the Music lead in Casey Morel with a nice bucket as we headed to break has put MC State behind by one now to St Louis and you know talk about progression Scott thats the epitome right there Casi Mor yeah just the growth as a player you know obviously transferring into NC State being being primarily a defensiveminded player being able to you know become a really really good shooter for this team he played with the Jarel Joiner and a TR quavon SMI being a great comp compliment for them to be able to knock down shots and hes just growing each and every year and you know you see him out here and hes the first one in pregame getting shots up so you know his hard work is paying off and you love to see it the basketball and a lead heres a lot of that dribble handoff action that they get a lot lot of just to kind of make the defense drop back a little bit and again uh D just being athletic and attacking the basket and finishing over the bigger defender in diara Mohamed diara just checked in to the game for NC State the VIN still a one possession gain the lead by three Applause 2926 burns on aoro yeah I think he shuffled his feet a little bit but I think Kevin Keats wanted him to get that ball a little bit quicker he had better position and then as war did a good job of kind of pushing him out a little bit there and again just shuffles the feet a little bit too quickly which you dont see out of him a lot hes usually really good when it comes to the Applause footwork Meadows able to bring it across the the timeline its good work there by oconnell keep Meadows in front shot clock winding down to five really good job just keeping your man in front and again theyre going to make them take a tough one here at the end great perimeter defense there by MC state is the wolf pack get the rebound from Mohamad diara still a threepoint basketball game J wanting to di one up deep and Bin with the rebound and thats one I think you can get pretty much anytime you want so you got to be a little bit more selective you know when it comes you can get that pick and pop especially being the first screen you know thats one that you know you wish you can get the ball moving a little bit more the second foul now on DJ Burns and see if that becomes a concern here in the first half for Kevin Keats I dont think it will unless he picks up his Music third hes got two players on the bench right now with two fouls and DJ horn and MJ rise I think this is one of the things that Jimerson has you know grown his game you know we talk about Casey Marcel putting in the work the same thing with jerson you know comes in being predominantly a threepoint shooter but now showing the putting the ball on the floor being able to get Defenders to foul him and get to the line you know being an 86 87 free throw shooter thats what you got to do get to the line you know hes had you know double digit free throws a couple times this year so just showing the growth of a player especially from you know when he first come came in to the A10 10 games this season he has put up double digit scoring graduated two weeks ago and the same night had a great game against Drake and now hes getting ready to work on his NBA and hopefully maybe for him go into the NBA yeah I mean hes definitely a good enough shooter I think he has I think one more year of Eligibility Im not sure but uh hes just one of those guys that you know continues to grow he loves the game hes a gym rat always in there grinding uh Coach Tate had many things to say about him so hes one of those guys that just constantly works and and improves each and every year he took a red shirt year so he has that extra time to work on the NBA and possibly stay with the bilans middle Brooks at the Applause line Applause Music Applause this is one area Jaden Taylors really kind of turned it around the first couple games of the Season he wasnt the predominantly you know guarding the point guard bringing up but now as you see hes just a tenacious defender on the ball so hes always picking up full court and hes just wreaking havoc and causing many turnovers this year big perimeter defense again for NC State they Trail St Louis here at home by a couple Music 3128 this difficulty despite the six turnovers by the bilic of St Louis they have a lead by three over NC State but its NC State who has converted all of their turnovers into points with eight for the wolf P I think if you showed coach Ford uh this graphic outside the score you know he would probably think hes down but um you know this is just kind of saying to them he was uh as AO just doing a good job of kind of keeping them in this game and and keeping the lead and a good look there by Casey uh getting it there you know coach Ford coming out trying to go Zone uh and uh Parker Jr able to finish with the bucket six points now to go along with five rebounds for the freshman in Parker Jr weve also seing here in the first half for Casey morcel and NC State morcel doing a good job of waiting for the shot to come to him as he is perfect from the floor tonight three for three has been very very patient yeah and then dower on this end you know just doing what he does best being the athlete and getting downhill and finishing at The Rim little short on the jumper there I feel like St Louis has just done just good enough job on the defensive end to just kind of keep them on the toes NC State is typically a very aggressive team trying to get downhill trying to attack but theyve just loaded them up just enough to make them a little bit uncomfortable especially on the offensive Applause end middle Brooks was hoping to draw the charge so are the fans here at the PMC Arena instead its bilin Applause basketball 15 seconds on the shot clock Jimerson takes the inbounds pass Music middle Brooks cleans up the glass for the work Applause p open three all day long there for mercel but too strong I think it shocked him a little bit Scott Wood that he was so wide open taking that pass from okell yeah but again thats just one of those looks that youre going to live with Casey being a great shooter you know okell probing the defense and just taking his time and allowing Casey to kind of fill into that corner and again you see Parker there just being aggressive C CL crashing the glass and being able to create an extra possession and get to the line only one made threepoint shot in total tonight were down to 235 remaining in the first half I hate to say it thats not my type of game I like to see a lot of Threes personally so says the alltime leading threepoint shooter in NC State history right again Jaden Taylor just absolutely doging the defender he does a good job of showing the hands you hear the referee saying show the hands show the hands so able and chest up the primary ball handler and just giving him a hard time bringing it up the court shot clock coming up on five now and again that perimeter defense really raking Havoc I think one other person touched the ball the entire possession but Jaden Taylors activity just continuously following him and being able to draw the charge you know you cant say enough about it you know a lot of kids dont want to do that and really defend a full possession and hes one of those guys that has really done it from since the start of the beginning and then I also think that gives him the confidence to be able to be that much aggressive on the offensive end as well is it more of a mindset you have to develop I mean its just hard I you know especially youre going to youre going to guard really good offensive players and especially today theres so much skill level especially off the bounds so being able to turn and be able to chest up the way he does just makes him that much Elite on the defensive end he had his shot blocked and then right back into his hands and hes able to finish there as you see just great hand eye coordination good athleticism there Parker very special freshman it looks like for Kevin Keats right now yeah I think Casey just kind of tripped them up a little bit they got LJ Thomas and Casey were kind of indecision there on whether or not they were going to switch and I think just that second gave dagard the time to attack and again just kind of tried him up from behind so going to the free throw line for St Lewis hes the 64 free throw shooter Tim dower 67 senior forward from Fort Lauderdale Florida played to Tulsa before joining the bilans and very quietly for St Louis here hes had eight games where he has finished in double digit Applause score just a twopoint lead for St Louis with under a minute and a half to play before halftime again theres some of that ice keeping the ball down towards the the Baseline and not allowing them to come off the pick and roll which theyre you know one of the things on offense that NC State really likes to Applause do under a minute to go now again harassing defense for NC State along the perimeter and it works for Coach Kevin KS yeah last two out three possession able to take the charge get downhill in case he does a really good job of getting his feet set and and absorbing the contact Timeout on the floor with 499 seconds remaining it is St Louis in a tight win here in Raleigh they lead by two 34 32 okay were down by a lot but hes got a plan head coach Travis Ford for St Louis in his teams huddle St Louis with a 3432 lead there in Raleigh on NC State its the Atlantic 10 and the Atlantic Coast Conference tonight and Kevin Keats I think has gotten good minutes tonight and maybe a glimpse into the future of what could be a great career I know its hardly to say but the Freshman Dennis Parker hes a lively one yeah its been a little bit slow game especially uh from a scoring perspective for you know NC States offense not being able to get those easy ones and get out in transition like they are but again Dennis Parker just doing a good job being able to create some extra possessions offensive rebounds and attacking downhill Jaden Taylor drawing contact twopoint bicin lead with 372 remaining 17 seconds of the shot clock here for the inbounds pulling trigger will be LJ Thomas Music NC State and St Louis right now with a little quicker lineup on the floor I Music Applause think Casey just doing a good job of being smart attacking understanding that both teams are in the bonus already uh thats just being a smart veteran guard understanding that you know as soon as someone puts the hand in there just being able to draw contact and him being a good free throw shooter get to the line Casey morcel 74 free throw shooter for NC State opportunity to even this game here 22 totals fouls for both teams here tonight early everybodys just a little bit slower being on winter break so I expect a much more quick fastpaced uh hands a little bit less active on the body uh in the second half lead is at one as more cell connects from the back end Bon pass coming on to the floor now number 10 the junior Guard from reille North Carolina first minutes first action rather well see from Brion pass we go below 20 seconds just a onepoint St Louis lead oh two shot two second differential on the shot clock in the game Applause clock thats just a tough Applause finish aring finish there for Meadows beting that tough and then we come in here to a struggle early on in shooting but I expect better things in the second half by both teams the flip sides of the flo as attacking the goal the right of your screen will be DJ Burns in White and the rest of the wolf pack and thats one I thing coach Ford has done a really good job you know especially coming out of timeouts coming out of the half hes coming to his zone so you know a lot of times coaches especially when theyre in their halftime drawing up their next play theyre drawing it for a manto man and then coach for comes out in zone and just kind of throws Inc State a little bit off but a good job by Dennis Parker being able to attack that Baseline dumping it down to DJ Burns and getting him to the line a rather quiet first half for DJ Burns considering the reference of work that he has put in so far this season transfer from graduate transfer from winr and I think him you know DJ horn MJ rice getting in a little bit of foul trouble early not being able to get a good flow so expect them to kind of come out here and get a much better flow than they did in the first half especially being in foul trouble seven points now after the free throws for DJ Burns Jr three of the wolf pack as you mentioned Scott with two fouls each in the first half Burns horn and MJ rice and St Louis doing a good job being patient finding the smaller horn on dager and being able to take you know a good position down low to post Parker junr unable to connect on that threepoint shot as the Wolfpack have yet to hit one now 0 for eight behind the Music arc another Miss threepointer that time coming out off the hands of St Louis and a guy that normally hits those and Gibson Jimerson finally NC State gets off the Island of Misfit Toys from behind the arc they hit their first threepointer of the game and gets a nice response here from the crowd at the PNC maybe a little bit of a sarcastic clap but again just a good job Casey its what he does you know its hard to keep those really good threepoint Shooters down especially when they have a little bit of confidence and theyve done a really good job so far on Jimerson just holding them to two points and making them take some tough contested ones straight away look with hardgrove its NC State basketball after the Miss and were tied here 38 38 but count it banging down the three is DJ horn and NC State takes the lead Applause 4138 two for one show here for NC State in the yeah both times the defender going under the screen and being two of the better threepoint Shooters on the NC State roster thats a big mistake you know obviously they havent made a lot of Threes during this game but that might open the floodgates for them and obviously causing St Louis to take the time out now Inc State getting a little bit more confidence especially from Deep NC State with the lead for the second time in this contest 4138 they had the lead for just 17 seconds in the first half its been nip and Tuck all game long really thats a good match up down low and its e aaro who will take it again over DJ Burns and as aaru who got 10 points quickly in the first half and then faded out a little bit gets his first bucket of the second and thats why I tell DJ to really kind of shade him on that right shoulder hes really looking to get that left hand hook so trying to be able to force him back to the middle to finish over the left shoulder DJ horn defender in his face launching that threepointer I think thats one he would like to have back but the ball will remain with the wolf pack 20 seconds to the shot we could probably call it a heat check its one of the first threes weve had so hes just coming back up and getting it up it looks like somebody got a technical foul but Im not sure who he called it on maybe DJ Burns so its DJ Burns yes indeed that will get teed up here and Kevin keeps looking a little puzzled I think DJ just got a little bit frustrated obviously e weo scoring on one end and then on the other end thinking that he got a foul uh giving the referee a little bit of piece of his mind so Gibson Jimerson at the free throw line 85 shooter lets see what yeah 30 does a little bit of a wave off and Im sure hes been warned uh maybe a couple times tonight so just you know sometimes you just cant show up the referee so DJ Burns will be on the bench here with 1721 remaining in this basketball game in foul trouble and I would tell you my angle there looked pretty clean he might have had his left hand on his hit but that one looked pretty Applause clean yeah thats not a foul thats just good defense it was really really good defense from NC State and weve been raving about Jadon Taylors defensive ability all night long showing it again there pallys lateral movement but being called for the foul here it goes again knocking it away but it will remain with the Applause billigans good Vision by midley and St Louis with the lead now 4441 St Louis is just doing a really good job viny State goes on a run makes back to back threes just making some plays to keep them right in front so good job by them you know its gotten ugly at times like deflections there and some things like that but theyre doing a good job of just staying the course staying with the game plan and staying in the game nice long range jumper there by Casey Morel hes starting to get that shot dialed in now here in the second Music half again thats one of the things that hes really added to his game being able to put the ball on the floor and rise up for a jump shot or even get all the way to the Music rim St r with a lead by one as a war thats a good play by St Louis being able to get to aaru two feet catches it inside the semicircle and anytime he catches in there I dont care whos guard him thats going to be tough to get a stop leading all scorers in this game now as war with 14 points in just his second game of the year milbrooks straight away three off the front rim going high for the rebound is St Louis and Terrence hardgrove but hes going to be whistled were going to break with St Louis ahead by three 4643 now icing the ball screen they understand that the bigs of NC State are not a threat so being able to send the ball Baseline not let them come off the screen and they are going to live with a middle books three hes 0 for seven on the year DJ burns doesnt take a lot of three so being able to allow the offensive player go away from the screen and not creating any type of an advantage horn off balance Applause shot I think a lot of it is just the the struggle being in Bow trouble in the first half so again just trying to get back in that flow of the game you know youre sitting on that bench for a while and then as soon as you come back in you know you want to make a play and get impact on the game so just trying to get that flow and that rhythm again and again nobodys paying intention weve got action on the offside the Mets just doing a good job of getting to the rim and finishing so the lead to five now for St Louis is NC State falling asleep there on defense Morel backs up behind the threeo line and makes the second of the game Casey Morel Casey Morel cuts the lead to two 4846 at Target try fast and free drive up and thats one of those timeouts that Kevin Keats takes out of frustration nobodys looking at the ball so a straight line drive being able to finish and then you see Kevin Keats laying into all of his guys saying somebody pay attention we got to be ready to play you cannot develop those easy buckets like that especially when youre in a tight game and this one might come down to the wire and Kevin Keats went at the Freshman first and thats usually the case and he probably was ended up being the low one so hes got to be in the help side but again you just got you always got to have vision and you always got to see the ball and again St Louis just doing a really good job theyre really targeting dger being a 67 being a physical guy down low and then you got a Casey morcel who is on him now and then you have the DJ horn whos been on him being able to attack down low when hes in the post is a clear advantage that theyre trying to expose especially in this second half so Tim dower with a quiet 11 points and double figures for St Louis now in his ninth game in double digit scoring hes got a dozen after that free throw the 67 senior forward transferred in from Tulsa makes it a twopossession game now as the bin put the lead at Music four horn open three from the right wing K it and thats a good play really good defense by St Louis for most of the possession but Jaden Taylor just good doing a really really good job getting the paint touch seeing the defense is sinking in and finding DJ horn whos been hot over the last four games for him NC State follows that three quickly with the Press Meadows cross the timeline being guarded by Jaden Taylor knocked Away by middle Brooks back into the hands of the bilans and net forces Jimerson into a long three and its collected by middle Brooks for NC State with a chance to reclaim the lead Taylor Off the Mark high for the rebound as z a waru and you get the crowd into it theyre starting to try and pick them up a little bit and again thats one if Im Jaden Taylor especially in the break and not anybody down there just just attack get to the rim maybe get to the line kind of keep this momentum going taken away and here they go again same think push it try to get ahead get a paint touch and then if they collapse thats when were going to kick it out for the three Morel off the screen big hustle play there again from Parker and these are the things on a stat sheet he doesnt necessarily get the offensive rebound or anything like that but just the activity of understanding Im going to crash this class and if I dont get it I may be able to you know create contact and get the foul like he does there but again its that extra possession anytime youre in a game its a onepoint game if we get down the stretch you know and and all of a sudden you got a a shot to win the game and you hit it you know nobody looks back and says okay with 13 minutes to go thats an extra possession but those are the kind of things that win basketball games middle just trying to B bounce in on JN and draws the contact but unable to set up the threepoint play and thats something St Louis has done you know the whole game whether its DJ Burns Middle Brooks all those post cut catches theyve said you know what lets take away NC States threepoint shooting and allow them to play oneonone so being able to draw the foul maybe get two here uh good job by middle Brooks being patient middle Brooks 72 free throw shooter unable to connect on the first try and tie here with a Applause Music second yeah coach Fords going to sub him out again this is just one of those mistakes you just cant make as a player you cant walk it up you got to push it get it across the timeline you know we talk about Dennis Parker Jr creating extra possession thats taking an extra possession away from your team thats an opportunity to get two three points on the board in a clutch game you got to be able to get that across have a little bit more sense of urgency especially in a onepoint game horn driving in and gets it to roll down I think he called it on the Music floor so its medleys first foul Meadows will check back onto the floor taking the place at Applause medley heres Burns gets it out the square taking advantage of the Freshman Jong on it puts NC State ahead by one and I know zong seven foot and a big body in there but again if youre going to let DJ Burns get two feet in that paint youre going to have a long Applause Music night and again Jaden Taylor just being a menace on the ball doing a great job of pressuring and contesting at the end and creating the turnover great play by Jadon Applause Taylor so NC State with a onepoint lead trying to add to that burns kicks it out to Horn wide open three yes DJ horn from DJ burns on the ones and twos and NC State with a fourpoint lead 5450 and this is why we call DJ burns the point Cent DJ Burns and NC State now with a fourpoint lead and how about DJ horn here in the second half from the land of the deep ball NC State in the first period had nothing they were 0 for eight but they have turned that around here in the second now five of nine on threepoint shooting in the second period and getting three of those is DJ horn including the last one yeah and I think a lot of it starts with DJ Burns being able to get the the Deep post touch get the bucket then after he gets the bucket the Trap comes and he gets that DJ to DJ Applause connection and the Big Fellas asking for it again going to back in hard on E Applause aaro 11 minutes to play in this game its a twopossession lead for INS state by Applause four again thats just a tough one you know Meadows is the only one that touches it you play good defense but again you kind of just he gets you on the hip and and is able to finish again but again just got to be able to turn that Defender maybe one more time meow with six points now Burns underneath nicely done against eoro DJ Burns in double figures now with 11 and I think you see you know NC States basically saying we have not been able to get much going from The Arc you know so lets get the ball into the big fella let him be able to make some plays DJ Burns 11 points so hes in double digit scoring now for the ninth time 10th time rather this Music season Corner trap Works to perfection trying to dial up another yes DJ horn hanging the ml toe over his head as he has really gotten hot here in the second period four threepointers four of six from the threepoint line and its the largest lead now in the game for the wolf pack 59 52 at seven and thats NC State when theyre at their best being able to get to a trap be able to create the turnover and then knock something Applause down and again doing a good job getting that trap Deep Woods comes across be able to create the turnover then again the extra pass to the corner and DJ horn starting to feel it and knocks it down from the corner second time here tonight that NC State here in the second half second period has created a turnover and then knocked down a three immediately after missing the back end is Gibson Music Applause jerson here they go back to a little bit of Zone just to throw them off balance again keep them on their toes now it looks like they match up back to man so again theyre just mixing it up they kind of start in that two3 action then go back to that matchup just trying to keep NC State from being comfortable sixpoint lead for Kevin KS as we look at Burns drawing the contact there from EA War I think as War just right before he shoots kind of gets his second hand on they kind of allow the alarm Bar for a while but as soon as you get that second hand on theyre going to call that all day third foul for E aoru just his second game of the season Burns bur he might be a big fellow but hes light on the feet great spin moving finish eightpoint lead for MC State Morel on defense H reaching havoc on Meadows was able to call the timeout and stop the clock with 902 remaining in this ball game and NC State sc one the Difference Maker in the threepoint or has been the threepoint shot for NC State here in the second period that in that stingy stingy defense yeah outside of the first two at the beginning of the second half when they came off ball screens the rest of it has came from one turnover and then DJ Burns just DJ getting into the paint and now all of a sudden the defense is getting a little bit more attention to him so being able to create those pass passing lanes and knock down some easy ones by going inside to out DJ horn has four threepointers here in the second half to propel the Wolfpack into the lead lead 6153 as we take a look at Burns to Horn for one theyll do it again and all these you know theyre kind of getting that inside out going again were getting a paint touch they kick it Jaden just hit him on one and then you get DJ burn turns there and then obviously the last one they get the trap in the corner and they make that extra pass to the corner you know we talked about him you know being one of the Big Time Players especially these last four games you know really getting some things going I think the first half having those two fouls kind of got him out of the flow a little bit but now he finally starting to get in rid of them and hes kind of turning the tables for the wolf pack getting them back in the lead 16 points on four of six shooting from behind The Arc in the first half the two teams bind for only one threepoint shot made out of 13 tries in the second half the Bic havent found much success but boy had the wolf Music pack and I think this is where coach Ford he comes out of that timeout just tells him look theres a lot of time left weve got 9 minutes to go but we got to start taking care of the ball be able to get in our offense ciny States pushing their offense too far out get some good possessions and start to defend a little bit better stay on the the two DJs who really hurt them in the second half NC State comes up with another stop and they almost get the drop there from the horn DJ Burns trying to keep it alive but its taking away by Applause dower good patience for Gibson Jimmerson dower just doing a good job pushing the pace understanding that he couldnt get to the rim and dropping that off and jerson doing a good job not quitting on the play and and following uh dower for the easy bucket nice Cut there by NC State and Michael oconnell and good feed good recognition there from DJ Burns thats how you draw it up in the basketball kame yeah I mean if youre not not going to go double team him you got to move on the other side keep those Defenders occupied they did a good job of setting a little bit of a rub screen there you know Connell just understanding the defender chasing being able to curl and DJ being a great passer that he is finding him on that cut gger misses left and NC State leading 6355 courtesy of some stingy defense and some good shooting from downtown in the Precision of healthcare every 55 its been those threepoint shots here in the second period for North Carolina State they found them able to drop when they were unable to do so in the first period but theyve got six here in the second and they have really done a good job of forcing those turnovers and then taking those into points and I think those 21 points off turnovers to zero is Just Killer uh I think the two DJs have really kind of sparked this wack team especially in the second half uh and theyve really gotten them going so just the patience to stay with it and continuously trying to turn that basketball over is just allowed state to really gain this lead state with 22 more shot attempts than the billies right now another stop for NC State as a turnover committed by Jimerson now 14 turnovers you know they did a good job in the first seven minutes of not turning over the basketball but here especially in this second half we just one too many you know you got to be able to stay in this game still a lot of time left but you got to do it by taking care of the Applause basketball NC State will throw it away committing a turnover of their own I think DJ horn thought he was throwing that to Victor one be on there yeah about took some people out in the first Music row shot clock coming up on 10 another stop for NC State morcel wants to dial up a three of his arm he gets it off the dribble JY Marcel on the assist from DJ horn thats Marcels third threepointer here in the second period and thats why I think medle just a freshman two backto back turnovers medley brings it down I felt like he had dager in the post against DJ horn again a a matchup that theyve exposed a couple times in the second half just give it to him and then instead he makes a play turns it over and then comes right back and turns it over thats just kind of being a Freshman and understanding the game you got to give it to your man there and let him go to work thats four consecutive stops that in state has put on St Louis back to back steals as horn gets it to Morell and he likes it up the three and then horn again this time hes going to take it himself yeah and this is just how you do it this is NC State when theyre at their best just being able to get out in transition again we talked about the 21 to nothing you know points in off of turnovers now there they hit another three so theyre at 24 26 so again its hard to win a ball game when youre giving up 26 points off of the times you turn it over Id much rather you know you throw it out of out of bounds so the other team doesnt have a live ball turnover coming back and have the opportunity to score and thats three times tonight here in the second period that NC state has had the the Takeaway on the steel and then the trifecta with a threepointer immediately after middle Works wide open crams are down and again just a little bit of misc I think as a thought he was trapping and nobody else thought they were trapping so a miscommunication that leads to an easy dunk by Middlebrooks there AO too strong holding his feet middle Brooks and thats going to be aaru with his fourth personal foul yeah Middlebrooks just doing a good job of standing his ground and understand that e Aero is a strong guy and absorb the contact and just kind of fall down sell it sell it the best you can Marcel give him four morcel and Horn hot from the threepoint line here in the second period for NC State and theyre starting to walk away with it now that lead even more extended at 7357 with 5 minutes to play and theyre doing it on this end theyre just getting those stops theyre creating the turnovers taking charges and then just finding and making the right play especially when they know St Louis has to ramp up the pressure a little bit and get the easy buckets ARG grve able to get in and stop horn lets take a look in transition okono nice bounce pass there Marcel having to go back and get it actually and then able to get his shoulder Square to the basket knock down the three is Fourth of the night I always said there was no such thing as a bad pass as long as it got to my hands as long as you still give me an opportunity to shoot theres no such thing but again just making the right play transmiss transition and finding the hot man 7557 the lead with NC State all with the bans of St Louis ACC and Atlantic 10 match up here tonight in Raleigh and I think when St Louis goes back and kind of watching some of this game film theyll realize look dger had some good mismatches throughout this game whether it was in the post getting downhill you know being able to find that mismatch you know make the game a little bit easier on yourself hes had a really good second half here so just being able to utilize him a little bit more uh is something I think once they go back and watch that hand come they say hey lets take advantage of that in this match Tim Jer at the line the 64 free throw Applause shooter heres a little bit of a 131 trying to maybe force a deflection or a turnover and state doing a really good job of moving the basketball finding the guy thats made a ton Middlebrooks keeping it alive the offensive Applause Music rebound oconnell back to midd Brooks he wants a straight up three and thats his first Collegiate threepointer well we said was 0 for eight so he heard us say it and made the point to say hey Im a good threepoint shooter too so getting in on the action I always said its contagious you know sometimes sometimes its you know missing free throws and then the roster misses a few free throws but also making threes its very very contagious as soon as you see a couple go in you see a teammate make a couple and even middle Brooks a guy that was 0 for8 on the year able to knock one down at the top with a great pass from okell in the Precision of healthcare every detail matters for the Casey Morel and NC State they have really used the three to their benefit during the second period yeah 21 points second time this year going over over 20 points six time in his career eight of 11 shooting four six from the threepoint line again a little bit of a slow start for the wack but again its contagious see a couple go in and then the floodgates are open y State 0 for eight and the first period with a threepoint shot in the second period nine for 15 St Louis really struggling at threepoint percentage under 10 at nine as they are one for 11 in this ball Music game no Connell doing some dirty work taking a good charge I was never a guy that wanted to put my body in there I just was not I was not good with bruises the next day um but Hy States done a really good job tonight taking some charges and sacrificing the body 7859 your score with 3 40 and Counting remaining here in the ball game as aaro tips it right into the hands of Dennis Parker NC State keeps it alive but under 10 on the shot clock now five and as aaru collects the Applause Miss St Louis Scott they have struggled mightily tonight from behind the threepoint line you got to think that that might be a factor coming down the stretch here is they Trail 7861 theyre going to need some big baskets yeah and I think obviously NC States got to get credit they they did a good job of Gibson Jimmerson their leading score one of eight on the day hes done most of his work from the free throw line being five of six from the free throw line but its also turning them over I think KY State kind of turned them over especially in the second half and getting those turn those points off turnovers and just being able to capitalize off of them middle Brooks gets the lay in over as aaru M Brooks for Five Points heres a good finish by harrove by2 coming up on two minutes remaining in the game NC State matching their largest lead of the game 17 points Morel really being banged by dag dger third foul on gger Ross Che Ernest Ross checking in 69 Jr fan favorite out of alaula Florida and morcel getting a nice round of applause for his effort going to the free throw Applause line we talked about the aggression for morcel and how he has developed and tonight can especially this second period can continue to go a long way building his confidence yeah obviously you know scoring over 20 points is awesome but also doing some other stuff you know just starting to put that ball on the floor a little bit more creating some angles sharing the basketball with others and then you know one of the things that we havent really talked about is how good of a Defender he is you know he had the matchup uh with Jimerson most of the night now obviously NC State did a lot of switching so a lot of guys saw him but hes one of the main reasons and being one of the main antagonists to really slow down Jimerson tonight Ernest Ross straight away going high for the rebound on the other end to St Louis and Applause Hughes so the final game for NC State of the year will be in a few days a 1 pm start here in Raleigh against Detroit and then once the New Year arrives you hit the road and go up to another Dame yeah both teams are getting ready to get in the bul of their season St Louis heading into the A10 for their next matchup and NC State trying to prepare to head into the you know ACC so both teams are trying to get a feel obviously theyve got a few players coming back obviously cam Woods is one of them uh you know MJ rice is another and then on St Louis side eos another one theyre trying to implement him into the office theyre trying to get used to it a lot of the team hasnt played games with them yet this year so theyre still trying to figure out some lineups I think theyll have some good things to look at on tape uh to get a little bit better and they want to be playing their best ball once they get to the beginning of that A10 schedule yeah and they hope to get sincere Parker back by then who suffered a foot injury in the fourth game of the season against Wyoming he was at that time averaging 17 points a game and was the bicin leading score yeah another one leading scorer goes down so again a lot of adversity especially for St Louis early in the season but I think youre going to see them bounce back I really like the roster and the pieces they have in place theyre just still trying to figure each other Applause out after for that tip in its 8267 NC State with the lead and the basketball as we go under a minute to play Applause Applause play thats what you love to see D on this end fighting gets the block shot they keep it in bounds and just pushing it regardless of what the score is just keep playing playing hard continue to finish this thing out and heres the fell who finished it out for St Louis on Saturday against louana a tick at the end of that game the 25 seconds left he scored 11 points to repel them to that onepoint lead LJ Applause Thomas Hughes with the takeway and a big finish for Larry Hughes the second Big Time dunk NC State 12point lead they go under 30 seconds to play and some more substitutions coming as we take another look at the steal in the slam here from very Hughes the second Im gonna go out on Lim and say his dads not that athletic Im just gonna say it yeah I dont know that is a powerful finish getting in the passing Lane getting out transition and even a little bit of contact there just finishing I think thats one of the things you know NC State coming off of a lost to Tennessee coming in here tonight and just they didnt have their best stuff in the first half you know they kind of weathered the storm a little bit of foul trouble then they come in the second half really start to make some shots get in a comfort zone same thing with St Louis I think its going to give them some good things to go back and watch on film some guys
