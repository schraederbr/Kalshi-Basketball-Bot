range and he is not afraid to let it go at any time by NC state has heard a little bit in terms of their depth the Dukes depth has been a big key this guy here Ryan young transferred from Northwestern he starts on the bench but look at those numbers from Saturday seven for seven six for six its not too shabby its almost as good as a perfect game in college basketball Ted Valentine puts the ball in the air with evernizer duwana and Derek Lively and Jeremy roach in the Blue Devils go to work on tonights first possession thank you State opens in the mantoman theyre trying to be very aggressive Wes here is Blakes drawing the start tonight he has been terrific in the last two ball games for Coach shot three and the rebound knocked out of there Mitchell a second chance for the Blue Devils it got batted away and heres state in transition and baby T to the basket but cant finish Applause of course the veteran player for John Shire is the point guard Jeremy roach Jalen Blakes has come a mile down in his development in his sophomore season and then youve got Mitchell with philipowski and here is Lively with the right hand couldnt finish Applause the rebound pulled away Greg cant getting his first start tonight for the wolf pack his 13th Collegiate start he had 12 starts when he was a member at Providence with dewana morsel Joyner and the aforementioned turquavion Smith who launches a three and the back rim and long rebound for roach and thats after quavion Smith hes going to shoot that ball Wes I mean that is a good shot for jaquavion Smith he was open and if that thing starts to fall could get very interesting it might be a bad shot for most of college basketball but its in his pocket filipowski against Smith turns forced it up and the rebound for Gantt there was a mismatch there West and what filipowski has to do is get down on the Block you dont want to be trying to take Smith to the basket from the freethrow line Joyner trying to take Mitchell to the Lane Fall Away too strong one and done with the wolf back though in the glass ever needed to wanna didnt help his teammate right there he had a chance to step into an open area but he stood still and so that forced Joyner to shoot a tough one two minutes in scoreless here in Raleigh roach picks up on the dribble phillipowski working against gan ganders trying to get right in his face theres a feat inside Mitchell to the basket he got blocked and then rejected on the return Blakes will fire program missing the three I think dewana got them got two of those West thats what hes in the game to do more cell NC State plays under man tonight Jack Clark announced an hour or so before the game will miss an indefinite amount of time with a cord muscle injury Marcel the leading threepoint shooter in the ACC misses out of the corner and there is Clark the eighth best rebounder in the ACC at better than seven a game he was doing a lot for Kevin Keats his team Dan we sure was Wes and you know one of the things his threepoint shooting percentage wasnt that high but hes a capable threepoint shooter and teams had to go out and guard him so that helped NC State spread the floor so its not just the rebounding the defensive prowess but it also affects them I think very badly on the offensive end theres Blakes and Jeremy roach will work against the Cleveland Smith Joyner the Ole Miss transfer out there to defend the New Jersey sophomore roach six to shoot for the Blue Devils Dukes missed their first six shots on the floor that got deflected and heres Joyner hes got Gann with him hell leave it for Gantt the layup good just the third field goal of the year for Fayetteville North Carolinas Greg Gantt Lively steps on the inbounds Duke misses a transition chance at their end of the floor and with that Smith will come out of Kevin keetss lineup and LJ Thomas is going to check in but heres the Finish By gan while Gantt really does a nice job running the floor West I thought that it was going a little too slowly he was going to allow Duke to catch up and you mentioned dawada he comes out because Dwight Burns Jr has checked in DJ burns the 69 grad transfer from Winthrop Burns may be in because young is in the game Wes I think Burns is going to have a hard time against Lively on the inside Marcel for burns hes already a fan favorite in Raleigh Fall Away with the left hand and thats why hes a fan favorite because hes very good with the basketball he struggled against Clemson missed some of those shots and those are the shots he missed against Clemson and normally shocks that he doesnt miss the intensity West on both ends of the floor by both teams is really amazing phillipowski trying to come up with it dead almost threw it away traveling theres the call on the Blue Devils both teams have gotten into their benches slow scoring ball game early wolf pack four Duke nothing the lead and one thing you know about Coach Gates hell walk 10 miles tonight in front of his bench Sean turn it over on their last three possessions the the cold start from the floor one thing taking care of the basketball is another area but not only have they turned it over three times West but theyve had three shots blocked and NC state has recovered all three of those shots right so the Blue Devils are listed at being owed for six but three of those six field goal attempts have been blocked chopped Joyner with Burns Gantt and heres Burns back to work with the left hand again you know hes usually not a screen and roll guy but he looks pretty good right there what were we talking about this afternoon he rarely rolls and there he did hes got States last four Derek Whitehead talented freshman from Kansas City in the ball game or Newark New Jersey rather here is Young kick out for roaches three off the front iron Thomas the rebound they missed that shot but thats a good idea by Duke to take the ball inside Marcel and heres burns with young defending ball away again building takes another level every basket he scores here got Wesson if youre not going to bring help then thats a really tough matchup for Ryan young Blakes trying to size up Thomas heres Whitehead and a reach on Marcel on an entry pass for philipowski First on Casey Marcel first on the wolf pack first foul of the ball game plus we talk about the touch that this big guy has he moves his feet very well thats not an easy shot right there but here look theres no help coming he just gets as close to the basket as he wants to and Wes he doesnt do that by putting his shoulder into young and pushing him he uses that entire body of his to get a little closer to the basket for that shot Granderson has come into the ball game for the Blue Devils theres Proctor the young Aussie he couldnt finish in front Marcel couldnt collect it but it was last touched by the Blue Devil so weve seen Duke get into the depth quickly or their versatility as youve talked about Dan when they go to the bench West they really can change the character theyre deep and I think John Shire is just looking for something you know his team is very good defensively hed like them to generate a couple of turnovers get some easy baskets to get this offense born Smith back on the floor challenges Ryan will draw the foul from Ryan young itll be the first on young the first on the Blue Devils and turquavion Smith West is extremely dangerous when he goes to that part of his game Smith sometimes relies on the threepoint shot a little too much but hes a very good freethrow shooter hes really quick hes strong enough that once he gets in there he can get the ball up on the board Smith trying to rewrite a little bit of his scouting report if you will as you see Joyner return first points of the night for the sophomore Smith look at the career hes had against the ACC and then look at Clemson and Duke Dan in his five Applause tigers and Blue Devils now he had 19 th during the ball game at Durham but it took 21 shots to get 19 both of those teams have long athletic Defenders and thats still the case with Duke tonight but its Dukes going to struggle if they cant score and he struggled of course on Friday night at Littlejohn when the Tigers were able to beat NC State Burns a factor at The Rim heres Joyner pull up three oh boy oh boy look out 13 to nothing and the Blue Devils need a timeout jarkel Joyner went three ball in transition Dukes missed all 10 shots on the floor and the wolf packs posted five blocks Dan but a moment ago at both ends but this is the situation here roach has that blocked by Burns then he gets a rebound and burns blocks it again unless its going to be hard to score if he cant get the ball to the basket but here in transition Joyner certainly can get it to the basket that core pressure grandison quickly front Court heres Whitehead a little crossover stripped and last touched by the young freshman so Tariq Whitehead and Duke having a hard time finding the basket well I think Burns knocked this away again didnt he you know so Burns hes theyre running in transition and burns somehow catches up and blocks them so hes got three block shots Smith working against Proctor Burns trying to help with the screen Smith from Deep Miss battling they scramble to the deck and burns challenged on the Baseline against Derek Whitehead it will belong to the Blue Devils well why cant Whitehead cut a break right there in the burns didnt land on him and watch this you see that philipowskis come back on the floor and promptly here comes dewana back for NC State to replace Burns Young on burns will come on young goes off Burns goes out Applause a seven foot frame huh what time threw it away trying to skip it to Mitchell I think that was the right idea thats four turnovers Now by Duke but I think philipowski can handle the ball against dewana he just has to be under control I think thats a hard matchup Joyner here is Smith against Whitehead hell take him on the dribble floater is no good phillipowski the rebound for the Blue Devils that was no good but that was some shot when I see them in there he got that ball push up with the left hand almost seven minutes gone Duke gets a scratch Mitchell on the drive and a foul against the wolf pack Ted Valentine is going to ticket Ernest Ross 69 sophomore Alachua Florida with his first second on NC State and Martin Mitchell will go to the line hes the 6A freshman from Kansas City comes in leading Duke and ACC scoring at 123 a game thats no good dont forget game one of our doubleheader here in Raleigh game two coming up tonight over in Chapel Hill Wake Forest trying to win at Smith Center for the first time since 2010 on the Corey cast Corey Alexander Randolph Childress bring you coverage from Smith Center coloring our activities here tonight at p and Mitchell had that one rattle out Chris this is hard to imagine Harris Smith around philipowski youre Kevin Keats you lost your Best rebounder Im not sure you could have asked for a better start it is 15 to nothing well you could ask for it but youd be a really greedy person and Kevin Keith isnt backcourt pressure Anderson did a good job keeping that one with the fellas in royal blue the Blue Devils have to figure out whats just how to calm down theres plenty of time left in the game its not like theyre in a desperation mode now this is a good place to go banged around heres Mitchell on the recovery in the dunk first basket for the Blue Devils an emphatic one from Mark Mitchell and typically its off on offensive rebound Duke and outstanding offensive rebounding team Music Duke on the board with the Mitchell dunk Smith of three foreign foul on Ross he got tripped up and that will get us to a timeout Ernest Ross becomes the first player with two third foul four of the last six against Duke at PNC Arena you can go back to 2013 how about uh 2015 8775 you see the Blue Devils were second in the country that night five years ago give me all the Leonard Freeman and Braxton Beverly and then three years ago my goodness 8866 that night and Kevin Keats got to be pretty pleased 13 straight to start and its 182 and you see States made Seven of their last nine from the floor and theyve blocked six shots with us they forced four turnovers and blocked six shotguns Ross playing with the two foul stays on the floor he goes off the floor again its come back its with dewana the NC State defensive intensity has been a very very impressive Proctor picks up on the dribble heres road to attend to shoot grandison Corner Mitchell nice crossover travel call Keith Kimball yes the guys are just going everybodys trying to make the great play and all you have to do is make the easy play right easy for me to say that sitting over well its not a 16point shot out there in Johns Playbook right thats it you gotta chip away here a little bit if there is he needs to go to it Joyner heres Marcel and were gonna go foul off the ball Ted Valentine has ticketed Ryan Young with his second now young is trying to be aggressive Wes and thats fine but you know Ebenezer dewana is not going to hurt you its not like going up against Burns in there right well here comes Barnes back well and and now thats Livelys gonna come in lets see how this matchup goes Derek Lively is all of 71 and a bouncy seven extremely athletic 71 Joyner inbounds for Burns and heres to kuevion Smith and see Lively help now hes also a skinny 71 the ball for burns partially deflected would tend to shoot this is what burns does into a double team put it up and it bounced out and he swapped it out West Smith and a three from Joyner long rebound for burns fresh 20 for State tried to feed the bounce pass back and Blakes commits the foul Wes that was some sequence by Burns he wormed his way inside there as he almost always is able to do and then somehow that shot came out but he tipped the ball back and then hes the guy who made the pass inside to where Joyner got fouled corner will put it in Play heres Marcel catch it shoot too strong and bodies went down underneath the play on Proctor for Blakes Applause Galen Blakes hes been tough here for state or for Duke and turns it over to state in transition and the blowby couldnt finish the layup oh my God foreign Applause Mitchell has got the only Blue Devil basket strong drive and a travel call on Mark Mitchell seventh turnover on the Blue Devils in the first half Wes Duke has to get better ball movement and player movement and this is just some play Smith I dont know how that ball is to win the basket but we talked about him being aggressive and very very talented heres Joyner trying to get it to Burns instead Marcel a kick Gant takes off Baseline back for Casey Marcel hell drive against philipowski Fall Away largest lead now for the wolf pack first bucket for Marcel roach and a foul on burns crafty move by the veteran Jeremy roach Dan absolutely Wes you have to take advantage of all the situations Wes and that was an opportunity and transition and the ability to attack Burns inside you have to take that if you can get it my you know my one problem with that Quest is if thats not called the father situation where first got down the court for Duke shoots the ball and thats not usually very conducive to effective offense Jeremy wrote 75 percent of the line Blue Devils hitting almost 81 percent at the line and ACC play and roach parries and both for his first point plus we played 10 minutes and they only have one field trip right well I I go back to your comment a moment ago its the wolf packs defensive intensity thats carried him to this margin yeah theyve done some things at the offensive end but even the flurry early where they werent scoring it was still pretty steady with the defensive end of the floor pressing that dude no matter who you got by the way if play defense you got a chance absolutely Wes they put some different guys in the starting lineup Gant and uh dewana those guys gave him tremendous energy really set the tone or helps to set the tone Duke was in the zone the last possession and they stay in the zone theres Joyner deep three long rebound more cell theres turns at the post over Lively slapped out by again third chance here Dan Duke is supposed to be the offensive rebounding team sometimes its harder in his own though Smith on a reroute Joyner thought about it attacks Hangar over Lively Burns trying to keep it alively came down with it he lost it and then it got blocked out by Lively to Marcel rimmed out Lively finally the rebound on the fifth try on the Duke on the state possession at that end of the floor Applause on the drive flakes knocked down no foul stayed in transition Joyner the euro Wes again Dukes trying to force it that was a force by Blake gets the ball inside kick it back out starts on defense Dan yeah and theres I mean how high did Burns jump maybe an inch well Duke lost on the road in the ACC this year in WinstonSalem you saw that prior to Christmas and here theyve committed seven turnovers they are one of 15 from the floor NC state has turned up the volume literally in PNC Arena theyve committed seven turnovers they have have had seven shots blocked and so thats 14 extra possessions for North Carolina State yeah Kevin Keats playing without Jack Clark tonight and dont forget doosan mahorsich is also out of the lineup for an indefinite period of time the Blue Devils who average Under 12 a game already with seven NC State yet to cash out on offense and what that means is that Duke has had to play against an aggressive set NC State Defense every time and thats thats a good thats a good sign there for Duke again it was just a little bit of dribble penetration and Tariq Whitehead buries his ninth three of the year just the second field goal for the Blue Devils Applause Joyner against Proctor and theyre playing in the zone just to try to slow the wolf back down a little bit yeah heres Joyner shot fake on Proctor five on the shot clock skipped pass more seven thats a great play by Marcel finding an old and a little bit of penetration by Joyner draws the defense Smith picks up a foul for quavion Smith a quick foul going to break and well step aside in Raleigh 17point lead for state for seven NC State leads ball game has really been set the tone at the defensive end of the floor especially by the Wolfpack West theres no question about that North Carolina state is only shooting 40 percent in the game and yet they have a 17point lead the turnovers they forced seven turnovers they have six offensive rebounds theyve blocked seven shots Duke missed their first 12 shots on the floor Mitchell has a dunk you got two free throws from roach and a three from Derek Whitehead now Mitchell was a dunk isnt a surprise that was his 16th dunk on the year he and Lively both he found at The Rim here is Whitehead setting for three at the top again and rattles it in well Wes Im sitting here thinking as hes letting that ball go that might be a little too quick but hes Rich enough to make that bet absolutely yep goes in the basket you say Nice Shot yep pair of Threes six points for Tariq Whitehead 14point lead for the Wolfpack ahead of seven minutes to play zone again for the Blue Devils heres Gantt over the top of lively and banks open for Greg Gantz second field goal Applause by the way he was two of seven from the floor coming in hadnt played in the last three games hes got two field goals in the first half Proctor almost had it swiped they go to the floor and a hill ball well send it to the Wolfpack the Wes Gant has two field goals hes got two blocked shots and hes in the game for defensive rebounding purposes he certainly has fulfilled that role very effectively the Aussie Proctor will step out and Mitchell returns potential averaging 123 points averaging 11 and shooting 50 percent on the floor in the last two for the Blue Devils coming in cluded the win against Florida State on Applause Saturday at Cameron when they shot 51 and hit 11 threes against Leonard Hamiltons team now Duke stays in the zone or sell 10 to shoot Al Burns double team DJ with a squirrel Lively got him in the air he lost the reroute and he traveled yep sure did first turnover of the night on the wolf pack was 6 31 to go his teammates are so used to Lively making a move in there they cleared out and they didnt have any place to pass the ball excuse me the burns maneuvering in there Lively handled it pretty widely handled it perfectly yeah working against Gan Applause Dan with some of these lineup changes interesting to watch the switching that state does defensively they were trying to find Philip powski who had a mismatch against Smith and Lively just overthrew it while West Duke their defense is really good and one of the reasons is their guys have such athleticism they can switch most most screens at that time and this is the second or third time weve seen filipowski against North Carolina State get out there and get hes hes matched up against Smith and they cant get him the ball inside it doesnt matter that hes seven feet tall if hes outside shooting threes hes got to get it down inside you got to get him the ball against Smith Applause trying to beat more cell to the basket and rebounded by Mitchell strong with a left hand is Mark Mitchell hes got four now Blue Devils trying to find a little footing at the offensive end of the floor here in the final five and a half a West as well as they rebound the ball on the offensive end that might be your best offense as you get the ball up on the board and go get it Birds entry mishandled tried to reroute the morsel turned it over two turnovers last three possessions for the Wolfpack philipowski in transition his first basket and Kevin Keats a little bit concerned about this great job by philipowski running the court and one of the if DJ Burns has a weakness sometimes its hes too adventurous as a pastor all right we all do a great start tonight by NC State right yes but the guys over there now they may be new to the program but the programs got a little history on scratching back right well those guys they may have been set back on their heels Quest but theyre theyre good enough players theyre talented enough that theyre going to hang in there particularly I mean the the coaching staff over there isnt going to let them hang their heads well NC State whos one and one at home in this young ACC season but theyre one in three in the league after the loss at Clemson the other day where they just did not shoot it well at all under 31 for the ball game just eight of 31 from three and the Tigers of Brad Brownell produced 30 bench points in the game now all of a sudden John Shire and his second ACC Road game is the Blue Devil head coach sees his team fall behind early and now trying to maybe buy a little momentum going to the locker room Dan well theyve theyve stopped turning the ball over and thats helped gotten a couple of easy baskets and that helped their season low for a half percent scoring is 29 Points yep in the first half against uh Oregon State they got a ways to go to get there that was out in the PK event Joyner Baxter Smith or philipowski way out there trying to fire it to Burns I thought hes throwing it to him off the board roach filipowski a catch and shoot bear balding Joyner the rebound Smith bothered that shot jarkel boy what a turnaround that is you get a turnover and you miss a three a contested three and then NC State just runs it down and gets a gets an open one in transition Smith coming in its hard over three balls oh oh now let me show you all the swag I got right here in one sequence roach on the drive and a foul Applause Wess that that is just some kind of play by turquavion Smith he tips the ball everybody thinks its going out of bounds but he gets it and he just turns around and shoots it yeah let me just show you all I got right here oh by the way on burns was his second with 419 to go first half he is the second NC State player with two and so Jeremy roach will go to the line and Wes remember weve got a whole second half to play guys in foul trouble for NC States a bad idea third point for roach dont forget full Sunday womens basketball on acc Network boy Pittsburgh hosts Louisville two oclock Eastern time then the matchup of the day number four Notre Dame and number 22 North Carolina and Carmichael 4 PM ACC Network and available always on the app the rest Just Four Points have all come at the line you made the point at the start of the game at NC State is playing shorthanded tonight because Clark is out and mahorsich of course has been out most of the year so this is a bad time for guys to be in foul trouble for NC State that bench just isnt as deep as dukes and to wanna back on the floor the Junior from Ghana who played his high school ball in Georgia here is EP got it blocked at The Rim cleaned up more cell back through traffic couldnt finish grandison comes out of there with him for the Blue Devils great defense to stop the dewana dunk under four to go packs double the number on the Blue Devils in young to work okay and hes going to get ticketed for the travels Ryan young commits the 11th turnover of the first half on the Blue Devils the 114 wolf pack just one in three in the ACC a home game tonight against Duke the state has shined early theyve doubled the number on the number 16 Blue Devils Music Duke started over 13 thats the bad news the five for eight cents might be the better news for John shires team going down the stretch and hope by the way Dan its only 16 yeah hes kind of in the world of basketball Duke has to stop turning the ball over thats it North Carolina state has attempted 10 more shots than Duke because of those turnovers and the Duke turnovers are not just by one guy Duke has had eight different players in this game with a turnover already roach pressuring Smith who brings it front Court and here is that zone again imported by John Charles Joyner and did not get the role grandison had a crack at it Awana was bothering him as Jacob grandison the Illinois transfer tried to control it itll stay with the pack but dewanas got a couple of inches on Granderson and he used that size Advantage effectively right there just a fly ball inbounds pass to Marcel inside theres EP for the hammer seventh field goal of the year for Ebenezer Delana and theyre not looking for any offense from him but he can dunk it they want him to rebound they want him to block shots they want him to guard and they want him to dunk it and thats exactly what he did roach theres young playing with the two fouls and an entry for Whitehead deflected away Whitehead grandison couldnt control it after it bounced away from Derek Whitehead down on the in the low post on the left side of your screen and young simply steps toward Joyner because Joyner shot the ball from there the last time and Mitchell did not drop down against Dewan and he was all alone tarquel joiners handed out five assists now Smiths turned it over in transition roach blocked by quavion Smith Marcella Applause score roach should have passed that ball ahead to Derek Jerick Whitehead Mitchell working on Marcel on the drive beats young nicely done first basket for Ryan Young still an 18point lead or the wolf pack Marcel Joyner Thomas a three largest lead of the night LJ Thomass seventh threepointer of the year is his first basket well hes a low volume but high percentage guy West Seven for 11 now in the season Young Roll Ed out over the right hand and Ebenezer picks up the foul his first seven on the wolf pack with a buck 52 to play in this first half young will go to the line for a pair here where he is 89 percent on the season hes made what 18 in a row thats it 2127 on the year Applause and a free throw good dont forget the debut of nothing but net comes up on Thursday night 10 oclock right after our womens basketball doubleheader the Hall of Fame coach Muffet McGraw with Kelly Grambling and Kelsey Riggs all the analysis all the highlights even the interviews and ACC womens basketball Thursday night about 10 oclock Eastern an ACC Network and of course on the ESPN app you got Young on the back end of that by the way didnt affect the first shot but you got the second shot it doesnt affect the sharp first shot it doesnt count Joyner three ball back rim Whitehead tough Rebound in traffic transition heres grandison feeding Young Mitchell right back to Young and one Mitchells done that a couple of times now Wes taking the ball very aggressively to the basket drawn the defense and dumped it off to Young and young just catches the ball so well inside young finds the open spot just drifts in and thats not an easy catch because you dont know whether your guy is going to shoot the ball or pass it to you so youve got to be ready to catch and rebound Ryan out of Stewartsville New Jersey gets the threepoint trip hes now got six here in the first half parafield goals two of three line shooting and he will come out with the two fouls with 79 seconds to play and here comes Greg Gantt back for the wolf pack to replace LJ Thomas so if youre Duke its just a matter of digging in here defensively and trying to get stops before halftime theyre back to the mantoman 17point lead for the wolf pack Joyner against Roach thank you Smith off the dewana screen Gantt and we want to try to keep it alive Marcel collects an awful lot of loose balls going to North Carolina State yep Smith the hanger one of the problems Wes when you get down by 19 to a team like North Carolina state with a player like Smith its really going to be hard to come back because he can get really hot baby Ts got a dozen in the first half to lead everybody Applause Music Whitehead in traffic Marcel ripped it out of there great defense Smith with roach defending and now the pack will hold for the final shot of the half Casey Marcel came across half court and said stop Smith lost the floor spread eight to go and roach fouled him Duke has four to give and thats the first on Roach Music and here comes Blakes to replace grandison but Blakes after a couple of outstanding performances Wes has really struggled tonight hasnt scored has turned it over a couple times and hes in the game defensively so Blakes will draw his second well you know theyve got fouls to give West but Ive never been a fan of giving fouls in the first half you might need your guys Music and another one Music third on Blakes Music thats six four point four left heres Gantt back for Joyner three over Roach Applause West the Duke strategy you know you foul get the ball out of the road last year in the ACC Applause they lost their first road conference game at Wake Forest before Christmas and Trail 22 as we go to half two shires team with the ball here the defensive intensity in the first half by North Carolina state was just something to behold and you wonder if they can maintain that here in a second heavily on the pitch young and filipowski start together and theres Ryan young hes now got eight on his third field goal philipowski continues to find himself matched up against one of the guards but of course you dont want him down inside when young is in the game one on the screen for Smith inside feed and could not get our devona could not get it on the rim Gowana starts with Gant Joyner Marcel and of course turquadian Smith philipowskys got to figure out a way to get himself involved in this offense here he goes on cue from Bonner philipowski gets his second field goal and thats a great way to do it young has drawn so much attention inside you dont have to wander along the threepoint line to try to find an opening ball goes inside cut to the basket four in a row by the Blue Devils start to have for John shires team off the screen dawana trying to free Joyner Smith would tend to shoot against Mitchell to quavion into traffic Fall Away got the shot to go theres nothing you can do about that 14 for Smith that was outstanding defense by a guy who figure is really going to bother Smith because hes long Applause theres Roach fall away from the left of the lane got his own rebound and the stick back knocked out of there heres Joyner leading the break Smith a catching shoe five straight for Smith heres Whitehead trying to answer too strong morsel the rebounder he will take it on the drive skip it for Smith another one soon foreign Music 2 26 theres the law firm of Smith and Joyner watch this play Joyner makes right here gets the ball watch this head think forces roach to come out then as the defense comes to him somehow he hangs in the air gets the problem Smith and as Joyner is lying on the floor he is signaling the threepoint basket he goes down he looks at his teammate up goes the three down goes the basket Joyner has eight assists no turnovers thats an 801 North Carolina state run West in 48 seconds and theyve doubled the number again young working on gawanna throws down and scores easily double figures for Ryan Young on his fourth field well Wes its you know not any great insight to say if your Duke and he stops you know you cant obviously cant trade baskets off the dewana screen joining a spot up and state is hitting shots now Dan again Wes we said they shot only 46 in the first half which is a decent percentage but not really a 22 point lead percentage and now theyre starting to heat up dark Hill Joyner now with 13 filipowski in one for the Blue Devils good play by philipowski West said his size he can get down on the interior and that time he knows hes got a chance he just floats to the basket and when he catches it down there Wes hes hard to stop first team foul on NC State belongs to Ebenezer dewana its his second and here comes DJ Burns for dewana as philipowski will go to the line to try and convert the free throw he is 79 on the year 11th in the ACC and has seven now in the ball game back court pressure offered by Blakes he gets joined and NC States made four of their five shot attempts here in the second halfway Id say thats hot so join her to work here and out of Smith against Whitehead shaquavion all the way through put it up on the rim with a right hand soapowski will chase it down for the Blue Devils the big fellow just handled the ball the skill set all the way to the rim and draws the foul I believe on burns yes third on burns second on the wolf pack I mean this is a seven foot 230 pound freshman going 94 feet Music he weaves right through the crowd here and he sees Burns ahead of him and hes not worried about Burns ability to block his shot Prince has four blocks tonight but he hadnt blocked any seven Footers Kyle likes a free throw down hes got six here in the half eight in the ball game dad played basketball and a line violation thatll wipe off the second attempt and hand it to the wolf pack I think they ruled that philipowski stepped over himself before the ball hit the rim okay thank you so backward pressure offered by the Blue Devils theres Gantt and he will Loop it ahead here for Smith the problem with pressure Wes like that is if you dont steal the ball somebodys going to get an open shot there goes Barnes backing down up and under blocked by Young and a foul gonna be called on young yes Tim Valentine the Whitehead said something and Ted Valentine didnt like it its on Young itll be his third I believe dont philipowski his first so its the first on Kyle phillipowski the First on Duke and here is DJ Burns Jr this is the front end of the twoshot chance Big South player of the year at Winthrop averaged 15 points five rebounds had eight games with 20 or more on his way to the top Hodder in the Big South for the Eagles and he gets one or two there hes got seven tonight how would you guard him in the Big South with about two guys I need more than two yeah a lot of you we saw Tim Craft and Garden Web earlier in the year hes got a talented team Winthrop was every bit is another really good teams in the Big South absolutely and producing great coaches by the way but theres not many six nine 275 guys philipowski the rebound off the Miss Young will try hes fouled thats burns so Kevin Keats his teams been trapped here a little bit thats four on burns three on NC State Blue Devils at the line trailing 23 when we continue Music the 11 wins in the three losses Dan you see some of the some of the statistical details here that have defined at least John shires first 14 ball games well on Duke theyre only shooting 33 percent overall tonight and 29 from Beyond The Arc but their biggest problem has been theyve turned the ball over theyve had shots blocked North Carolina State outscoring the 204 in Fast Break baskets so after the fourth foul on burns here is Young at the line coming off his fourth career DoubleDouble on Saturday against Florida State the Northwestern grad transfer 23 years of age Applause well get the back end just three for five at the line and here are the Blue Devils with some backcourt pressure again Marcel a catch and shoot three too strong long rebound for Tariq Whitehead and thats okay if youre Duke you know youre gonna you gotta take a risk so youre giving up that shot the lob for filipowski might not have been the best offer offensively heres Smith trying to be a whitehead to the basket and one 22 now for taquavion and Derek Whitehead commits his first and the second on the Blue Devils but this is the situation again North Carolina States able to get out and go because of the turnover and once to quavion Smith gets the ball in transition West he is really hard to stop and Whitehead is very athletic he moves his feet very well but once Smith gets going like that you just cant stop him yep three for three at the line hes now got 23 in the ball game he had 14 games of 20 or more including five of his last six a season to go their NC State shows a little prep bit of pressure West Tyrese Proctor The Freshman from Australia on the floor with Blakes Mitchell philipowski and Young as roach gets a break for Coach Shire the roaches oh for eight tonight Wes and Blakes hadnt made a shot either hes only over two but your two starting guards are over 10 tonight is the fifth game already this year for Smith of 20 or more Proctor got locked up five to shoot heres Blakes attacking he had it poked away cant got a hand in here is Smith he gonna race it right at filipowski and draw the foul Applause if youre filipowski in that situation its a hard hard defensive play to make but maybe if you know its gonna be hard to stay in front of Smith maybe let him get by and try to block it from behind yeah so here is turquoivion from Farmville Central High School in eastern North Carolina Applause he made 96 threes a year ago this is the back end discussion today about high volume high scoring guys in the last two decades in the ACC hes on a list he can join a list later this year thats a pretty distinguished list in this league when it comes to scoring and the volume and I mean this league has produced some incredible individual scores goanna the rebound of the Miss from phillipowski and now hes got a wingman and this guy right here Joyner heaven 15 for jarkel Joyner Wes some days you get to Bear some days the bear gets you this is not Dukes day 15 for Joyner he and Smith on their way to combining for 50 Applause maybe in this ball game theyve got 39 combined right now young thought about the three Mitchell on the drive off the glass and in Mitchell using his size against Marcel right there Music but you dont just need one or two stops West you need multiple stops you need a drought now absolutely you need to somehow create a drop yeah heres Smith trying to beat the Blue Devils on the bounce feeds dewana with a left hand left it on the rim again dewanas not in there for his offense youd like your big guy to be able to make that one but thats not why hes in the game Proctor back for you guys pass inside phillipowski rips it down with two hands boy the things that young does for this team so you couldnt have ordered out of a catalog a better grad transfer opportunity for Duke than the one to Ryan young gives them Smith lost the handle on the drive and now were going to get a whistle and a foul and Im gonna put this on Proctor I think yep but philipowski there hes got the mismatch inside weve talked about that a couple of times today and with young out in the high post Hes Able of philipowski has a lot of room in the low post yep and that high low game very effective on that particular situation fourth foul on Duke Ryan young checks out Derek Lively on the floor now Dan seven minutes into the second half for the first time and heres Joyner off the dewana screen step back three Applause F Wes that was not bad defense nope nope sure wouldnt Proctor reroute drive and one for the Freshman Proctor first basket for Tyrese Proctor where Joyner gets just a little bit of room and knocks down the three its really a nice drive that Duke has had some success driving the ball into the lane and getting to the freethrow line Proctor missed the end one Lively touched it itll belong to NC State here in the second half turquavion Smith and jarkel Joyner have 19 of NC States 20 the only outlier is a DJ Burns free throw elsewise these two cats right here running the house Thomas is coming the ball game by the way wearing number four hell handle it in the backcourt Ernest Ross also into the lineup for NC State wait that was close to 10 second violation yeah here is Joyner jarkel working on Proctor with eight to shoot another step back three that was a heat check Maybe philipowski the rebound now the clock running down a little bit really nice job defensively by Lively that time you can sort of ignore dewana and he did Applause heres Blakes theres philipowski down inside against Thomas and hell flip it to Lively the dunk but before that the foul thatll send us to break foul on Thomas will be his second its the fifth on NC State whos got a commanding lead at the under 12 start of a critical stretch for the wolf back you looked at their opponents this is a quad one win opportunity at Virginia Tech is the same thing Miami at home might be a quad two Georgia Tech a little outlier there but at North Carolina another quad one and when youre being considered for the NCAA tournament when you put yourself in that conversation the more quad one wins you can get the better absolutely basketball for the Blue Devils out of the timeout theyre on the Baseline gets it to Blakes now of course Wesley have to say that Joe doesnt determine who gets in the NCAA tournament but he leads the discussion and its a fun discussion to have theres Thomas on a reacharound against Proctor freshman from Plant City its his third its the sixth on NC State thank you Proctor trying to weave through traffic got caught in the air flips to Lively missed the layup and Ted Valentine before the shot by philipowski is going to call Ross for his third and he emphatically calls off one Ross didnt want to make sure that everybody understood everybody understood how many times did he point at Raw 24 fouls one and Lively gets two shots six of 11 at the line is Lively this year preseason ACC Rookie of the Year thats his first point Applause and the second one no good and slapped around but Marcel has it well thats a strong play by Marcel sure is 11 and a half to go vion Smith okay were gonna get a foul on lively first on Derek fifth on the Blue Devils the Duke defense really does an awful lot of switching including their big guys on those screens out on the perimeter and turquavion Smith too fast even for live is that speaks to the versatility Dan yes it does I mean not many can switch one to five now they roll on the deck Lively going to get the takeaway turned over by the wolf pack and Proctor Smith bounced that off his foot Blue Devils need a basket here yes they do more than anything else for John shires team back him down not like that third on philipowski all in the second half 16th Duke turnover you know guys need to take a page out of DJ Burnss Playbook what philipowski does here he turns lowers his shoulder and goes right in to Smith if he just uses his backside to back him in hes not going to get called for that foul Thomas with Proctor defending here is Smith Tawana trying to help and Blakes okay its not been his night offensively but Jalen Blakes is the real deal on defense Dan yeah he sure is but I think I think Smith was telling dewana hey just get out of the way dont stand there youre bringing two guys to me heres Thomas and now Ross with four to shoot now heres Thomas through hell leave it for dawada Duncan Wilson and one dunk West with 3 seconds left on the shot clock and its four on philipowski Applause the Third on philipowski its the seventh on Duke Joanna just is in the right hands a part of your screen just standing down on the Baseline excuse me at the on the the low block there and he bees got two field goals and theyre both dunks missed the free throw its the third on philipowski well what did Kevin Keats tell us before the game he wanted to wanna to play defense he wanted him to block shots he want him to rebound he want him to dunk yeah more so far so good morcell out Joyner back so now you got Joyner Smith Thomas along with Ross and dewada and here is Blake streaking to the basket Jalen Blakes first points of the game with about 10 25 to play wolf pack looked a little confused on their assignments there Smith tries to back off to the corner fires a three Music Craven went over there the bench and lost his juice Ill get it back it wont take long I promise you that philipowski and a handchecked foul on Ross Music thats his fourth so now burns with four Ross with four at the 1004 Mark and without here we go without mahorich without Jack Clark Dan here comes Greg Gant back 18 foul on NC State so NC State with Ross going out of the game Wolfpack gets smaller and Duke Duke has their two seven Footers in the game first one good on the free throw by uh philipowski dont forget ACC womens basketball coming up Sunday full Sunday of coverage at two oclock presented by Food Lion Pitt in Louisville from the Yum Center and then Notre Dame number four in the Chapel Hill to meet number 22 North Carolina all available on acc Network and of course the ESPN apps the lapowski buys one of two at the line Music NC State so with this lineup for NC State in the game West the only real offensive threat are Joyner and Smith out of the corner Gantt airball the three a bunch of quavion Smith took a rip on the on the screen and then philipowskis fouled by Gant on the drive for the dunk thatll be his first nine on the pack well with 9 39 to go the parade to the freethrow lines available at both ends of the floor so Ron Cooper the fourth year trainer of the wolf pack to tape up a couple of the fingers of turquoivion Smith those are very valuable fingers Music phillipowski will go to the line for a pair here as he was fouled by Gantt first with good see if we can see what happened to Smith that looks like a body block behind me he ran into lively thats Livelys jersey with his Camden one of two filipowski rebound dewana just its been that kind of a night for Duke Wesley simply havent been able to create that many opportunities and when theyd be able to been able to create them they havent been very efficient taking advantage of Brian Young getting ready to come back hes got three fouls Joyner out front heres Thomas five to shoot Thomas trying to get around Blakes he took it away from him now heres Proctor he had Mitchell in transition offensive foul on Proctor Wesson thats a perfect example they created an opportunity for themselves did the Blue Devils with a really nice defensive play but then this is just a tremendous job by Joyner I mean that is a tough play to get yourself back in transition like that and get your feet set so you can take the charge Applause theres Gantt trying to get in front court against Mitchell Keith probably would like to have it in the hands of one of the smaller guys yeah you know I dont know that hes thrilled that against dribbling behind his back and a crowd out there but it worked so everybodys good tend to shoot Joyner working against Proctor fires and hits 21 for Joyner what are you supposed to do Wes if youre trying to guard that guy get a hand up I mean you know youre there just their night right now philipowski fouled and Gantt draws his second thats 10 on NC State and with 8 24 to go duke has gonna go to the line for two and theyve been to the freethrow line they have 21 freethrow attempts tonight West but theyve only made 12 well and heres the other note about this thats well below their season Mark let me tell you theyre third in the ACC in their three conference games Dan at nearly 81 percent but tonight its been a different story at the line well Western since December started theyve been even better than that theyve been in the high 80s but again everything that could possibly go wrong tonight for Duke has gone wrong Mitchell out Derek Whitehead theres a good look at the 67 Freshman from Newark bothered by a foot injury in the preseason and Whitehead they feel like is just kind of rounding toward form as we get to early January 23point lead for NC State Smith all the way to the basket knocked Away by Whitehead all good says the officials as we head to the other end with Blakes skip for Whitehead hell launch and dewana the rebound ripped it out of there in traffic were going to get a foul called and is that philipowski nope its on young its four on young nine on the Blue Devils free throws when we come back to Raleigh bind and its eight assists belonging to Joyner its one behind Duke wow I want ahead of him in another category those two guys have just been outstanding West but Ill go back to the start of the game the thing that set the tone was North Carolina States defense yep youre right and we wondered if theyd been able to if theyd be able to maintain the same kind of intensity in the second half and it has backed off you know substantially but theyve still been really good they forced a total of 17 turnovers in Dukes high for the year and turnovers is 19 that was against Maryland Eastern Shore Whitehead heres philipowski now Blakes trying to get by Joyner four to shoot Blakes in trouble now its got knocked out of there and here comes Joyner with the turnover darkell reroutes to koi Beyond thought about it hell take Whitehead Baseline around young tap follow and they Scramble for it last Touch by NC State says mike Roberts why Smith was open in the corner in transition but Joyner didnt see him and that was a really good defensive play by Whitehead to get out there and for Smith to put the ball down and try to get to the basket Proctor comes into the ball games the Lakes takes a break for Coach Shire 23point lead for NC State coming up on seven to go here in the ball game in Raleigh Proctor block Marcel Casey will take off shoot to beat layup good thats the story of the night West but Proctor thats nine block shots now for North Carolina State but Proctors not a really good threepoint shooter he needs to take the ball to the basket thats a travel and a turnover and for Duke thats 19 turnovers in the ball game well he pulls up to shoot the three West and Marcel is an outstanding defensive player and is close enough that he can block it and go the other way thats again thats the way North Carolina state has played defense all night long Granderson Whitehead Proctor shoot and Ryan Young on the floor now for Duke and here is Smith Joyner Gant Marcel and playing with four fouls as DJ Burns but DJs teams up 25 well DJs got to be a little bit careful catch layup good you know West theres so many times that he puts the ball up there and its such a soft shot it bounces around the rim three or four times before it goes down heres Proctor back for young in the corner Whitehead got it thats really good ball movement nine by Whitehead tonight all three from behind the line for his nine points come on you dont see young launching it up from out there Wes he just does a nice job when hes out at the top of the key facilitating moving the ball very quickly Joyner forget bounce pass for burns Fall Away with a left hand five and a half 11 in the game hes averaged 11 and five and a half coming from the last two 30 doing it Whitehead again rattles it in from Deep Wes I think youre starting to see some of what Tariq whiteheaded what the big fuss was about and again you said he missed a lot of the preseason hes just rounding in the form now the news is real for Tariq Whitehead heres Gantt on the shot fake had it knocked away tried to recover had it poked away again theres Joyner oh my goodness fatigue on the girders in the building with a shot heres Whitehead feeling it and the rebound for Gantt you know Gant has made a nice contribution tonight as well first start for the wolf back 13th of his career after transferring from Providence look at Burns two of them oh come on Whitehead had it Gantt beat him to it Joyner off the loose ball pickup fell off the iron Joyner will run it down foreign right there North Carolina state with a 25 point lead and theyre still diving on the floor there goes Burns wrap around and Ryan Youngs Knight might be over yep five on Young and for the first time in his Duke career Ryan young will foul out well I think as people play North Carolina state theyre going to find out that DJ Burns is a different kind of Im an animal down there I mean he is so crafty and at his size hes got such a soft touch yep but again Wes the thing that impressed me is theres a loose ball and the guys from North Carolina state are diving after it yep in a 25point game Christian Reeves The 71 Freshman from Charlotte checks in for the Blue Devils as Burns knocks down the free throw DJ Burns start his career at Tennessee ended up red shirting and then went to Winthrop Mark Prosser was the coach of the Eagles a year ago Dan as you know done a phenomenal job there after Pat Kelsey went to the College of Charleston but Kelseys got the College of Charleston in the top 20 yep missed shot by Proctor with four minutes to go but Burns he revitalized himself at Winthrop and he wanted to see if he could play at this level theres a foul on Reeves thatll get us to a timeout you know the wolf pack has had the momentum since the jump tonight and the latest guy to show his Wares is DJ Burns my goodness state by 26 well Music NC State tonight took advantage of Duke going ice cold from the floor to start the ball game but Kevin keetss team took advantage Dan at the defensive end of the floor well Wes Duke was ice cold but it was the North Carolina State wolf pack that made the mice cold you know they were oh when they were over 10 West they were over 10 at one point in the game where the Blue Devils five of their shots had gotten blocked and they turned it over six times Burns free throw hes got 15 the North Carolina State Defense was intense and smothering yep and stays at 15 for DJ Burnham and thats the way its gone Granderson and Reeves and Proctor and nobody grabbed the basketball John shires team will be at Chestnut Hill on Saturday in game one of our ACC Network triple header theres burns with the left hand rattled out over the top of Reeves under four to go 27point lead Applause is a freshman from Yorkville Illinois and that ball got thrown away by Proctor into the lineup Here Comes kale Catchings for the Blue Devils and we get our first look at the sophomore Breon pass for NC State Applause Dan and Ill be at the County forum on Saturday wake Louisville follows our coverage from Boston College Syracuse Virginia our night cap of a terrific triple header on a 360 Network Cavaliers off the pit loss last night hosts Syracuse and jpj how about Pitt you know theyre really playing well yes they are heres Burns over Reeves with a left hand of course Applause DJ Burns now was 17 8152 its a 29 point game ahead of three minutes Music and a foul called and that is going to be on Ernest Ross and thats his fifth I believe well in the night scoreless with 301 to go Applause well Kevin Keats is going down the bench Joyner leaving the game Wesson what a game by Joyner 21 points nine assists so one assists away from the double double six rebounds and zero turnovers for jarkel Joyner 24 year old Jacob grandison at the line free throw good hes now eight for eight this season and thats his first point of the game yep and we talked about Dukes depth and their versatility well grandison is a big part of that and if hes not going to score then that that depth doesnt mean anything and there is no versatility second one good 8154 and you just thought if you duke he just dont have any time to recover from this you got to go back to work immediately heres Burns against Reeves skip set it Rim out Marcel the rebound every Burns catches the ball the fans are oh they love it now PJ Burns Marcel 10 to shoot heres Burns spinning back Baseline skip across Breon pass ninth field goal of the year for pass 2 15 to play grandison Catchings in the corner shoot shoots thats what hes in the game to do fifth threeparter of the year for Jordan shoe or Jaden shoot rather minutes to go turns out of a double team and a whistle and a foul called Mike Roberts is going to call the foul on Christian Reeves itll be his second I think Burns got one in the nose Applause Music now Burns has gotten everybodys attention they smother him out here he got hit in the face yep so DJ will go back to the line where hes got 17 points tonight you know Reeves it wasnt a flavor top right as he was reaching for the ball he scraped scraped the face probably maybe poked him in the eye so Ron Cooper the basketball trainer for the wolf pack checks him out and burns will go to the line with 156 to go on a 26point game it has been since 1972 the Duke has lost to an unranked opponent they lost by 27 points at NC State Applause think about the 1972 NC State team well and you know what as I recall a pretty good team wow David Thompson 1972 freshman team and 72 thats right but they still had Tom Burrell yeah they had Tom Burleson they had Tim Stoddard well I started was on the freshman team on the team what about Monty Tau was he there he was on the first freshman team too well the freshman team must have been alone freshman team is pretty dang good so it was Paul Krause on the uh varsity team in 72 yeah hes not on the freshman team right or not Paul Krause Paul coder thats what I was thinking of right I thought Paul Krause didnt he is a Vikings yeah that was close wow youre still mixing your Seasons I understand yeah I got one more left in the regular season here is uh Proctor now with a hundred seconds to play Catchings kick out for grandison and Reeves had a shot at it Marcel will pull it away so 1972 is a 27 point loss at NC State thats the largest loss against an unranked opponent potentially until tonight Marcel to try to make it 30 and its now interestingly enough NC state has scored 84 points Marcel hadnt made it three yeah thats true for the ACC leader yep coming in theres Proctor and one so Tyrese Proctor on the foul by pass now its not that Proctor cant shoot the three West but he is his percentage is very low this year and hes been much better going to the basket as he was right there well here comes KJ Keats Chase Graham Alex Nunley and Jordan Snell into the lineup for NC State to join Ebenezer dewana Wesson everything Kevin Keats could possibly have asked for tonight you know I think if you told them before the game or the minute left in the game hes gonna be clearing his bench he might have disagreed with you yeah hard not at the office for John Shire and Dan we got a lot of respect for the job John star is going to do at Duke and the job hes taking right and tonight this time out here might as much to do about the rest of the way as the last 108 of this one well Wes it might but we showed you that graphic earlier about the North Carolina State success here in recent years against Duke yeah and John Shire was not the head coach then so I dont think this beat down tonight has anything to do with who the head coaches no no questions but the wolf pack looking to win for the fifth time in the last seven games against Duke at PNC Arena its an amazing stat Kevin Keats is trying to go three and one against Duke in this building and Dan the other part is Duke never got closer than 18 points in the second half Wesson if you remember as the second half started Duke scored the first four points of the half and we thought okay maybe we have a little bit of a little bit of a run now and there was a run but it was an eight a foot run in 48 seconds by turquavion Smith and jarkel Joyner who combined tonight for 45 of NC States 84 and even without Jack Clark whos lost for the foreseeable future with a core muscle injury and certainly mahorsich who they hope to get back at some point Dan NC State set this tone tonight in this ball game at the defensive end of the floor and playing tougher at times I thought well they did Wes and and even though Duke is a great rebounding team and one of the top rebounding teams in the ACC in the country north Carolina State really did a great job battling him on the boards but the wolf pack strength has always been scoring points off turnovers they scored 30 points tonight on 21 Duke Turner yeah Catchings defends the inbounds here is Graham who played at nearby Athens Drive Chase Graham in his 33rd career game tonight fourth year walk on Alex Nunley is a sophomore from Kerry and KJ Keats well hes the son of the head coach and theres Josh Snell Fall Away rimmed out rebound for kale Catchings transferred from Harvard coach Blake and hes inside is the missed by Reeves Applause and kale Catchings played for Tommy Amaker yep he played it armored yep and Josh Snell is going to dribble this out no fouls from the Duke bench heres the call States going to go to 124 and 23 in the ACC Dukes going to fall to 114 and 22 visiting Boston College on Saturday and NC States going to take a whole bunch of momentum to Blacksburg Dan big big win for North Carolina State another opportunity on Saturday a combined 45 points tonight for taquavion Smith and jarkel Joyner NC State goes wire to wire in beating Duke 8460 great to be with Dan Bob
