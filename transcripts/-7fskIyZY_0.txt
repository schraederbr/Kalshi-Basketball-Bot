hottest power Conference teams in America meeting for the second time this year and Florida State at home controls the bald first its been a long time since this place has been this Juiced up and there was tailgating in a parking lot this morning so theyre ready atmosphere at the tuck and theyre not going to like that as Watkins throws it away looking for Jaylen warley on the BS North Carolina has an early possession Florida state will throw on its early trademark pressure Kevin its full court pressure it is switched to Steel it is up the line it is over playing North Carolinas got a really good pressure package though they can dribble entry they can high post entry or they can do this right here get in the paint with two feet and make a play Harrison Ingram Mia C part of the UNC starting five and Ingram tied up by Watkins allaw saw the Notre Dame transfer Cormac Ryan and of course Armando bot ACC preseason Player of the Year wearing five in Carolina blue the usual starting five for Hubert Daviss Tar Heels FL State typically makes teams play off the bounce youre not going to be able to play off the pass against them youre going to have to be able to get in the paint and then go Swing Swing or kick kick to make open shots fla State the fourth most efficient defense in the ACC Carolina the second most efficient offense heres the Freshman kadoo his floater TI by Bott back to Kad cormack Ryan misses a three and BBA Miller clears it at 611 up the floor for the Florida state seminal jir Watkins part of that starting five swatted by bot Darren Green Jr Deontay green 67 point guard warley and the 611 sophomore Miller the tallest team in the nation Florida State by average heights and they will go about 12 deep today and then Leonard hamilo say its the smallest team hes had hes got three seven Footers coming in next year heres kadoo pressive early The Freshman from West Orange New New Jersey has the games first bucket 73 Point per game score kadoo the tar Hills leading assist man a great compliment to Davis at the guard spot Watkins floaters hoisted in by Bop its a 999th defensive rebound of Rondo botts career well over a th000 total Davis Ryan extra pass Kad missed a three Ingrams got the offensive rebound lines it right back in Bott who had it lost knocked away in Watkins has the Florida state takeaway and Miller just ran right over cormack Ryan an offensive foul called by Ry Stein whos with Lee cell and Matt Potter todays officiating crew Leonard Hamilton 25 top 10 wins as an unranked team the most wins over unranked teams the most wins over ranked team as an unranked team period in NCW history 57 75 years old Debbie and his team the last month or so has really turned it around well theyve gotten healthy Primo Spears and Cameron Corin are two players that did not play in the first matchup against North Carolina and Primo Spears is a oneman press breaker should the heels look depress like they did in this first matchup go on the drive is foul on the way up but Elliot too initiating a lot of the offense early Jay warley with a foul saw Leonard Hamilton a moment ago who for one season was the coach of the Washington Wizards where for 15 games he got to coach Hubert Davis who was traded from the Mavericks to the Wizards in the middle of the 01 year so Leonard Hamiltons former player briefly at Washington meeting his old coach and trying to sweep him in the regular season this year its interesting how Elliot CAU has been so aggressive to start the game because he would be the fifth option on the floor offensively hes mostly a pass first score second point guard and for him to take an early three thats not his game he hasnt made one since well not in the calendar year he hasnt made one since December 29th hes coming off his second highest scoring game of the year the 14 against wake farest and he has the first four for North Carolina Darren Green Jr terrific threepoint shooter being right now by RJ Davis theyll know where 22 is at all times if theyre playing their assignments right and they know where 11 is right now Baba Miller with the first Florida State bucket Miller coming off a double figure scoring game with 12 points and hes starting to come on for Leonard Hamilton and the Press forces a timeout 2 minutes and 38 seconds into the game its a quick one well be right back to Tallahassee we all need

nice get it with go Music Baba Miller Kevin has really stepped up his game at 611 the sophomore is starting to get it in Leonard Hamiltons system hes very good at switching defensively but he also has made 16 triples coming into the game and he shoots it very confidently and watching him in practice yesterday hes really good shooting a three getting to the paint hes not a good free throw shooter thats something to keep your mind keep in mind as the game wears on sophomore was one of the most improved players in the ACC this year after season where he dealt with injuries he was suspended by the NCAA 16 games because cost of travel from Spain to the US for training camp was paid for him RJ Davis the leading scorer in the ACC at 21 per game has his first three for Carolina its a great job by Kau to get into the pain and spray it to the corner heres Watkins Florida States leading scorer rebounder assist looking for an assist here Deontay green couldnt finish and we get a whistle by Matt Potter on the way down the floor hes pointing at something on the floor piece of debris nice job of kicking after you get in the paint its a great feed and thats the pass first mentality of Elliot cadell its a smaller back court for North Carolina but they do not turn the ball over RJ DAV without Caleb love this season shouldering a heavier burden to the offense in terms of scoring 42 from three 94 from the line one of the best free throw shooting Seasons at the moment in the history of the ACC only JJ reic had a better free throw shooting season to this point theres the three for Harrison Ingram who can really step out and stroke at the Stanford transfer playing the four position he can really stretch it around Bayon this I can shoot two Darren Green Jr 348th threepointer of his career thats the one guy you cannot lose if youre North Carolina on the perimeter Ingram again with backto back triples and three threepointers made in the game in about 25 seconds yeah I see the game through an offensive lens North Carolina because they have been so good at scoring has allowed them to set their defense they do a really good job at icing on the ball screens on the side and then theyve been switching the middle thats usually the way theyve started the game theyre not switching one through five right now theres green another threepointer over bacot around it out the putb is there for Deontay green the 69ine SOP for that is a real Rarity a second chance basket against North Carolina which allows the fewest Second Chance points per game in the nation keep in mind thats a big part of what Florida state does to score though they C and they dont lose anything with their team speed and getting back in transition because they press full court so theyre picking up early Davis got the switch to Baba Miller and a step back triple in his face UNC four for six theyve hit four straight threes makes the defense wrong every time such a high IQ and reads the game so well offensive foul against Jaylen warley is his second we go to break with Carolina shooting the lights out here in tally the kick from the inside out thats how North Carolina has set up their threepoint shooting and then Davis on the switch creates separation off the bounce and drills it over the 611 Baba Music Miller youve got too much on your plate to worry about what to put on it next thats where

first meeting between these teams this year Florida State led by 14 in the second half and then a lot of this turnover after turnover Carolina put on the press and turned a 14point deficit with 1725 to go into a 14point lead with 441 to go thats a 3911 run there was a 22 nothing run in there and UNCC won the game 7870 Florida state was brilliant from three UNCC though crushed Florida State at the free throw line today early on it has been the threepoint shot of of Carolina theyve hit their last four and theyre off to a great start and Armando Bott hasnt got a touch on the Block and hasnt shot had a field goal attempt in the game yet Jaylen Withers Off the Bench for North Carolina heres Davis hoisting again misses from three there and the rebound down to Taylor B Bowen as Florida State finally uses its immense depth Camp core and the 610 sophomores in the game as well as Primo Spears George out transfer on the ball right now neither one of those two guys played in the first matchup and they desperately needed Primo Spears hes more of a natural point guard for Florida State Spears trying to set up Cor and he turns it over and Davis has the Tar Heel takeway hilf scored on five of the first eight possessions and Davis passed up an open layup through it to Withers in traffic and the ball is grabbed by Cor Watkins pushing Tempo and jir Watkins fouled before the shot North Carolinas first foul of the game after 6 minutes and the second itll go against Jaylen Withers I think North Carolinas going to have to dig a little deeper into their bench early on as well just because you know theres a wear down effect with the way Florida State plays even Adrien ay the head coach of Syracuse after the game the first thing he said was they wore us down our guys retired could see up to 127 that is a Leonard Hamilton staple goes as deep into his bench as about any coach in the country deep in the shot clock heres Spears and a big score Off the Bench hes got the switch with bot Spears botts all over him Spears has to throw it up near the rim brilliant defense on the ball by Bott who is rewarded for his efforts with a threepoint opportunity the first first three steps up the floor are dig dig dig by Bon when we were talking to Hubert Davis before the game one of the things that ouro has had to do is dig a little deeper into the film with their switching D you

creative planning our private wealth managers learn about you first dont settle for a standard portfolio book your free meeting today at creative planningcom we come out of break and and heres Armando B look at this switch one through five hes got the point guard the quickest player on the other team for Florida State and he keeps them in front and forces a tough shot then the Sprint to the rim thats what Armando Bott can do to change the game to make winning plays he didnt have to do all that perimeter defense in the past now hes more equipped to do it he studies film he knows every Personnel on the other team thats kyp man you got to know youre guarding when youre guarding on the perimeter and youre switching one through five he admitted Bott that he really didnt have a great year of rehab last year he had shoulder and Ankle issues hes been laser focused on basketball this year said he was going to cut down in some of his nil engagements his final year in college or as Hubert Davis calls it his third final year in college and hes going to take a seat for Jaylen Washington after the threepoint play Kevin you can look at all the numbers and obviously its incredibly decorated career one of the greatest in the history of North Carolina basketball but when you watch him play this year its the angles its the communication its the nonstat stuff its the leadership its the way he shapes up to the ball its how hard he posts to demand a double all those things affect the spacing on the floor for his teammates there Watkins Florida State hasnt scored at 2 and A2 minutes Trimble down the floor good find from Washington and then Trimble slaps the floor after blowing the layup B Bowen from green Air Nails a three and Carolina looks to run it again Davis has options on the wings up top for Withers stuck by buone and Watkins grabs it for fzu backto back layups at the rim for the heels to break for the Florida state they take advantage with the Watkins three thats a big swing if youre Hubert Davis as four you didnt get and three they got in transition Davis pickpocketed by Primo Spears its a three on none and Spears will lay it in spe and then the pressure starts and Hubert Davis has to wave his Tar Heels back and teams are just not used to this kind of Relentless 40minute pressure that Florida state provides its a switch with high hands its a switch to steal they communicate on the weak side and you force tough twos Watkins off the withers Miss heres Darren Green Jr Withers able to recollect his position and Spears will reset arst State team its won six of seven Spears has been a big part of that and his elbow jumper is cleaned up by B Bowen seven straight over a minute and two seconds for FSU Trimble washing gets three inside and finishes Jaylen Washington whose playing time has been slashed of late with a big Slam in the last three games hes played 15 minutes hes scored a total of four points hes going to get more playing time today Carolina 7 for 15 to start Florida State 6 for 14 four turnovers for the Nolls three for the heels Watkins again had it taken away good hands by Harrison Ingram Ingram will go up with a lift and Watkins high points it back to Carolina its Davis Washington flying into Watkins and a foul will be called against jir Watkins we may all need a few moments to catch our Collective breath here because Carolina and Florida State are burning up the floor and its Jaylen Washington just a single point the first time these teams met with a thunderous two in Talahassee Music enough so I got

well as North Carolina right now their longest win streak since the end of 17 into the start of 18 seven straight ACC wins by double digits been over 30 years they did that nine straight opponents 70 points or fewer been 17 years since they had that kind of a streak its been all about the defense for North Carolina in that streak yes theyre scoring it at 83 and a half per game yes RJ Davis a brilliant lead guard but they have changed defensively they felt like they were embarrassed against Kentucky in December gave up 87 points in that game gave up 9 two to Tennessee they tweak some things Pat Sullivan whos the director of recruiting who helps coordinate the defense Hubert Davis and his terrific staff Hubert Davis telling us that Armando Bott came up to him this week and said this is the first time Ive really had fun playing defense its been engaging for here and the rest of the tar Hills well they work at it and thats a turnover by Kau that was an easy one for ball jayen gaining Cormac lion gets back defensively here heres the thing Im not going to call it a softer cover because I dont think its that I think its high hands good habits I think theyre in the right position but what theyve done is they ice ball screens on the wing which means youre trying to keep the ball on the same side of the floor not let them use the screen okay and what that does is it loads your defense to the strong side and makes it tougher for them to make a crosscourt pass the other thing is Bott protects the rim theyve got quickness on the perimeter sometimes they switch the shoot sometimes Bots and drop coverage they change it up right here drop coverage High Hands by Bott and then you get out to contest and thats just a good shot by Primo he can make it hes a good midrange shooter Primo Spears a top two to cut the lead to four big CAU back on the floor Jaylen gainy the grb transfer from brown right now iss on the ball guarding Elliot kdo gets round gain he a screen from Bott to Spring free and Kido will return to the Applause Music line what a different mind said when Elliot Kau becomes a threat on the top of the floor and not just a pass first I mean we we know thats his game let me tell you this hes hes been solid for a freshman point guard in the ACC the first 10 games his assist turnover ratio was 285 the last nine its 22 its excellent to have a freshman in this league be able to manage all the different defensive looks that he gets and not turn it over its a great day college basketball on ESPN every Saturday from here on out its a great day of college basketball but some heavyweight fights here in the ACC where Clemson visits number 12 Duke PJ Hall Kyle filipowski go head tohe head sonic Blockbuster game day was at Bud Walton earlier itll be rockus as Arkansas tries to write it season against Kentucky and then LSU Alabama after that all right here on ESPN or the ESPN app Clemsons got a tough one there and C last time Duke was there they lost a pit Clemsons only won four times in Durham so its not an easy task for Brad Brownell but thats the other team right now Clemson Duke North Carolina that Joe lonardi has in the NCAA tournament right now and I think theres a couple more that are going to be there and Florida States got something to say about it right here today this is a quad one opportunity for them yeah the rest of the league it seems like is collectively on the bubble right now in the e CC Carolina will be a one seed certainly Duke and Clemson look like therell be tournament teams as well Dan smashes down for two heres what I dont understand about the narrative in the ACC when North Carolina was down everybody thought the league was down well North Carolinas up and theyre a one seene right now Duke is up okay why are is everyone not talking about the rest of the league like theres some really good teams in the ACC and theres some good quad one opportunities left on everyones resumee feels like there are about eight teams that could have a hot twoe stretch and all of a sudden be in the field Ingram tied up jump ball possession out the way of Florida State jaylor Jackson was in on that play the 65 sop Bo from Memphis Ingram sets up his ability off the bounce because hes made a couple of triples and look at the way Florida State converges to the basketball if youre going to dribble into the paint Kevin you better make a strong play because theres going to be multiple bodies and hands in there RJ Davis returns after a brief break for North Carolina which is not trailed in this game Josh nickelberry on the floor for the first time from Florida State wearing number 20 theres the ice by RJ Davis keeping the ball on the same side of the floor and on the other side though Florida States got to reverse it against North Carolinas defense Jackson got it to Spears not a good threepoint shooter and Miller with the long arms tapped it to Davis going one against three here Davis had it taken off maybe the backboard no goal tending call Ryan dribbles it out to kadoo back in for Bott who scores it great hustle play by cormack Ryan a little Pawn Skipper to the top of the key and Bott with a finish when Bott gets his shoulders Square to the backboard forget about it youre not going to stop him from scoring Five Points two for two for bot Ingram guards the ball right now the post move from the sophomore Miller couldnt convert Ingrams got his sixth rebound of the game and he can take it down the floor too nickelberry tried to draw the charge no call Davis passes up the three Bott couldnt catch Davis on the cut Davis on the floater its beautiful hes got the best float game in the ACC theres nobody that has a better one than RJ Davis about how about in the country when youre a smaller guard you have to know how to make plays off of right foot Left Foot Right Foot wrong foot you have to know how to get the ball to the rim over taller Defenders the ACC at 21 per game hes well on Pace to do that heres a three for Jackson he sticks it just his eighth of the Season Chandler Jackson just really good ball Movement by florid to State boy this games picking up Kad will get back to the line Jackson after the three in the middle of it All Florida States hit 43s North Carolinas hit 43s not two teams that are necessarily known for their threepoint shot I mean RJ Davis such a good basket cut and a scoring cut with the float game and then attacking the switch Jackson ready to fire plac is jacked up in here this is fun where you learn to serve oh I didnt serve

always delivers to du in Carolina it will deliver next Saturday game day will be there for the 261st overall meeting way back in 1920 Duke took both last year of course the famous final form game a couple of years ago in Hubert Daviss first year one of the great listens in college basketball is Dan and Jay on Duke Carolina it doesnt get much better than that the right voices the right teams the right colors it just feels like college basketball so we cant wait to hear those guys and watch the first two meetings between those teams in Chapel Hill Hills will see if they can remain unbeaten in the league into that after two free throws by Kau Watkins has it knocked out of bounds so North Carolina will situational press off of some dead ball situations or free throws and thats our first look at Primo Spears trying to attack that press and there were numbers on the backside good Hustle by Carolina wanted to get that tap and set their D Deonte green with a tough Leander seventh rebound for Harrison Ingram is a leading rebounder in the ACC in conference games hes hit two threes already he does not have a third Spears will push it after the rebound only Florida State player with multiple field goals in the game Primo Spears eight different seminal have scored 11 different players have played Watkins with a strong post Watkins is fouled and finishes right through the contact of Canó you run your offense to get the switch and then you clear it out good coaching decision by Leonard Hamilton to put the ball in Watkins hands coming off that career high 27 in the last game against Syracuse too much size and physicality in the paint this is what he does Watkins hes taken 35 free throw attempts the last five games hes made 29 thats an average of six of seven per game and he hits his first of the afternoon Davis back on the floor for North Carolina with Ryan Kad Bott and Ingram the starting five and North Carolina has already built in two point guards in the starting lineup so they usually dont have any trouble in the back court against pressure we got multiple ball handlers to bring it up Bott with a deep post of green who tries to draw the offensive foul and then Bott turns it over and then K commits his second foul in a matter of just about 21 seconds so set Trimble another point guard will replace Applause him good collapse on the post on Bott forcing him to become a passer thats what you want to do you you dont want him to catch it that deep and score you want to push him up the lane if you can bring two bring two and make him a passer spear Watkins Miller green and green Jr four starters along with Primo Spears for Florida State heres Miller that tripped up with Ingram thatll be the fifth North Carolina foul Harrison ingrams Applause first a Florida State team debut that was picked 11th in the ACC they were 9 and 23 a season ago and early on in the season looked like they might be no better than 11 but theyve gotten healthy theyve gotten Primo Spears back he was a twotime transfer and his waiver eligible theyre 12 deep and theyre playing some of the best basketball of anybody in the league as Miller misfires from three and Bott loses the rebound it will stay with Florida State the beginning of the year you wouldnt have thought Florida state was anywhere near the top of the ACC nothing close to the NCAA tournament conversation they moved up 31 places in the BPI ESPNs basketball power index since then theyre still not quite on the bubble because they have three quad three losses but theyre five and four in quads one and two so you get a win today thats going to do wonders for their metrics its going to be a huge win against one of the best teams in the country and then we have to start seriously talking about Florida State as an NCA tournament team I mean theyre noncom youre right there are a couple bad losses on their resume but the win over Colorado is going to get better Colorado is a very good basketball team I was in a pack 12 all weekend last weekend theres some good teams out there right now Joe lonardi has three pack 12 teams with Colorado on the bubble and I think theyre going to make it some of the nonconference losses lip scum home loss really hurts him they had a 17point lead here against Georgia with 648 to go they blew that game had a win probability of 993 in that game according to Ken P and LW so there are a couple of big missed opportunities but in the new year they looked like an NCAA tournament team now they need to build an NCAA tournament resume Trimble with trouble 5sec violation and the Florida state pressure forces the seventh UNC turnover 611 on the ball look at the wingspan of Baba Miller Trimble tried to get timeout and then a takeway on the other end for Carolina Trimble is fouled by Music Applause Miller Baba Miller with his second foul fou number 11 Baba Miller is Music Applause second SE Trimble was a huge part of that comeback win over Florida State in December 64 free throw shooter hits the first two of the top teams in the SEC square off tomorrow a Sunday womens college basketball ma its Tennessee and Old Miss from the Pavilion in Oxford three Eastern two Central here on ESPN lady falls only behind undefeated South Carolina right now five and one in the SEC theres clearly two top teams in that league in South Carolina LSU did you see the rating for game day in Baton Rouge on Thursday night my goodness Spears strong Drive gets the underside of the rim e rebound already for Harrison Ingram Carolina its plus four on the boards Trimble right right into the paint out for cormack Ryan two deep from three Bon Hing his jersey held right there by Deontay green he wanted a foul and now bot and green with an exchange of words and a little headshake from Deonte green trying to fire up this guardit and gold crowd emotions on display from the sophomore Deonte green who oh by the way is from the state of North Carolina Asheville North Carolina home of Roy Applause Williams I mean theres clearly a a a whole Jersey being held right there Bott didnt like it and Watkins stepped in between lot of chatter good job by the officials to break it up and a good job by Leonard Hamilton Hain on the spin slow down a little bit here Zaden pie with a rebound his first action pxs and Ws on the floor for the first time as UNCC goes very deep in a bench theyre watching that match up right there green theres no question thats going to be a fact hes draped all around him I mean Im watching that match up first trip down the floor you dont think the officials are watching it that was an obvious foul by Deontay green and hes still running his mouth how about the majority of Bott though right not picking up a cheap one here right Mondo prefer to let his game do the talking as he often does one and one here for a vastly improved free throw shooter misses it though 80 on the year Darren Greens got the rebound green with a hard drive off the long foot scores it theres a little juice in this building right now more than a little fla state which has not LED within one into bigot knocked Away by Green who saves it in front of his own bench here comes a three Ms looking for their first lead Spears will give it to him and then Davis answers what a response the last time down I knew Florida state had the three Kevin because of the way they Suk to the paint defensively and if it wasnt going to be Darren Green he passed up a three to give Primo Spears an opportunity and then RJ Davis making the defense Applause wrong heres Spears backing out nine to shoot it Spears Watkins High has the hands down down Watkins into the body of hve and a little Bobble there itll be a travel and a Florida State turnover Carolina LED this

heavyweight batt the Big 12 Kansas and Iowa State and uh not the softest Landings in terms of homecomings for Ed KY today who is back with George Town in Providence if youve seen some of the scenes from there whoo has it been heated at the dunk where the friers lead at kie Hoya by six leaks you mean theyre upset that he left I mean somebody blew up his house listing and put it on a poster in the crowd hey how about this game Carolina leads by 11 early but Florida State 11 points off turnovers getting the balance that we so often see well Florida State leads the ACC and steals at better than nine a game and theyre are plus three and a half turnover margin so you have to if youre North Carolina neutralize some of that by not turning it over and staying on the offensive glass p and wji gets a timeout wow Carolinas burned two of those nothings going to burn Hubert Davis more than not getting open you got to get open I dont blame him cut cut hard move without the Applause Music ball I dont blame him Id give it to him too and then on the other side Florida State how about that forcing two timeouts right thats big because that gives them some Mojo right thats momentum for Florida State if there any of you that are professional lip readers Id love to know what happened in the last 15 seconds not going to repeat it Im not sure its all PG but boy Huberts fired up cuz thats not only two timeouts bur remember there was a 5second call earlier in the half as well third year for Hubert Davis in North Carolina Leonard Hamilton 22nd at Florida State former player and Coach together for last couple of months of the Washington Wizard season 20201 the other thing is that when that ball goes into the corner or when it gets inbound with Florida States not looking to trap okay so they fall back to set their D so all you have to do is get the ball in bounds especially when you have two point guards on the floor well Zaden High stepped out so after all of that Carolina turns it over anyway thats nine in the first half for UNC its their most versus an ACC opponent and a half this year another three for Florida State this one is from Watkins and the semal are 6 for 11 from Deep now after a made bucket Paxton roic can run the Baseline Davis dribbles it off his foot his third turnover Carolinas 10th Primo Spears in the game has had an impact watch here he gets in the Gap and high just overh helps you didnt need to to get that far to help you should have stayed on the shooter North Carolina on pce for the best threepoint defense in school history theyve given up seven in the first half Spears has his second and the seals lead by Music six this is uncharacteristic for FSU and Darren Green has only made one their best threepoint shooter tremble trying to take control he gets fouled on the Applause drive Primo Spears four for eight two for three outside the threepoint line hes got a couple of assists to go with it in his 13 minutes he remember he did not play the first time these two teams met in Chapel Hill in December I mean North Carolinas threepoint defense isnt good its its great its possibly historic yes their best threepoint defense ever 2015 30 sorry Kevin it its supposed to be great right and and Florida state has neutralized that some because of their downhill driving ability taking advantage of their speed and quickness and their length their length isnt just on the defensive end theyre on the offensive end they can get in the Gap and make plays over the smaller guards from North Carolina set tremble makes a couple of free throws uncs threepoint defense 29 on the year 23 in the ACC Florida State though hit 12 out of 28 the first matchup its 7 for12 in the first half today they lead by four at home Watkins over dribbling thats the second time that Ingram has picked somebody clean on the top of the floor Ingram he loses it he dribbles it out of bounds North Carolina turns it over again and Hubert Davis trying to measure his emotions on the sideline its an old basketball cliche about not playing too fast versus being in a hurry right dont be in a hurry dont get caught up playing too fast theres a difference here right now they are all sped up by North Car by Florida States defense few moments ago we told you Carolina had a season High turnovers and a half in an ACC game they now have a season High turnovers in a half period they had 11 against Kentucky earlier this year in the first half they have 11 in the first half here at Florida Music State Primo Spears Leading The Way with 10 Primo Spears missing the B Bowen has the offensive rebound it was kept Alive by Corin and a few Second Chance buckets now for Florida State Leonard Hamilton has run that little elbow screen a couple of times and the Florida state jump Shooters know that its theyre not leveling off the screen at that point for North Carolina so thats an open jump shot for them Ingram snatched the Miss from Davis is still alive its Bott throwing it on the rim Paxon woek is in there and woek of all people finishes what a tough two by Paxton roic hes getting some quality minutes here in the first half for North Carolina usurps his season average with a single basket eight offensive rebounds for Carolina in the first half Jackson spinning around woic Jackson kept that dribble going thats pretty good d Thats Just A better jump shot NOS are six for their last seven tying their game high lead of six points briyan all kinds of contact there water State PCH wanted to tie up and wont get it for M Bryan a brilliant free throw shooter will get two second foul on Chandler Jackson for Florida State what a turnaround this has been for Leonard Hamiltons Nolls down 11 early up six in the final 49 1 half of the half later tonight Rivals week rolls on in the NBA 530 Eastern on ABC the last three MVP Trophies have gone to Nia yic or Joe lmb theyre the two favorites for this years theyll face off with the nuggets and Sixers then LeBrons Lakers and Stephs Warriors at 830 eastern NBA basketball on ABC oh a Miss cormack Ryan who was 47 of 51 before that free throw Miss 92 on the year going into those shots if you go quick theres a two for one opportunity here for Florida State nickelberry stumbled so they dont get it Spears will try to make it a good one nickelberry a pull up its probably not the right option North Carolina can hold it for the last shot here HS LED this game 19 to8 they really havent played through Bott in the first half thats going to change in the second only taking three shots Bott the screener on Green Look At The Drive By Davis left to right couldnt finish and its North Carolina ball with two and a half to Applause shoot RJ Davis with 10 points four for n and a half but three turnovers Taylor B and will replace jir Watkins for the final defensive Applause possession Josh nickelberry look like he was headed out of the game hell stay in with two and a half to go got time for two dribbles oh Ingram couldnt catch it nickelberry hoist is off Target what is scoring off its bench 21 to seven bench points 19 three edge off turnovers most turnovers and a half for UNC with 12 how do they get back in this game to start the half I think they got to play through on mindo bot thats one thing I mean he only had three field goal attempts in the first half and there have been games where he has not had a lot of free throw attempts hes had five times this season hes had single digit free throw attempts hes got and single digigit points hes got to be a factor here in the second half on the road you got to play through him check the possession live off the Cormac Ryan Miss RJ Davis with 10 to lead UNCC but three turnovers for the ACs leading score Florida State led by Watkins and Spears each with 10 heres Kad starting the second half much the way he started the first and Elliot kadoo has nine starting five for Florida State Baba Miller Aon green Jr Deontay green jir Watkins Jaylen warley eight different players scored 11 different seminal played in the first half green P up two you wanted to see him get going and right on Q I love the Twist and then the retwist by Deontay green to free up Darren Green Jr good twoman game on the naked side seven points for the second year seminal transfer from UCF theau against Deonte green and green knocks it away from him another turnover the 13 Watkins out for three for Applause green too good largest lead for Florida State Greening the double figures in a Flash Ingram will try to back him down back for Ryan and finally Ryan hits from Deep he was 0 for three to start they need him to get going this seon season Ryan the Notre Dame transfer the 29 shooter this year from Music Deep Watkins a 10point first half did turn it over four times warley over Davis they it kadoo big height advantage and a big two for the nos point guard now heres Davis pulling up over green I mean hes a oneman fast break he is absolutely terrific corner to Dicky v hes the best scoring guard in the country and I agree with them Watkins that one too deep from three and Miller went over the back of Ingram and knew it thats the third foul on Baba Miller I mean watch this in the open floor RJ Davis hes coming at you and all you can do is backpedal and force a tough two he gets to the elbow and he sticks it and 27 against Florida state in the first game remember Carolina was down 14 in the second half in that game and came back to win by eight so down eight in the second half here thats nothing for the Applause heels this the first time though that theyve trailed by more than seven points in their last 10 games point is really fight fighting to get to the point of screen and the contact is picked up the level of physicality has risen Notch here second foul Darren Green Jr its a non shooting Music foul L state does struggle with fouls a foul at one of the most frequent rates in the country Carolina has been on the line a lot today Ryan a catch and shoot his second three and a half cor M Ryan its a simple roll in replace however the roll is Bott with a guard on him and so you lean towards helping a little bit B and that gives more separation to Ryan tough catch by Green Ingrams got another rebound Davis oneman Turbo Charge floats it home and Carolinas got eight straight RJ Davis aint messing around 14 TR to make it seven in a row for UNC to tie the score Watkins with a green screen oh Bowen in the game after that third Miller foul another screen by Green Watkins taking on two Tar Heels a foul against Cormac Ryan is his first Watkins knows theyre icing so hes trying to snake behind it to get open this will roll hard to the rim by Bott and he creates that opportunity for cor M Ryan because you got to help a little bit and help tag on that roll and then Davis will not be denied at The Rim Applause Music through the elevator door screens and cormack Ryan is right there on his hip warley floats it over Kad couple of times hes taken advantage of the 6 in size Advantage there and Kad is fouled Carolina very aggressive off of makes here thats the third foul on jayen warley well if you play downhill and you push and you look for early opportunities in offense theres no time for Florida State to get organized and to switch and do all the things they like to do defensively its a really good job of picking up the tempo by North Carolina with their offense here in the second half Davis three bot in between a couple of seminal kept it alive for Ingram and Ingram finds an outlet with kdo Ingram off the shot fake has B Bowen hooked around him elbow to Elbow thats four fouls and not yet four minutes in the half for Florida State that could be a major factor down a stretch UNC is a very good free throw shooting team well these two teams get to the line more than anyone in the ACC North Carolina leading that category four stay to Second and theres a discrepancy at the line right now the heels 10 for 14 fla States only made two trips therea States got Primo Spears back in the game as a team best plus 13 in the first half in there for warley Ingram shot ready Ingram rattles home his third three and North Carolina is back on top the other thing is North Carolina is keeping the ball in the middle third in their quarter Court offense and thats allowing them to run some different screening action that we did not see in the first half six assists for Kad to been very alert to all of that off ball movement heres green thats a two and that is a stroke of beauty Davis again I mean just look at him go there are no numbers nothing resembling numbers and he pulls Watkins into trouble for the fifth Florida State foul of the half heels are back within one here in Music Florida Music Applause Music see

many as eight here in the second they led by as many as 11 in the first half Hubert Daviss team has won nine straight games and theyve won every ACC game except for Florida State by double figures that was a mere eightpoint win but a come back go to 9 and0 and League Play which theyve not done since 2001 to start in the CCC morac Ryan with seven points for Carolina all five starters between 5 and 14 with Davis Leading The Way with those 14 points CAD has been a great distributor and scorer today and Elliot kadoo will return to the free throw line a chance at a threepoint Play Taylor Bowen has been on this match up with CDO a couple of times and he just cant keep him in front hes too quick Music ellot CAD with 11 points and six assists they get 12 and six his season averages are 73 and Music 35 closing in on a season high and he has North Carolina back in front here at the tuck Watkins thats a shove up high L do draws an offensive foul Jamir Watkins third and Florida state is starting to get into some real foul trouble which they usually can absorb because they play so many people but I think getting Primo Spears back in the game right now by Leonard Hamilton is going to up the level of uh intensity on both ends here he played very well managed the game was under control in the first half for Florida State and helped them build that lead North Carolina started 11 for 29 they fit seven of their last eight Davis has the switch with a big man gainy twotime ivy league Defensive Player of the Year at Brown Davis he got away with a travel there yep he Tred when youre RJ Davis sometimes you get lucky hes got 16 green at a big second and half thats a tough angle shot rebounded by Jaylen Withers up the floor Applause Kad hes got the switch with gainy now what will Kad do with it driving into gainy got around him got to the rim and scored Elliot kadoo is taking over I mean kdo and RJ Davis have decided to put their head down and they are getting their hips and

half Florida State shooting 63 in the half and theyll been outscored 22 to1 UNC is 9 for 10 now in the second half and leading by six Kau got green in the air drives it again and kadoo who has lived

was headed to North Carolina he decided to decommit go to St Johns under Ric patino Leia kadoo reclassifies up in the summer what a lift hes given them 16 points a new season high for the Tar Hill freshman well Hubert Dave the selects to go with three point guards on the floor right now and Trimble in there as well with big cotton Withers jumper from Spears is missed Leed up by Deontay green and green stuffed by Bott a foul and Armando Bott is going to hang hang back here with the simmering tension from the first half between these two carrying over yeah I dont think its free throws I think it was on the Applause floor theres a push right there yeah ball out of bounds good job by the officials and hbert Davis going to take him out settle him down a little bit but I dont think uh he looks rattled at all to me only his second foul and he needs to take a break right here wait till the next meeting timeout Koo flying in slams it in bounds but apparently Kau touch the sideline first and Florida State will keep Applause it I dont know if he did oh Im not sure thats a tough one you know what the officials theyll tell you the plays that are right in front of them right under them are the the hardest ones to call K gets a breed there near the Under 12 as well Harrison Ingram returns Spears wild drive cleaned up by green and what do we have here Deontay green was grabbed the rim now that Potter is going to go over to Lee cell and make sure they clean this up look like green grab the rim theyll get Ramy Sans in as well see right here yep right hand looks like this play is going to be reviewed at the Music monitor all right Matt Potter just gave you the official word yes its a Class B technical foul for holding on to the rim Class B technical fou against Flor to say number five that means anyone can shoot the free throws for North Carolina of course were going to put RJ Davis there then youll go back to the point of interruption which I believe will be well I thought it was going to be North Carolinas Ball but I think you go to the to the uh to the arrow because the ball was not possessed at the time hel it that is a tough Tech I know the rule by the way but thats a tough technical foul to give on a ball thats just up for grabs well he had an advantage by grabbing the rim so one free throw because a Class B and beonce green is going to check out of the game nine in a row for North Carolina the snap one was a 5252 tie flid state has not scored it in nearly 3 minutes and they still have it watch hins couldnt convert on the you from Miller seols will keep it they it 10 straight after the technical free throw by Davis for UNC the 611 inbound room Miller Watkins on the drive whoa dunked it so hard ended up in the back court on a bounce yeah thats two points at The Rim hes missed back to back he drive it again this time hell hand it off corm will finish at the rim and finally delightly L state gets a bucket on The Possession one of those deserve the go down for the seals effort fla States got to get a couple of stops in a row right here so they can get this crowd back in it cuz it definitely gave them a lift in the first half Davis has the switch on Corum Davis is stri by Corman that was a smart foul because Spears had green all alone down the floor North Carolina by seven whole lot of chapters left to right in this Music one

great basketball game on our hands Carolina down 5 and a half leading by seven trying to start 9 and0 and ACC play for for the first time in 23 years Kentucky taking themselves into another tough environment how about Lamont Paris and South Carolina they win today so they build on that upset in Columbia on Wednesday 17 and3 for Lamont pariss team at South Carolina huge huge week for them might be a top 25 team come Monday South Carolina should be as a tie up there the arrow belongs to North Carolina the possession arrow has not reset previously on the class B technical foul Kevin now you know Leonard Hamilton doesnt like to play any Zone however I did go to practice yesterday and Im not saying that they should play it but he has it in his back pocket because the North Carolina guards are so downhill right now that they cant keep them in front F do and Davis have scored 13 points for B in the second half Ingram fouled thatll be Watkins fourth with 1126 to go Florida States leading scorer there one foul away from being out of this Applause Music game two hard dribbles off two feet play on the ball didnt look like there was much there judging by the replay here the fans are just as stunned as jir Watkins is isnt the big screen inside the home court such a great thing to listen to the face its the great equalizer for the fans who are up in the upper deck like should I get mad about that then you see it right in front of your faces now the big screen is uh filled with Fury right now theyre zooming in on Angry Flor State students Ingram goes two for two and Watkins out of the game this is gut check time for Florida State Music we got cam corm on the floor down by nine game they led by five of the Applause half Miller fouled by Ingram thats the sixth of the half against UNC Ingram second you know what though hes had a couple of picks up there so its worth the gamble right maybe you give him one chance to to make that play see if you can make that play RJ Davis with the game of high 17 gets a breather cormack Ryan returns so no Davis or Bott on the floor right now Spears yet to score in the second half warley Washingtons got the rebound see warley is not a threepoint shooter in the corner so its a good pinch by North Carolinas D no personel you help on that drive and force that pass Music Harrison Ingrams got a double double Again by the way so fourth time in the last five games for him 11 points 12 rebounds he has been the best rebounder in ACC games in the League this year 107 per game big reason why Carolinas one of the best rebounding teams in the country again its more than just Armando Bott now G with Miller on him 10 CH Advantage here kadoo into the body of Miller who holds up and Florida State will take it youre a big in this system you know it you have to be able to switch out and guard smaller guards and they think Baba Miller at 611 can really do that no switch has been able to contain RJ or Elliot today they have been fantastic in the middle third green especially in the second half Kevin ingrams got another rebound make it 13 UNC is plus eight in that category Ryan on the bounce kadoo make it Trimble he misses a two Millers got the rebound for Florida State halfway through this second half Ingram comes flying in he has become one of the most exciting players in the ACC his first year over from Stanford Harrison Ingram who does either a little or a lot of everything hes been in double figures on the rebounding side five of the last seven games look at that rebounding number right there 19 rebounds on January 10th hes a McDonalds AllAmerican and his parents own McDonalds great story in the athletic on Harrison engram Kau by the way thought he had a breakaway and got tagged with his third foul thats the seventh against UNCC so everybody will be shooting free throws the rest of the way and its Darren Green Jr who is surprisingly only a 69 foul Sher and he misses the front end wow Florida state is two for six at the line Ryan found his way into bacot blocked by Miller back to Cormac Ryan who will pull it out 15 to shoot trying to break down Corner Ryan still with a dribble a whole lot of dribbles for cornack Ryan and now kadoo bring the big to get the switch you want he gave it away to Ryan got to get a shot up cormack Ryan on the rim Im surprised kadoo gave that up because he has taken Baba Miller off the bounce off second half especially that leate the shot clock fla State working on a 3 minute plus scoring drop North Carolina is about two and a half hes pushing off hes really using that right arm Miller he got away with it and then Bott cleans it up in the rim taking it away from warley Trimble into Miller Trimble no can anybody make a basket there were stretches where it seemed like nobody could miss Kor there you go and scoring drought is over about 3 and 12 minutes for Florida State cam Corum snaps Applause it there have been some strange segments in this basketball Applause Music game Ryan good luck left it short rebound Ingram another one Bott will throw it to Ryan hes confident hes got his third three of the Music half good kick by Applause Bott its a great time to get one North Carolina 8 threes made in the game they are nearly at their game high lead was 11 in the first half Spears have pull up three wow thats a tough bucket High hands on the close out thats a big triple and he is streaky he could get hot on both sides offense and defense was 6 for 25 from three into the game its three for four today as Kau misses Florida State looking to build on that last make get this to a two possession game and Ryan fouls warley third foul on cormack Ryan everybodys got three fouls Florida State got the ball down Music seven when you share a hotel room

Florida State hasnt beat a top three team in 5 years and J Ry said Florida state is not quite in the bubble conversation yet despite five quad 1 and two wins with a win today they will be in that conversation but my goodness Debbie they are two for seven from the free throw line so many missed opportunities in the half year for Florida State Ingram one of four Tar Heels in double figures Harrison Ingram and turns it over with a Applause travel got to relace up the shoes Im just thinking about that next game too with Clemson and Duke PJ Hall number two in the league and scoring just under 20 points a game and Kyle filipowski number four in the league is scoring at 18 points a game its a couple of bigs that are going to be fun to watch in that one and of course Carolina Duke one week from today Clemson along with North Carolina the only two teams to beat Florida State and ACC play this year Lam Hamilton seals have six of their last seven on the comeback Trail here at home Chandler Jackson into the body of Jaylen Withers Jackson puts it in and hes three for three for seven points Off the Bench well Florida States got a lineup on the court right now that needs to Speed the game up but its been top keeping Elliot Kau in front and heres the switch that hes taken advantage of downhill all second half B Bowens on him B Bowen stays in front Ryan Davis wanted the ball on top for a moment there Ryan with bu Bowen on H Ryan gets around Ryan pulls Ryan leaves it short rebound Jackson Florida state with four reserves on the floor with six and change to go the only starter is warley yeah and the best scorer on the floor is primo Jackson in the Davis Jackson again he puts it home Chandler Jackson with a huge Ked off the 70 Music bench he really uses his body well to Shield the defense Davis on gaining Davis steps inside and Bs it home he is so crafty so highly skilled what an entertainment highlight reel he provides every night silencing what was an earsplitting sound here at the Tucker Center lead back to five Spears step back on Ryan no long rebound B chasing it with Davis in the corner its off of Bowen and headed the way of North Carolina RJ Davis the AllAmerican with a hustle right Music there the step through the lane is wide Music open youd think that at some point Florida state would pinch and force those downhill driving guards to pass but theyve been getting to the rim all second half why happen they no help Watkins back on the floor with a four fouls for Florida State and Watkins immediately he forges a turnover Watkins b b three chase down by Watkins and Spears has it its Jackson who is taken over of late and Jackson with a turnover FL to say with its 12th turnover of the game Baba Miller will check in now for Dany as Leonard Hamilton puts together Applause one might or might not be as closing Five but as deep as they go Oh no youre going to go hard as hard as you can for a couple of minutes this probably wont be the last substitution for Leonard this might be the five for Carolina though the starters kados misses tipped in by Ingram right on the top of the rim was it in the cylinder or not is the question the ruling

accidentally on a play Deontay green was the one to hit mil accidental swipe across the face so that player was reviewed but nothing to call here it was teammate on teammate crime but Florida state has the ball down five with 356 to go again Florida State theyre an NCAA tournament caliber team they dont have the resume because of a really poor nonconference a win today over the Nations number three team theyre right back in the conversation and also a game off first in the ACC Watkins in trouble found Jackson he misses a three Ryan was a little late to close out though and Jackson chased the ball down for M Ryan is going to be called for the foul what a hustle play by Jackson thats a tough one to go against North Carolina its a loose ball off the rim its his fourth foul cormack Ryan Chandler Jackson scoreless in three of his last six games just three for 14 his last four games and here he is Off the Bench with nine points but yet again a missed Florida State brief Watkins is four for five at the line the rest of the seminal are now one for six you got to cut hard to get open right Applause here they got two against three gdau gets open gets it back from Ryan hes got Miller on him all the way down the floor see if gdo will try to take it gdo got to the right hand no Millers got the rebound youer the former guard who had a late gr take makes it all the way down the court Watkins oh Watkins was on the sideline in an unforced turnover by Florida Applause Music Applause State its a tight spot over there in that corner Kevin theres only 17 panels over there its about 3 4 in from the threepoint line to the sideline you know I like working we do because you know there are 17 panels specifically on that side you put in your hardwood research I checked it out yesterday when you have size 16 and a half shoes like Bama Miller really creeps up on you Davis under three to play Davis left it short Davis keeps it alive the AllAmerican on the deck again Ryans got it for UNC amazing Hustle by the heels Ryan being absolutely hounded and he will get a timeout North Carolinas third time out North Carol its not just a scoring for our J Davis its all the little things too that are so emblematic of why North Carolina has turned the corner this season so North Carolina leading by four here in Tallahassee 70 to 66 big day of ACC Hoops dont forget Clemson and Duke which is a game that was supposed to be on this network right now is going to be over on ESPN news BJ Hall in the Tigers Kyle filipowski and the blue doubles jard has three ACC teams projected in the field right now at the end of January North Carolinas one Clemson and Duke are the other two so that game on ESPN news and well bring you to Cameron after the conclusion of this one here on ESPN 12 to shoot what is Hubert Davis just want to do here well you got to get the ball in bounds first good start and then Im looking for RJ Davis driving downhill I would just inbound it to RJ if possible like Ks going to get it though but Watkins on Davis hes not near the ball its a steal for Spears all the way home he floats it in with a layup and its a twopoint game Primo Spears has had a couple of takeaways in the breakaways and now Ingram stopped cutting to the ball and that allowed Primo Spears to jump the passing Lane Darren Green Jr is going to check in for Chandler Jackson and the tuck Rises as one Ryan the inbounder theyve had trouble with this several times during the game Ryan gets it in Kad just in time in the first half they had a 5sec and North Carolina had to call two timeouts not being able to inbound the ball RJ Davis leading score in the ACC at 21 a game guarded by Deontay green a step back three no good rebound Miller Florida State can Tire Take the Applause Lead Miller Spears Watkins green and green its Wat big height Advantage Watkins double team Stripped by Ingram and it is Florida State ball with 12 to shoot this is a better offensive lineup on the floor for Leonard Hamilton and I like Darren Green in this situation right here hasnt gotten a bucket in a while green 12 in the game hes over in the right corner now Miller back behind for Watkins no he missed it for the Applause lead the gets it across the timeline with a minute 35 remaining theyre clearing it out for Kido one of his best games as a Collegian lefthanded shot missed it rebound down to Spears minute 22point game Primo Spears get get it back to Applause green Spears gets a screen from Deonte green Spears lost it out of bounds and its last Touch by Spears that is the call Lee Cassell waves the index finger for a Applause review o thats going to be close think thats off they got call on the floor is off Florida State Bott certainly touched it the question will be is there enough evidence to say that Spears right hand wasnt on the ball simultaneously here it may be a tough one to overturn given how close those angles are yeah that that from that angle that is really tough Applause well this game may come down to some forensic activity at the monitor see this angle is a tough angle you cant really tell from Applause there so a minute nine to go again the call is out of bounds off Florida State 70 to 68 North Carolina Tar Heels are one for their last eight over their last six theyve turned it over 17 times to TI season high they are trying to hang on for dear life here and win their 10th game in a row and right now the debate is was this ball last off Spears or Music Bott and the officials have come to an adjudication and theyre going to stick with the call North Carolina ball with a minute 9 to go and keep in mind North Carolina has one timeout left theyve got to get the ball in bounds so they have not elected to use any screening action down here to get open they have just tried to cut into space Le Hamiltons going to pull Miller off the ball here and have him help face guard to do and Davis inbound to Davis Watkins has four fouls hell pull off it what an afternoon this has been at Tallahassee and theres a minute left at least RJ Davis is not going to give it up here on the switch with green Davis with 19 Davis with a dribble Davis with seven to shoot Davis with a righthanded shot in the lane to make it a two possession game he wants the big moments and he has earned the opportunity to take those shots right at his seeson average of exactly 21 Watkins spins stuffed by Ingram think you got a foul half two and its going to be green fouling Davis the best free throw shooter in the ACC fourth foul on Deontay green thats a big time block by Ingram inside and then Davis you knew he wasnt giving it up Applause Kevin he wants the ball in the big moment Hubert Davis talks about RJ Davis they got the chemistry mix right and RJ Davis has been the man at the front of it all well for North Carolina you got to locate Darren Green immediately you cannot let him get free Davis its two more at the line hes up to 23 its a two possession game only if those two are threes North Carolina wants to keep in front and deny the threepoint line Spears will take it primo Spears need a couple of Threes here hes going to go for two no foul Miller misses the tip Ingram wrestles The Rebound Ingram gets it to Davis who is fouled with 192 and that is just about all she wrote for 11 an impressive closing sequence by RJ Davis in North Carolina as the Tar Heels look poised to start ACC play 9 and0 for the first time in 23 years on the road in this environment with the style of defense that Leonard Hamiltons team plays they keep the pressure on for 40 minutes and North Carolina countered I thought they did a terrific job in the second half off the bounce keep the ball in the middle third letting RJ Davis and Elliot kadoo set the tone well they have been a second half team all year outscoring oh theres an RJ Davis Miss outscoring ACC opponents by 11 points per game in second halfes this year right now theyre plus 12 in the second half green misses a three Davis has it up ahead to bot no need to foul its North Carolinas night it always seems to be right now in the ACC a 9 and0 start for the Tar Heels who take down Florida State in a really good basketball game in Tallahassee first
