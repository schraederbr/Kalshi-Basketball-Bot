just 17 points for him against North Carolina was the first time hes been in double figures in their last four games they have to get consistent production from their biggest guy on the floor the yellow jackets by the way have not won on this floor at Purcell Pavilion since Notre Dame became a member of the ACC they are oh and eight here so thats getting old for them it absolutely is Josh pastors never won in this building he was looking forward to trying to get a win here tonight Notre Dame winning the opening Tippin were underway the Irish coming in eight and eight and coming off a third consecutive loss the yellow jackets at eight and seven just one and four inside the conference they do have a big win against Miami however is Goodwin downstairs trying to get free up top lucesky will swing it where its the point guard looking inside shot clock down to three he spins the fire and its around and out one of the things youll see with Georgia Tech starting with no true point guard on the floor whoever rebounded when you think of one through four is going to push the basketball that can make them dangerous in transition getting into the paint Franklin will drop in two nice spin move by Jayvon Franklin the sixth seventh senior and a bigger starting lineup for Georgia Tech with Franklin and Howard both on the floor its one of the things that Josh Pastor switched it up a bit in comparison to having the four guards hes been doing that a lot this year hasnt he I mean hes used six or seven different starting lineups I believe this is the seventh one as you bet you put it right on the number Obi and again its more so about having the interior presence with this lineup Hammond tough shot good one with the rebound block from behind wins it again and hell be at the line to shoot two as he draws the foul we give you a look at the series history the yellow jackets on top two to nothing early Notre Dame leads at all time 1412 and certainly had the better of it lately the last meeting Notre Dame took that 9056 in February yeah that was a beat down for the fighting Iris on this floor and won a overtime game last year against Georgia Tech these two teams permanent Partners so they will play each other twice a year and we go back and look at the last time Georgia Tech won in this building was 1990 wow Lethal Weapon three Kenny Anderson Dennis Scott Brian Oliver one of the best teams in Georgia Tech History that team went on to go to the final four yeah Scott and Anderson were all Americans of course Kenny Anderson was an amazing freshman he was the guy wanted to be over hes the reason I wore number 12 no kidding absolutely when Virginia wouldnt let me wear three and Jeff lamp wouldnt take it out of retirement for me I went to 12 or working hard underneath there Franklin the grad transfer from South Alabama where he was all Sun Belt Conference yeah Franklin making his presence felt early now you see Georgia Tech going to some full court pressure to see if they could find a way to take Notre Dame out of an offensive rhythm Marcus Hammond in that lineup for the Fighting Irish 64 grad start to play for Notre Dame was delayed this year coming off a nasty knee injury is Terry with the rebound and here come the yellow jackets you mentioned they beat first place Miami last Wednesday in Atlanta then fell at Florida State on Saturday yeah and again one of the things that has hampered Georgia Tech this season is turnovers turnovers got them again against Florida State 13 turnovers for 18 points for the nose but a great start in this one Kelly way downtown he can do that all day hes 40 percent beyond the threepoint line you think about the two offensive rebounds for Franklin putting him back up and then Kelly knocking down to three Josh basser has to like the early Offensive start and defensively theyre able to rebound and run getting out in transition quite a bit but one of the frustrating changes for the Fighting Irish after they get off to the six and one start as Howard drops in two with a sweet move Corey theyre not shooting the ball as well anymore no theyre not and thats been a struggle when you consider you know shooting of course is always going to be a premium for every team but when you dont have it on the road it hurts you it haunts you often at times and you know one of the things we didnt mention Obi JJ Starling the prize freshman for Notre Dame did not start the first of his 16 games as Hammonds able to knock down the three but Starling Aubry at the scores table ready to check in JJ gifted freshman out of Baldwinsville New York thats basically Syracuse so hes the guy that got away from the Syracuse program Kelly slamming on the brakes Georgia Tech with it and the gray Unis here tonight I like them I like the gray Obi I do too Coleman strong and got that one to go a little backboard usage and when you started a bigger backcourt with Coleman really as you point guard position youre going to have those opportunities in the post area when you get into the paint up top for Goodwin comes in averaging 12 points a game you round it up but all five starters for Notre Dame are in double figures and of course were going to play a ton of minutes good of a nice move there on the Baseline hit the deck he gets the two and thats what Notre Dame needs they have to find guys who can put the ball on the floor and attack the painted area they struggle to get to the freethrow line and they have to find other ways to put pressure on the defense other than passing around the perimeter looking for threes its a shame for Fighting Irish fence too because theyre good at the foul line thrown away there by the yellow jackets so a turnover back to Ryan moving it around they want Hammond a fire and he gets hit as he Nails the threepointer hes been the goto guy here the early possessions for the Fighting Irish and thats the way you get to the free throw line OB you knock down the three and get an extra one opportunity for four Marcus Hammond and Debo Coleman closes out of the game and Mike Ray cutting it to one and about to go to the foul line and they need to get there a lot more dont they they absolutely do when you look at the free throws in the ACC games most teams have played five games I believe North Carolina States played six Notre Dame Dead last in the ACC and free throws made the second fewest is Boston College plus 19 compared to Notre Dame so that is a lack of points and opportunities that you get to put points on the board Marcus Hammond here with an opportunity for the fourpoint play transfer from Niagara where he was threetime all Metro Atlanta conference he scored about 1500 points in his career theyre getting a Bonafide guy here they absolutely are and missed the first seven games of the season so Mike Bray happy to have him back in the lineup as he gets JJ stalling and for his first action of this game at the point guard position Coleman on the dribble up top here for Howard the handoff for Kelly who launches and Goodwin comes away with a rebound Applause Notre Dame three consecutive defeats beaten by North Carolina last time out they started out six and one but theyve dropped six out of their last seven games Applause Hammond looking for a cutter shot clock inside 10 now and a shove and thats on Zona foul on the Fighting Irish will go against Notre Dame one as far as the yellow jackets are concerned they have struggled to score this year the ranking 10th in the ACC and 12th in shooting at times theyve shot it better but at 87 theyve needed a lot more work there 43 overall just 33 percent from threepoint territory and part of reason why Josh Pastor made the change Miles Kelly nice to tell you these guys were not starters to begin the season but he went to his reserves and put them in a starting lineup and because of that theyve become a much better shooting team and scoring team but these guys dont have the experience on the defensive end orange hook not there Kelly tried to keep it alive but on the line so itll go back over the other way to Notre Dame well you look at the conference right now and its really fascinating to me because finally Clemson is getting some attention at 50 at the top of the league then youve got Miami at 41 Pitt at four and one they also got off to Great starts then come the Blue Bloods Virginia Duke North Carolina Syracuse All racked up behind them styling with the kick long one coming and thats going to fall in nice touch there by Starling and a great start for stalling you know Mike Ray installing spent a lot of time together yesterday when he talked to JJ Starling about the fact that he was going to bring him off the bench for the first time in his Notre Dame career he talks about how great of a kid he is he accepted it very well but he wanted him to see the game for the first couple of minutes and really not being golfed into too early putting so much pressure on himself Yellow Jackets will keep it back to the threepointer moments ago by Starling hes hitting only 34 but starling gave the basketball up and theyre relocating Cormac Ryan finding him in the corner got a home court bounce in the corner for three you know one of the areas I had a conversation with JJ Starling earlier talked to him about was being a Difference Maker one getting to the basket but also defensively he has the ability to be a very good Defender and thats been a struggle for this Notre Dame team this year he can be that guy that can pick it up on defensive end of the floor Terry good bounce there but never got to the iron and its going to be a shot clock violation I dont get the idea that youre terribly terribly shocked that Clemson has shot out to such a nice start not shocked at all and Again Brad Brownell I start with that Brad Rondell has continued to put a great product on the floor for the Clemson Tigers ever since hes been there whether its been an NCAA team nit team whatever it may be hes one of the better coaches we have in this league rarely gets the credit necessary but with older veteran players this year and of course a big time front Court in Tyson and Hunter Tyson and PJ Hall theyre winning those games but tuck traffic there for Ryan but hes stuck with it and drops it in and Notre Dame does he get a lot of points in the paint but now on top 1611 but Owen we can see early in this game theres an attempt to attack the painted area Georgia Tech playing without a shot blocker is Trey Wurst gets out in transition and draws the foul from Smith by the way our ACC Network Wednesday night college basketball doubleheader coming your way seven oclock Eastern Blake Henson and Pittsburgh squaring off against number 24 Duke at Cameron Indoor then Matthew Cleveland and FSU are in WinstonSalem to take on Wake Forest both games also available on the ESPN app so I look at the map when you and I work together and I I think to myself where is Corey headed tomorrow and the next day and what league is he working what time zone is he in its unbelievable well tomorrow night I will be on the second of that double header the second edition of CA and chill Randolph and Childress and myself and of course I get to do my best Dave OBrien impression tomorrow on the playbyplay side no by the way Im no Dave OBrien if anyone ever asks I like I like what youre doing there that foul is going to take it the other way on the Baseline Notre Dame on top by five with 12 38 to go and the Irish kind of taking hold on this one but you see Howard with the screen and moving and as soon as he rolls to the basket I believe they actually may have gotten Franklin for that when that wasnt on Ron Howard trying to pie for Words Notre Dame Under Mike Bray always a superb passing team styling again will try one not this time and you want JJ stalling to be aggressive but be aggressive attacking the basket even though hes knocked down to three already put some pressure on this Georgia Tech defense trying to get in that painted area lets pull up pop that will not drop Notre Dame last year at Purcell Pavilion 141 83 this year so unable to duplicate that success at least so far Ryan denied on the Baseline by Lance Terrys tough d ude oh but you look at this lineup this has to be the smallest lineup that Mike gray has played in his 23year career had no today air ball there which of course doesnt make him too happy 1144 to go in the first half Notre Dame on top by five but more importantly Obi theyre moving the basketball theyre sharing the basketball you can see all of the threepointers have been assisted on and thats the key for this Notre Dame team sharing the basketball finding the right look and the best look for the team and theyve done that early in this game out to a 1611 lead Mikes team on a 142 run after Georgia Tech had opened it on a 92 run just under 12 minutes to go here in the opening half students are still not in a building so to speak here in Notre Dame I see what you did there but it takes a few wins Im gonna go as far as to say and Ive been coming to South Bend now I guess how long has Notre Dame been in the ACC seven eight years this was the nicest Day in South Bend I have ever been a part of sure was beautiful here today about 40 degrees Terry jumping and thats going to be a shot clock violation on a defensive stop by Marcus Hammond now does does Hammond get a block for that hes got to get a block hes got to get a block right but is that so does that become a shot clock violation turnover or is it a block both gotta be right I dont know so John Gaffney give the sign for a shot clock violation yeah it was absolutely a shot clock violation but the block happened prior to that I wonder if they could score it as both pretty much in sync and were taking a look at the stat sheet thats exactly true there we go see I learned something thats why I asked the notorious we learned something every day we learned something all the time Kelly outside the three from the corner long one and air mailed by Coleman but a second effort by Franklin thats really what Franklins been a bonus for Georgia Tech this season offensive rebounding although 67 does a great job on the glass Kelly looking to make a move no Goodwin high up for the rebound yeah thats a big time rebound by Dan Goodman coming from outside of his area to gather that one for Notre Dames giving up a number of those offensive boards in this game making sure that his team got that one Nate lashesky so far pretty quiet here for Notre Dame thats going to be an offensive foul theyll get Hammond the give last Terry a lot of credit sliding his feet getting in front of Hammond getting his body Square more importantly exposing his chest so therefore the contact hits him in the chest he doesnt have his hands on the offensive player to pick up the foul himself were you a guy defensively at Virginia like to take that charge so you probably could have cut it off it was either God defensively many of my teammates would say no but I will say this I was a big fan of taking charges as Davon Smiths definitely knocks down to three but I was a fan of stepping up defensively when I was playing against the big name guys that got you going that got me going when I was playing against the Sam cassells the Randolph childrens Travis best the Charlie Wars those guys I stepped it up defensively yeah the other games maybe not so much maybe maybe not laying down this good one will take the hit and a good one going to the line and again if they do get to the light guys like this make their shots 86 percent that foul on Smith number two so a good one to shoot playing a ton of minutes about 36 minutes a game nothing new for him and he came in with all those minutes having turned the ball over all of 15 times all season long and naturally misses there every Thursday night womens basketball taking over the ACC Network this week its Diamond Johnson a number 11 NC State taking on FSU at six oclock Eastern in Miami and Georgia Tech that should be a good night for womens Hoops on acc Network and the ESPN app as Goodwin hits on one of two its always a good night for womens hoops and ACC in the ACC Network because there are so many great womens basketball programs in the ACC of course including Neo Ivey in the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Smith trying to make a move before the basket drew the foul Iveys banner up there in the Raptors here at Purcell Pavilion great great player in the late 90s in this program and of course now the head coach Music of course my guy on a lot of the calls for the big time womens basketball games now so you are up on all of that yeah had a lot of a lot of Skylar Diggins games too oh yes was that fun talk about a dynamic guard and a true star Ling look at that move into the lane lost the handle on it there is a whistle as it is knocked out of play but you can see he has the ball handling ability he has the size the entire package to be able to be the guy for the fighting hours to get into that painted area to put that pressure on the defense as a freshman right now oftentimes the confidence isnt consistent but everything else is theirs he gains that experience at cops and again hes ABS over 12 points a game its not like hes having a bad year right McDonalds AllAmerican first one in the program in what nine years says DJ Demetrius Jackson Goodman going strong airborne and draws another foul yellow jackets with another personal now well go against Smith and for Damon Smith thats number three already and thats one of the things with Josh pastner he will allow his players to play with three in the first half hes not the guy that once you get two or three automatically takes you out of the game hell allow guys to continue to play especially if he feels like he needs you on the court at that time boy most head coaches you get that second one youre sitting alongside the head coach yeah absolutely Ozona had it knocked right out of his hands Terry on the loose strong into the lane and Goodwin stayed home and played really good defense he absolutely did that and thats been a struggle for the Fighting Irish this year and ACC play those five losses teams are shooting 491 percent against them 75 assists only 35 turnovers so its been easy against them when theyre on the defensive end of the floor but theyve made it difficult for Georgia Tech here for the first 12 minutes of this first half Yellow Jackets been piling up those fouls heres Terry long distance too strong Notre Dames into bonus the rest of the half with eight minutes to go and we can see theres kind of been a concerted effort by the Irish to attack that painted area Zona looking for a cutter or its back for Starling shot clock to seven Starling with a quick dribble and an offensive theyll say Clarence Armstrong set a charge Notre Dame on top by three with 7 40 to go here in South Bend Indiana JJ styling three points in the early going JJ Starling the third leading ACC freshman score at 124 points per game this season you see Judah Mintz close to 16 who is doing a great job at Syracuse running the show at a Kyle filipowski who got off such a great start this season for Duke has tailed off a bit but Starling and you look at it the expectations of course because of Blake Wesley a year ago because of what Blake Wesley was able to do and moving on you know drafted by the San Antonio Spurs I believe that added undue pressure to Starling and again hes a completely different player than Blake Wesley more of a point guard not in the same level of score but averaging 124 percent that is great numbers for a freshman I think you know hes one of the guys that puts a lot of pressure on himself and has to understand that what hes doing has been positive for the Fighting Irish a great high school player AllAmerican Smith will kick it out Maxwell with a Fall Away not there son of Vernon Maxwell the former Florida AllAmerican and longtime NBA veteran Hammond trying to shred the D but gave it up on the bounce Kelly way downtown on that one another offensive rebound for Franklin Smith with a nice finish on that play with a triple they give Javon Franklin credit continuing to keep plays alive for Georgia Tech in that offensive rebound has three Second Chance points tying this game yeah without him this game would have a much different feel it really would hes been the aggressor on the interior more aggressive than anyone else on the floor both ends Goodwin gets inside and draws another foul theyve been a ton of those for the yellow jackets a good one again to beneficiary hes back to the foul line and a 1717 game Goodwin one of the many grads for Notre Dame theres six players on his team who are earning masters degrees thats the most of any power five School a good one out of Upper Arlington Ohio with the line to shoot two one of the better foul Shooters in the conference maybe Thursday at 10 right after our womens basketball doubleheader the nothing but net crew breaks down the night the ACC highlights an analysis of every womens game and a look ahead coverage you can only get in one place right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere and of course if we talk Notre Dame womens basketball we have to mention the great muffin McGraw who is in studio nothing but net so great great coach did he did a brilliant job here at Notre Dame Music by Miles Kelly hes an outstanding Shooters got it going from Beyond the threepoint Arc I believe thats the third consecutive threepoint field goal that they made allowing them to get back to this lead up by one strong move into the paint that wont go still a battle for it and it comes free to the yellow jackets as mentioned theyre not a great threepoint shooting team only 33 percent thats what they like to do more of and its Franklin again and a nice fine for Miles Kelly whos really playing more of the playmaker right now and Georgia Tech has found some momentum on the offensive end of the floor gives Javon Franklin a lot of the credit for that Applause trying to power his way up in another foul back to Franklin a moment ago well Miles Kelly so dangerous from Beyond a threepoint Arc you have to pay him a significant amount of attention when he has the basketball in his hand pick and roll actions a nice five to Franklin and Dan Goodwin late on the rotation right there giving Franklin the easy bucket the chesky top scorer for Notre Dame at 14 points eight rebounds a game and 87 at the foul line you mentioned the sixth graduate students on the roster Fort Notre Dame of course Nate liszewski Dane Goodwin both those guys started here Cormac Ryan and Trey works both transferring in but the core from last years team returning a team does NCAA tournament team the missing piece Apprentice Hub who was the point guard that came in with that class and of course we mentioned Blake Wesley already and that point guard position not having Hub around to help hey oh nice fine Smith yep and once again looking for Chevron Franklin underneath Notre Dame does not foul very often thats one of the trademarks of a Mike Bray team but theyll put the yellow jackets to the line here Mike who comes from a family of coaches hes won about 500 games in South Bend have you ever heard the story about Mike Brays mother being a swimmer I think I heard some of that story whats the full story I want to say that she was either in the Olympics or she was Olympic trials but she was a big time swimmer and she wanted for him to be a swimmer but he fell in love with basketball so she finally gave in and said look Ill take you to the gym and of course goes on to play for the great Morgan that DeMatha and here he is now but swimming was supposed to be what it was about for Mike Ray cant look at Mike and say to myself you know thats thats the next Phelps in the pool or somebody like he just doesnt strike me necessarily that way because you think him as a basketball coach but you know Mike gray well enough and spent a lot of time around him he has a beach mentality he does he does have the beach Metallica this is a gentleman who wore shorts to a game at Chapel Hill in February so definitely always got the sun block on the desk you come in to see Mike youre really one of the great Personalities in coaching a terrific head coach 2320 Georgia Tech Notre Dame to check it in five seconds on the shot clock more time than many people think about it great poised by Cormac Ryan the pump fake and the pullup jumper comes in averaging 12 points a game for the balance Notre Dame attack although they want to be a lot better than eight and eight at this point in the season Coleman for the corner Maxwell Air mailed that one and Obi you mentioned it earlier but we gloss over it quite a bit its on the line and a turnover David Smith is playing in this first half with three fouls and hes been on the floor continuing to be aggressive making a number of nice passes playing well but still three fouls thats something that we have to keep an eye on as he runs the point for Georgia Tech right now but a lot of trust that Josh pastor is showing in Smith hes a really smart player its five zero turnover games this season already so he can be trusted he really cant and but his you know his number thats staggering for me is Smith pulls up for three unable to knock that down but is his rebounding thats a staggering number Coleman with a misfire but Franklin again kept that alive on the tip and right now Franklin and Ryan a little involved in the quick conversation that got physical between those guys on the other end the floor Franklin switching off back to leszewski Wertz with a pullup jumper and here comes Smith quickly down the other end getting inside that paints no whistle he thought he was fouled on the play nice job defensively by works but thats picked off by Terry and Terry will slam it out Im not going to call it a dunk hes not going to call it enough I think he will hell take it hell take it and he appreciates you saying slam it was a gentle slam it was an attempt I believe he caught a little bit of a flat tire on the way up still counts for two points swing here lasheski will give it up for Cormac Ryan hes one of the doubledigit guys and back inside that thatll be and one getting a little more involved here the last couple of minutes fouled by Lance Terry and itll be Notre Dame back to the line when we come back from the break Georgia Tech up by one Notre Dames alltime winning is kept basketball coach in his swimming history however we talked about his mother and his mother Betty Berry was on the 1956 US Olympic Swim Team once held a world record in their butterfly event and later the swimming coach at George Washington of course in the DC areas which is how Mike ended up NBC at the Matha got his text from my guy the great temporary Notre Dame Alum who not only graduated in 1977 got his Masters in 1978 and Tims great guy and Tims name is on the book he helped Digger Phelps Basketball for Dummies he assisted in that book getting that together on behalf of digger Phelps former Notre Dame head coach and and Digger of course thinks Basketball for Dummies is for everyone because everyone is a dummy when it comes to basketball according to Digger except for said high before the game and made us all feel really stupid shes very smart about basketball yes he is love talking to Digger every time you get a chance to come here he shows up to the games and you learn something every time get a little history lesson step back for Kelly rebound free Goodwin will collect that and the Irish have it again and a 2525 game not exactly a high scoring affair here in the first half but dead even Applause trying for lucchesky poked away and hell commit a foul as he made contact with Franklin thats number two on the big guy Music with the season with three consecutive double doubles and it was a point early on Notre Dame is rolling pretty good they beat a depleted Michigan State team to get to six and one but since then its been tough sledding it really has been a struggle and Im not sure theres really anything that you can identify or point the finger to other than the fact that defensively theyve struggled to defend and you talk about playing you know after that stretch you start playing ACC games at the beginning of December and thats kind of when things started to go downhill Javon Franklins been the star so far for the yellow jackets wearing number four in the gray Unis tonight heres Smith B on the three were under two minutes to go in the half Smith got to take advantage of that you got lesevski on you on the perimeter you got to get to the bucket play nice feed for Coleman to make sure he hits the shot great cut by Debo Coleman right there recognizing his teammate in trouble didnt stand to wait for the ball cut to the open area Music where its up here for Goodwin Goodman trying to get closer on the Move turns cant knock it down and its Franklin with another rebound Smith with a nice find thats one Coleman with a shot early thought about it we know he who hesitates is lost thats one Depot Coleman catches that immediately shoots it in Rhythm normally thats going to go down Georgia Techs number two scorer and about 10 points a game good one wide open from threepoint land but cant connect a great shooter missing a wide open three Dan Goodman shooting 50 in ACC Play From Beyond the Arca Smith attacks the basket what a tough drive that was that was a determined play it really wasnt for God is playing with three fouls you see that it has not affected his aggressiveness at all his eight points hes been very valuable despite the foul trouble where its kicks out for Ryan denied Applause Music under 30 seconds to go here in the first half Applause Ryan to the paints yes and theres a nice individual play by Cormac Ryan as Miles Kelly did the job defensively but you know the saying great offense beats good defense anytime and Josh Pastor taking the time out here with 12 seconds to go in the half its a 30second break well take it as well and finish up the first half in just a moment Applause here with 12 seconds to go and the ball and right now you want to have this opportunity to be able to build on your league going into halftime but Josh pastner taking that usual loser timeout making it very certain to his guys to make sure Notre Dame does not get another opportunity on offense they would he would like for the shot to be in the air with one second remaining or less to make sure that they dont get a chance Coleman puts it in for Kelly Miles Kelly 40 outside the threepoint line he makes his move driving strong and thats going to be an offensive and thats with 31 seconds remaining so the Irish have a chance to get one off here and thats the thing that you did not want was to be able to pick up that foul and now Mike gray going to take his usual losing time out as you see Kelly getting downhill a little comfortable tangle up between Ryan and Franklin up top Music back for the last three seconds of the half so Mike has three seconds on the clock to get a decent shot in the air and conclude the first half and they have an opportunity with a triple to be in front of the break but you and I know this one of the things that Notre Dame works on at their shoot rounds at the end of every shootout they have plays designed for these situations to make sure they get a positive look well see how well it works but theres been practice today in for Starling cross mid court gets a shot up there Applause and the horn and Notre Dame goes to the locker room up by one its almost like having special teams practice when youre at Notre Dame shooter day shoot around you see them after right in front of the bench Now give me a quick look here see going across ah Josh bastard may have been correct it but you know his hand never came under the basketball but the ball did go high and so I see it could have definitely been called but again I didnt see it in live action and you know the officials of course didnt see it in live action would have been a tough call to make at that point but maybe Josh bastard was correct Starling given credit for the big three to put Notre Dame in the lead heading into the second half Coleman going to the line Depot Coleman a sophomore from Memphis former Mr basketball in the State of Florida where he played his high school ball and drops in that one hes hit 68 percent at the stripe Josh pastner just a couple of years ago LED Georgia Tech to the ACC Championship remember that and a bit of the NCAA tournament absolutely did and of course Jose Alvarado the ACC Defensive Player of the Year Moses right the ACC Player of the Year leading the way for Josh pastner Applause That season and when you look at what is happening with Georgia Tech right now theyve got really good Wing players but theyre not really filling that point guard position the way that they have to pass or that Center position which those two guys played of course very difficult to replace guys like Alvarado and Moses right shot clock a factor now down to three for the Irish launching here wurtz never got there so back over to Georgia Tech it goes and a great defensive start for the rambling wreck on that first possession coming up with the shot clock violation and it goes back to the lineup with Devo Coleman at the point guard position but Davon Smith playing with those three fouls in a strong first half Coleman downtown rebound tip to Second effort now its Kelly he went wildly in there and he commits the foul thats going to be a charge thatll go against Miles Kelly another offensive rebound for Georgia Tech they had seven in the first half and although they dont score on that theyre letting theyre setting the tone as Miles Kelly attacks the Basset Cormac Ryan does a great job stepping up absorbing that contact and getting outside a restricted area but Georgia Tech continues to set the tone that theyre going to have to be boxed out when the shot goes up styling and its going to be a hand check foul thatll go against Rodney Howard the big senior at 611 a transfer out of the University of Georgia number two Georgia of course on the football side celebrating a second consecutive National Championship an absolute runaway from TCU last night it absolutely was it was a beat down and again and many people dont think about the fact that even though it was a 58 Point win his name was Jeske attacks the basket is able to finish over the top of the Howard Georgia missed an extra point at the end of the game it could have been a 59 Point win the only thing they did wrong thats it the one thing they did wrong another longrange shot that wont drop by Debo Coleman JJ Starling starting this second half continues to be in attack mode getting to the basket unable to finish its got his own Miss luccheski cant can it Applause Kelly really stands out no shoes doesnt he they absolutely does oh plucked away the quick hands is Starling on it strong for two he can be a Difference Maker on the defensive end of the floor as a freshman you always think about yourself your numbers you play defense you help the team and he just helped the team to a threepoint lead JJ Starling being a Difference Maker on the defensive in the floor catching Miles Kelly with his back turn comes up with the steal and turns the defense into offense on the other end of the floor and Notre Dame out to a threepoint lead now has gotten a ballast offensive attack from its Usual Suspects throughout this game Mike Ray has to be happy to see everyone getting involved Starling is 64 freshman is eight points a plane like this theyre a different looking team when hes on the floor they really are right now picking up 94 feet and JJ Starling recognizing Debo Coleman is not the traditional point guards he knows he can put pressure on a guy like Coleman and be a Difference Maker on the defensive end of the floor Franklin spinning into the lane almost got it to go hell be at the line to foul on Goodman with the body thought it was a good time out by passner there not a big separation only three points but thats how this game has been played hes trying to keep everything really tight and Josh Pastor has admitted hell do that hell call all the timeouts in their last game at Florida State he was done with all his timeouts with 1337 remaining in the second half Josh Pastor is not a guy thats going to conserve the timeouts if he feels though he needs to talk to his team at that moment he will call the time out and try to get them together oftentimes to stop the bleeding and even though like you said it was very a little bit of Separation his team was bleeding after that turnover one of two for Franklin who had a big first half maybe it didnt show up at all the statistical categories but he was really the motor for Georgia Tech he kept more basketballs in place sweeping inside its good one for two and nice offensive action right there from Notre Dame a simple UCLA Cut for the easy basket for Dave Goodman he has nine 3632 the Irish opening three minutes to the second half here at Purcell Pavilion Terry will launch its not there for him and again Georgia Tech has not won in this building since Notre Dame got into the ACC Goodwin looks like he is hurt yeah Dan Goodman struggling to get back down the floor right now favoring that right leg calls a timeout rebound came right to him and then hes going to hobble off the floor and Notre Dame will bring on Troy words back to where that happened you see Goodwin fighting through the screen and immediately as he jumps something going on with that right leg doesnt want to put pressure on it and youre talking about when the accs leaders in minutes per game second in the ACC at 357 minutes per game so a guy that Mike Ray is used to having on the floor Ryan turns to fire and its on that for threepoint land homie when I watch core Mac Ryan make plays like that I always just wonder why does he not do it more often hes capable weve seen him explode to score he gets the job done defensively here he comes again he lays it off the iron and end it hung up there a while but dropped in and now Notre Dame gets some fairly serious separation yeah and give form back Ryan credit for a 50 run all on his own knocking down to three and then doing the job defensively coming up with a steal turning it into points on the other end Goodwin being attended two on the bench for the Irish try and find out what that is all about Howard for Smith he cant drive it hell settle for the jumper and knock it down speaking of Separation Davon Smith got some separation that moved a nice pullback crossover sent Nate lejewski in a different direction was able to knock down the midrange Smith has been playing with three fouls forever but he has 10 points yeah hes been aggressive regardless of the foul trouble continuing to be productive Hammer not there another rebound for Franklin Smith to penetrate yes on a reverse well they needed that shot of life and hes given it to him they really did and thats the reason why Josh Pastor is bringing him off the bench because oftentimes when they get in those laws he needs to find a way to change it up Davon Smiths been able to do just that plucked away heres Smith again and Ryan tries to stop him and commits the foul 4136 Notre Dame but Georgia Tech has the life and so does this guy Cormac Ryan hes starting to get it going offensively from way downtown hits the triple and on the drawer for Notre Dame Dane Goodwin who was injured on this play a leg injury came up lame and had to hobble off eventually when we went to break he had gone to the locker room to get further treatment now hes back out there on the bench and looking like he means to get back in the game tonight hes very close to a double double and UC grabbing his foot not sure if thats a cramp or anything else but as you look at his numbers nine points 10 rebounds in 22 minutes and second in the ACC in minutes per game so hes not a guy that Mike Ray is used to having on the bench but a great sign to see him back on the court trying to stretch out whatever the issue was normally that means that he will be making an entrance back into this one Smith trying to pass inside its picked off lasheski hes got a big paw on the way yeah just tight quarters right there Im not sure but Franklin would have even been able to do with that one if he caught it wurtz cant hit Applause and a foul by starling and its a time for a Goodwin to come back into the contest and Goodwin to return right now right in this 66 grad for Mike Bray with Notre Dame leading 4136 dang Goodman in my opinion last year was an all ACC performer First Team all ACC performer when you consider how good Notre Dame was and he was their best player a year ago I cant say that his production has gone up this years probably regressed quite a bit but playing without you know without Prentice Hub and of course with Blake Wesley to take away a lot of that attention defense have loaded up a lot more on Dane Goodwin this year than they did a year ago 1 000 Point man for the Irish Sturdivant in the lane left it well short Franklin with a big rebound slapped right back to him and up and in for two the fifth offensive rebound for Javon Franklin Second Chance points as he continues to add to his tab and you mentioned it earlier he has been a problem for the Irish on the interior all night long and the double figures now with 10 Music chesky Zips it out for Ryan hell drive and Dish and the whistle and thats one youve got to have the bucket from Nate lasheski cormack Ryan did his job Maxwell got a good look but around it out Franklin skying up for another one but knocked away from him over the top lashesky on the rod lays it in and count it hell be at the line and Notre Dame was hesitant as to whether or not they should run but neglassesky sprinting down the middle of the floor they had numbers because Franklin was behind the play starting with the nice fine the shezewski not only with the great catch but also the finish and an opportunity for the threepoint play as an opportunistic bucket hey lucesky 610 grad out of Jupiter Florida looking for a threepoint play theres eight points tonight four rebounds connects there to make it 4438 so Notre Dame looking for a little bit of separation Georgia Tech keeps coming back with shots like that the triple by Sturdivant out of the corner how about cow started but staying ready has it been into rotation much over the past couple of games but when his numbers called hes stepping up and giving Josh Pastor everything he can on both ends of the floor yeah well see how the treatment will help out Goodwin now that hes back into The Fray but Ryan with a miss Smith on the Quick Step into the paint for two and the smaller Smith going over top of the much taller stalling on that possession accepting the challenge and getting two more points in the paint Georgia Tech right back at it theyve cut the lead to one Hammond selling in the lane and a drive and count that I love the decision from JJ Starling on this possession instead of 743 which would have been a good shot he attacks the basket finishes and picks up the fourth foul on Davon Smith by attacking the rim gets to the freethrow line and stops the bleeding as Georgia Tech is starting to find a way to get back into this game Josh Pastor is showing so much faith in Smith with the foul trouble all night hes not taken him out of the game but hes a guy he cannot afford to lose though he has been playing very well and you think about 12 minutes remaining in this game and Smith continues to attack the basket slacked away from him itll be Tech ball but you look at the numbers 14 points for him in 19 minutes he has been all over the place and not just with his scoring is assisting his defense as well so Josh Pastor gambling on this one but he knows his guy better than any of us Music score for Georgia Tech at 15 a game back up high for Smith sort of interest in a big three a moment ago on the cut boy thats a tough one underneath but it wont go Franklin another board is Maxwell drained from the water Javon Franklin another offensive rebound this time kicking it out for the three to tie the game from Tristan Maxwell Franklins had a great night he really has over hes been all over the place and he got Austin he got off to a great start on the offensive boards has never slowed down tied at 46 Applause steinley gives it up for Goodwin shot clock is at three hell Loft it Smith with a rebound Smith wants to get it and go heres Kellys triple yes that rattles home and a yell at the Yellow Jackets Are Back on Top by three smart decision by Josh Pastor to leave Davon Smith on the floor I believe 4946 Georgia Tech surging and its rainy threes from the rambling wrecks Yvonne Franklin with another offensive rebound finding Tristan Maxwell in the corner Stutton like his daddy play out of Davon Smith despite four fouls yeah Davon Smith has not slowed down at all 14 points five assists and continues to attack the basket aggressively and you see taking on tall The Defenders doesnt bother him at all continues to be aggressive on both ends of the floor and Smith has been the leader for Georgia Tech here tonight its 14 points and five assists as we mentioned playing with those four fouls very valuable to Josh pastner has to make sure he doesnt pick up that fifth in fact Id say that hes the most aggressive player on floor tonight for either teamski outside bouncing here for Goodwin trying to test that foot of his hell spin inside that wont drop for him Music thanks well to push the tempo Smith will kick for the corner Yellow Jackets surging here Franklin down the lane hes an air youre talking about a power move yeah Franklin coming back smiling at Smith because he didnt dunk that Smith wanted him to throw it down hes smiling said he had a little flat tire on that one but again it still counts for two points 132 run and a hold before that basket so no hoop there weve been 1017 to go the fake handoff all the attention going with Sturtevant Nate maseski taking his eye off the basketball and off his man as Franklin goes right Down Easy Street for the quick deuce Franklin transfer from South Alabama where he was all Sunbelt conference also spent two years at Auburn so the Atlanta school is third stop Ryan around and out now thats where Smith has been so impressive to me over his rebounding has been spectacular you see the smallest guy on the floor going in and grabbing the biggest board Maxwell Travels With It tried to hold up but he turns it over hey weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants you to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic take a video tag it with the hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social you just might see it on the ACC Network Music under 10 to go here second half now its Notre Dame and needs a lift Ryan penetrates left it short Georgia Tech taking advantage of his opportunities to get out in transition swell that wont fall for him got a good look at it right there Tristan Maxwell going to an individual move made the right Play Just unable to finish it getting that close to the basket Notre Dame suddenly in need of a hot hand Music shesky back for Ryan he can certainly be that guy so can good one oh look good on that move as it spins on in they look pretty healthy on that move to the basket he absolutely did great to see Dave Goodwin back on the floor and great to see him being aggressive getting his shoulder Square past Tristan Maxwell and challenging Sturdivant at The Rim is able to get the hoop and the harm opportunity for the N1 as you see the DoubleDouble for Dane Goodman his fifth career double double but his first on the season 11 points 11 rebounds and trying to tack on one more point to that total cut it to a twopoint game with nine minutes left and he does Applause its had that field all night really from the opening seconds that it was going to come down to the last couple of possessions absolutely and again if youre Josh pastor and youve never won here this is one of those games where youve coached us a little bit harder as Terry gets to the rim unable to finish and again numbers for Notre Dames darling has to push Ryan taking the Baseline and a block by Franklin but Franklin limping away from that one headed over to the bench another guy they do not want on the bench if he does for very long hes going to try and hang in there back to the block Javon Franklin sixth in the ACC and blocked shot over one and a half a game locks that one but comes down feeling it a little bit gonna stay out there Josh passes one of those coaches hes asking Javon right now if hes okay but Josh bass is one of those coaches you say look at him the wrong way hes like Im not taking you out so I dont even know why youre looking at inbounds quickly yeah good one will sink down well that was a lightning strike and were tied at 51 it really was and Dane Goodwin getting back into the action as Notre Dame gets back into the Zone defensively seeing that they can find a way to slow down Georgia Tech has picked up some momentum as of late Goodman with 14 along with 11 rebounds Applause Music it gives it up for Sturtevant he could be dangerous beyond that threepoint line Franklin draws three heres Kelly big fight for it and asheski comes away with it yeah big rebound by Nate liszewski now of course hes going up against a guy who may be a foot shorter but Smith is a great rebounding guard an important possession for luceski defense it off defensively again Georgia Tech all for their last eight in this building and switched in by lashesky 5451 Sturdivant going up against the big and Campbell got it the Georgia Tech guards playing big in this game weve seen Smith going to the post area and score where he told the defender and of course Kyle sturvin now going over the biggest guy on the floor for Notre Dame Applause good one at the foul line contact there thats going to be an offensive foul as Lance Terry went down and foul number three on the sheskies but earlier neglaszewski finding his way beyond the threepoint Arc recognizing he can shoot up hes been 10 offensive reborn rebounds that have turned into 10 second chance points for the rambling wreck of Georgia Tech Devon Franklin has been culprit number one five offensive rebounds alone but Franklin as he continues to come up with offensive boards and assist kicking them out for threes three assists as well for Franklin in this game zero turnovers as he has won all the hustle points for his team tonight both of these teams in dire need of a victory in conference play and its up for grabs with seven minutes to go here at South Bend Indiana back to the zone for Notre Dame keeping both bigs on the floor and Campbell and luccheski to try to help them on that back line to find a way to defend and Rebound with Franklin on the floor Sturdivant trying to make a move cut off gets it in the air and it rattles home Kyle Sturdivant has been a blessing for Josh basser coming off the bench in his second half continues to make plays and make shots when his team needs the most even amongst much taller Defenders transferred from Southern California listed as 63 generous generous unless Im 63 now me me too good one to the paints Slams on the brakes and its tipped out off the hands of Georgia Tech Smiles Kelly and Cormac Ryan about to return now from Mike Bray with six minutes to go weve got a timeout this is a onepoint game the yellow jackets in the lead over the Fighting Irish well keep it right here only two on the shot clock yeah two on the shot clock right now so and a very important possession theres of course Georgia Tech has taken the lead on the last one weve had eight lead changes in this game thus far and this second half has gone back and forth between these two teams we may have an exciting finish here park has that feel and talk about exciting finishes the last time that the yellow jackets came to Purcell Pavilion and one was 1990 that game went overtime Georgia Tech won 8880 what a team they had with Kenny Anderson Dennis Scott and a host of others under Bobby cremins Brian Oliver the the three of those guys forming Lethal Weapon three and Obi no one watched more Georgia Tech basketball in 1990 than me Kenny Anderson was my guy I was headed to Georgia Tech actually to replace Kenny Andersons Leches he gets the three off at the shot clock buzzer unable to knock it down but I was going I was on my way to go play for Bobby crimmins to replace Kenny Anderson in 1991 and of course things didnt work out but at the same time that was my guy especially in college basketball Terry thought about it heres Miles Kelly sweeping inside guess who Franklin another rebound well he beats everybody he really does and again hes playing against much taller players Franklin at six seven nation much taller 610 to 611 Sterling with a hot hand yeah Kyles tournament has really given Josh pastner great minutes and youre talking about a young man who wasnt in the rotation the last two games but keeping himself ready when his coach calls upon him well he has nine Off the Bench tonight nine big points determined effort by Starling thatll roll in for the freshman and a necessary Bucket from Starling right there to kind of stop the bleeding for Notre Dame and more importantly putting his head down finding a way to get to the rim use his size to finish over top of smaller Defenders under five minutes to go Franklin Sturdivant again not this time rebound tip they get the second chance is Kelly and hell draw the foul in Notre Dame fortunate Kelly just missed a wide open layup on that possession Dan Goodman fouled him much earlier on that possession but it would have counted as it and won if Kelly makes a layup Sturtevant unable to finish on the pullup of Miles Kelly after the basketball you see Dave Goodman coming in and fouling him low missing on that easy one I would not be doing my job as a journalist why didnt you wind up following Kenny to Georgia Tech I mean obviously it worked out great for you in Virginia it did however so long story short Bobby crimens and his staff knew I was going to commit to Georgia Tech I was at Virginia Travis best was at Georgia Tech they knew I wasnt going to sign my letter of intent until Kenny Anderson Goes Pro Travis best convinced and says Ill sign my letter of intent now I see and of course so again they got a great player in Travis best who becomes one of their alltime breaks so it worked out well for everyone well Virginia got a great player as well I appreciate that but you know Georgia Tech of course was my first choice coming out and honestly all it was the second this opportunity at The Rim once again it was Franklin initially defending him Sturdivant nice five Smith will lay it in Applause you know but to finish that story after it was all said and done I had to open my recruitment once again because I knew I was going to Georgia Tech so I really didnt give the other teams much of a chance or much of an opportunity I had to get to know all the coaches and everyone all over again sure 6156 Georgia Tech put a little bit of wiggle room suddenly oh nice and slacked away that was the theft by Kelly Smith sturdivin he finishes that Dynamic attack for the yellow jackets OB at the beginning of this season Josh pastner start its third of it and Smith in the backcourt tonight he didnt start either one of them but yet they have shown up big time for his team here especially in the second half Smith to Sturtevant weve all called alleyoop will just call to Ali scoop but either way it depict off Notre Dame on this floor for the first time in nine tries it goes all the way back to the 1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket team you know immediately following our broadcast of this game its ACC Legends a look at the 1990 Georgia Tech basketball greats they were ACC Champs they went to the final four eventually lose it to UNLV yeah but a great team and one of the most fun teams to watch in ACC history and right now Josh Josh pastner trying to join that team is only the third to ever get a win in South Bend and second to be able to get one in this building a tough couple of points there for Dane Goodwin it was bounced back nicely from that leg or foot injury it absolutely has and Mike Ray going to Dane Goodwin on the block out of the timeout making sure that he gets the basketball in the hands of the guy he trusts the most Yellow Jackets looking for an answer Kelly got a little too cute with the pass picked up by starling heres lecheski got a real good look but couldnt knock it down yeah great look for luccheski on that one and again as you look back at this game if no names unable to win it you gotta go look at the opportunities like that where you could have gotten back to a twopoint game if you knock that shot down Music Sturtevant big difference maker on this one good D passes tipped out and a whistle and a foul and thatll go against Starling of Notre Dame that was with seven on the shot clock yes darling just trying to make a hustle play get to the basketball third it does foul Terry on the way out reaching for the ball theres the contact it goes off of Terry not a lot of contact of course you can hear the crowd here that doesnt like it I think they have a point actually so Terry to the line and drops in number one Music in a big swing because you think about if laceski makes that three on this end of the floor and then you get that basketball back an opportunity to be able to tie it Josh basser on the floor tiptoeing back to the coachs box as the shot was waved off and now substitution Hammond comes off and Wertz back on now for the Irish and Terry will have to shoot it again with 2 31 to go here at South Bend Indiana and thatll rattle in yeah if he didnt miss that free throw though Josh Bassett would have blown a gasket after the official scorekeeper over there buzzed in a sub for Notre Dame took the free throw off the board earlier Charlie to penetrate strong flips it up for two hes a different player but hes being aggressive getting downhill you see the skill the talent that He has right now as a freshman just figuring it out but hes a pretty good one Music Franklin who has a double double tonight hands off for Sturtevant on the turnaround no rebound tip toleszewski an opportunity to get into a one possession game right here if you Notre Dame I may want to look at Goodwin back on the Block where he has success coming out of timeout Applause Ryan shot clock down to 11 Starling on Terry Big Time contact in a blocking foul minute 28 on the clock eight seconds on a shot clock Starling shaking off that shoulder as he goes down staying down for the moment trying to attack the basket Terry who picked up an offensive foul earlier in the game on a very similar play that time not getting into legal guarding position this is a shoulder he actually injured earlier this season so aggravating that again is hes going to collect himself here and try to get to the line and also his shooting shoulder is one of those ones where youre going to the free throw line thinking okay hopefully this is okay one and one for the freshman hes 62 percent at the line this year Applause shook off the pain there Applause 6561 and another one coming for JJ and now 15 points for JJ as he continues to score in double figures seventh of his last eight games now make it eight of nine up to 16 points in his first game coming off the bench but its been a positive move thus far from Mike Gray Georgia Tech trying to win on this floor for the first time since 1990 Irish trying to deny them thats Smith gives it up and off for Kelly coming up on a minute to play shot clock down a six is Smith on the drive no and numbers for Notre Dame good one outside the three heres a long one by words that will go and he has tied it at 65 and the Irish taking advantage of having a man down for Georgia Tech in the backcourt opportunity to find the right guy and that right guy was Trey works in the corner Dave Goodwin the pump fake Franklin does a great job jumping in the passing Lane but because it was a 514 still enough time to be able to get Trey works in the corner hasnt shot it well in this game but makes a big bucket when his team needs the most to tie it at 65 foreign Applause North Carolina drains a big time three theres a look at our reset Notre Dame with the possession arrow Notre Dame out of timeouts Georgia Tech has one to go at 47 and a half seconds to play and trust is a big word within this Notre Dame program Mike gray trusts Trey Works trade Works was over five from the field before that shot but at crunch time he still has him out there because he believes it you and I caught a game which Ray words made a game winner in the ACC tournament a couple seasons ago so Mike gray has that level of Trust In Trey words and Trey word stepping up and making the biggest shot of the night for the iris thus far so itll be Yellow Jacket basketball coming out of this timeout and Josh pastner trying to get back into the win column tonight and for the first time in his career on this floor as a head coach at Georgia Tech and one of his mentors the great digger Phelps in the stands watching who Im sure has had a number of conversations with Josh pastner about coming into this building and being windless thus far I know thats another monkey that Josh would like to get off his back absolutely so heres Smith with 35 seconds to play in a tie game off for Kelly shot clock at seven and a timeout Georgia Tech will take one here with 287 to go yeah Josh Pastor did not like what he was seeing from his team offensively on that possession head of action designed for his team to go out and run but they did not get that first action it was had no success on it early deciding to call the timeout seven seconds remaining on this shot clock to see if they can get a good look seven seconds to shoot and a 6565 game 287 on the game clock here down the stretch both sides fit some big shots yeah and give Notre Dame a lot of credit because Georgia Tech took the momentum here late in the second half and had an eightpoint run a eightpoint lead but Notre Dame not going away staying poised and composed and oftentimes when teams have not had that success we talk about oh and five theyll falter off and just say okay its not a night give the Fighting Irish a lot of credit for to give the pun continuing to fight Georgia Tech to check it in ugly Lance Terry looking for somebody does get it in for Kelly hes got to shoot it in four seconds somebody does Kelly on the Move Kelly with a long one off the backboard never got to the rim shot clock violation Notre Dame has the ball with 20 seconds to go and a chance to win the game shot clock violation here and Notre Dame recognizing only seven seconds remaining on the shot clock coming up with the big defensive stand and getting the basketball back with an opportunity to take the last shot to either win or send this game into overtime and right now the official is going to go over and review something Im not sure but giving both these coaches really a free timeout I think this is a clock situation its the only thing I can think of because the shot never came close to touching the iron obviously it was high up off the backboard so this has to be a clock situation John Gaffney is going to come over and explain it to us the veteran official give you a look at the clock here should there be more time than 201 will they add time here at the time the shot clock expired its John Gaffney telling me of course they have to go over and get the Tom right after and making sure from the last dead ball to the actual timing on the clock he let it be known that he would never got out of college without a calculator so so therefore when you see the shot go up and the clock shot clock go to zeros there should be more time on the clock and it will be 217 seconds so a little extra room there for another name Im a job by the way as far as that calculator oh Lifesaver man Im a bad guy youre a math guy all the reading was the issue for me well here we go tied at 65 in the final seconds kind of figured it would come to this words has already hit a giant shot in his career in Notre Dame Starling on the drive and Banks and wont drop trying to get a heave off its going to be well short and this game is going to overtime tied at 65 boy starling with a really really strong drive but could not get it to go Georgia Tech tough D in the end and were going on OT clay you can right there forget about what happened in the past fascinating too because weve talked about it several times tonight Georgia Tech its been almost a quarter Century since they won here theyre old for their last eight trying to win on this floor and the last time they did win in 1990 it was in overtime I mean again you and I are here why not give us a little extra time you know what I mean free basketball free basketball lets do it theres no charge for this yeah were underway in the overtime Notre Dame to get their first crack at it tied at 65 Applause Music Starling who missed the shot in regulation cant hit the first one in overtime but again staying aggressive getting downhill disturban who had a big second half for the rambling wreck back on the floor to start this overtime along with Smith whos playing with four fouls seemingly since the first five minutes of the game yes it feels that way shot clock at nine Sturtevant with a spin left and well short Applause who will be the hero in overtime tonight in Southbound Applause for Mac Ryan gives it up here for starling all right took a look at that shot clock where its trying to make a move to the paints nope but again a good look getting to the basket continuing to put the pressure on Georgia Tech defensively not settling for threes along the perimeter you dont want to bail out the defense by taking tough shots Notre Dame is not one in the ACC yet Owen five how am I going to play tonight Smith pounding through that lane Sturdivant another pullup shot got that one he switched it in nice and you just have to take your hat off Kyle Sturdivant regardless of the way how the things have gone over the past couple of games he kept his mind right stayed engaged with his teammates and its helping him out here down the stretch of this one coming off the bench these days started the first eight games of the year for passner nice defensive stand by Sturdivant pulled the chair on Dane Goodwin and comes up with the basketball all the time out well hes shown up in a big way particularly in the second half of OT now he absolutely has you know weve seen him do it on the offensive end the floor but defensively here you see him it immediately just releases contact pulls a chair strips the basketball and then Dives on and calls the timeout regaining possession so after getting the bucket they gave Georgia Tech the twopoint lead Kyle serpent getting the job done defensively as well a senior and he plays like it its a 251 left in the OT Yellow Jackets clinging to a twopoint Advantage Sturtevant coming off the bench where 13 points six out of 10 shooting and a couple of rebounds and some really good defense he really has done a great job for his team here and particularly in this second half I want to say that he was scoreless in the first half but then stepped up big and had a stretch of his own where he really put Georgia Tech on his back in the second half getting them out to a lead so well recap to how we got to this point but the yellow jackets leading at 6765 Kyle Sturdivant getting out in transition finding Davon Smith who finishes with the easy layup and then Smith returning the favor to Sturtevant the alley scoop on the other end of the floor is Trey Works knocking down the three ball to tie the game at 65 which ended up being the score at the end of regulation as JJ Starling got a great look but unable to finish it off and we head to overtime with Georgia Tech now with a twopoint lead and the basketball so Notre Dame needing to win so as not to slip below 500 Georgia Tech at 87 they have one big win in conference play that was knocking off top 15 Miami but then turned around and lost to Florida State on the road right after that big victory so it could not maintain any momentum heres their upcoming schedule now very tough customer coming up next in the Pitt Panthers yeah its playing great basketball Jeff Capel alongside Brad Brownell have to be the Front Runners to ACC Coach of the Year this year NC States playing very well and of course Syracuse then going to Clemson another of their permanent Partners which is going to be a tough game and then Duke which is always going to be tough youre not careful you slip up you could lose every one of those games and for Notre Dame they are at Syracuse next uh January 14th at the Dome always a tough place to play and then Florida State Boston College coming here to Purcell Pavilion then on the road to NC State and home to Louisville the yellow jackets for the basketball and a twopoint advantage in overtime Smith has been a real engine tonight for the yellow jackets and lots of foul trouble got bottled up and taken away by a good one that was a great defensive play by Dane Goodwin although he was in Hell position couldnt see the basketball but new to get his hands in the passing Lane and comes away with the steal Goodwin turns to shoot it got it threepointer right on the money how often have we seen that in this game alone Obi hey God makes a great defensive play and then comes up and makes a big shot right after absolutely right its been the theme tonight here in Southbound Applause so the Irish by one Sturtevant feeding Franklin Franklin no but another offensive rebound heres Terry no a couple of big misses there by the yellow jackets Iris dodged the bullet on that one the offensive rebound kick out to a knock down shooter and Terry whos been unable to really get it going here tonight Starling a little wild in the lane off ensive foul and right back to the yellow jackets good one by the way tonight with 12 rebounds its a career high yeah and this was a design play for Goodwin to get this look coming off the screen beautiful footwork beautiful shot from Dane Goodwin and he repays his coach for calling his number here down the stretch under 90 seconds to go in OT Applause Sturtevant wont wait yes a threepointer love the confidence of Kyle Sturdivant stepping up and making plays for his team here down the stretch and you mentioned it hes a senior hes seen these moments before the moment is not too big Yellow Jackets by two good one negotiating into the lane Wertz gets a look he buries three with 552 to go back and forth we go and the Irish by one Music big shot after Big Shot both ends of the floor weve got veterans in this game Obi we talked about the six graduate students for Georgia Tech forgive me for Notre Dame Trey works is one of those guys steps up and makes another big shot it was words who made the big shot to tie the game at 65 in regulation and now his big shot gives his team a onepoint lead with 552 remaining here in overtime so we reset Georgia Tech has the possession arrow no timeouts for either team though fouls to give Music and an exciting finish here in this overtime or another overtime well see absolutely this has been fun and we kind of expected this coming in even though Georgia Tech has not won in this building they have thus mostly been competitive games Josh pastners team of course hungry for a win and Notre Dame winless in agency play you cant get hungrier than that and both teams have played like it here tonight its an air of desperation hanging over both programs coming to this game who will pull it out in the end Miles Kelly gave up the Dremel his Sturdivant theyre going to keep very close watch on number one but it better trying to make another move got the shot up there and a whistle and a foul with 399 thatll go against starling thats number five on JJ Starling now wait a minute thats going to go on Trey wurtz Trey Works defending there on Sturdivant you see the contact on the shot as it goes up Applause and well put Sturdivant at the line hes only 52 percent there smart play by Sturdivant to attack the basket because more good things can happen for you than settling and he heard you with his 52 percent didnt look like it on that yeah but thats the thing about 50 free throw shooters they got to make the second so a little pressure on him here at 7171 they look really good they look great on those two free throws but hes looked great here in the entire second half in overtime gives his team a onepoint lead Applause Sturdivant with a careerhigh 18 points Applause under half a minute remaining in overtime getting underneath the draws the foul and he will be at the line to shoot two in an excellent foul shooter with 23 seconds to play about love the basketball intelligence that both these teams are playing with down the stretch recognizing throw the basketball inside lets find a ways to get into the painted area better things can happen for you when youre trying to operate in the paint in comparison to settling for Long Shots because you can get those fouls get to the free throw line and find a way to change the lead 87 at the stripe theres 12 points so far tonight and he has retighted and the vital second one to come again neither side has the timeout to go Music and Notre Dame in front by one and now you have to trust your defense right now Mike gray trying to get the crowd involved in this game doing jumping jacks on the sideline getting everyone going 13 seconds left in OT Sturdivant knocked away batted right back Coleman got him free Sturtevant cant drill it 37 to go and its Tapped Out Applause and Notre Dame has the basketball but of course under two minutes the officials are able to go and review this so they will be able to determine exactly who the basketball went off of take a look a jumbled broken play but ends up with a good look for Kyle Sturdivant who has been the hero here in overtime towards Georgia Tech as the ball comes off the rim to see starlink and Franklin in the mix and hard to tell who that goes off of but if it was called on the floor to a Notre Dame I believe its going to be difficult to overturn that I dont know if theres enough evidence to show that either one of those guys definitively hit the basketball out of bounds both reaching for it and from that angle I cant tell could you no I cant I mean again so if it was called Notre Dames basketball thats a big call because it looks as though both guys have their hand on the basketball at the exact same time spending it in different directions it ends up going out the direction of Franklin the way Franklins going so Im sure thats why it was called Notre Dame basketball but if you look at it it seems as though both players hands were on the basketball at the exact same time maybe Franklins fingers spinning it in that direction taking it out of bounds its a 37 seconds to go here in overtime Notre Dame has a onepoint advantage theyve gone to the monitor as they can in the last two minutes to double check the call on the court was it was off Georgia Tech well wait a minute Nell does Starling touch it with his left hand after that the bet is a Difference Maker does he touch it with his left hand on the way out I didnt see that early you can see the fingers going back right as if the basketball is on it wow this is huge this is huge so this call might be reversed yes that staling does touch that on the way out yeah getting together yeah lets see which way this goes in the end an official review Music yeah initially you see both guys have the handle the basketball at the same time but its all these left hand comes up it touches that basketball because the balls spin trajectory changes and so with that this basketball I believe is going to go to Georgia Tech this last angle truly shows it right here not enough information but right there that left hand of Starling touches the basketball thats going to be Georgia Texas and It reversed the call the Yellow Jackets will happen I think they got this right I believe they got it 100 correct Notre Dame by one Georgia Tech with the ball and looking to checking in on the Baseline to get a shot to win the game Music zombie Debo Coleman to put it in looking looking over the top for Franklin Franklin shoots it he cant hit it its hit and thats the game and Notre Dame hangs on and they beat the yellow jackets yet again here atterdam for the ninth consecutive time 7372 in overtime it was fun partner it was that Notre Dame man they needed to have that one its their first win in the ACC so far this season and a great performance
