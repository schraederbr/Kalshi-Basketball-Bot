couple of weeks back and had 22 points against Notre Dame so the consistency has been there in addition to some of the big performances of late this Monmouth team coming in Mark theyre 19 on the season so far theyre kind of in rare territory because King Rices program has been very very good in the MAAC the last few years this year theyre going to be in the Colonials so thats going to be a change for them but many of the players that allowed them to get to the MAAC championship game a year ago not here any longer so a bunch of guys in new roles and Joe Gerard Begins the game mind knocking down a three in the orange on the board Applause see the lineup for this Monmouth Hawks team theyre very young as they come into this one Jack Collins with CAA freshman of the week next week nice pass underneath and Clement lays it in a really good start for Monmouth an attack mode early and remember King rice and the Hawks of Monmouth were giant killers in 2015 they beat UCLA Notre Dame USC Georgetown and Rutgers all in the same season they want to restart recreating that magic now with this young basketball team starting here tonight in Syracuse turnover by the orange Gerard trying to feed Jesse Edwards a little bit too strong for him now Monmouth brings it across miles Ruth at the top of the key Collins or to Miles Foster hes in the middle of that zone now Collins gets it to buga puts it up over Edwards for the bucket a great look by Monmouth as theyre rotating miles Foster inside with Clement vuga and theyre rotating to the ACC logo thats where you need to beat the Syracuse Zone take a look at the Syracuse lineup for tonight this has been the starting five that Jim Boeheim has gone with most often this year its easy to pencil Jesse Edwards into the lineup with the way that hes played him late but this time comes up just short yeah two defense has also been tremendous the last two games 13 points seven and a half assist again increased deals Jack Collins drills the three and a good start for Monmouth well I Love the Way Monmouth is working the ball inside in that midrange area and then kicking it out right now King rice this looks like the Monmouth of 2015 not the young team weve seen early in the season judamins to Benny Williams has a good look and knocks it down both teams naming their shots early in this game Monmouth coming off a loss on Saturday against Princeton 9154 King rice hoping his young team is respond in a very difficult game tonight yep they got it down low luga cant finish underneath and now a foul against muga and Syracuse will have it Applause to be talking about his coverage in the zone as Monmouth is able to get the ball in that logo area of the ACC and right now Myers Foster almost like an option quarterback real doing a nice job of finding options for his teammates on the drive has it knocked away itll stay with the orange there is Jim Boeheim season number 47 with the orange the legendary head coach of this program putting the Ring of Honor on Saturday before the Georgetown game along with pearl Washington theres a turnover by the orange and Collins comes out with her yeah now you try to push it before that zone gets set good ball movement Collins again for three Splash Jack Collins with six early points Monmouth could not get off to a better start and theyve theyve attacked the Zone in a very cerebral way King rice has a great game plan early against the Syracuse Zone Chris Bell on the wing he answers back with the three so much for being tough to shoot in a big dont like this well weve seen a lot of barn burners in this building over the years thats for sure well we know Syracuse feels at home but Monmouth is also knocking down the shot of the Season shooting under 40 percent as a team Collins finding cougar has that one knocked Away by John Bola jock three seconds to shoot that shot will not go tipped around and Edwards has it now a foul against Tehran Allen now thats the foul that you do not want to have as the junior fouled 90 feet away from the basket that drives you crazy as a coach both the vugas bounds have come the same way so he goes to the bench Hannah Montana will check in the freshman player from India in the history of college basketball we won well have a lot more coming on about Sandu later in this one theres Judah Mintz on the drive and draws the foul you know the thing about Syracuse lately theyve won their last three games and theyve been aggressive but theyve been a smart aggressive earlier in the season I think they played a little bit of disease of B basketball looking to get mine but this team has settled in I think Jesse Edwards is a big reason why this team is settled in and Mintz as well has taken over a leadership role with this team and this young orange team needed leadership and now theyre getting it from their two best players in Vince and Edwards Judah Mintz has had a real good start obviously the heralded recruit for Jim behinds team 12th among freshmen in the country in scoring 14 points per game in the early going he is the engine that drives this big old Mac Truck Music settle back into that zone Collins for three this time cant come up with it and a rebound Sandu and has it taken away tournaments right there to steal it wow nice move in the paint but cant finish well thats a twostep rude to care Collins again this is that time and the rebound Edwards now Magna found getting nothing in the mid post area everything is side to side and their shot selection shows it Mira Torrance into the game for the orange Benny Williams stops and Fades thats well short John Bull and John tried to save him its out of bounds itll be Monmouth basketball when we return of both teams knocking down some shots early as Monmouth has gone inside out Collins from Deep little Street Music here in the dome and then lets do it again Syracuse and Chris Bell with the awardwinning Geico mobile app our

tonights start time in the dome was actually moved an hour later to accommodate the fans coming in here at 5 30 to get ready to watch Syracuse play Indiana and the mens soccer national championship of the college Cup tonight so as the basketball game was getting set to begin all the video boards here are starting to get ready for basketball so these fans have all gone back behind the bleachers here inside the JMA Wireless dunks they want to see the end of the game now its 22 theyre going to overtime I understand that there could be two 10minute overtimes and then if there is not a winner after that they go to PK so we could be hearing lots of random cheering from behind us depending on how this goes out of the timeout Jack Collins gets a nice feed underneath and scores hes got eight first half points Jordan all those fans running away reminded me of my high school dating career thats pretty much what it was like so at least you had a high volume high volume high volume I wasnt shy trying to look at the bright side here for you mark cant be afraid to ask underneath the passenger side to Edwards six to shoot and yeah possession arrow will send it here the other way most human beings dont even catch that basketball the wingspan of Jesse Edwards just to go up and get it and Jim Boeheim doesnt like the pass and were going to have a substitution here Malik Brown will check in for the orange as dudiments well head to the bench weve got that house theres Justin Taylor who had a 25point game against Bryant Lawrence trying to find consistency for the Freshman from Charlottesville Music Monmouth coming in here today did not act like a 119 they acted like a team that was grateful for the opportunity and ready to come in and really compete so far theyve done exactly that Sandu against a double team replied to shoot nice pass and Ruth misses underneath a rebound to John bolajak around Larry Bird when he passed there well done cyber Torrance goes tour has it taken away and now Collins will slow it down for Monroe on the wing Jack holmstrom a three no Torrance the rebound and they throw it out to Taylor Joe Gerard says Im open and now well take the three and hit the three for what confidence there were five blue jerseys there was no way Syracuse was going to get an offensive rebound right there but he let it fly with confidence anyway Joe Gerard how the orange into the lead by one was one for its last six from the field after a hot start Sandu has his pocket picked Gerard spins into the lane lost the handle and now well throw it out to Taylor Torrance the spin nice to get it down low to Edwards knocked out of bounds itll stay with Syracuse sometimes this young teen gets in a habit of trying to hit Grand Slam home runs on every pass versus letting the game come to them hit a single just make the simple pass and work together as a team but this young team hasnt quite figured out those hard lessons yet well its a young Syracuse team theyve got six freshmen on this group one of the things the coaching staff has consistently said is they know there are going to be ups and downs here early nice play Malik Brown off the block able to get it and score Applause that time Gerard went to the bucket Chris Bell was wide open in the corner Music of his own thats a problem time to shoot into a double team and a turnover by holmstrom yeah you can only go to the corner if youre taking the ball from the logo mid post area and then kicking it out to the corner but if you take it just Wing Corner prepare to get trapped foreign its interesting the way that Monmouth is going to play against this Zone on their coaching staff they have Rick Callahan who began his coaching career under Jim behind back in 1980 was unstaffed for six years and then King rice of Binghamton native grew up watching this Zone it was a huge Syracuse fan as a kid theres Edwards underneath cant get that to fall in the rebound of Foster so Obamas staff certainly has a lot of familiarity with Syracuse wants to do I mean its no secret obviously Jim behind has been playing The Zone here for decades but those two guys in particular would know how to attack it and they do some interesting things when they get it there good things happen get good shots consistently and they run some interesting little back streets they try to go misdirection a lot Applause goes to work around Allen feeds down low for Brown the unselfish by Judah Miss to drop that shoulder get in the lane and the eyes up looking for a teammate the opposite way yeah not squaring up its too onesided right now Allen trying to get around Bell and finds the bottom of the net thats Ron Allen hes effective at catching hes effective at sitting down and getting open now hes got to open up his vision to the back side as well good spin move inside Joe Gerard makes a nice move takes the jumper no Edwards rebounded and the second chance puts it in the pterodactyl wingspan right there theres just a bunch of other guys out there and then theres a pterodactyl thats just eating up the basketball his first bucket of the night I love it now every time I see Jesse Edwards Im going to think about the pterodactyl almost a turnover heres holmstrom in the corner buries it through Applause the Junior from Rockford Illinois Jack holmstrom the team that only beat Manhattan so far one and nine they got drilled at Princeton the other night and Judith Vince has just taken over right now Judah with five first half points after that three also three assists he had ten assists in the Georgetown game on Saturday there you go nicely done Allen cant get that to fall another opportunity for foster to put it in miles Fosters just a bulldog not pretty about his game but that kid just gets after it Applause he plays for contact Joe Gerard so far this years had some ups and downs but playing off the ball with Judah Vince running the point for the most part of course Gerard the predominant point guard the last couple of years the coaching staff says he just needs to be aggressive talking to Alan Griffin before the game said yes sometimes youre gonna look at a shot and say maybe its not the best shot but when Joe takes it its a good shot Judah Metz the thing I love about his game is vision thing I like about Magna is theyre reigning threes from downtown and theres Vince answering the call as well Syracuse by five Monument competing we love our new home theres so much space but we have ants its expired expired expired its a lot of house I hope you can keep it clean at

Callahan began his coaching career Mark in 1980 under Jim bejas Rick Callahan has a really infectious positive personality and one thing about Jim Boeheim over the years hes been able to surround himself with assistant coaches that really bring a unique perspective and personality to this program and I asked Rick Callahan what was it like coaching with Jim behind from 1979 to 1986 during the Pearl era and he said you know Jims very introverted but he is so intensely loyal and hes a guy that will give the shirt off his back once youre in his sanctum and of course Rick Callahan is very much a part of that and this game came about because of the lunch date between the two this past summer I said hey how about we play each other because King rice and Monmouth need the money and this is an 80 000 guarantee game so Martin gets a chance to come and play in front of the great crowd and wonderful Arena and maybe get a win and walk away with 80 000 in the end thats not a bad deal pretty good deal for them no doubt and certainly a special for Rick Callahan to be back coaching on this court against Jim Boeheim he said even though weve been friends a long time he still wants to beat you ferocious competitor is how I described it he said he will beat us by 50 if he can and even that might not be enough right now hes got a threepoint lead Riles Foster had that one bounce off his leg and it comes out to the orange its finding Brown for the alleyoop to the mix is the Difference Maker in the first half because hes Distributing the basketball timeout Monmouth shoot up miss the engine

always under control and he can attack and accelerate thats the engine of the Syracuse Orange and Jude immense has tied his season high with 20 points tonight 11 of 12 at the free throw line go along with five assists and four steals so he has had another real strong game for the orange so you just saw Judah Mintz and number 24 for Monmouth miles Ruth just out there talking enjoying each others company we saw during the timeout where King rice and his team were actually having a laugh together during the timeout that says something about culture that says something about understanding the opportunity to come into this big arena to play against Syracuse on national TV and just have fun playing the game and thats what king rice Im sure they were just talking about have fun here enjoy these last few minutes you may never be back here again as Judith Metz goes to the rim now a new season high with 22 I have a feeling were going to be seeing that number climb higher as the season goes along no one expected Monmouth to win tonight but Monmouth came in and really made it interesting for a long period of time in this game yeah this teams getting better before our eyes theyre going to drop to one in ten but theyre getting better Monmouth had a second half lead as Ruth buries a triple 1012 minutes Syracuse has really pulled away no way oh look at that from hence Ted Valentine talking to Rue Ruth had something to say either to a fan as we talk to Judith look at this again this engine just purged he never gets sped up he always looks like hes under control that dudes a Ferrari how do those drive in the snow in Syracuse well apparently pretty well yeah they do Applause just keep it on the court when I checked the national they asked me if I wanted a fourwheel drive truck yeah right me too yeah I think thats kind of how you have to start when youre at Syracuse can I have fourwheel drive please lets start from there Danny Williams and Judah Mintz go to the bench and mints getting a nice Ovation from the crowd here inside the Dome 24point effort best of his freshman season pass underneath Allen scores in a foul to Ron Allen the sophomore from Brooklyn now a timeout taken by the orange with 240 left well Saturday on acc Network and the ESPN app our college basketball doubleheader starts one Eastern with Pittsburgh hosting North Florida the Oakland Zoo will be rocking then Cornell takes the 50mile drive up the road here to the JMA Wireless Dome a little square off against Syracuse the orange have won the last 41 against the big red dating back to 1969 no word on if Cornell will be driving a Ferrari of those 50 miles well I dont want to think eventually all those guys that play for Cornell will be driving a Ferrari I know that at some point when I was in coaching we would play Dartmouth and Cornell and all those teams I tell my guys you better beat them now because youll be working for him later thats exactly right yep Applause long time series with Cornell I think every graduating class for either School has seen multiple Syracuse Cornell basketball games and Allen at the line and he hits the free throw to complete the threepoint play so I got to go here were were at uh 12 points here coming down the stretch you are a proud graduate of Syracuse of course this is one of the great Broadcasting schools in America as we take a look at Edwards going inside and cleaning that thing up what was it like to go to school here to be a part of such a an unbelievable Hall of Fame group of broadcasters yeah pretty great all right safe if you want to go to school for broadcasting cant think of a better place than right here in central New York NSU was such a proud tradition got to visit College radio station waer this afternoon and certainly that is home for many of us that have decided to chase Sports around and call games for a living you do a great job and youre in great company guys like Bob Costas went to school here Mike Tirico Sean McDonough Iron Eagle Applause one of my great Partners Rich Hollenberg is a Syracuse guy Jason benetti theres the Hall of Fame right there what any of those guys stick out to you ladies stick out to you in particular two right there got Marv Albert on there but Mullins on there by Costas on there so many great broadcasters and so youre always trying to live up to a high standard just the way that you know Jim Boeheim being here for 47 years has held this basketball program to an incredibly high standard and theyve upheld it yeah Id be remiss if I didnt mention my good friend Kevin Brown who now is the playbyplay announcer for the Baltimore Orioles has has been my partner in the American for a couple years Drew Carter also was a highly decorated now so I understand theyve got some awards they give to guys coming out of here and Drew up and coming guy Dan horde who obviously in Cincinnati one of my friends down that way is a Syracuse Greg you guys are everywhere that is definitely true got to see Dan on Saturday Cincinnati Music Brown was just here for the SC Georgetown game Saturday Torrance is foul 127 to go it was really fun Jordan before the game to get to visit with some of the young broadcasters here prior to the game and and just uh asked them some questions they got a chance to ask some some questions of us as well and you know you do it you do a great job and youre proud Alum here and this is this is world class the announcers that come out of Syracuse and youre one of those great classes and Im proud to work by you tonight well theyre very kind thank you Im I think Im somewhere down that list of all the greats but thank you very much its you know youre in good company though I am but its a great its a great Community its what I would say and then whats nice about it is that for many of us who have come to school here and you come up to Central New York and you break the snow and you have to go to a wonderful school but the community and the memories you make are the really important part and thats the same as these basketball players on the floor as well thats right very highly competitive people that that build these memories and King rice really understands that part of it I was really impressed with him todays first time Ive really met him and got a chance to really talk to him really impressed with his perspective Foster has that one go up his fingers out of bounds King rice certainly knows the tradition in the history here at Syracuse he was telling us before the game he said its special to come into this building and its special to coach a game against Jim Boeheim who he has immense respect for and he said when you grow up in Binghamton Syracuse basketball is the thing that you grow up watching and idolizing and said he grew up wanting to be the Syracuse players of his generation growing up would be the next Pearl yeah now think about this so he wants to go to Syracuse theres the tip in right there he wants to go to Syracuse and play for Jim behind but instead change his mind decides to go to North Carolina play for Dean Smith two pretty good choices two pretty good choices and rice 24th and Wayne wins among active head coaches the winningest head coach in Monmouth basketball history has done a really good job the Hawks program now this young team is going to do nothing but get that emo got the block and then calls it up Applause yeah yeah two young guys going up and oh Hema doesnt like the call the foul with the other hand perhaps right up there with Kadir Copeland Sandu The Freshman from
