away from home and watch their first 12 games this season will be on the road well such as life according to head coach Tony madlock and HBCU got ta go try and raise up those resources and Coach Matlock has got a nice crew hes assembled but theyre still trying to learn how to play with each other 16 players 12 newcomers only four returners sobering tab control by Rodney Howard and the yellow jackets so were open for business here on this Saturday afternoon Kyle Sturtevant running the show at the point guard position number of new starters for the yellow jackets this after news they shake up the lineup Tristan Maxwell drills the threepointer to get things going thats one of the not a bad way to uh to start off the game in your first career start by Maxwell heres a look at the starting five for Alabama State TJ Matlock their sophomore point guard setup head coach Tony madlock we talked about Isaiah range and then Dwayne Posey getting the start today he was off the best the last time out Corner three ball for Reigns had a short and the board rolls out of bounds down the Baseline theyll stick with Alabama state thats one of the keys John for Georgia Tech is shooting the basketball they have really struggled from Beyond threepoint land this year and most of the surprise that the yellow jackets down tempos important Pace its only scored 59 on the road at Carolina and obviously a different look here by Alabama State than the Tar Heels but nonetheless Tempo is going to be important for the Jackets today DJ madly out to Coleman threepointer off the front of the rim and the rebound controlled by Sturdivant Yellow Jackets starting lineup you touchdown a number of new faces Tristan Maxwell making his first career start Rodney Howard back in the starting lineup for the first time since midnovember and some notable absences as well jaymon Franklin is not dressed out he suffered a groin injury last Saturday against North Carolina so we will not play today Leia blocked by Rodney Howard and John what are the keys today hes too close I think for Alabama State you know Tempo said Tempo thats important but more important rally than the state they struggled to score in the half court theyve got to push the tempo get some easy buckets um and for Georgia Tech its all about the energy and effort coming off the exam week Tristan Maxwell rd2 for two from three that threepointer swirls home for Amar Knox Maxwell had missed his last 16 shots job before those two threepointers sometimes opportunity knocks and youre ready its that you know that jolt the confidence you need Alabama State led by first year coach Tony madlock spent last season at South Carolina state where he was up for the Joe B Hall award which goes to the most improved program in all of college basketball he was in South Carolina state they had won one game the year prior they went 15 and 16 under his watch entry pass and the high post to Howard pretty good turnaround for the former Memphis Tiger college team makes Penny Hardaway Tristan Maxwell is on flyer right now three for three from the floor hes got all eight points yeah he had a couple of good games at the end of last season and uh hes just picking up right where he left off there he gets the opportunity gets minutes and hes hes producing he had just 17 points in the first eight games he played this year Jalen more rising up he works through the contact floats it in hell go to the line for one more Eric Coleman good yeah more thats him hes got bounds to strength absorbs the contacts uh playing great basketball center entering the starting lineup five games ago along with Kelly Applause Music Moore had 15 points and a team High hello and Miles Kelly last Saturday went 6 for 10 from the floor against North Carolina also had a team high five rebounds the yellow jackets really struggled in the glass this season shooting 74 from the freethrow line Applause four or five from the floor and more you know five consecutive games and double figures scoring his confidence is high hes going to continue to grow only a sophomore skys the limit for his game hes so talented so athletic you can continues to get better every time we see him play Coleman trying to take on more and theyll whistle the Buford Georgia native for the travel okay head coach Josh passner speaking to Memphis ties he spent seven years as the head coach of Memphis until taking the job here at Georgia Tech he has matched that tenure this year these two coaches very familiar with uh you know each other working the southeast and uh coach Matlock during his time in Auburn and Ole Miss also interviewed with Coach Pastor when Pastor was at Memphis so theyre very familiar with each other theyre going to compete today and Kyle sturdivan he too was cold recently did not make a shot with over six last Saturday he hits the three and the Yellowjackets who have maligned their threepoint shooting so far this season they have found it here in the early going and 80 run Maxwell with Georgia Techs first eight points this afternoon its led the yellow jackets to an 11point lead here in the first three plus minutes so far John no concerns about a final exam hangover huh yeah give him exams every week where theyre shooting 80 83 for four three of three beyond the yard five of six from the field and Maxwell Id start leaving tests in his locker Music and whistle on the floor our officiating crew Jamie lucky Japan and JW Lucas that foul is going to be on Rodney Howard Wiley sometimes thats all you need as a player is is the opportunity and you know thats thats really gets the mind right you know you got to step up and not looking over your shoulder and uh seeing whos coming off the bench and Maxwell playing confident early on in this one we mention Jameson Franklin and not in the lineup today he is not dressed uh both Debo Coleman and Davon Smith spoken coach passer said they were questionable for this afternoon well charged Dwayne Posey a junior from Memphis Tennessee lets take one more look here contact underneath there we see the extension of the arm the lake across the eye you saw Kyles tournament hit a three earlier hes got two rebounds and two assists already today and thats really what Georgia Tech needs for him is be a good quarterback and avoid plays like that DJ Matlock lays it in well his pedigree is there uh last year almost a 31 assists the turnover ratio by sturdiven hes a heady guard hes got a lot of minutes a lot of starts under his belt and um hell be able to step up today didnt that loss against North Carolina Maxwells three wont fall Tech actually had a season High nine threepointers Rodney Howard has blasted at The Rim hell go to the line and well step aside one more time Georgia Tech leading by nine and somewhere else and Tristan Maxwell has answered the call John yeah hes been on fire taking good shots great shot selection we knew he was capable against PC late in the season last year 7Eleven from Beyond The Arc had 22 points in that game scored nine and a loss to Utah early on in November so hes definitely a great shooter thats what hes known for on a North Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte Area North Carolina and struggled those shooting John and that really is one of the stories for this yellow jacket team is they felt like theyve got some guys in the roster who can really light it up from deep but that has not been the case so far this year Tristan Maxwell one of those guys one of 12 threepoint land entering today he sent two of the first three weve also got a guy like Lance Terry whos been cooling off a threepoint land recently youve also got a few other guys in the mix in fact if you take Miles Kelly and Debo Coleman out of the mix the rest of the team shooting below 30 from three yeah low 20s uh collectively the rest of the team and um you know thats what they need guys to step up and Sturtevant very capable shooter um but its good to see Maxwell because thats what he does if hes going to find the floor especially when you see his own he can hurt the Zone Miles Kelly gets a good look loose ball Corral by Knox nice feet ahead to Isaiah range whos off the glass and him thank you Music horn is trying to mount a rally here Jordan 10 from the first five minutes has come out playing sharp Maxwell another three you bet he cant miss and give us a glance towards the Hornet bench yeah you know just play ball might want to save that look it was a you know its a hard stare right there I dont want to get caught with the officials Dwayne Posey is stuffed by more second chance no Howard the board foreign Applause ripped away by Alex Anderson the transfer from South Alabama he was teammates last year with the yellow jackets Jayvon Franklin Debo Coleman coming to the scorers table looking to check in Rangers three wont fall another rebound for Howard you know Maxwell gives that hard stare to coach Matlock you dont need to look you know about the nest so to speak the warrants will come flying Matlock can coach these guys up theyre going to play hard just like him thats his DNA but right now the yellow jackets cannot miss they are five of eight from distance Tristan Maxwell has hit three of them and look at that glare towards the pitch Music foreign Music Applause Music this weeks press conference and that is exactly what has happened in the first six minutes of this one Tech is seven of 11 for the floor five of eight from three and on those seven makes Johns six assists theyve been moving the ball extremely well yeah thats important for this team you know theres theres no one star on this team its a collective effort ball movement player movement offensively is critical blocked from behind by Maxwell knocks on the take yellow jackets the other way Kelly lets it Fly short and corralled by Matlock the step on the gas weaves around Kelly he runs the show for Alabama state thats what coach Matlock told us yeah and you know hes an awesome Defender as well hes going to draw the toughest assignment from the opponent every night its just a tremendous athlete and competitor Sturdivant going against the Freshman Knox finds a window spills off the rim no good Applause range has been so hot this last couple of times out 26 points 27 points in his last two games Anderson with the left spins teardrop oh nice move Applause the yellow jackets Im calling time out oh both teams are not shot at using these timeouts already three of them first well I know pastor had momentum you know see a couple couple plays he doesnt like hes going to stop that right away had some words with his team uh challenging them defensively this is a a hornet team that has four guys on the floor at any given time that can handle the ball and talk to coach Matlock yesterday uh Wiley and he was high on this roster the versatility of it guys can attack off the bounce catch a rebound and go thats tough to defend well in in our conversation with we talked about you know how hes a brand new coach in Alabama State theyve got 75 of their players are brand new and theyre trying to build a new culture as well new system everything its just so hard to build it on the Fly especially when youre playing every game away from home they did have a home game scheduled November against Carver college but that was canceled so their first 12 games this year are going to be on the road and its not exactly like theyve been just down the street theyve been to California to Ohio to Pittsburgh I mean they have gone north south The Edge about every direction theyve still got a couple more Road games this week yeah and what resonated with me in that conversation and Coach Matlock was high on the growth of getting better game by game practice by practice in first three games of the Season you know they give up 96 and 91 points uh given up in the 90s and then the next eight or nine games defensively theyre holding opponents in the low 70s so you see Improvement and Lance Terry he continues the trend in this first shot of the afternoon Falls Debo Coleman and Dave Hunt Smith good to see them on the floor John their availability was questionable entering today did not start and he started each of the first 10 games for Georgia Tech Music Maxwells Gonna Bump Matlock and Music yellow jackets uh you know with Clemson coming in for the ACC home opener not going to take any risks you see a guy like Dave on Smith come off the bench you know the ankles probably not at 100 yeah hes gonna get some minutes uh but hes a guy that definitely rebounds well on his guard position hes athletic hes good defensively hes got leadership seen him pushing the ball now his minutes you know probably be diminished today well and one thing hes done such a good job of this year John is hes taking care of the basketball hes got a sets a turn of a ratio of two and a half to one and thats the growth you want to see you know over time and experience you want to see those numbers go up huge statistics especially as you get into League Play got to take care of the basketball well and thats been a Hallmark too of Coach pastors time at Georgia Tech is the players have gotten better year in year out could have found the floor charge too Tristan Maxwell and the yellow jackets have been draining threepointers so far this afternoon John that was one thing coach Pastor felt strongly his team was going to be able to do this year and today theyve done it yeah and the common denominator has been great shot selection these are high quality shots obviously Maxwell leading the charge three and four could be on New York Kelly and Sturtevant also getting in on the action uh but with ball movement and its quality um shot selection Georgia Tech five of nine from Deep theres a look at Tristan Maxwells numbers against the entire Alabama State team Tristan had just 17 points this year in eight games and now in just over eight minutes hes put up 11 just the second time in his career hes had double figures in a game we got a long way to go on this one its Davon Smith gives it to Maxwell why not keep shooting a little strong met time the rebound belongs to TJ Matlock steps on the cast bowls over Lance Terry no whistle shot left short Coleman rips away the rebound Applause Terry no attack continuing to get open looks a gamble by Terry looking for the steal range the range has been quiet so far just two points Coleman and a foul gonna go against the yellow jackets we had Rodney Howard thats his second and that was a heady play late in the shot clock uh you know not much going on the ball was sticking on the left side of the Court and number 30 Eric Coleman with the speed Advantage takes advantage of the iso situation to draw the foul heavy flown so Howard and Maxwell get a breather Jordan Mecca Miles Kelly in for the yellow jackets Music Roland McCoy making his first appearance today for Alabama State David Smith how good is that ankle ankle and there get up son get up Smith at the rim and Georgia Techs defense getting it done the Zone the length uh really bothersome to the Hornets well and thats the other piece for this Georgia Tech Team John is do they need to shoot three better absolutely but they can do themselves a big favor they can get out and run more often great entry pass and the jam from Daryl Reed whats your freshman from Hammond in Hammond Indiana and Josh pastner not happy with the middle of the zone defense right there he had some words with Mecca on the way down the court too easy just the fifth game Mecca has appeared in this year hes averaging less than five minutes a night Smith misses the roll Alex Anderson head full of steam dumps it off down low blocked by Mecca he might be the best rim protector on this team and Becca steps up to the challenge he bit the fake on the last possession stayed in the game on that one and then we have Debo getting in on the action and already Georgia Tech now with eight different scores this afternoon only one players made multiple field goals thats Tristan Maxwells got 11 and Colemans a guy that can score in bunches if he gets hot in six of ten games and double figures this season and hes known as a prolific score he scored anywhere on the floor talking about defense turning into offense got the wing defense in the zone uh you know to attack that youre gonna have ball fakes uh the high post area again somehow get the ball to the middle but for the Hornets ball movement moving that zone side to side and then youre not just going to be able to Telegraph passes first free throw no good from Daryl Reed you think that dunk davons going to be on low sneak his Instagram handle no doubt about that hes got some serious followers on that you know hes got 82 000 followers a little snake Im surprised someones not operating right now man that accounts hot second free throw good from Reed Applause Music redshirted last year now in his second year at Alabama State one brings it up Music Applause jackets looking at the 23 zone of the Hornets again ball movement tried to attack the seams all screen from Mecca Coleman goes the other way Applause fifth end of the paint lifts off leaves it short as they arrange controls the board Applause Music nearly a turnover down low Terrys scrumming for it Point Blank layup wont fall nice hands TJ Matlock trades the steal no points off the turnover and the goaltending is gonna be called so theyll count the basket great body control by Matlock he avoided the charge Mecca had the feet set and you know thats the versatility you see the size the length of TJ Matlock hes just adds value in so many ways and thats where hes at his best playing downhill attacking the rim hes just a sophomore playing in his 41st game he started every single one of them I think I just got shout out give me a shout out now you guys go way back dont you oh yeah my brother Mike my twin brother spent six years on the bench with Tony um during his time at Auburn and also back to Utah they won 22 games a season over four years there so they had a lot of good times together and I know coach Matlock well great great human being on memories of the miners yeah Miles Kelly for that last basket down Five Points balance so far for the yellow jackets are still still shooting over 50 percent from the field DJ Hadlock from the seat of his pants hes gonna get called for the travel yeah just an unfortunate Possession looks like he had a wet spot on the floor lost his footing jackets will benefit Wiley keep an eye on Davon Smith a little slow getting up there to step aside up Georgia Tech 2916 lead 743 on the clock in the first half and moments ago we saw Georgia Tech guard Davon Smith go down hes been nursing that ankle injury and boom Matlock steps right on it and you can see Davon in some pain yeah in the hand uh immediately goes right to the upper part of his ankle Davon obviously grimacing in pain this thing when you have an ankle injury it doesnt take much to turn it again Im sure hes taped up to the you know almost to his knee but uh those things can occur easily and uh the way that look is not good well he is walking under his own power we got Richard Stewart the trainer in his 16th season here at Georgia Tech hell take a look at him getting that tape going Im taking that right sock off I assure you its not the first uh ankle roll that Richard Stewarts seen hes one of the best in the business and um you know he gets these guys back the rehab and and the hours those guys work the unsung heroes of coaching staff so the athletic trainers theyre the first ones to work and the last ones to leave and you see Richard Stewart getting after it on the sideline trying to get Davon ready congratulations Richard by the way he got married this off season his wife Rachel is the trainer for the Georgia Tech womens basketball team to Boston this afternoon theyve got their ACC opener against the Boston College Eagles thats one way to make it work if youre going to work long hours to get a wife in the same profession right that does not hurt at all right there they speak the same language and Kyle Sturtevant its his second shot of the day hes not got five points story so far in this first half Georgia Tech shooting the ball 12 of 22 from the floor that hit five threes on 10 attempts Isaiah Reigns trying to get it going swirls out Lance Terry with the rebound and Howard did a good job defensively on that possession thats a tough rotation you know Howard closing out on range on the corner three defense by Rodney there was a ball in the high post its on the floor Kelly not his best shot I havent seen many of those for Miles this year sophomore leaves the Yellowjackets golden scoring threepoint shooting yeah he went with the side step towards the sideline and you know coming out of a dead ball situation tough shot clock was running down Coleman off balance cant hit it and Coach Matlock was hoping for a threepoint play opportunity and for Eric Coleman and went to Beaufort High School began his college career at High Point playing for tubby Smith start of it right there giving up some inches and they definitely got the elbow on the way up but theyve got to get his shot going proud Namaste coach men like thinks thats imperative he just has not shot the ball well this year shooting below 25 from the field below 60 from the freethrow line thats not the the way Eric Coleman has played so far in his college career transferred in from South Plains College first year as a verdict just doesnt have it going right now those are big free throws you know when youre down 15 every bucket matters and Colemans a guy thats going to see a lot of minutes uh plays just shy of half a game hes averaging 17 minutes on the season and you know for the wine you gotta gotta try to knock him down third event doesnt get it to go offensive rebound for Jalen Moore goes up didnt quite get the roll that was an area of focus too this week in practice offensive rebuilding for the jackets yeah against the Tar Heels jackets uh were crushed on the boards negative 21 in the game and only had one offensive rebound but theres a guy right there at the line that with Howard drawing the tallest opponent on the Hornets Moore can have a field day in there if hes active and aggressive and the hope is that Jayvon Franklin would be available on Wednesday against Clemson but if theres anything less than 100 you can count on Jalen Moore hell be asked to do some work on the glass and thats gonna be a big key for him the rest of the season no matter whether javons there or not and Moores really been shooting the ball well from the freethrow line he was 17 of his last 20 coming into this and now three of three on the day so thats a great stat because hes a guy that can get through the line often largest lead of the day for Georgia Tech at 17 one and done possession for Alabama State Music Applause to represent on the ball Applause Music NFL off the ball gonna go against Eric Coleman its a 16th foul for the Hornets and thats one right there was late in the clock they were doing a great job in their mantoman defense and kind of failed the jackets out on that possession Coleman will take a breather foreign Applause Music so given different looks keeping the jackets off balance coach Matlock switching up Howard lays it in softly with the left Applause now eight different Yellowjackets have made at least one basket Applause Posey block from behind by Jalen Moore the vicious rejection yeah more can be real effective off the ball his length is athleticism here you see anticipating Id like to see verticality on that I dont want to swat down especially when you get into that ACC play youre playing with a shorter bench uh plays like that just the little ones where you dont want to give the officials any any reason to blow the whistle and keep the hands straight up but a great defensive effort a good effort on the rebound as well for the tech now plus five in that category Sturdivant has it blocked more the put back yes Jaylen Moore on both ends cleaning up the glass yeah and you know Howards going to eat space hes going to eat bodies in there and if youre active on the boards youre going to be the benefactor and thats thats what we saw in that possession Roland McCoys threepointer off the back of the iron Maxwells been hot in this first half that ones short long rebound its McCoy here come the Hornets to Isaiah range hes trapped in the corner and a turnover Jalen Moore can fly and a little swirl in the scoopdeedoo yeah the best offense for the jacket starts with their defense and again their length their athleticism you know the way they trap the corners out of the zone and play Passing angles uh cant throw casual passes and and jackets Applause under four minutes to go in the first half tough shot Christian McRae cant get us a go and now fouls gonna be against Dwayne Posey thats his third Yellow Jackets a 23point lead one more look at this steal and score from Jalen Moore get into the bag Jack an unbelievable Defender you know guards can guards four positions on the floor can rebound block shots you know that should be a goal its certainly attainable with the right mindset as you mentioned James nine points eight rebounds to Texas Legends this year in the G League hes got a birthday coming up next month Tristan Maxwell having the best game of his season by a mile today 11 points first free throw of the afternoon is good that continues a 130 run for the yellow jackets its been close to five minutes since Alabama State last scored Music and Jalen Moore just wins it back Rodney Howard Cashes in the second chance points Rodney Howards now made 11 straight field goals John dating back to two weeks ago against Northeastern and hes got eight rebounds to go with the five points and um this nice touch by the big man from 15 Isaiah range throws up a circus reverse how itll turn it over to start with him then one of the better halves of the season for Georgia Tech admittedly Alabama State not the stiffest competition theyll face the rest of the season but for a group that was coming off final exams and a disappointing loss against North Carolina this has been a nice job of answering the Bell being down two of the regular starters and Rodney Howard a little high low game that time just dissecting on the offensive van with Precision great ball movement unselfish play and on the defensive side of the ball Wiley holding the Hornets to 25 from the floor now a 170 run for Georgia Tech Alabama States missed their last shots until that made from Eric Coleman Applause Music and while Georgia Tech has cooled off from distance John theyre still find a way to create opportunities in the lane third event lets it Fly he drills it you know I think what were seeing here sometime in exams weeks uh exam weeks its tough to get the entire team together theres going to be days off but its a wonderful time for individual Improvement getting shots up free throws and the jackets really shoot the ball well from three to six of 14 and nine threes in a game which they had at Carolina and the losing effort was the season high so you might see a season high today if they keep shooting from you on the arc and Lance Terry Works through the contact as he took a Hammer to the forearm from TJ madlock youll have a chance for an N1 yeah and weve seen a lapsed defensively and then thats what coach Matlock spoke about is this maturity and teaching these guys how to play 40 minutes and over the last five minutes the jackets have really taken it to the Hornets young team a collective group of guys that havent played a ton of ball together they get to have a home game but I like what I see on the bench over here on the right theres a high energy coaching staff its tough to stay positive you know when youre playing away from home and youre taking some Ls but you know coach matlocks done a nice job at turning this into a learning experience and you know hes got to teach at halftime hes got to play defense we cant let up jackets are just picking them apart right now Tech has put up 50 points in the first half Sturdivant from behind Maxwell another triple he is dead on this is fourth threepointer of the half you know thats one as an assistant coach Wiley you know thinking back to my days as a former assistant coach hes probably not on The Scouting Report a lot theres not a circle around him as the you know the laser shooter from outside unless youre looking back to the previous season and you know youre kind of sitting there on the bench like oh my God wheres this guy coming from and you know this this Im having flashbacks you know you miss a guy on the Scout he hasnt done much this season thats why you got to be thorough you definitely a guy that hit seven threes late in the year against BC last year and uh as a coach as a staff I mean you gotta gotta find these guys fine Shooters players got to know that going into the game Ive been pretty confident Clemson staff would be aware on Wednesday right and Im not saying they didnt know whats going on Coach matlocks pretty pretty thorough coach and uh hes been super successful uh just probably just PTSD from my assistant coaching base then on the wrong side of that seven minutes Georgia Tech has outscored Alabama State 262 Music and Alex Anderson gets a chance in the free throw line he probably one of the most versatile players on this Alabama State roster John he can play positions one through four and as you see hes from Memphis hes actually on the Matlock family for a long time so when coach madlock got the job at Alabama State and Alex Anderson was in the portal it was a pretty easy match Applause and matlocks an unbelievable recruiter hes a legend in the Memphis area around basketball the history of basketball playing with those great teams of Penny Hardaway and then coaching for 2 for 25 plus years hes been done a tremendous job recruiting in the southeast United States so hes hes going to do well here and theres a distinct Memphis flavor to this supported roster as well theyve got a number of players from there Western Tennessee area 45 seconds left in the first half its been a pictureperfect half for the yellow jackets shooting 57 percent Alabama State shooting just Jordan Mecca with the rebound Terry elevates it dropped one Applause Reed welcome to the ACC carmans Court he just took that in the face Polaroid right there got over a 40 inch vertical final 10 seconds hard to imagine a better way to finish off it was been a dominant first half for Georgia Tech TJ mad locks three no Jalen Moore the rebound buzzer sounds and it is a 35 point lead for the yellow jackets over at Alabama State at that half Tech Nails seven three pointers shoots close to 60 percent in the opening on that sheet stick out to you yeah I think the 15 assists right there is the one thing that tells the story it was that was created by a good defense pitcher heads and the extra pass on the half board sets and you know 15 assists on just shy of 2425 made baskets thats thats pretty good so Alabama stay with possession pressing Matlock up near the Music near the disc drops a twohanded hammer I take that back while theres 21 made field goals 15 assists on 21 its pretty good first offensive sequence for Georgia Tech the account theyre starting five from the first half out Rodney Howard and Kyle sturda that the seniors who have been coming off the bench the last five six games all of a sudden the chance today and they had responding right and Rodney Howard with a twohand jail on his end range Oh What A Move Isaiah range he was quiet in that first half job yeah he had a chance to line it up his leading scorer on this roster in uh 26 points uh 465 points per game over the last two coming into this one it takes a strong take right there he wouldnt touch really done the job finding him uh playing The Scouting Report held him to two points in the first half so a guy that can get off he can score from Beyond The Arc really knocks down the three point play Applause Music shoved into the corner Tristan Maxwell have a day that is his fifth threepointer of the afternoon Applause and he now officially John has more points today than he did in the first month and a half of the Season yeah hes chasing that career high 22 he had against Boston College late last season thats up back to Jalen Moore he lost track of it I think it went off the foot of Eric Coleman another Corner three jackets making the extra pass the goods to grades are flowing for the jackets unselfish basketball inches up great energy well in the story through the first 10 games of the Season John was that nobody was making threes outside of Tristan or a Debo Coleman and Miles Kelly a timeout called by Georgia Tech today nondibo nonmiles they are seven for eleven for three Georgia Tech in control adding their lead early in the first half second half Geico has been offering savings for over 85 years that could hurt all this Georgia Tech leads 6024 and Tristan Maxwell how about delivering in your first career start John next man up next man up Tristan answered the Bell right there 18 points three assists zero turnovers so a clean game from the floor as well take care of the basketball in 17 minutes of play you can see the comparisons there so nice to see him taking advantage of the opportunity and you know as well Sturdivant the senior 86 rebounds six assists in 16 minutes those were the two new starters tonight after uh you know Tech had a solid five going for five games and so both guys stepping up to the challenge Jayvon Franklin out with injury Debo Coleman and Devon Smith itll banged up as well they have played this afternoon but you know for Coach pastner John you know when you have a chance to get some new guys in the rotation on a day like today when you see these guys deliver like they have what does that do moving forward for their roles well number one it certainly doesnt hurt their role I think it gives them some confidence uh an important part of growth is getting the playing experience and you know you can only put five on the port and coming off the bench for two or three minutes spotty here or there is a lot different than getting into the flow of the game and so you know its tough to be a great shooter off the band you know theyre hard to find but hopefully a game like this Maxwell can find minutes in ACC play and and draw on this experience weve touched on it a couple of times but that was 22 points against Boston College I mean I dont want to say singlehandedly winning that game but that was a huge performance and for a team that won just five ACC games last year John if they can get even half of that type of production Off the Bench from number 11 go a long way for Georgia Tech as they prepare to take on The Gauntlet of ACC conference play I agree mental toughness is just a you know its such an important thing and its so hard to to hone that skill its definitely a skill to be tough and put misses behind you and turnovers and not let them dwell and eat on your confidence and hopefully a game like today gets Maxwell going Jalen 4 tries to go behind the back somehow retains possession Music Applause Maxwell bounce pass to Mecca cant finish good look though Good Feet underneath Maxwell wasnt happy man that was his dime that was his assist he said come on Mecca hes already got three of them this afternoon he wanted it Music Applause Music got the bounce Isaiah range finally with his first three today just the second for Alabama State as a team and again he was 11 of his previous 14 and two games coming into this one from Beyond The Arc so hes a very good shooter on matlocks roster and Kyle Sturdivant Strokes it home hes now got 11 points hes hit three threes he and Maxwell combined to hit eight of Georgia Techs nine one more and they will collectively die Georgia Techs uh season high from Beyond Jordan Mega called for the foul there played in his case thought he had all balls there onto Wayne Posey third foul on Jordan Mecca first year at Alabama State last two years he was at Kilgore College thats in Kilgore Texas about an hour west of Shreveport now when youre in a situation like coach Matlock and youre rebuilding and assembling a team and you play 12 games on the road which is you know he inherited a lot of that schedule he kind of walked into a lot of that his hands were tied and um you know theres an arc to scheduling but sometimes you know in a swac level School youve got to play those by games but you can still strategically pick them I dont think thats the case of what coach Matlock walked into and if you have to find the silver lining you know the back the back court of Matlock and range is really good and theyre combined eight of 17 from the four theyre playing at a high level you know in a losing effort but youve got to build on the positives if you push Matlock yeah and more it is really remarkable how far he has come the last 12 months he is um you know I I think they saw that he was a late Boomer in high school and uh Georgia Tech was lucky to go in and grab him he was heavily coveted late in the game and Coach pastor and staff did a tremendous job in the recruiting effort selling the school The Institute the degree in Atlanta but Above All Things is you know as the opportunity has been presented hes really stepped up and shined that personal breakout for him was Clayton State in January a nonconference game yeah he goes out there and no Michael devotee no Jordan said uh all right I better show up kind of similar to whats happened today with David Smith Devo Coleman limited Javon Franklin out Music theres a problem so far for Georgia Tech though shot the ball at an impressive clip 57 from the field nine of 173 the growth Ive seen in Moores game is you know hes comfortable in his role he knows his limitations uh very rarely does he take a bad shot uh it doesnt Force early contested threes hes under control there you see Applause fast break opportunity right there hes

last couple of minutes the yellow jackets have now hit 11 threes this afternoon a new season high they also have 21 assists on 29 baskets now my guess is they were all in the uh in the gym we call

those two free throws hes now five of six on the free throw line threepointer wide right from Isaiah range basketball Music ing in the second half was you know before those two free throws were made it was just a threepoint differential in the second half almost 10 minutes in so you know coach coach Matlock whatever he said at halftime theyre competing theres theres no quit no theyre getting some good production in the second half too from Isaiah range he had just two points in the first half nine here in the second Nebo Coleman continuing to work Jordan Mecca Second Chance points Applause another thing the yellow jackets have done a good job of todays getting in transition 20 points this afternoon in the fast break s have seen the court and all nine have scored now with that Mecca too Daryl Reed a smooth J Applause and if youre Alabama State I mean taking licks like this you know on the road its either 10th straight road game theyve got Monday against Arkansas State Wednesday against Memphis you know one thing it does do it does build some camaraderie among the team and theres been that many nights away from home gone to California Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Jordan Mecca another Bucket from point blank hes got four now yeah you know its its tough to have fun but youre losing but I I think this coaching staff that coach matlocks assembled theyve done a great job keeping it upbeat they look like they have fun that they genuinely like each other and he spoke about that on the phone and said you know they played one game in the last 20 days thats a lot of practice thats a lot of two days thats a lot of time together and he said no not once did he have a day over those 20 days where they werent getting along and getting better and having fun with it Daryl Reed heating up here for Alabama State he was averaging just one point per night scored just six points this season and Reeves now got seven with a chance for an eighth here at the free throw

foot eight Music and he hits his first free throw of the year and a one for free on the season Smith sneaks through and oh touched every last part of the rim but wouldnt go Music Colemans three short gotta get him going range of the offensive rebound Hammond leaves the hook shot short were getting looking Kyro martinov as well number 10 for Georgia Tech has checked in now Alex Andersons going to return for Alabama state spelling Reed Marks not a freshman from Ontario Music reclassified the 2022 class Kelly gets an easy too Tech hasnt need his needed his scoring prowess today seven points for Kelly four for Coleman two for Smith theyve gotten double figure efforts from Sturtevant Maxwell Jalen Moore and Lance Terry theyre gonna call Kelly for the fouls he reached behind Knoxville News yeah Terrys uh you know quietly weve been talking about a lot of players today we havent mentioned Terry nunch the transfer from GardnerWebb and hes five of six from the field hes got 13 points his developments been there as well and hes hes taking full advantage of the opportunity today with you know his teammate Davon Smith nurse in that ankle injury and his minutes are down so Terrys guy that can help this jacket team uh come ACC play well entering this season John no player on this yellow jacket roster had more points at the college leveled than Lance Terry which speaks hey to Lances success at GardnerWebb and also to the absence of proven scores on this Georgia Tech Team but the sophomore nucleus has been so strong Miles Kelly Devo Coleman and Jalen Moore especially today but getting to add a guy like Lance Terry to that mix and hes one of those guys who if he can shoot the ball better especially from three moving forward the Georgia Tech Team could make some impact in the ACC standings Smith tunneling underneath Kelly long range call and he swishes it just like that hes in double figures Music its now six consecutive games for Kelly as a starter scoring in double figures Georgia Tech 12 of 22 from three down to Martin off going to work and theyre going to call him for the offensive foul Applause Music its pretty raw down there and miles Alabama State playing on the road here in Atlanta and theyve got ties one former Hornet has made his name loud here in Atlanta any idea John recognize that headshot I dont want to ruin it for our audience who is that I know it but I got some help so I gotta be honest so in 1995 to 1997 one of the Alabama State Hornets Two Chains Epps star rapper here at Atlanta and part owner of the College Park Skyhawks just about 20 minutes south here of Midtown Atlanta Gateway Center thats the Eastern Division first place Skyhawks uh theyve on their way to Vegas to play in the Showcase Cup and the gleague said its unbelievable the growth of the league the development um an interesting step of Wiley 234 players uh currently active in the NBA have played in the G League thats 47 of the league so its really turned into a true farm system and weve seen a number of yellow jackets we saw James Banks earlier today playing in the G League you also got guys like Mills Wright whos made his name the G League Marcus Georges hunt spent a good bit of time in fact Marcus Georges hunt North Clayton High School also the alma mater of 2 Chainz Applause so Coleman curling in Martin uh uh here comes the 10th yellow jacket to score today and a nice job uh keeping the ball in the left hand not exposing it not bringing it back to the right good left hand finish by the big stolen away Coleman will go to the line for two Applause Debo getting in on the defensive action with the steal another chance to earn him the hard way at the freethrow line Carol marks enough Music one more look at that move his second basket has a yellow jacket first today martinov knifing his way to the basket you know silky smooth at 6 10 Applause were actually gonna hear from another freshman Fred Paul baganskas freshman from Latvia will check in Lance Terry to the bench Music Applause DJ Matlock also returns replacing Isaiah range for Alabama State its a global game Global Institute here one of the best in the world and can attract players from all over yeah but Vasquez or Vegas is a big report that did not play against North Carolina but played for the Latvian national team in the Euro championships about the balance is there two goodlooking prospects with length skill high IQ players um Babyface right there you can see it yeah thats a young thats a young guy right there hes got hes got time to work under coach pastor and the staff developed the body foreign he got to Georgia Tech one of his missions is its not just attracting good players but turning good players into great players and the development that weve seen individually for a guy like I was just right and lambers James Banks Joshua Hoagie I mean the names you know go on and on with the guys whove gotten better individually and thats been a trend for this team and they got a pretty good base you go back to that sophomore class they were a top 30 class coming in and also Davon Smith transferring in that year now theyre in their second year and then you layer that in with some freshmen this year and you know they keep this group together moving forward you got a chance to do some special things perhaps in the coming years yeah absolutely and you know that sophomore class that Tech has uh you know ranked top 30 in the country and thats right where you want to be you throw some Player Development and on top of that guys pan out start getting momentum Georgia Tech the academics the city of Atlanta the platform the play on and now with the uh you know the nil no better more can be than Atlanta martianov has ripped away and Alex and Anderson with the jam Alabama state has not let up despite the score Applause Music the pressure here in the backcourt as well talk about recruiting like you know how do you recruit against Duke or North Carolina you know Chapel Hill Durham well youll sell yeah and with this nil its a game changer theres no better uh to grow your platform and shine than Atlanta the yellow jackets will be welcome in some Blue Bloods too coming next month the Duke will be here at the end of the down at the end of January Music Applause I also got Syracuse Virginia coming in the Cavaliers will be here in two weeks got a big game this afternoon taking on Houston Applause threepointer Amari Knox no Music and what do we have here I think Davon and Matlock just competing getting into it a little chirping going on JW Lucas seen enough he wanted to put a stop to the action before it get out of hand technical foul has been assessed Music now theyre going to get Anderson its gonna be on both double Tech Music Anderson and a technical foul on Davon Smith Music hey Dave I appreciated that bump right there you know what though mature play by Davon Smith not retaliating yeah you know he definitely too soon he got him he got him he got in his head come on hes got Clemson coming up man just eat it eat it I was gonna say I figured there was something else coming if they assessed Im not sure I could read his lips Applause yeah Music four minutes to play here in the second half Rodney Howard looking for that double double cant get it there Applause and we will step aside Georgia Tech cruising to a 60 record here at home their seventh win of the season got 25 teams Not a Bad Thing to play them at home though Wiley that always helps early on in the season uh you know unfortunately students not in the building so thats thats a variable thats unfortunate but theres some good teams man Virginia too in the country speaks for itself although Houston giving them all they can handle in Charlottesville today Miami won earlier today over Saint Francis by 15 that puts them at 111 ranked top 25 as well so the going gets tough like they say you know its a tough road ahead for the jackets no theres a couple teams too in the ACC that are having a really tough starts and Florida state is three and nine looks like theyre gonna trouble in the second half trailing St Johns by 15 and he got Louisvilles one in nine but theyre poised to pick up their second win of the Season second straight leading Florida a m by seven no I think Georgia Techs schedule is favorable this year they got a good draw theres a lot of parity in the league you know you get outside of Virginia Duke you know I think Miami is very competitive Virginia Techs had a great start to the season but on Georgia Tech when they go into games theyre not looking at you know oh theres no way we got to play Perfect to win this like theyre gonna have a chance and they the way they protect the ball and the way they defend that stuff travels travels well they just got to start knocking shots down like they did today and continue to you know have good rebounding efforts yeah I mean I think the two keys for Coach pass are moving forward here in the short term theyve got to shoot the ball better theyve done that today 12 of 22 from three theyre shooting 54 overall and Ive got to get out and run a little more and I know I think if you talk to any coach in the country theyll tell you that because there are some easy points to be had if you can get in transition and score up at Georgia Tech with 21 fast break points today Rodney Howards count the DoubleDouble now 11 points to go with his 11 rebounds and a healthy Howard is good for this lineup you know he can he can smell great minutes off the bench uh you know spot minutes rebounding and effective he can hes about production hes got the right hand hook the lefthand hook he can rebound eat space and its just a wide body in that zone plays big you know thats thats effective this margin currently at 39 points would be the largest division one win for Georgia Tech undercoach passenger their largest win ever was last year against Clayton State 10353 Music Anderson misses his jumper two and a half minutes to play s it over to Sturdivant is directing traffic how about the day for Kyles tournament 11 points a careerhigh eight rebounds a careerhigh seven assists stepped up to the challenge and the opportunity presented and hes still building on it Wylie hes not done yet no hes not at him 13 points for Kyle today hes got to feel great man oh yeah for exam week its been in college since his fifth year of the transfer from USC um fourth year third year at Georgia Tech people the one year USC good hands by Vegas its a lot of exams man hes happy hes happy right now hes shown hes got to be out here playing and producing and great to see coming off the bench and you know prior to this but he gets the start today and the seniors stepped up Applause he most certainly did a season High 13 points for Sturtevant this afternoon and now the WalkOns will Sub in for Georgia Tech smooth shot Roland McCoy some of those names for the jackets Brandon Daniels handling the ball Coleman Boyd a senior from Smyrna wearing 30 in white Music back up minute and a half here Georgia Tech has matched their season high of 93 points got that against Clayton State on opening night and for Georgia Tech you know its theyve got some depth theyve got experience coming off the bench Coleman Kelly and more are one two and three in the scoring column its a nice shot right there by the Hornets and six different yellow jackets with double digit points finish from Rolling McCoy here hes put up a quick five points in the final two minutes and the threepointer is good Lloyd with senior getting in on the action stepping up taking advantage of the playing time All State guard for Mount Bethel and how about that his first points since his freshman year for Coleman Boyd I think with this roster like Sturtevant and Howard great minutes today and and its not really about who starts the game hes getting ACC Play Its who finishes the game you know in a competitive game in the ACC you dont get caught up in starters if youre a senior and you bring it to the table and then you see what kind of work you do just like that senior did right there Coleman boy coachs son Cowboy former Wake Forest Demon Deacon hes got DNA in his blood boy talking it down from Deep great to see uh unbelievable team guy locker room guy hes put in his time its good to see him get in the scores column and the 133 of the day for Georgia Tech Applause free throw good from Alex Anderson and Jordan second dribble it out here 133s third most ever under Coach Josh passner for Georgia Tech Martin uh off the back of the iron final 10 seconds here Alabama State going to fall to one in nine Georgia Tech will improve the 74 and 60 at home and they will head into a stretch of 15 straight ACC games with a seasonhigh 96 points final second and a half here one more Baseline inbounds and the Hornets they played Tech to a onepoint game in the second half they did so thats the bright spot for Tony Matlock made the adjustments at the half his team did not quit one point game in the second half um hell have a nice road ahead finally get some home games in January so the yellow jackets remain undefeated at home that game or that wreck
