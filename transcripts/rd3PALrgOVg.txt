him off the bench in this ball game officials today Tony Henderson Jeffrey heer and Jeff Pond BC and the visiting red controls the opening tip last time out Eagles on Wednesday came back from 19 down

Lance Terry the teams leading scorer and he knocks down a triple by Dongo athletic big down low he fouled out of the game on Tuesday and that allowed Notre Dame to make a little run in the second half when he got in foul trouble starting lineups for Boston College Joshua Beetle at 13 last time out theres a three it is Elijah strong whos played well in conference play we got Chad venning the big guy in the middle of the transfer from St Bon Applause Aventure now the Freshman jayen mustaf his fallway not there and a rebound by Brown its something were going to see the BC guards crash the boards almost better than some of the bigs and high low action to strong you got to love that get clean rebound get it to the other end before that Georgia Tech defense can really set itself find your Lo your guy down there on that block easy opportunity for two coach stay real concerned about keeping Boston College out of the Interior out of bounds last touch BC Georgia Tech in its win on New Years Eve against Notre Dame played with Damon St called their best first half of the Season arguably their best half in the Damon statamire era you got to love that right you got your team fired up hes a fiery coach we got a chance to watch practice yesterday lot of intensity in practice Donald Han Jr missfires he is the reigning ACC player of the week Terry the reverse layup so Terry with all five for Georgia Tech strong all five for BC well last night we were worried about Terry because he left practice he got nicked up a little bit didnt come back to the practice court but seems no problem he is off to a quick start on Brown to the 10 with the transfer from UNBC where he averaged 19 a game last year well thats going to be a focus tonight for BC taking the ball to the right already weve seen Four Points inside the pay area George the mro off the pick and roll Dongo down low for two boy did those two really make an impact as freshman last year still kind of waiting on Dongo to take that next big step up as a sophomore yeah Dongo you know this is one of these guys when he gets it going hes got three triple doubles on the season hes fourth in the ACC and field goal percentage hes shooting 60 60 in the three ACC gam so he looks to get a high percentage shot deposit slip for Donald H and we told you reigning ACC player of the week at 29 last Saturday against fdu he and his dad who start at Virginia the first father son Duo to win player of the week honors in the ACC and that is hand beating Georgia Tech and transition that quick transition right get that basketball one pass and from one side of the floor to the other and again thats their third layup and Coach coach STM not real happy with the effort from his starters hes bringing two guys in off this pitch to shut off that interior Suare and McCollum getting ready to check in Dongo with a height Advantage little Dipsy Doo underneath Joshua Beetle I dont understand because I think Boston College was confused as well looked like Dongo changed his pivot foot and just walked himself right into an easy two points walked himself into it you see what I did there yeah heres inning big body down low guarded by Ryan Matumbo dmbe son went to the sky hook Matumbo gets the rebound Applause back well this is what you want right get that basketball off a transition whether you get a rebound or a steal and get it to the other end and then big fella download gongo working out underneath just a motivator I just got goosebumps listen him sitting here and with this little tableside chalk we did he mentioned to us how as a head coach youve got to rethink the business model how to build a team how to construct a team Earl Grant never dealt with this kind of roster turnover in the past last year BC returned a ton as Javen McCollum knocks down the three coming off a 21point game and you saw the dividends for BC a year ago they won 20 games competitive in the ACC and the new age of college basketball that doesnt guarantee that you have roster continuity one year to the next oh Vin he got himself with a bad way along that Baseline tried to force a pass that was turn intercepted Dongo size Advantage here on Dion Brown George averaging more than six assist assists let see if Dongo goes at Beetle Brown tried to help too strong on the hook and both bodies crashing to the ground we get a foul yeah that was a nice move by Dongo I love that one dribble middle comeback Baseline left shoulder turned to your right hand hook hes probably shot that time 10000 times or more gets a clean look at it here but when he missed it then he gets a little too aggressive and comes right over the top of the defender its still early but you almost get the sense BC is daring Dongo down low with some of these matchups yeah theyre going to want to see if he can operate right like they dont want to leave those threepoint Shooters open on that perimeter theyre make sure the Dongo has to try to beat them from inside strong misfires from Deep heres the lob and the Finish By Ibrahim Suare the red Shir freshman well yesterday coach SM Meer was on that young man imploring him to rebound and I love the fact that hes coachable comes out tonight with a good attitude DC two years of Eligibility bring some ACC experience Fred pay five and red and almost turned it over pay got the start against Miami played maybe the best game of his career 15 points career high six rebounds in a season High 32 minutes with Dion Brown aling with a Music sickness Beetle off the shot fake Lefty floater teardrop good how about that along the Baseline with two Defenders he just froze them he looked like he was going to throw the ball back out the out the top after he got stopped and then just put up that little Lefty floater found nothing but cut numbers for the Eagles P blocked at The Rim batted around now Georgia Tech wants to push oh the young freshman making a difference got the D he gets two blocks BC able to get back Dongo blocked at The Rim chase down by venning strong the other way draws the contact I love it you know when The Bigs get out there and you shall not pass get on that backboard flat those shots away a one to one in and going back the other way Benny comes back and he blocks one so yeah were going to see some both teams out here playing some good hard defense not allowing any easy opportunities and fast and its Furious and thats what ACC basketball is supposed to be about you felt it over the last week the intensity in some of these conference games starting to pick up you dont have directional State on your schedule anymore Im not sure where that schools located but I understand what youre getting right youre not getting that cupcakes so now all a sudden the competition Rises Duncan Powell checks in for Georgia Tech he had a career ey 21 in Tuesdays win against Notre Dame three threepointers transfer from Sacramento State after starting his career at North Carolina t nice young player without 1100 career points so he likes to put that ball in the basket he works specifically with bonsy Wells on getting shots not afraid to call Coach Wells at 800 at night say hey coach we go get some shots Music up mum off the bounce over the trees how about that drive young man not afraid to take it in there like you say amongst the trees and just throw that little floater right over the top of the defense strong the runner theres Powell with his first rebound wasted no time getting into the action this young man no better way to get yourself going for all you young Ballers out there do something on the defensive it then your offense will cut Powell the corner three I was about to say should George have shot the layup instead he finds Powell for three well Pals a threepoint specialist out of the corner so they are been almost conditioned to look for him along at Music Baseline tough Runner by Payne Here Comes McCollum Georgia Tech putting some back to back stops together Tech sizzling from the field at 67 in the first half 10 points Off the Bench remember on Tuesday both McCollum and Powell had 20 plus Off the Bench Suare seeing some more minutes of late mustaf with the shot clock winding down the reverse layup oh boy Ill tell you what if theyre not beating them over the head from the outside corner threes are attacking the basket mustaf good looking freshman he can fill up a stat sheet last five games averaging about 10 and five strong off the shot fake over Powell yes strong has shown the ability to get down there below the free throw line where he likes to operate Boston College desperate and needed a basket and strong deliver teammates involved that hes done that tonight one of the reasons why Georgia Tech is shoot 69 in this game and 75 from the line a three excuse me a three fter that W make coach real happy you get that time out you draw something up and then your team turns it over now the foul is on mustaf away from the ball Music Applause Chaz Kelly the long three and the rebound snatched away by Mumbo look at that box out by Mumbo like I say yesterday in practice 30 minute box out drill and its paying off how about mullum sports center top 10 I love this young man right here got a chance to listen to him be a leader in the floor arm practice yesterday encouraging his teammates coaching everybody else up on that defensive end and then he comes out calls his own number drives one to the r a little show and tell heres a three and its good by Roger McFarland 15 a game at South Eastern Louisiana last Applause year both team shooting it well in the first half Georgia teack its 71 howwell has it poked away loose ball battle Terry had it Anish I absolutely love when players dont reach for a loose ball but are willing to dive for it skin their elbow skin their knee to try to get the ball back for their mates they get a foul on Chaz Kelly second to team foul on BC coach BR cant believe it how you going to call a foul on that he wanted a jump Applause ball Howell loves that corner three thats his second two for two right now teammates doing a nice job finding him in that corner takes that ball it way up over that headband not quite the traditional threepoint looking shot but he finds it uh finds a way to get that thing in the Applause basket strong launches columns Been Everywhere yeah this is this is fun to watch after the hard work they put in boxing out yesterday theyre rebounded really Applause nicely Hastings talented talented red Shir freshman oozes potential 22 in red Kelly and that one flushes in well he did a nice job he got the defense on his back and was B to keep him there then attack to Big that had to step up to try to help that was a really nice use of the left hand on glass a colum fouled on the drive hes getting what he wants when he wants it right now he is ultra quick I dont know too many people in the ACC who can stay in uh in front of him when he is determined to get to the basket second foul on Chaz Kelly as Joshua Beetle gets ready to check in beep beep look the way he just cradled that ball in the left hand keep it away from the defender that might be trying to wipe it away McCollum last year was Oklahomas leading score started his career at Sienna tomorrow after our top 20 Womens Basketball double header well have an AAC mens match up between the top teams in the conference it is Memphis ranked at the top 25 hosting Dean green of North Texas Penny hardaways done a nice job with the Memphis Tigers colum thats the free throw terrific free throw shooter career 90 Georgia Tech by six Music Applause Music Deon Brown tough shot over Terry almost looked like he was caught in between but hes out of bounds well the defense of Georgia Tech has been impressive theyre for the most part theyve kept Boston College on the outside and theyve rebounded the basketball pretty cleanly so it this goes back to something that coach Grant said when we were talking to him earlier hard work works and Georgia Tech put in that hard work in practice yesterday were seeing it here in the first half McCollum catch release grazes the rim rebound Music Beetle Farland eyes Terry strong backing down Powell turns fades old school Music shot we put pretty good ball handlers for Georgia Tech on the floor George Terry and Music Applause Music McCollum shot clock down to five maalum turns and hits well big fella Chad V played about as good defense as he possibly could on the much smaller uh offensive player but just a wonderful move to get create some space by spinning back away from the basket 11 points now for jav and McCullum McFarland puts it home over a double team hes got five well it seems as though when Boston College needs a big bucket theyre getting one just when Georgia Tech trying to get that uh triple thre possession separation Bon col comes back with a big basket about the ball movement it started with the screen and roll and the extra pass by Dongo I love the high low pass between the bigs there using the bounce pass keeping the ball away from the hands and the arms of the Defenders George doesnt get an assist there but thats the Old Hockey assist was the track out at North Carolina coach Smith was tracked down on the big Court you get plus points for those hockey assists as you call them get you out of lapse much needed Terry wide open hockey assist again yeah you got to love the way George Tech is sharing the basketball here in the early part of this game goes down low below the free throw line basketball prior to today came on Tuesday you might be starting to see a Georgia Tech Team that has changed The Narrative of its season and the arrows pointing uh in an upward trajectory before their win against Notre Dame on Tuesday Georgia Tech hadnt beaten a power Conference Team yeah New Year New Beginnings right and Boston College coach Grant just shaking his head after coming out of that timeout and turning the basketball over right over the top of the offensive player but they come back on defense and get a deflection so theyre down by 11 they got to get a stop here they do not want to lose touch with tech going to the locker room in half now remember last year BC rallied from 16 down on the road to beat Georgia Tech and on Wednesday they rallied from 19 down to beat Miami Second Chance opportunity for Georgia Tech big point of emphasis in practice yesterday y rebound that basketball not only on the defensive end on the offensive end as well look at big fell down here operating trying to use his size Advantage basket does not count but hes able to draw the foul on the Freshman Luca Taves you got to love the use of the pump fake a lot of young bigs when they get that ball in that paint they want to hurry but just that little use of the pump fake got the defender to bite and then got the whistle is that something that you have to learn as a big when to use that when to deploy that yes and look at this drive right down the right oh nice dish pack to Mo St in the middle for a bucket really seeing the extra pass out of the Tech players today its a thing of beauty to watch but yes going back to that you got to learn that how long you have to operate down there when to use the head and shoulder bck and then when to just go up quick and strong with power Here Comes Taves hes probably the closest to what BC has to a true point guard and they Ste on the sideline third maybe fourth turnover now for Boston College nothing drives me crazy more than that watching Team get a hard stop or needs to get a bucket and your wing player steps on the sideline I played in Philadelphia with former tarhill Jerry stack and he was good for doing that about once a week I say when down here battling trying to get these rebounds and throw it up to you and you step on the sideline we going start fighting in this locker room you cant take care and value the basketball a little bit better so right now Boston College losing touch got to Value the basketball cant see turning it over George slippery inside could not finish Taves has earned extended playing time Earl Grant felt he gave them some really good minutes in the comeback against Miami venning on the follow hes been a nonfactor so far and well get a foul on the floor against Georgia Tech yeah big venning tried to go inside but uh was not able to get that to go but if they start attacking inside getting themselves to the free throw line they claw backing into this thing look one more time two big bodies banging into each other in the paintting down here trying hard gets the offensive left he rushed that one just a little bit too much and it squirted it out of his hand 425 to go first half by Dongo to the bench with two fouls on Tuesday Notre Dame started to come back in the second half when Dongo got into foul trouble Taves wants help theres hand BCs leading score over Terry to strong and thatll be an over the the back on Elijah strong his second foul thats going to be the fifth team foul on Boston College so itll be side out of our Baseline out of bounds for Georgia Tech with a 13point lead right now Georgia Tech is really having her way with Bon C theyre mixing up a good doing a nice job mixing up the inside attack and the perimeter attack they are shooting 65 here in this first half five of eight from three George has been the Maestro six assists even when he doesnt get credited with the assist he seems to be in the middle of it Powell with his third three of the half on the heels of a career night on Tuesday and pal had a defender in his face and said I dont care I got my stroke worker from the outside I love this left side of the floor let me stroke my third three from right over here on the left how about the bench production McCollum with 11 Powell with 11 Roger McFarland its not there rebound pulled down by Suare Terry jump stop turns tipped into the air it comes to hand almost seven and a half rebounds that one is knocked out of bounds by George oh be quick but dont hurry H was in a bit of a hurry that time wasnt able to finish that pass break 314 to go Georgia Tech trending up 11 assists on 16 m field goals and only three turnovers and one thing theyve done theyve limited BCs Second Chance opportunities venning using that big body and goes right to work on the red shirt freshman Suare design play right there we need a high percentage shot were going to give it to our 250 lb uh forward center with all that muscle and let him throw that little left shoulder right hand hook first field goal first points for venning who averages about 12 a game the lob for Suare and they get venning with a foul hes in disbelief well far away yesterday the coaches were kind of riding him he wasnt giving some of the things done there was some communication issues he was trying to put his body on guys and box him out I was wondering how he would come out here and perform today and he has responded nicely nice job with the pick hard roll to the basket they try to hard hand off he goes up and grabs that thing with two hands he puts the pressure on the defense call make the call weve got a womens college basketball double header tomorrow afternoon look at this Notre Dame North Carolina you get to see great Hannah Hidalgo and then Oklahoma and Tennessee at 300 pm on ESPN 2 second chance try here George the love Terry went flying and comes down hard hell be rewarded kid came down like a sack of potatoes George tries to throw that thing up there trying to get his seventh assist and look where Terrys coming from hes trying to come up over one of his own players even and crashes down hard on his right side I fall like that you guys are going to have to call stretcher to come get me up off the floor thank goodness this young man popped up and is at the line to shoot these free times you played with MJ that would have been a tough one for him to Corral yeah I dont know too many would have been able to get that one even Vince Carter would have had a tough time jumping up and grabbing that Vince Carter man amazing he used to have those electrifying ingame dunks as well as slam dunk contest but uh some of the things he did in game he had coiled Springs in his feet Im convinced of that how many times I was on a jumper in high school I never jump like that tell you what Chad venning going to be the first pick in every YMCA draft for the rest of his life old school low poost big game look at this too big too strong Im going to take that long step put my chest right into your chest and just fully my way to the basket nice concentration to finish going to the line looking for the and one fifth here out of Brooklyn originally transfer from St Bonaventure started at Morgan State not much of a rebounder but on the offensive end very crafty down Music low M collums got 11 blows right by venning and knew he had Suare right behind him yeah Vins got to come over and help on the dribble drive and Suare just just a smart thing young big follow you right to the basket and get the dunck oh they looking at this previous plays riew for offensive basket interference they will look at it so lets see well the balls got to clear the cender cylinder before swall grabs it lets see if its over the cylinder you make the call thats close yeah its pretty close Im going to say that half of that ball was still over the cylinder not very good on predicting what the officials will say but it looked like it was still over the cylinder this might be our best angle he gets it tries to pull it back and then slam it down I dont think theyre going to give it the officials are just to the left of us so were watching yeah what theyre seeing and at the end of the day whether or not they get the two points I like the way this young man really has come into play right so you you set that strong pick Kenny Smith used to tell me the got the better pick you set more your Defender is going to have to help lets go leave you open to either me to get you the ball or you to get on the glass he he loves it hes got a positive attitude and uh he believes in hard work hes said he had a father worked in a Papermill for 30 years and hard work work right now his teams getting out work though getting too many shots at that Rim Yeah Suarez still flying pay wide open and connects 42 from three thatll put a smile on coachs face right there cuz they got that rebound clearly and they got it to the other end on a wide open look for triple I dont mind the wide open looks its when the players come down like when they dont have numbers and Jack something up and it just gets clanks off the rim that was a nice execution of your fast break George green lights a three 4431 now just when BC gets a triple to kind of carve into that that large deficit Right comes back Georgia Tech with their but is that their seventh triple here in the first half seven out of 10 theres Suare again creating Havoc underneath George defended by Taves Terry needs help shot clock at 10 column step back rebound venning BC can hold for one Luca tabes The Freshman born in Tokyo Japan where his dad is a long time basketball coach and we get a foul on Lance Terry his first yeah they had one to give side out of bounds so going to make him operate with a short game clock here just 51 to shoot Donald hand Jr will inbound comes Taves has to put it up and thats how the first half ends Georgia Tech shoots 59 from the field 7 for pick it up Music both teams have their original starting five out there heres Ryan Matumbo son of the Hall of Famer dmbe Matumbo the late Hall of Applause Famer look at this long distance three right here oh my goodness little confusion on the screen situation you cannot leave a shooter wide open thats the spark BC needs they have been able to claw back in the gamees by shooting threes in the second half and Beetle gets it started Clemson transfer who sat behind Chase Hunter and Joe Gerard on a sweet 16 team last year George the lob Dongo count it I am getting my first look at George and he is impressive the way he comes off screens and then finds his bigs for the high handoff got to love this right here oh this was this right here thats just miss communication you can not go underneath the screen Big Vinnie cleared out that guard and then come back the other way nice job just making yourself available using your length around the basket and then you use the glass you soften your shots you give yourself that extra tick to find the the glass and Dongo just lays it off the board so all you young bigs out there use that glass its your friend threepoint play is good so Georgia Tech counters the beetle three the oldfashioned way Music knocked away Terry throws down wow down that right lane right wing like a lightning bolt and I love the way he put that thing in that right hand with a Statue of Liberty Jam 11 for Lance Terry venning from 18 yes well we talked about vinning in hand having to start get cooking here vinning comes back with a big jumper from the free throw line maybe thatll be the one that gets him going and then you get an offensive foul the other way in Dongo I dont believe got set on that screen thats going to be number three he fouled out in the Notre aim game only played 20 minutes see that look at coach STM Meyers face there just knowing that hey its a combination guards got to let the big get set the Bigs got to hurry up and get to position to set that screen and with Dongo to again hes so valuable on the Flor four if hes going to pick up a foul you want him to commit a hard foul you dont want to pick up those Ticky tack fouls yeah especially not the ones that lead the turnovers and over to strong thats a tough turnaround left it short Mumbo another Music rebound Terry down low against hand and foul on hand his first you know Terry in that first half he he had himself nine points uh in just under 18 minutes of action but he wasnt the Terry were used to seeing right like he now in the second half putting pressure on the defense along that Baseline realizing I got to get myself going here in this second half early and then he gets that uh foul call opportunity to go to the free throw line he was unable to get that first one but theres no better place to be in that free throw line and then look at who theyre bringing off the B bench here Mr energy 11 points in that in that first half Duncan Powell coming in this game early the shagman as hes called yeah hes got a tattoo on his lace thats shagman did you ever give any thought to uh adopting that style no sir no no no I well listen I Im jealous of any hair on these players that they got at my Advanced age I cant grow I cant grow hair for nothing on my head theres venning no the follow by strong tumbo had it fell down here comes mustaf missed opportunity for Boston College to get some Second Chance points had the shot Point Blank Range strong not able to get it to go freshman against Benning Beetle on Terry Terry gets underneath and a chance for three Terrys just putting his head down he hes decided in his first three minutes of this second half that I am putting my head down going to the basket I dont care who or what is in front of me I like that one right there and then looking you just see just getting the defender off balance there taking his time getting to the outside frame of his body and getting that contact going a whistle every time Lance Terry red shirted last year didnt play had a leg injury and he could have come back but wanted the extra year of Eligibility wanted to play for this team and for Damon stoutmire and thats why he took the red shirt he has been this teams leading score through the first 14 games yeah up to 14 points now we talked about all things that this young man can do on the floor look at that left shoulder turn Im surprised they really lowered a boom right into Terrys chest he wanted the offensive foul but this has been letting a play for the most part get a lot of that physicality around the basket you the player with the ball be able to bang the defender one more time look at this just that move him right up out of his spot the first time they come back in trying to get yourself going he wanted her trip to the line said hey youre going to come down here and punish us inside Im going to do the same thing to you on the other end yeah Lance Terry went right after Donald hand and 65 hand repays the Music favor he really emerged hand did over the last 10 games of last season its been a springboard into this season where hes been one of the breakout stars in the ACC he was their top returning score from last years team only averaged five a game up to almost 15 yeah and a lot of times you always say a player hey I if you give me more minutes Ill be able to give you more production but an is one of those guys that say Im not going to double my production I have tripled my production so wonderful job by him any rebounds the ball which I love when the SCS come back and get on the glass is there a player that hasnt said that no we all want more minutes baby Terry using the jump stop all right Terry in hand little back and forth here it really is is that whatever you do Im going to do it the other end so lets see if H comes back at Terry a second time here comes hand over Terry doesnt get the roll offensive rebound strong I dont know if we were going to have to pull up Dominique and Larry footage cuz we are in Atlanta yeah that would be fun wouldnt watch those guys operate but how about the second chance opportunities now once they got to the offensive glass they get it they werent able to get it to go strong once again goes in there chews some glass and now hes got to earn himself a trip to the line now you got to calm yourself down down 16 you got to get both of these free throws you dont want Georgia Tech P this thing out to a 20point Advantage strong had a big hand in the comeback against Miami 11 points all in the second half on WI Wednesday sophomore from Myers Park High School in Charlotte big game earlier this year against Temple went for 25 and 13 hes been in double figures in every ACC game or BC all three make it oh almost all four hes at nine right now yeah missed them both 71 free throw shooter and I was just talking how they need to get those points they got to capitalize on those little Second Chance opportunities around the basket and of course from the free throw line bucket here puts BC in a bad way George again using that screen from Suare well Suare is doing his job and hes not going to get a lot of credit in the box score for it but he has been setting up his teammates with some really mansized picks on the offensive end rning comes out to set the high screen Beetle doesnt want it goes to the rim gets blocked loose ball venting on the floor and get a held ball another block shot by S it says You shall not pass swatted that thing nearly through the backboard Lance Terry though how about this young mans ever and when you look at this conference as a whole were getting ready to dive into conference play which done is done and nonconference Duke far away is the class of the league Clemson appears to be the clear number two and then SMU pit I put Carolina kind of in that next tier of teams after that just get the sense anybody on their best day can knock off anybody else 6 through 18 yeah accs really got to pick it up well you say New Year New Beginnings maybe they can get something going but youre right right now then you just wonder about them beating each other up and that being an issue trying to get more teams in the top 25 board teams in the in the tournament SEC Far and Away the best conference in basketball I dont think in my 35 years I ever would have thought a predominantly football program would be consider conference would be considered the best basketball conference in the country but with 10 teams in the top 25 they are flat out getting it done yeah and again they took care of business and not conference which helps the league in March and what the ACC is going to be up against Georgia Tech could be a great example lets say Georgia Tech has righted the ship and the pieces start to fit and they go on a little run in conference play they didnt have a single power Conference win until beating Notre Dame on Tuesday so Georgia Tech could be a vastly improved team they could start knocking off teams you dont get credit for losing to Georgia Tech in fact it hurts your resume can hurt your resume badly come selection Sunday no great Point theres Powell looking for his 43 the rebound pulled down by Payne strong to strong offensive rebound venning n BC is closed to 15 yeah get a couple free throws get an opportunity on a second chance Point big vinning down there flexing his muscles using that beef around the basket 255 lbs hes got to be closer to 270 if you ask me I got him at 270 how about McCollum no one has been able to stay in front of McCollum today too fast I I I dont think theres a guy in the ACC defensively they can stop him when he wants to put his head down and hes determined to get to the basket a good with the three Suare a rebound Suare is doing his job blocking shots grabbing boards hey Im a big guy Im going to point out when these big guys do all the dirty things to help their teams get a victory went up top to set a screen for Terry doesnt want it Terry on the drive and out at the tangle well just 41 points we under the 15minute Mark here foring the 14minute mark of the second half Boston College hasnt been consistent score they got one guy that can consistently get him a be trying right now and he gets flossed Away by s once again hes brought energy Off the Bench Suare even though it hasnt been with the scoring four blocks for Georgia Tech George has seven assists launches doesnt hit now hand hes going one on Three were going to get a foul yeah little little out of control that time solid the defender tried to knife through and get to the side of his body but hand has kind of been discombobulated tonight he hasnt got himself into a good smooth Rhythm doesnt know if hes going to shoot the jumper no know if hes going to get the job just right just Just Trucks right through Terry and officials easy call for the officials the turnovers the Miss free throws some of the things that are hampering Boston College trying to come back from to get one of those large um victories from a large deficit so they got to do a better job getting stops cutting off the middle and then capitalizing on the offensive end but just too many turnovers here in this basketball game they were down 19 and came back against Miami it was their largest home comeback in school history this will stay with Georgia Tech theyve been down by as many as 18 today but Georgia Tech hasnt let up 61 from the field in the first half six of 10 from the field in the second well theyre getting good looks and its the bigs setting guys up look at that side out of bals play easy opportunity no one there to protect the basket miscommunication get an either high percentage shot largest lead of the game for Georgia Tech another block that time Applause Dongo mustaf offensive rebound Dongo draws the foul I like what Im seeing out of this Tech squat they might have started this season seven and seven but theyve won their last two games and they are off to a great start here in 2025 total team effort on offense and domination on defense by Dongo all ACC freshman team last year added about 25 plus pounds in the off seon I got another 25 PBS he can have if he wants North Dakota State Montana state in the FCS Championship game Monday at 7 Eastern on ESPN North Dakota state by the way it is pronounced bison not bison bison arent they always in the championship Im telling you on man as great as Alabama has been over the last 15 or so years best Dynasty in BS and FCS college football has been North Dakota State fun to watch Fargo Dome Ive told people Ive been there have you it is a bucket list item if youre a college football fan Montana state from Boseman they are the number one seed Hastings with the left hand no strong the follow strong has been doing his job around that glass and this one he finally gets one of those Second Chance points Ive been kind of imploring Boston cge to try to get back into this game so stay on balance after he got the rebound and was able to go right back up with almost a turnover shot clock at 10 George the Maestro inside to Dongo sophomore to sophomore Dongo was working hard down there wasnt the prettiest set but George who is just got such good Court vision sees the mismatch underneath and gets it to his big 20o lead for the yellow jackets Dongo in double figures for the fifth straight game four yellow jackets with at least 10 points these yellow jackets down here communicating on defense switching screens and they get it they get the foul its hard to set a screen on a guy when hes moving at that speed and Boston colge just discombobulated here in this second half third foul on strong strong and another turnover for BC hard to get a rebound and they no shots coming off for BC to get back into the game you get the sense its going to have to start defensively too many times Georgia Tech getting easy looks at the basket that time we get a foul its on Dongo thats number four and you start to think of whats a window to get back into the game well Dango picking up his fourth foul yeah that really hadnt hurt them today though really you know and Dango got thats the second time I think hes got whistled for set one of those illegal streams you take out Dongo and you come in with a guy like I say only one field goal but has really affected this game and reason why GTs got to 63 43 Advantage so Boston College they got to attack inside if not then they have to start settling for threes uh in the final six seven minutes of this game Kelly tried the old show and tell kick ball stays with BC Suare six rebounds Off the Bench to go along with those four blocks active hands Chaz Kelly heres Payne coming off a 15point game tough shot but draws the foul it is on Suare Suare has been trying to go after everything count there around that low block and closer to the hoop and he comes to me here and I love kind of goes high but you just got to give a lot a lot of credit that the offensive player gets into his body and creates that contact and thats really what hes whistled for because from the waist up he was pretty clean Fred Payne at the free throw line entered the game 18 of 21 from the line missed most of last year with a torn ACL its an 18point game here we go look at EC coming with a little full court pressure here realizing they got to start creating some turnovers instead Kelly picks up his third foul and that puts Georgia Tech in the bonus yeah and thats the last thing you want right so your coach Grant youre like okay we we got our bucket we got a free throws got a chance to set our 221 full court pressing get a turnover and then you foul 85 ft away from the basket s mallum to to the line what does he shoot 899 from the free throw line the best in the ACC yeah we can round that up to 90 cant wait three for three today that gets him over 90 he is now 29 of 32 on the season 94 last year 90 for his career so were not plucking small sample size here right Im Im Im jealous for like a career 60 sub 70 free throw shoo in my career he wanted to stroke those things like he goes he its sleepwalking and Scott hes immune to the announcer Jinx too thats a real Music thing Kelly working the Baseline back out to hand now Music pay and the three short you see getting a ton of easy looks in this game yeah they are and I dont I dont know if it was you know coming down here the early starts got a team discombobulated sometimes you dont get that the full amount of time that you need on a on on a day where you have to travel to have the team properly ready to compete for a noon game when youre get to the arena at 1000 it it just seems like theyve never been able to get into Rhythm theres mustaf nothing intentional there thats just a couple of big bodies flying at each other yeah just youve been there yeah at the end of the the day when youre getting knocked around like that you hope youve given as much or maybe even a little more than youve taken over the course of a 35 or what however many games these guys are going to playing this season you were telling me earlier when you played against Charles Oakley oh you would get it they just didnt call it hey I still hate Charles Oakley to this day for banging me down low when away from the ball theres one thing to play hard but the cheap shots of of Oakley and Bill lambir I never appreciate it still got the aches and pain from some of those blows bill out here might he had some helpers on those bad boy Pistons teams Mahorn Sally Rodman they were cast a characters for sure but I I wouldnt trade any of it for anything the way they play today I love every minute of it you see me hobbling down these stairs this morning I saw you and I looked I I tried to Staten up after I saw you yeah but was too late McFarland on the inside they needed a bucket in a big way there and down 19 approaching the 10 10 minute Mark they had to get something now can they get the stops on the defensive end still staying with that mantoman defense now what point do you change to his Zone well am I take that back they are doing their amoeba zone so they did change back to little zone defense and they got the stop at a clean board chance to run instead of turnover oh and lost and he wanted to make a bounce pass to the right wing and it slipped out of his Ms a column the trailer hits how often do you see that what should be a two the other way comes back the other way after the turnover and its a three the other way its almost like a fivepoint swing in a 20point game thats devastating 18 now for the senior from Fort Meyers that three doesnt go Hastings batted it and tried to take the charge no call and mustaf has the two it has been all Georgia Tech here early in the new year look at this you get the turnover put the ball down the Baseline shink the defense give it back to me and let me stroke this three 38 for the game Georgia Tech 10 of 16 in the second half 61 for the game yeah it and you know the Boston College is having done to them what they did to Miami in the second half of that game when they came back from those 19 points down oh someone lost their shoe got a guy out here playing with his ankle brace on it goes through venning he still got the stop run over to the uh signage to grab his sneaker hes having a little laugh at of it that was McCollum they lost his left sneaker gave the old flat tire trick we did that in the playground back in the elementary school flat tire trick whats that well you step on the back of the guys heel so when he lifts his foot up he comes right out of his sneaker we called it a flat tire what if they were nice sneakers then you fight dont step on my Jays he was shus jave for a moment Applause mustaf oh athletic move kids coming on wow two big buckets inside now for mustaf time ticking away for BC Beetle venting with great position kind ofsted that shot up he went up soft he he rushed it and he went up stoft 255 you need a bucket thats why you push all those weights in a weight room you got to go up with more power Beetle picks up his second foul when mccollums got the ball BC has not been able to stay in front and you mentioned mustaf the Freshman whos dad played in the NBA well he is starting to come along yeah he really is starting to come along you love that little drive from the left side of the floor float up underneath the basket to the right side hey I played with his dad uh in in the in the NBA I would played some golf with him this Summer and hed be proud of the way his son is out here performing this afternoon his dad the late gerro mustaf died in October you think of what Damon STM has had to be for his team in the early part of the Season Ryan Matumbo loses his dad Jaden loses his father at the college level we were talking about this earlier the the role of Coach uh takes on many different forms yeah many many different forms I lost my parents started my sophomore year coach Smith and the Carolina family were there for me to throw warm blanket of support around me and thats exactly what this Tech family has done for their two players sometimes its its best to be out here battling on the court with your teammates and make you forget about some of the things going on in your personal life its a little Escape for me Im sure uh having his teammates having this coaching staff having the support system that coach ster has developed here has been help for these young men 7449 740 to go Georgia Tech has been in control throughout Bench productions been a factor again Dongo with the four fouls too much and venning gets the rebound thought about bringing it up now Beetle Dongo didnt get his offensive game going today he went in there against Chad Vinny and hit a roadblock he got bounced to the the Baseline but I like the way he attacked the basket hes doing other things to help his team today lets see if venning goes right at Dongo whos got the four fouls he does and theres the soft feathery touch well with a with a little power of two though got into the chest of Dongo before he went to the Finesse shot that I like 13 for venning nine in the second half Dongo at the other end venning came over to help but too late yeah you let him go to his high percentage shot left shoulder turn turn right hand hook for a young big thats a rhythm shot thats a confidence shot foul on George we will step aside 644 to go the yellow jackets up by 20 again the bench production especially in this day and age you get 30 plus points from your bench from two guys that goes a long way yeah 30 33 points off of that line theyre doing a fantastic job I love the fact that got 42 points in that painted area when that battle of the paint and then theyre theyre picking their spots from behind the ark they just casting up 25 threes tonight theyre eight of 16 from behind the AR for 50 so just a nice balanced game all around yeah they came in shooting 34 as a team from Music three 20point game Beetle out of control turns it over Terry an exclamation point everybody get out of my way clear out this left side for me here and Im going to take this thing Baseline and rise up and throw it down look at the the energy on the bench they love it now thats how you thats why you push all the weights in the weight rooms when you go over there and the big guy tries to to challenge you at the basket you just Thunder it right over the top how about the fact that the only guy who didnt have an expression was Terry yeah very matter of fact even after the dunk yeah bonsy Wells and I were talking before the game and uh he he was one with the most expression on that floor boy was he he was a little tight before the game too hes loving it now Taves with the sweet jumper all smiles on that Georgia Tech pinch and why not right like hey thats why you work so hard in practice thats why you did all those dirty things in practice defensively so you could come out here and hold a Boston College to 45 shooting theyre under 40 from behind the arc and that numbers gone up here in the last couple minutes just because they have kind of turned off the Applause gas the ex EXT ra pass and theyre trying to feed Suare who has done most of the dirty work tonight yeah I like this young man right here you know he didnt get that one to go he got smacked upside to F the head take it an extra moment down there look at the pass underneath trying to spoon feed the big down there has been doing such a good job blocking the shots setting the picks being a rad block on defense trying to reward him on the offensive end late stages of this basketball game that shows me a team it doesnt care about who gets the credit they just want to make sure everybody gets opportunities you we mentioned the four guys in double figures George out there approaching his career high and assists with nine looking for 10 thats a team thats connected and when you got a team connected like the way this Georgia Tech is Tech team is theyre tough to beat what do you take away from these last two games for Georgia Tech because they looked nothing like that prior to this well it sometimes you just got to stay with it you mention all the guys that are out with injuries this was B them up 100 plus and a loss to North Florida early in the season yeah five different starting Road uh starting rotations it just takes a minute to get everybody to understand their roles the kid Duncan Powell from sack State hes got to come up see how he fits in get all these guys that are replacing guys that are normally out there playing Ling how aggressive am I supposed to be how passive am I supposed to be um and it takes a moment to figure out that right recipe even coach STM good look at him there hes got to figure out how to make the maximize guys strengths put them in possession a position where they can be successful out there on the floor here game 15 theyre firing on all cylinders the injuries have been real Reeves amua OBrien all currently out anuu not an injury related issue its personal hes missed now five games in a row mum missed four games after a concussion had Matumbo who was absent from the team in the early part of the Season dealing with the death of his father yeah he missed a month so its just taking these guys a moment right like to figure it all out clock at five colum and stays with him McCollum puts it up its blocked and that is a shot clock violation and for BC then you got to hit the reset button flat first half against Miami they responded in the second half they have a week off to get settled before Syracuse comes to town and theyll figure it out I you know Im so unpressed with the time I had with Coach Grant this morning that I am 100 confident and next time that they step on the floor theyll be a better version of themselves I a guaranteeing victories but uh theyll have a better energy a presence maybe uh B more connectivity couldnt seem like they could ever really get their two stars early part of this game off the launch pad talk about hand uh and uh big Feller um V venning thank you to really kind of get them going and that hurt the overall offensive production in the first half but defensively too they got to figure out a better way to start keeping their opponents out of the uh the the paint yeah hand especially just an off game for him hes been so good this year six points on two of seven shooting McFarland left the three Applause short about McFarlands high school team you had Z flowers whos a wide receiver now with the Ravens played at BC outstanding wide receiver Scotty Barnes kidding me ACC rookie of the year that went on to be the NBA Rookie of the Year as well thats a high school Squad right there hey got to be stay Champs right at least once right well this has been fun partner I I know it wasnt the close game that we wanted but it has been uh real impressive show by Georgia Tech and um what I what I take away from this the most these teams in the ACC realize were going to have to compete hard and I think the tonight the harder working team team won his basketball we saw it in the League last year and they didnt get credit for it come selection Sunday when the reality was teams like pit and Wake Forest were Bonafide NCAA Tournament level teams but we saw teams get better in League Play and season and often The Narrative is already written once you get through nonconference play and so the narrative against the ACC right now its not great it doesnt mean these teams cant get better and cant improve and we might be watching in front of her eyes here in Georgia Tech I agree with you 100 there get a nice hand there is that George go Terry going off for his efforts tonight he was absolutely fantastic he had nine points he wasnt really doing a lot in the second half he just came out more determined and that that lead really ballooned off of his efforts the 20 points just being aggressive taking it hard for the pass test to three by strong didnt find any iron shot clock inside of 10 Taves the drive the kick Benning again a little too much finesse Taves getting in there almost to knock it away and Georgia Tech can now dribble out the clock it has been almost two years since Georgia Tech won backto back ACC games by double digits David Styers team from the very opening tip controlled this game and dominated
