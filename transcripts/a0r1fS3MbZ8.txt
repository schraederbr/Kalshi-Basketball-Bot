the next point guard in Nathan George leading the conference an assist hes going to have to have a big game today for Georgia Tech to stay in this one Clemson wins the tip in the road orange Georgia Tech in the home Applause white here is Jaden Zachary who is turned into a terrific point guard at Clemson after transferring over from Boston College T to shoot for Chase Hunter to Victor lockin and the Cincinnati transfer puts it in how about the short roll Victor locking up and over the big rushing with the soft touch about 8 ft out some full court pressure here by Brad brownells Clemson Tigers meanwhile for Georgia Tech look the injuries have been a theme for this team since the beginning of the year down four players right now and playing with their six different starting lineup ni Touch by Clemson itll stay with Georgia Tech 15 on the timer going really big as Georgia Tech Dongo Suare and Duncan pal all three of those guys known for their physicality all roughly 6869 Georgia Tech easy to see why you would try to match Clemsons physicality in the front Court Suare and Powell getting their first starts in a Georgia Tech uniform tonight 3 seconds to shoot Suare Off the Mark got his own Miss and heres Powell at 15 in his return home in the loss to s youu and another rebound by Applause Suare see the offensive glass if youre going to go big in Georgia Tech you have to dominate that part of the game it looks like theyre just continue to climb the glass Ian sheflin finally able to close out that possession well it is a veteran Clemson starting lineup Ian sheflin of course returning from that Elite a run as his chasing Hunter and the addition of Victor lockin has been huge for this team particularly after losing PJ Hall to the NBA absolutely comes over from Cincinnati known more of a defensive player coming to Clemson though his offensive game has really opened up and as you see same starting lineup 17 out of 18 games this CL Clemson team understands the role they understand each other Victor lockin has fit in seamlessly one thing you notice about Georgia Techs offense wide open a lot of space guards looking to create both Corners all always filled it allows George to try to create have to do a little bit better than that well Damon stmy challenged his sophomore point guard after the loss to SMU in which he had a great stat line until you looked at the turnovers and overall the team with 22 turnovers in that lost to SMU and they got off to such a slow low start against SMU and you cant do that SMU has legitimate Talent on that roster they get out in the open floor you can forget it same can be said here against Clemson have to take care of the basketball here is Chanty Wiggins what an ex Factor he has been this year for Clemson five to shoot for Hunter and well defended by Suare Georgia Tech looking for their first points and last Touch by lock and itll stay Applause here well you mentioned the slow starts its something that Damon STM the seconde head coach for Georgia Tech talked to us about today at the shooter round really pleased with the effort in the second half but when you Trail to a team like SMU 50 to 19 at the half its too big of a hole to climb out of thats a deep hole to try to climb out of but look Georgia Tech theyve been ravaged by injuries it seems to be somebody new missing out the lineup every game and youre just having to Plug and Play and that can be difficult but whenever I talked to Damon he said you know what thats just part of it Im an X NBA guy were used to guys being in and out of the lineup now I have to find ways to help these guys win heres McCollum he could be somebody that feels part of that scoring void without Lance Terry tonight averaging 12 and half a game shooting over 40 from downtown as Suare couldnt catch the pass meanwhile Brad brownells team has won four of its last five in the ACC theyre only loss so far this season to a very good Louisville team he feels like theyre coming off one of their best performances of the year in the win against Florida State well they just handled the ball so well Florida States going to do a lot of switching get out in the passing Lanes Clemson has legitimate Playmakers with the ball in their hand right now though it seems like the offense is a little fragmented struggling to get comfortable and sometimes you come two hours down the road this isnt an easy place to play frankly slow starts have plagued both of these teams at different times and in different ways this year another turnover is going to give it up to Ian shefflin who is averaging a double double reing most improved player in the ACC and the floater is good by Dylan Hunter big fan of what Dylan Hunter has turned him self into very much a role guy his offense also this season has turned a corner a lot more assertive with the basketball also shooting it a little bit better as well of a number of Clemson players returning home for this road game of Georgia Tech five to shoot again for GT George with one just beat the buzzer and now Georgia Tech 0 for six to start the the game been really impressed early with Clemson in their defensive discipline but the problem is they spend 30 seconds down on one side of the floor defending they come down and they shoot within the first four to 5 Seconds thats not what Brad Brownell wants he wants to grind you down it has not been a pretty opener late night midweek game both teams coming off big games over the weekend nobody got their nap in they needed a coffee with a double espresso like TL darn right six nothing lead for Clemson and a bit of a disjointed first five minutes here in Atlanta well be right back after Music this dear Clemson you have to protect the paint one of the best defenses in terms of threepoint defenses in the conference sometimes can struggle in inside the paint need to do a good job of that for against this Georgia Tech team that loves a lot of roll actions with Big Fellas trying to attack the rim and on the other side you have to battle on the boards Clemson terrific on the offensive glass especially Ian shefflin it looks like Georgia Tech is going to continue to do that they went bigger at the beginning of this game showing some dividends just not on the scoreboard again if just joining us no Lance Terry the leading scorer for Georgia Tech has five 20point games this season and they are certainly missing his offense to start as Dell Jones is Off the Mark in the rebound Ryan Matumbo Im not mad at that offensive set Dell Jones gets space gets right at that ACC logo nice move terrific pass great to kick McCollum and George cant hit Chase Hunter watch out come on man two hand Jam Welcome Home Chase Hunter the high school right down the road West Lake bringing a house down here early this is the danger zone right now for Georgia Tech 0 for eight to start the game well this is what Damon STM talked we cant start slow this is not what he was hoping for they found shots just havent been able to hit them theyve been good at home averaging over 75 points per game much better shooting wise across the board in this building but not to start in this one now 0 for nine great pass Hunter reloads and locking the rebound and is fouled by Duncan Powell about you get out in transition Mr Schumacher this is ridiculous we talked about Chase Hunter coming into this game he is a blur and then you dont get in front of him forget about it the man will soar above and beyond if hes not first team all ACCC at the end of this season somethings wrong with the voting situation somebody talk to somebody hes been spectacular all year long career highs across the board points field goal percentage threepoint percentage free throw percentage speaking of the devil no good I I like the offensive flow though Clemson settled down after the first four or five possessions moving the ball from side to side Georgia Tech though I mean really struggling to find any crease in this Clemson defense extremely active off the ball Damon stms team two and four in League Play coming off not close losses to Syracuse and SMU but theyve shown the ability to win games in this league and create offense you look at Boston College and Notre Dame they scored over 85 points in both of those mustaf is rejected at The Rim by Reeves Hunter will pull it Applause out great pass to his brother off the mark and the rebound by Dongo yet another good offensive possession draging comes across attacking Ryan Matumbo whos a little bit slow of foot that help has to come in finds the open shooter those are ones you have to knock down howwell gives Georgia Tech its first points of the game seven plus minutes in I love every everything about Duncan pal I love the game I love the ability to shoot I love the toughness and most of all I love the hair incredible too giving hope to guys like me more on that in a moment heres Reeves back out to Dylan Hunter and Clemson has not shot it well from downtown to start 0 for six for one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the conference this might be something small and its coming from a shooter Georgia Tech plays with an Adidas basketball and I love Adidas I love the product its very different from the Nike ball that most other teams in the conference use different feel takes a little bit to get used to CLS in a Nike School of course Jay sun on the pullup and the rebound Powell he was fouled by Dylan Hunter were going to learn how to would break out of shooting slumps using a uncommon basketball when we return in Atlanta after this players four of them on Clemsons team absolutely the hunter Brothers Ian sheflin and of course Chanty Wiggins who is becoming a star in his second year under Brad Brown L hes kind of been The X Factor chy Wiggins has played well this Clemson team and what theyre capable of I mean it changes their trajectory because he gives them a 610 playmaker who can knock down shots neither team has knocked down many five combined made shots on 26 attempts and that is picked off by Zachary and the ACC Steels leader gives Clemson an eightpoint lead hes been incredible last year for Clemson it was Joe Gerard Jaden Zachary has had the same impact as Joe Gerard but on the defensive into the floor hes been terrific and the reason Chase Hunter is having such a big year is because Jaden Zachary has let him fall into that role and hes so physically strong on this end of the floor an absolute problem mum off the B draws a foul missing out on a threepoint play opportunity but headed to the line he missed out on the opportunity I missed out on where the foul was tough drive to the basket McCullum theyre struggling to get some offense going I like the assertiveness McCullum a nice player first time I saw him he was playing at Sienna transfers to Oklahoma has a terrific season there and then comes back plays for fellow small guard Damon stmy this guy can score and if he gets going and you let a score get to the free throw line look for him to be aggressive the next three four possessions 20 points or more in three of his last five games meanwhile before you went to the last break you commented on the fact that this is a different basketball than at least Clemson is used to playing with given that theyre a Nike School Georgia Tech is an Adidas school did you ever deal with that when you were playing and if so how did you get around it well we whenever we came down to Georgia Tech they used to play with the rock which was a literal rock it had no tack no field Adidas they just feel different and the weight distribution is a lot different and it just takes a little bit to get used to AUM lob Jam for by Dongo you want to crawl back into this game start to gain some momentum get out and transition get some steals create turnovers get busy nice move got to finish there is a lid on the basket down on that endend Applause just a fourpoint game despite the fact that George Tech has shot just 15 from the floor to start this game better shrink the floor Powell draws a foul the yellow jackets are headed back to the free throw line you get out and transition youve struggled scoring in the half court get out and run excellent Advanced pass and McCullum throws it up to Dango he knows how to finish those terrific athlete in his own right all freshman team remember last year seeing some improvements in his game as Music Applause well so some people dont know this free throw shooter at the line Duncan pal his cousin is Julius pal who I played with at Clemson and he came up and told me this before the game and it all makes sense games very similar shooting three fours tough Dallas native though I mean hes been a welcome addition here at Georgia Tech Im a big fan of what he brings just from a physicality perspective as coach Damon STM called him a grinder Hunter to Zachary in the first three of the game for Clemson thats older player in Chase Hunter doing older player things he misses his first two from the right corner a little bit more patient attacks the paint knows where the helps coming from finds the open shooter at the 45 Jaden Zachary thats about as easy as they Applause get George responds with a three terrific pass by Javier McCullum driving at the help making them sink in I thought Chase Hunter came over a little bit too far doesnt matter Nice Shot Nate George Georgia Tech starting to find their offense a little bit after they began the game 0 for nine since gone three for five heres lockin and now Zachary with 10 pull up sheflin fighting for the rebound wins it back for the Tigers and flips it up and in you guys want toughness Ian sheins a tough dude Im convinced he could play tight end at the high major level its a strong man as he picks off that pass and flips it up to Zachary there have been discussions of sheflin joining the dbos Sweeney coach Clemson Tiger football team how serious those discussions are that is yet to be seen but your point is well taken I played against Jimmy Graham when he was at Miami pretty Applause Music similar Hunter stripped and fouled by Javen McCollum sixpoint lead for the Clemson Tigers Georgia Tech finally starting to find their offense a little bit in the half court nice pass McCullum Nate George two first names thats a three big time shot and then on the other side Clemson theyre going to have to out T you he and shefflin thats where he specializes up under offensive board forget it Clemson up Music six I like the way theyre moving the basketball its changing sides of the floor just havent been able to hit some of these easier shots 12 of their 17 points have come in the paint and out of the timeout Here Come the Tigers inside to lock in he had four early points they go right back to him and hes headed to the free throw line I love that Baseline out of bounds set locken catches it up at the top goes for a dribble hand off the Chanty Wiggins and then reestablishes himself in the post youll see it right here nice seal Suare you have to remain active even after the dribble handoff because if youre not moving your feet locking such a wide body and he gets such a wide base when posting up hard to get around him quick feet or you get beat its pretty simple second foul on Applause Suare an injury shortened Georgia Tech team foul trouble something they can ill afford tonight not a ton of depth a lot of injuries but Victor lockin over the last five games has slowed down a bit but still averaging over 10 points a game on the season I I think his versatility is so valued its not just about scoring with him its blocking shots on the defensive end coming down as a trailer ball handler on the perimeter at 7 ft such a matchup problem with the versatility and things he can do for your offense part of that slowdown could be attributed to the illness that hes been dealing with healthier now but he was sick as a dog in that stand game played excellent and then didnt play at all in the first half of their following game against Cal was held to zero points finally feel like theyre getting a healthy Victor Lock in back as the foul goes on Ian sheap 100 but it also comes down to being able to be scouted throughout the course of the season and obviously there was a lot of tape on him at Cincinnati but but Clemson in the Atlantic Coast Conference you know it plays a little bit different than the league he came from so you have to find different ways for him to be effective and by midseason guys figure it out mum from Music downtown and shaken up after the play is by Dongo who just motion to Tony Henderson did you not see that now Tony Henderson is headed under review for a flagrant foul monitor okay so Chase Hunter is trying to battle through a screen and I if you slow this down it could be looking a certain way I thought Chase was just trying to get through and he ends up going with the elbow I dont think this was an intentional thing I think he was trying to get around this is one of those when you slow it down its going to look a lot worse right I In the Heat of the Moment as fast as its moving I thought this was nothing and if youre B Dongo and youre setting a Down to a guy whos chasing you better tighten your core but all that being said if this is slowed down this is interesting Tony Henderson now looking at the tape with Brian oconnell our officials Tonight Tony Henderson Brian oconnell and Jerry heer and that was a pretty quick review I dont think I think this is much to do about nothing I think this is a guy trying to battle through a screen after Fu no flager foul call STS giant nothing burger with cheese hey Im serious about that if youre going to set a screen and theres a bigger physical guard thats going to go you need to protect yourself I to me like Chase is just trying to get through that screen again you slow it down you might be able to find something good no call by the officials Ive never had nothing Burger before doesnt taste too doesnt sound too appetizing Ive been on a diet for two weeks everything tastes like a nothing Burger fivepoint lead for Clemson heres Wiggins and hes blocked by Applause Dongo thats the type of effort coach STM has challenged his sophomore from sagol to play with on both sides of the floor and he wins a foul on Victor lockin and I would like to see a replay of this cuz to me this looked like a hook and hold youre going to see on the backside number 11 right there thats a hook and hold and Dongo Got Away With It third trip to the free throw line for Georgia Tech they are four for four so far tonight A team that has had the worst free throw percentage in the ACC since League Play Applause Music Applause began well Saturday a triple header mens college basketball Virginia Tech and Wake Forest in blackburg then Notre Dame and Syracuse followed by Cal in North Carolina State another great day of Hoops on the ACC Network and Georgia Tech is perfect from the foul line its an upside down World were living in right now keeping them in this game in which they started 0 for nine from the floor they Trail by three with less than seven minutes to go in the opening half and theyre finding offense theyre moving the basketball from side to side creating turnovers and Musta pays off the Ste onepoint game in Atlanta Jaden mustaf consens is top 75 player I thought he should have been ranked higher than that hes a bucket inside sheflin and he draws a foul I love it you get out in the passing Lanes youre starting to find your Rhythm a little bit mustaf physical on the perimeter cant happen you have to come off with some physicality if youre Chanty Wiggins but mustaf big fan of this young mans game hes gotten better as the seasons progressed father Jared mustaf big time player at Maryland was drafted in the 1990 NBA draft by the way second foul now on Duncan Powell to your point though about Jaden Musta theyve challenged him to look to score more and they need it tonight without Lance Terry their leading scorer sideline with a hand injury the first time I saw him play was playing for bu Williams on the Nike circuit and good size can shoot a little bit attacks the rim big strong physical kid I I think hes going to score a lot of points in a Georgia Tech uniform Ian chefin will check out and chefin battling a couple of different ailments tonight back a calf hes been a warrior this year for Brad Brownell and Dylan Hunter comes in for him the column Stripped by Zachary you cannot put that B in front of JD Music Applause Zach Zachary off the screen tried to flip it in the lock in last Touch by the Cincinnati transfer I thought oh theyre going to say its Clemson ball with 11 on the timer I like the aggressiveness trying to play through some contact Georgia Tech though we talked about Clemson defensive ability Georgia Tech playing physically on this end of the floor five to shoot Hunter deep three can it in could have been four Chase Hunter creating something when there is nothing that is the value of a first team all ACC level player just the second made three of the half by Applause Clemson Powell tried to drive it in to the chest of lockin and was stripped out of bounds Ive been impressed with lockin being able to stay in front did Clemson switch some and hes been able to stay in front of some guards and play pretty good defense I like Duncan Pals aggressiveness though and assertiveness here in the first half whenever he thinks he has a mismatch five to go for George trying to shake loose cannot picked again by Zachary Hunter left it short and now Applause Musta and a whistle on the entry pass in to Dongo its one you have to have I I am amazed at what Jaden Zachary is able to do because whenever he cross whenever guys cross over in front of him he is right in your lap the entire time were going to take a quick look at it you bring that ball in front of you forget it and hes so physical for the entire possession he makes it really hard to get any space Music Applause whatsoever first Miss of the night from the foul line for Georgia Tech fivepoint tiger lead less than five to go in the opening half lockin was fouled by Dongo one more and Clemson in the bonus for the rest of the half this games going to come down to who can create some easy buckets because right now Georgia Tech even though theyre thin missing some players with injuries theyve been really good on the defensive end of the floor disrupting Clemsons timing and then pushing their offense out a couple of feet locken for Applause three Powell no and the rebound Zachary oh great pass pick by McCollum pushing with numbers oh soft touch around the rim by the senior from Fort Meers Florida Ill tell you how sneaky that was I was directly behind Jaden Zachary didnt see mull coming over nice steal in transition and his change of pace and change of speed downright impressive and it has to be whenever youre outsized by pretty much everybody you play a big fan of McCullum and what hes capable Applause on threepoint Clemson lead less than four minutes to go in the opening half it has been back and forth Georgia Tech hanging in with the Music Tigers opportunity to mentor and Coach other young guards like Nate George Who as just a sophomore has been given the keys to running this program and who better to learn from if youre a recruit and youre trying to come up and come play at George attch and youre a point guard you see what hes done with Nate George and you talk to Damon Today George didnt have all that many options coming into college its really an interesting story he was between Seattle and Texas AM Corpus Christie was an unranked recruit but his uncle is an agent and called Damon stmy and said you got to take a look at my nephews tape Damon STM looked at it and said that it compared favorably against another guard that they were also considering offering they went with George and boy as it panned out in just a year and a half I think his willingness to adapt and learn has really improved his game and Damon stod he he coaches these guys are and but hes put George in position to have success with some of their offensive sets and schemes now hes got his hands full today cuz Jaden Zachary can go capital G G but what he does he gets him in spots to where theres double gaps and you can try to penetrate and as a result he finds places to draw more help he just hasnt had his way today for that for that matter not many players on the floor today have had their way to that seven Georgia Tech turnover the timing is a half second off for both teams and Im not sure what it is but this is where you have to score if youre Chanty Wiggins got to score and he does on the tap back and now you look at Georgia Techs lineup the four and the five are 68 and 69 the guards are smaller so when you play Chanty Wiggins in this game hes going to be able to draw some favorable matchups if Georgia Techs going to switch hes got to be able to score inside of eight feet Suare on the bench with three fouls he started this game another guy with some size on the bench with foul trouble mustaf spinning and draws a foul on Wiggins and that is number two from the sophomore from Grayson Georgia and I like this pass by Bango he draws the extra guy mustaf comes over and then there there is zero doubt in his mind what hes about to do with this basketball puts his head down attacks with aggressiveness and strength thats whenever youre able to draw fouls when attacking the rim you have to be the aggressor they said they always get the second guy especially when youre picking on somebody at school they always picking on your little brother right theyre going to get the second guy who reacts same thing applies here and with mustaf if he attacks first hes going to be able to get some of those calls around the rim just rimmed out that free throw attempt now seven for nine are the yellow jackets from the strike for what its worth I didnt pick on many people more talking yeah well you wouldnt hurt a fly thats exactly right Im a nice guy but I did have a little brother did you pick on him little heres lockin trying to pick on Dongo oh what a floater by the six 11 red shirt senior you know hes got a high center of gravity but he felt dong go trying to get physical with him spins off quickly able to regain his balance he is a big gangly but at the same time nice move collects himself nice finish tied for the largest lead of the night for Clemson and eight less than 10 to shoot for Georgia Tech George kick out three ball from the corner no good Powell shot clock did not reset and its a violation giving it back to the Tigers there are a few teams in this league that are really good at this part of defense and what that possession exhibited Clemsons good at it Louisvilles terrific at it pit is good at it and its that second guy that comes over and helps nice move better screen Victor lockin you can call a moving screen all you want nice job pushing his guy under theres a theme with those three teams you just mentioned were all in the top four in the conference 100 Georgia Tech in the midst of a 3minute scoring drought Clemson with its largest leate of the night at 10 final 68 seconds of the half when we return Music Music I Love the Way Clemson plays defense look at the activity away from the ball Zachary gets caught shefflin Extra Man help great job now George having to create something at the end of the clock look at Chase Hunter help secondary help you force a guy whos not comfortable in that right corner to be able to take a shot thats not necessarily something he does its not just guys like Jaden Zachary that beat you defensively for Clemson its the unit its the entire team its their activity and they are so good at that and like I said before the break its them its Louisville its pit all terrific in that Applause manner column ends the 3minute scoring drought with a pull up Jay now trying to defend Zachary back out for three got it from the left wing excellent pass good shot great screen by lockin on the backside thats not a drawn up play thats an older player realizing I can help my guy get that much more space for an open look Music colum off the bounce and there was a foul before the shot itll go against the Tigers and the second on Dylan Hunter will send McCollum back to the free throw line he could create can he off the bounds change of Direction Pace he can hit some difficult ones look weve talked about about it but theyre without OBrien theyre without Reeves theyre without Lance Terry tonight which was unexpected was a participant in their shoot around this afternoon and then was ruled out with a hand injury to his shooting arm this was a surprise to both of us CU we were getting shots up in between shoot around and my man was over there getting a small workout in I didnt think he was going to be out today but he is sorely needed because he settles this team down when things get erratic shot clock turned off for Zachary 10 to go in the final few seconds of the first half lock in with five double clutch Fade Away got it was that a dirk it sure looked like one what a move the seven footer From Russia with Love nice heres McCollum five to shoot double in the corner George with three step back three got it from downtown Big Time shot by Nate George they have to find some Rhythm offensively how about starting by hitting a tough one at the end of the shot clock and ball control too dont you think to is going to be important in this second half for a team that gave up 13 points off nine turnovers thats Georgia Tech in the first half but I mean how many times too nice defensive possession by Georgia Tech Suare coming over getting the block but how many times has Georgia Tech had to settle for tough jumpers at the end of the clock thats really the thing that scares you if youre a yellow jackets fan but got to find some way to move the basketball from side to side get that helps side moving for Clemson colum well that was altered by the outstretch arms of the 611 locking and that pass pitched out of bounds by Wiggins couple of things here I thought Chanty Wiggins first of all dont throw a no look pass in transition the next thing I I thought Chase Hunter he should have gone in for a layup right there have a twoonone break use your athleticism hunter in the first half seven points on two of seven shooting got better for Clemson at the end of the half but they still were just three of 10 from downtown one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the ACC good rebound Dongo and I like that offensive possession quick Boomerang pass back to Nate George who had a mismatch those are ones you have to Applause finish late help by Suare playing with three fouls theres been a couple plays today Chef hasnt looked like hes completely comfortable that shot right there looked like he was going to pull up and shoot the three its like he paused right at the middle that M back really bothering and hes also dealing with the cat and hes got that sleeve on his left leg and we saw him in the layup line coming out of the halftime locker room with extra treatment on his back sort of this heating vibrating Applause pad and Brad Brownell told us hes just so impressed by the toughness of Ian cheffin may not be scoring at the same clip but hes in there banging getting rebounds saw play for team curry in the under aror circuit he didnt even start for his a team but he brought value every time and Ill be honest I I missed I I thought Chef was a little undersized didnt have a ton of perimeter skill hes come to Clemson hes worked his tail off and the dude boards also has five assists tonight to lead all Clemson Tigers I like the pace though Georgia Tech coming down really getting downhill McCullum needs to be assertive early in the clock and if youre Georgia Tech you have to take the first best look because defensively Clemsons really on their ps and qs right now George through traffic counted in the foul Nice Shot look Nate George operating in a pick and roll theyre playing two on two Clemsons not helping all that much from the opposite corner but look at the move playing strong the late reach but this is a nice play theres not a lot of contact there nice play by Nate George able to finish up and over and youll notice on the opposite side where George gets most of his assists is when the help side comes over and he SW swings to that opposite a corner Clemson staying put not coming all the way over its taking away that lane its forcing him to be a little bit of a playmaker and creator for himself not something hes necessarily accustomed to all that Applause often T to shoot Powell defending sheff thats two strong humans right there banging bodies inside 10p dun po could easily be a tight end heads up oh Dongo cannot connect on the oneand jam behind the play Shuffle to lockin open three Zachary bang killer 10point Clemson lead an absolute killer you have a shot at a lob not able to convert vert fivepoint swing thats tough and in a game like this in particular where its been a crawl right like youre trying to find some offense you have that opportunity those are ones you have to have moff strong move and on one end you have a ball screen coming down Zachary limping a little bit nice move McCullum gets downhill throws it up little high sure you have to convert and as a result now you have a guy on the floor playing Five on four Im poet and didnt know it Corner three Jaden Music Zachary with those little plays around the rim youre at home youre struggling a little bit offensively youre trying to conjure up some energy for your team those are the ones you have to have keep an eye on Zachary here as Dell Jones comes on for the Boston College transfer still gripping at that leg on the Clemson bench meanwhile Georgia attack cuts it back to single Applause digits say this its dangerous Georgia Tech just hangs around right and when youre at home two threes can change the course of a game locking no shein the rebound and theres a foul in there Powell didnt like the call but its going against the yellow jackets and the second foul on Nate George how the worlds greatest hair dud you got to meet Ian shefflin further away from the goal you cant meet him at 8 feet because hes just going to force you under got to be strong starting out whenever he first attacks the offensive class cant wait Applause Music itll be Clemson basketball with 10 on the timer when we return an eightpoint lead for the Tigers looking for their fifth win in their last six Music games whats the inspiration behind the hair you feel me its a Dallas haircut you know Im losing a little bit up top a lot a bit but like he said he going to get some right here too can get it for real for real but now as the D takes haircut I take dat everywhere I go so you know its we got to get to some Gallas on the back Ive been trying to convince people that should be the next thing to give a guy like me like some some like help you know what I mean yeah its ridic the first thing he did whenever he came over to the interview he was so full of adrenaline he comes up and Palms my H bald head like a basket ball he goes good win baby and just smacks my head you do have a nice shaped head I appreciate that which is probably important given the fact that the games on the games on all right back to basketball back to basketball eightpoint lead for Clemson five to shoot Dell Jones cannot hit but Callum playing with a busted wheel and now theyre going to let him put his shoe back on and Nate George came out of the Georgia Tech huddle and lost his on that play I Ill say this about Dell Jones he plays sparingly his minutes have fluctuated up and down depending on the night but you see what makes him promising as a player in the future he reminds me a little bit of Rod Hall who played a Clemson about 10 years ago kind of the same aggressiveness assertiveness quickness quickness with the ball I think hes a better shooter but hes able to get where he wants with the ball in his hands he has good quickness uh very coachable hes going to be a nice player just sometimes when youre a freshman youre playing behind a sixyear senior in Chase Hunter you dont get that many minutes highly touted recruit top 15 for his position coming out of high school Nate George trying to slip free cant rebound Chase Hunter what a grab by the guard to sheflin back out to Hunter deep three nothing but net okay so you get a rebound you push the ball up one side of the floor gets to Ian shefflin right corner and then the ball moves all the way back around to the left side I I mean thats textbook from a coachs perspective Powell step through left hand how did that go down thats a strong individual and the thing I love about Duncan pow hes going to tell you about it he was telling sheflin about it all all the way down the floor back to a ninepoint game cheffin defended by Powell Hunter fouled on the take now who will it go against it will go against Nate George and that is number three on the sophomore point guard pass getting stuck up in the air but Chase Hunter bails you out and Im not sure it was on Nate George you see number one coming in from the corner strong side help oh he got him on the and thats thats a fair call I I would rather it be on him right now than Duncan pow well excuse me Nate George is third hes as important as a of a player as there is for George Tech Powell playing with two now Suare is going to come on Suare has three and picked up his third late in the first half again no Lance Terry tonight the leading score for Georgia Tech out with a hand injury and thats just inadvertent contact there locking tripping over Powell no foul either way were going to play on thats just two big men going for a rebound and and look you see the pressure by Clemson right now extending out into a full court manto man do you want to create a turnover Shore but more than anything youre just trying to continue slowing the pace of Georgia Tech conversely if Im Damon STM I want to pick up the pace in which Im running my offense a little bit too much dribbling and the guy with the ball in his hands hes going to have to be the guy to play with some speed it just feels like Georgia Tech just dribbles the air out of the ball and then they stand in hold and Clemsons defense can just sit right there waiting in position lot of shots late in the timer for Georgia Tech in the first half thats carried over now into the second half and its shrinking the game for a team thats down double Music digits somebodys got a cut Bing and if youre Jaden moff and youre guarding the guy in the far corner you have to slide over he looks like he might have fallen on Ian sheins foot but were going to take a look at this they double team locking in the post right here Loff goes away stay in the paint right there I know youre injured and if nothing else youre injured burn a foul dont let him get his arms above his head young man looks like hes in a good amount of pain so in a team thats already ravaged by injuries no Reeves no OBrien no Lance Terry tonight they have struggled to put together a full Squad to practice let alone have a deep bench in a game Hay Reeves obviously is a scorer Luc o Brian is somebody that Clemson told us they looked at a little bit while he was in the portal because of his shooting ability coming out of Colorado and then of course Lance Terry weve talked about this teams leading score and a great threepoint shooter out again tonight kaisey Reeves right there in the middle of your picture and then Luke OBrien to your right and I I really think they miss both of those guys a lot Reeves for a shooting ability a spurt ability if you will and then OBrian is kind of a connective piece he played on a Colorado team last season that had three NBA draft picks on it made the NCAA tournament kind of a guy that whenever he grabs the ball or catches a pass everybody takes a deep breath Im not sure Georgia Tech has that besides him on this roster uh theyre really missing those two big jumbo Wings not just offensively but defensive defensively as well obviously well they just walked Jaden mustaf back to the locker room so we will keep an eye on that for Georgia Tech under 10 to shoot again for the yellow jackets Dongo tries a three not his strong suit cans it anyway but but capable right on the season hasnt taken all that many capable threepoint shooter Im not mad at those slow contest now that hes made one though you got to get out there put a hand up battling with shefflin in the Applause post five to shoot Del Jones step back I dont like it I dont like it into the clock attack the rim step back jumper is probably not something Brad Brownell is going to be all that happy with you have the quickness to get somewhere get somewhere B Dango though its not a bad looking shot McCullum nice pass to the opposite side and Victor locking I understand like he he doesnt take many hasnt hit a ton but at least get out there and put a hand up on the closeup can Georgia Tech go on a little run here still shooting just 33 from the floor well below their average at home team that has averaged 75 points per game in this building Georgia Techs so stagnant theres not a whole lot of player movement one guy cutting everybody else just spotting up and and when that happens guys just sit in their lap how much do you attribute that to Lance absence I I think some because hes a guy that they relied upon when that ball gets swung out an opportunistic score and a high percentage guy they need that good pass lock it wide open and a foul on Clemson Dylan hunter that is his third 10point game at mamish Pavilion here in Atlanta Georgia Tech trying to battle and snap a two game skill Music hes terrific hes hes head pit playing really well the other guys you got Hunter Salis whos playing well you have RJ Davis whos been a little more down than up this season especially from a percentage standpoint I I I I just like what hes been able to do and Im talking about low for pit in a team thats projected to be in the NCAA tournament after they got snubbed in their eyes last year 2 win season 9 n against q1 and Q2 teams right now the metrics like them they are in tournament field along with four other ACC teams including Clemson right now five projected Wake Forest has to do well in the conference play good defense by Ian Sheffer Applause you know Wake Forest has to really put together a nice conference play if he would have shot that it would have made me blush and I used to shoot him deep Applause Matt steady drives into the teeth extra pass locking back inside sheelin and puts it in off the window hey Duncan Pals a strong man Ian shefflin talk about widebody Jones man is strong as well he threw that to the Moon there was no way that was going to work tell us how you really feel well I I like the aggressiveness the early clock offense for Georgia Tech be now theyre theyre showing Pace right this is the best offensive possession Ive seen from Georgia Tech in four or five minutes and good defense tough shot thats hard but at least the ball changed sides of the floor right its been very very much at the top of the key for Georgia Tech trying to create something late and thats not a recipe for Success against a team whos good on help side now some trapping here from Georgia Tech and trying to shorten the shot clock for Clemson about Ian shefflin though having to switch over on a guard big block and he takes off on the other end of the floor and he ends up with the bucket off a post seal B back and all Zachary seems to be all right after he went out with an apparent banged up leg now has a season High 17 but the difference in Pace between the offenses and a lot of that has to do with the amount of injuries Georgia Tech has but the cutting is just a lot faster for Clemson eight to shoot Powell third opportunity through contact no call Here Come the Tigers oh my goodness uh Georgia Tech was tired that I Im just going to be honest so thin so many injuries you could see the fatigue and the constant ball pressure and physicality of Clemson starting to wear on that a little bit have not seen Jaden mustaf come back after he went to the locker room meanwhile Wiggins hits a three and it forces a timeout by Damon STM well be back in 30 seconds from Atlanta 70 Clemson Applause Music run that guy the extra scorer if you will has Clemson up 17 has been Relentless in their pursuit of the basket so far tonight mat 26 to1 in the paint and youre starting to see the result of that relentlessness with the fatigue of the Georgia Tech players especially in the front Court they Georgia Techs only played six guys more than five minutes and you can see the wearing effect that is occurring with the yellow jackets so many injuries and whenever you have guys so Relentless getting into the painted area it makes it hard because that constant physicality is a problem Jayla McCullum started this half with 11 points still has 11 points meanwhile good news for Georgia Tech Jaden mustaf with the basketball back onto the floor and a travel is going to give it back to Clemson thats the 11th Georgia Tech turnover Applause Chanty Wiggins nice job pulled the chair out big fan of that move that was the only defensive play I had and then now Chanty travels because he gives the ball right back he cant run the Baseline of a dead ball so just not knowing any better Brownell is not happy with that that play aside he has been an X Factor for this Clemson team theyre 8 and0 when he scores in double figures beyond that Brad Brownell has challenged him since the start of his freshman year to play with more toughness more competitiveness were seeing that now in a sophomore season you know heres the thing with Chanty 610 can shoot it talk to people in NBA circles hes got a chance to play in the association because of those intangibles and he shoots the ball well whats his daily routine going to be is he going to be an assertive player every game or is he going to dis appear for two games at a time and then come back and have 15 its the everyday thing with Chanty Wiggins and I think to be honest with you Matt like as soon as that clicks hes going to be a problem because all the measurables are there the athleticism is there the touch from three is there and hes every bit of 610 other thing that impresses me about Wiggins he can defend multiple positions because of as his athleticism and hes stronger than he looks Applause Applause look at the for Zachary sheflin hits from downtown the player movement and the pace thats what sticks out more than anything in Clemson because theyre an older team theres not a player on the floor thats not a senior excuse me Chanty Wiggins is a junior everybodys a junior senior or sixyear senior thats what you get in college basketball right now and because of that they play so well together and I like that possession by Georgia Tech finally able to take the lid off the ground that is just the fifth made three of the game for Georgia Tech theyre shooting just a tick above 30 from the floor and were going to have a whistle off the ball Music and it will go against Jaden mustaf and we will take the break with him a 16point Clemson lead trying to hang on and come away with their sixth ACC Music Victory hoping for a quick and to those fires and the speedy recovery in so many communities that have been completely devastated meanwhile back here in Atlanta Clemson is led by as many as 19 Georgia Tech hanging around but there is wagin rolling to the cup with a twoand jam what a pass by Victor lockin back door puts it where only johy Wiggins can get it easy flush Music dong go good help side defended yeah really well defended empty side ball screen lock and reads it comes over vertical contest theyre able to get an easy one Dylan Hunter trying to get into that balanced scoring graphic 17 for Zachary thats a season High hes been good but that possession thats where this is just this is tough this is tough this is lack of depth these are guys getting tired Damon STM doing everything he can this is tough situation to be in as a coach so many players down well you said it only six have played more than 5 minutes and frankly in the second half it has been six players total because Ryan mutumbo we have not really seen since the first half thats picked off by Dongo three on two and mustaf has a chance at the n one nice play Jaden mustaf The Freshman hes good in transition foot bothering him sure but the young man big physical body nice play be Dongo out in transition handling the rock I like it Jaden mustaf Big physical puts that ball up high gets the foul call Ian shefflin eats rebounds hes averaging a double double 13 and 10 today has 11 and seven to go along with six assists Dylan Hunter Applause sheflin with five and there was a foul underneath its going against Ibrahim Suare and thats number four on the red shirt freshman thats the relentlessness right continuing trying to post up Suare getting impatient as a younger player pushes out zero points four fouls Suare has got some athleticism its about refining his game right now lock spinning and draws two Im not sure who thats on but if you watch this play develop and thats going against Dongo and thats the second by Dango but I if youre Suare the younger player look at the inbounds play you have to jump to the basketball so look at guy with the ball 30 you have to jump to the basketball no one that screens coming and beat him to that spot so you dont get screened Victor loin setting his man up well but thats a young player not in the correct position as soon as the ball moves and thats the difference between freshman at the college level seniors at the college level when that Balls passed you have to move on the pass you cant just wait for the next uh next action to occur Applause johnon Wiggins moves his feet at 610 we talked about potential at the next level thats why good Music pass its just been that kind of night and theres been times through the course of this game Georgia Techs found those opportunities but its been struggling to really knock down some of these open Applause looks they cut it to a one possession game in the first half remember it was a onepoint game midway through the first half after they didnt score for the opening seven minutes but I think we are seeing fatigue play a real factor youve mentioned it a couple of times particularly in the second half Clemson playing with pace and rotating body as well thats great defense by Dongo wins it back here comes McCollum pops and rims it out rebound Dongo and the put back is Applause good 14point Georgia Tech deficit shade under five minutes to go in regulation Music Applause you cant leave the ball if youre guarding the basketball Dont Run Away you just gave Jaden Zachary a wide open look in the corner heres Nate George could they get it close to single digits before the under four timeout deep Music three heres its not just physically training its mentally draining too you get down you miss an open look what does Clemson do they just walk the ball down again and run you through a Long offensive set zero points in the last 330 but every possession youre going through so many different options George and a turnover the 13th of the night will give it back to Clemson and that look on the face of Nate George says it all these guys are worn out theyre banged up but theyre battling as Clemson leads 59 Music 45 get in uh I I feel like Pits firmly in the picture right now and then I Im going to be honest Matt I think smus just kind of hanging around and if they put together some nice wins throughout the course of the conference season possibility there too theres still a bubble team according to ESPNs Joe lonardi next four out first four out theyve sort of been covering in that group of eight for the last couple of weeks certainly theyll have opportunities as Hunter missfires but the tap by Zachary finally crowed by Music Powell Dongo nice move his 10th career double double and is fourth this season excellent patience by Dongo gets it in the middle nose helps coming not worried about Victor locking in the least tough Applause finish in the lock him howd Applause that crucial time right here next two possessions for Georgia Tech not going to say its the end all Beall but they need to find a bucket here Powell for three big shot cuts it to single digits thats what you needed to happen now it could get interesting if youre Georgia Tech you get a stop hit a three all of a sudden things get a little bit tighter for the Clemson faithful in tigertown good pass oh that is a dagger by shefflin snapping a 90 Georgia Tech run that is brutal nice play by Chase Hunter getting in the middle but prior to that Georgia Tech Nate George passes it out dunan pal thats a bucket gets them to single digits next play down though Chase Hunter to Ian sheflin and thats a killer Tigers up 12 closing out this one Music Applause well the Clemson Tigers with a win tonight are going to move into a tie with Louisville for second place in the ACC behind only Duke of course Louisvilles only loss this year was to Duke in the ACC opener and by the way they led by 14 in the first half against the Blue Devils I Im telling you guys what pack Kels done in year one has been fantastic and theyve done it with two SE season ending injuries to guys that were playing K Pryor and Corin Johnson and they were play they had two guys on roster that werent going to play the start to begin with so four guys four scholarship players out for the season Louisville just finds a way rooff draws a foul hes headed to the free throw line that lost to Duke for Louisville came on the heels of the prior injury it was still in December weve seen a totally different Louisville team theyve won won six or seven in a row now they in a row taken down pit theyve taken down Carolina they beat Florida State on the road they just beat Syracuse meanwhile Clemsons only loss is to Louisville on the road that was last Applause week very interesting jostling for position top four or five in this league right now thats exactly right its top four five in the way the league performed in the nonconference these teams down towards the bottom of the league and the standings cant lose those games for NCAA tournament seing because then theyre quad three losses right so and these teams get better I I I cant stand the net metrics the rankings all those things I think it takes a lot of context out of the selection process and it its made it really difficult for the ACC to land those seven eight bids on a given season Applause what would you like to see different theres probably a rrap sheet of things youd like to see different but anything that comes to mind Im sure it factors in a little bit but what the what a team does in the last 10 games we season well that was the argument that pit had last year thats right and teams get better throughout the course of the year and a league like the ACC outside of Clemson like relies on a lot of transfers a lot of young players that are going to get better throughout the course of the season so while theyre not going to be great in the first two months when youre figuring your team out the problem with the net is thats when your cake is banked before conference bre so it it it makes it so difficult to factor some of those things in if youre trying to tell me Georgia Techs not going to be a tougher R in February when they get healthy like you would be lying to me I dont like when people lie to me well look there were times in this game where it looked like it was going to go really sideways for Coach saom Myers Club theyve hung around this is not an easy out for Clemson by any means against an extremely shorthanded Georgia Tech team that has played six players since the start of the second half I mean Ryan Matumbo came in for a cup of coffee played five minutes got two boards and hasnt seen the floor since theyve played six guys three guys basically have not come out of the game 37 plus minutes they desperately need to get healthy and the problem is when they get healthy again theyre going to be difficult to play against and the net doesnt take that into consideration thats the problem I see in terms of potential postseason that shot mustaf gives Georgia Tech four players in double figures thats 12 for mustaf and a timeout makes it a ninepoint game with 459 to go one timeout left for Georgia attack th this has been the craziest game Ive called in the last couple of years because it feels like Clemsons up 30 points right because theyve just been so efficient in how theyre finding their shots they just havent knocked them down vice versa Georgia Tech is has made a lot of tough ones and kept it close that way you look at what this team did last year they beat four teams that made the NCAA tournament including this Clemson team yeah now they were healthier last year that was a big part of it and you wonder if Lance Terry plays in this game does he make up enough of a difference to make this you know a one or two possession game in the final minute rather than a ninepoint maybe not one guy in Lance Terry but you throw Ka reeds in there Luke OBrien those three make a significant difference and it also changes the way the games play yeah because then you dont have so many ball dominant guys who flourish with the ball in their hands you look at McCullum mustaf Nate George all those guys like to dribble the ball so you add those other pieces in that are more catch and shoot guys ball movers makes it easier uhoh that was lost by Wiggins and its going back to Georgia Tech and theres Lance Terry up out of his seat great defense out of the timeout by stmy and Im just going to call it like I see it thats a soft play by chony WIS you turn your back to the defense turn around square up up tighten that grip on that ball and you find the next guy dont dribble towards the Baseline do you need a three here if youre Georgia Tech oh thats picked by shefflin the one thing you couldnt have happen is turn the ball over and sheflin wins it back for Clemson he and and hes been grimacing the entire game almost the same way Damon stms grimacing right now because hes been in pain in his midback but hey theres your theres your tight end right there he just made winning play after winning play tonight well thats what I was getting to Georgia Tech Cuts it to nine who hits a three Ian she you need a stop at the end of the game to close this one out who gets a steal Ian sheffler so even though hes not 100 and hes visibly ailing with the tight back he has been outstanding despite those things 15 points seven boards six assists four Steals and a block for sheth and its almost like hes playing a little bit slower and its helping him right because hes seeing the G game so vividly just done a really nice job today less than full strength good pass inside to Dongo that was nice Georgia Tech still fighting here and Jaden Zachary is going to go to the foul line for a one and one and Suare has just fouled out for Georgia thats a nice move jav McCullum you wanted to see a little bit more of that throughout this game just getting into the Music lane say it you know Clemson defensively todays been in impressive just for their activity theyve stalled a lot of Georgia Tech actions Yellow Jackets just not healthy enough to really compete today and and we say all that its a ninepoint game so you have to applaud the grid of the guys that did get to play and there was a correction on that foul it goes against Duncan Powell he fouls out Suare remains in the game Clemson coming off of a stout defensive performance against Florida state held the seminal to 57 points Florida State significantly improved offensively this year dangerously athletic too that team you catch them on the wrong night always the case so Clemson will improve to 144 6 and one in League Play and that sets up a very interesting next game between the Tigers and the pit Panthers who have two losses in League Play after their loss on Saturday to Louisville and really you talk about bolstering a resume pit kind of needs this one in conference play after losing a couple opportunities like you said so incredibly important for both Applause teams Im a little shocked right there that Brownell has his hands on his hips wondering why his sixthe guard decided to go straight to the cup instead of pull it out you know what the crazy part is Chase hasnt had his typical game today three and N from the field a decent two of five from three but hey look I mean this is a game if youre a Clemson fan that youve learned to enjoy because theres going to be nights throughout conference play you have to win ugly and this game today hasnt always been pretty but they find a way they get just enough stops just enough plays towards the end of the game Brad Brown L told you something interesting today at shooter around he said were in the dog days right now at conference play this league is hard it doesnt matter who youre playing what the record is Clemson comes in they get an important win because of the fact that this would have been a Q3 loss EXA its a losing the Georgia Tech
