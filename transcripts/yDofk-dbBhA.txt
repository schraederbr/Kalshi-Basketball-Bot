Clemson this campus knows its football team is playing for a championship now though its about hoop and the hardwood were set to get things going control by Kentucky in the blue Alon Butler is their point guard and it is deafening in here Jackson Robinson he steps back for a three they can all shoot it and boy can that quiet a house man that will Qui a house quickly when Kentucky reloads they step back from that threepoint line youve got to take up the air space ke Clemson is number four Ian shefflin he is there Superstar Chase Hunter has been their goto guy he has the ball now Clemsons first three off to the right rebound Kentucky they will look to push its a pacing and spacing for Kentucky and that is their starting five and they will go 8 n maybe 10 Deep o puts up a three thats too strong Kentucky has shot below 30 from the 3point line the last two games they have to have a good shooting night on the road cheff line is a terrific passer Hunter just short and down to the ground goes Butler theyre going to keep it here looks like a foul on J Zachary oh they instead called on Butler for Kentucky Well Brad brells done an unbelievable job 272 wins here at Clemson the alltime winningest coach in the program I got a big fiveyear deal to stay even longer yeah no doubt that had his core Brad branell wants a team that will absolutely sit in the stance and guard you the entire possession Clemson one of the best in the country so far making you work on your offensive end they put you in a lot of Long offensive Music possessions Andrew Carr is long for Kentucky at 611 on awake Forest last year a whole bunch of transfers M major transfers whove made the transition to Big Time basketball and they have shined under Pope and his Applause plan theres Carr straight up good defense but he got him on the elbow on the shot Clemson will shoot too thats Victor Applause lockin if car the first foul on him and two free throws coming up for the Tigers right that Kentucky team is an an entire rebuild and the numbers arent blazing look at OTA o away 16 points last year at Oklahoma but Mark Pope and his staff they identified analytically who fits with how they want to play and man did they knock it out of the park in that area in his first year sure did and this guy at the free throw line another transfer locking came after three years at Cincinnati and his scoring has gone up considerably this season by almost three and a half points a game so hes a red shirt senior at 611 out of Russia both three throws good been a long day for the Tigers they had their shoot around at 730 a a yeah 14 hours before tip off thats a new one for me Williams a terrific passer up top for Kentucky hands it off to Butler they had an alleyoop set up and the shot goes up and it will count Lamont Butler doing a good job probing and instead of throwing the pass he threw it in the hoop youre going to see a lot of Zoom action by Kentucky not only this game but all season long that big right there Williams is so good at triggering the offense up top dribbling towards aside now you got different actions that come off of it Butler has really elevated his play this year Ravi finishing around the rim it was not his strength last year hes now shooting 62 from the twopoint part of the floor famous for the buzzer beater against FAU in the 2023 semifinals he converts the threepoint Applause Music Applause play Zachary who has the ball played at Boston College had 22 22 two in the ACC Tournament game as that one rolls around and out that was against Clemson after that Clemson went to the Elite 8 lamp is missed there by o shefflin big body blocked by Carr we had a good chance to talk with shefflin they know each other from the ACC and sheflin said Carr gives him a lot of PR well because car is 7t tall as good as shein is rather hes only 68 now hes a load especially from the waist down big old tree trunks for legs high IQ smart relies on angles and Carr had no business in the angle Department that time really well done by Carr Butler he took a block there by locking and down he went tough physical game that was the concern of Pope the physicality of Clemson take locking out of the game well Kentucky has shown early their ability to turn the corner and get downhill and theyre operating off of those dribble handoffs and coming right through the nail right down the middle of the lane with the ball and Brad brills guys are typically very good Ravi on ball defense heavy in the gaps taking those kind of plays away Christian Reeves red shirt sophore is huge 7 2 in tall he comes in locking to the bench they try to get it under the hoop they do and now Butler gets pinned but they get it out car will launch High arcing three too strong rebound underneath and therell be a foul Ami Williams went up for it how about the effort of Williams he was actually the play initiator Ravi he dribbled at Carr with a dribble handoff and as Carr rose up Williams fought to get inside position I think he was maybe the most important pickup for Mark Pope in the portal because he fits what pope wants as a fivan up top in that offense which means what wants to pass the ball yeah hes a hes a play starter play initiator as a post player very unique the averages a double double gets the first free throw to go 10 points 10 rebounds a game this is the second annual SEC ACC challenge Wednesday night ESPN how about a must seat mens double dip 715 Eastern 20 Carolina 10 Alabama and Chapel Hill they got some back news about their Superstar Latrell ritel and then its second rank Auburn and Duke at Cameron indor four top 20 teams two phenomenal games and if youre Duke I think thats a must win for them they have swung and Miss on their two most important games they are catching Auburn with that Maui hangover its a real deal will test the maturity of the Auburn Tigers sheflin finds Wiggins theyve done that twice to double sheflin this time Chanty Wiggins knocks it down when Wiggins scores Clemson is at their best Music Big Time blocked by Reeves and the height of Clemson early on has been a factor in this Music one and theres a block on the other side by Williams I see your height and Ill ra you one says Williams hes got 12 which leads the team its about two blocks a game always step back he got fouled hell shoot three and thats going to be the second on Reeds never never lose your balance and jump at a threepoint shooter watch sheflin get a piece of the paint he leads Clemson at four assists of ball game and Wiggins steps right in but then the next time down watch Williams hes s foot and goes up with his left paw on the right side the shot side of Reeves to take it away Music so early in this one locken has a foul hes on the bench Reeves now comes in and he has Applause two they look at it to make sure this was a threepoint attempt and he will away get three free throws first one rattles in gra you this kid o way hes the only wild cat thats been in double figures every single game so consistent hes kys be best athlete and he is a downhill driving forceful guard for Mark pop still zero left Oklahoma for a better nil deal and he was he was one of Porter mosers main guys last year Oklahoma by the way picked 15th in the SEC just won the battle for Atlanta thats how good the SEC has been in November the SEC at least according early to Joe lardy I know you love this the had how many teams from the 12 12 and LSU the first four out which would be 13 ridiculous depth right now for the SEC to start with Brandon Garrison who missed last game against Georgia State he wears 10 for Kentucky hes into the game now as Zachary rolls to the rim up misses and that was a rebound for Garrison he took it away from Applause Music shefin Butler boy he has learned to do that a prober and he finds the lane he really wraps that ball screen like a NASCAR cut coming off of it to get downhill Bam from the top jeffan knocks down a three he is only 22 on the year but he was 47 last year thats the number you have to pay attention Applause to Robinson fires that one is off grip rebound for Clemson three to tie it theres going to be a foul out top called against Lamont Butler fast start what youd expect buzzing crowd Little John its Kentucky 11 Clemson 8 ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball its presented by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires and most people used with that action Im not sure where it originated like everything else in basketball one guy use it everybody steals it its a common word right now on offense like to see Hunter get going a little ball fake there he cannot get it to go Foster with the rebound he puts it back up and in Miles Foster think about this miles Foster at Illinois State last year had 20 and 15 against Kentucky I know this is a completely different Kentucky team but hes got Good Vibes coming in absolutely right Kobe bre in number four a phenomenal shooter and so is kesa so the back court changes for a Kentucky youve got to battle in this game on the glass on both ends and Miles Foster does a really good job of getting inside hes a below the rim rebounder carves out space and just won his oneonone battle right there in front of the rim the fouls on Wiggins fourth foul for Clemson he comes out of the game and Zachary back in fourin blue is a no help off guy if youre Clemson hes the nations best threepoint shooter Garrison and Almanor now in the front court and Bria lost it a run out shefflin no good follow yes its Dropped In and just like that backto back offensive buckets for foster on the glass Clemson on top by one and how about it it will go to Clemson Pope cant believe it this is not rup Arena and this is not a neutral floor this the kuys first time to take their show on the road and this place is rocking especially in the first half very difficult rally for a coach to communicate his guys with play calls they have been waiting all day lined up Clemson for this one they bring Williams right back into the game Applause Music Applause four on the shot clock shefflin has to Fire gets his own rebound and its kept alive what a job by sheflin Hunter no hes been off to start this game early and Williams with a board there Clemson you got to get back and build a wall Kentucky wants to score early so far so good by the team in white P plays with an attitude when hes out there 77 in blue Brea calmly knocks down at three Ravi 61 right now as Kobe BR and hes got all the stuff man the side steps three the ball fakes hes a tough cover chefin no good heck of a job by and Almanor to block him out but the ball ends up once again in the hands of Miles Foster but that ball almost came to a dead stop in the paint because of the job that Almanor did blocking out rby why is Kobe BR the nations best threepoint shooter his feet are always on balance even on the step back threes he doesnt get rushed he shoots the ball with great Poise the second thing I love about his game the elbow is always under the ball on the shot side he doesnt bring it from the left side to the right side and the third part about it he has a really high release hes all up 67 getting that shot off against the longarm defender of Duke thats why he is the nations best threepoint shooter and the most coveted guy in the transfer portal last year as a shooter Mark pop said I told you guys all summer hes the most efficient player in college basketball he made 100 threes at almost a 50 clip at Dayton last season and hes doing it even better right now for Kentucky brya stays on the floor they bring car back in hes joined by Will O heres Carr big height advantage using that body gets all the way down underneath the basket Foster helped deflect it and it will stay with Kentucky boy that he musle his way into the paint yeah he is such a tough cover is Andrew Carr hes all of 611 and that time Kentucky imps out of side lets him go to work and to your point he just muscled his way to the right side of the rim the first shot didnt go but the dog determination to St after it foul called against Foster thats his first and Andrew Carr will shoot to the SEC player of the week week of the 18th he is a terrific threat inside and out missed the first on his official visit to Kentucky his plane got canceled and Mark Pope drove himself 2 and 1 half hours to pick up Andrew Carr saying that you are a must get for my offensive system hes missed every shot he has taken so far tonight including the free Thro just into the game and kerr CA takes down lockin that midcourt theyre both back up on their feet this is Kerr crees kind of game on the road in a hot building Carr trying to get one to drop he does its a three and thats the inside outside game of Andrew Carr lets go now he had a huge n against Duke went for 18 10 three assists thats the versatility of Kentucky Zoom offense this time they put Carr up top he got to take away his air yeah Hunter thats what he does better than anybody on this team he knocks it down hes got over 23es to start the Music season Williams loves to go to his left and they took advantage of that by picking the pocket bad pass it was behind the trailer Dylan Hunter and out of bounds good battle so far this challenge dominated by smus coach by Rett Lashley whos done one heck of a job there I was Rett lashleys PE coach when he was in the seventh grade so my heart a little bit is tilted towards SMU just a little so you did the jump roping and the presidual fitness test and all that stuff of Lashley I was an ad at a high school and we needed somebody to fill in in for a semester over the seventh grade boys PE I rais my hand Jones picks up the foul Bene points 73 in favor of Clemson Second Chance points Clemson six thats miles Foster and Kentucky one couple of fouls each on Butler and Reeves on the other side Williams thats a little low and he missed it Carr with the offensive rebound he cant get it to go Carr got rushed and he shot that ball before his shoulders were squ up yeah Clemson five offensive rebounds already in this game now locking stuck with the ball nobody was moving for him and Foster working down low against Carr giv up about five Ines C came to double that left Jones open his shot too strong blocking with the offensive board tipped away good hands that time by Williams and Williams didnt box off the first time but he comes around with a reach around behind the punch Applause out foul underneath against Clemson Dylan Hunter he had ball then the body got in the way OA o rabi is such a physical guy for Kentucky on both ends of the floor and in this league you have to have a defensive Thumper and every football team has one in the SEC and you got to have him now the hardwood and egga O is Mark Popes defensive Thumper he sets the tone hes physical on the ball he fights through screens big broad shoulders on this kid 64 215 out of Newark New Jersey by way of Oklahoma got more field goals than anybody on the team shooting 57 from the field knocks down that first free throw the length of Kentucky defensively for Mark Pope is very important in this ball game why Clemson is sixth in the country right now in terms of how much they play through the post their post usage is in the top 10 that Kentucky length has to be physical and long when that ball gets inside cats by five always got Applause four rocking thought about it got Carr to move be a foul out top theyre going to get it on Carr Jimmy Thursday night we focus on the womens SC AC Challenge Game 7 Eastern Time ESPN 2 as Old Miss and NC State and how about the double header on ESPN number four Texas number 10 Notre Dame number eight Duke and number three South Carolina well South Carolina has already been knocked around a little bit that thing is wide open this year year theres 8 n 10 legit national championship teams this year where last year was all about South Carolina and da Staley yeah bit of a surprising loss that they suffered Dell Jones looked like he got away with a walk really tough shot oh shefin as the shot clock went to zero he knocked it in well the chef can start cooking at any second hes only 68 but his understanding the fundamentals and how to free himself up hes being guard by a sevenfooter Garrison is pretty long and sheins going to Pivot out of it and pivot away from the pressure you go back and watch the last three or four ball games he will make two or three of these per game his understanding and ability Ravi to get shots up against link is a really big deal for Shufflin this season meantime Jones Goes to the bench with his second foul hes being used to sort of slow down the Kentucky attack and he fou pra yeah he goes to the bench well hes the Jammer hes the Jammer in the back court but you cant jam and defend and foul shefley no that would have sent this place again off of its seat Garrison Big Time height Advantage backs his body in thats an offensive foul Jaden Zachary planted his feet he got knocked right out of this building Jaden Zachary is a brad Brownell kind of guy hes in a bad mismatch but hes going to win the mismatch by staying low and strong and wide and Garrison bam finally just loses his patience and goes right through Zachary thats a big time defensive play by Zachary jeffin finds Zachary on the Baseline he works in the paint denied Big Time block oh what an effort there by Jackson Robinson Jackson Robinson has started to hold his own on the defensive end wasnt so much the first couple of games or last year at BYU but hes learning to fight and Zacharys trying to win the battle again as the lower guy on the offensive end and Robinson just eats him up and then great awareness by two in blue kys Gone without a field goal for almost three minutes Applause theyre down to five on the shot clock o met by sheflin and he did a good job going straight up theyre over three minutes without a field goal a high pass from Hunters CAU Music Applause fading away thats a tough shot nice touch Chase Hunter and all triggered by sheffeld up top that Tribble handoff guards getting downhill through the elbow through the nail it is a problem Chase Hunters first two Almanor no good Garrison the offensive Applause rebound too strong CA offensive rebound he lost it Wiggins he went to jam it down Garrison got him on the arm and a chance for Clemson to go ahead with two free throws the energy level of Clemson is off the charts right now on their home floor and theres shefflin hes a play initiator he pops to relieve the pressure and then you have to make some hard guarded shots outside the lane in a game like this and Chase Hunter just got two points for Brad Bernell making something really out of nothing Garrison now has two fouls in what has been exactly what pope thought it would be a very physical game and it looks like with two fouls Lamont Butler is going to come back in the point guard for Kentucky things have really kind of ground to a halt without him on the Applause floor Wiggins now has four Music points he bring Butler back in along with Williams both teams have good depth and and both coaches not afraid to throw throw their eighth nth guy out there in a high level game where are you on the with two fouls you sit the guy the entire first half or do you play him I I its its always a gut call I think unless youre a guy just draws a line and says this is who I am but right its a gut call and this kid on the line man he looks apart does he not all up 610 good shoulders but hes got to be more than just a feet set jump shooter for Clemson this year hes got to battle on the boards hes got to talk defensively some dirty work I think the way the coach put it affect the stat sheet in a number of ways yeah Jaden Zachary said he got a elbow from Butler no call Butler look at sh boy he ripped that off from the rim they got numbers shefflin will fire cant find it Kentucky with three high level Defenders Butler and O were two of them that got back and stopped the ball Williams a former defensive play youre out of his league as well chefin one of four from three Kentucky misses one of their own now this is the pace that Clemson is an awful lot more comfortable playing we know KY is going to take 30 to 33 threepoint shots per game theyre Unapologetic about how many theyre going to take Hunter great dish shefin no good they will call the foul a little late whistle theyre going to get it on egga o away a timeout here thats his first Clem on top this place is love to cut with force and cut through contact the entire game and Kentucky again its worth mentioning backto back games now single digit makes in threepoint shooting below 30 thats going to be a tough number to overcome tonight if it continues no NCA division one team has averaged 35 or more threes since Savannah State put up about 39 back in 18 and 19 they want to get the ball over the half court in about 3 seconds seconds they want to shoot 30 35 threes a game I love the word you used Unapologetic yeah Clemson continues to jam that ball in the back court trying to slow Kentucky down Robinson slows things down off that good screen from Music Applause Williams cheffin thats a high arcing elbow shot comes up short another offensive rebound and a no look p pass that goes right to Kentucky Butler sees a lane throws it up and in pretty play Lamont Butler that is big time you talk about driving the ball right through trash right through a wall Butler so physical and strong very impressed how he has become a much better finisher this year at Kentucky 100 no question hes got seven theres a pick away yes pick it right away from Hunter and off that timeout Kentucky has gone on on a roll they got six in a row at Kentucky theyre singing oh away oh away away way man he has been so good on both ends of the floor early for the Wildcats 6 minutes to go Kentucky by three sheflin shoots again hes been ice cold and hes frustrated with himself right now o strong physical uses the window offense by Kentucky man theyre operating off that secondary break high ball screen and letting their guards turn the corner and big blue nations in the house and they rise to their feet six players for Kentucky currently averaging double figures through seven games six of them theyve had four different leading scorers through seven and Zachary whos had his head whacked a few times knocks that one down and every mistake is being capitalized on by the other team right away again little too strong that time really good defense and a physical game no Applause Music whistle shefflin is two of 10 from the floor locking and he had a layup and he went all the way to the other side with oay on the ground boy Clemson will post up and they will not chase the ball when the balls in flight to them they continue to back up and post up low and strong very similar to what I saw saw from Gonzaga in Atlant CA no good no call Clemson tries to grab the lead again Hunter too strong oh theres sheflin little twoman game between four and one in white Hunter step back Clemson has been really really cold from three now four for 13 Robinson the floater thats way off very thats a bad shot by Robinson man off balance a little bit of a runner early in the shot clock they leave lockin loose ball the hunter tipped off the fingertips by CA the score in the pace favors Clemson considering Kentucky has out of their seven games four times theyve gone over a 100 Clemson doesnt have that type of offensive fire Applause four on the shot clock locken throws it up and in Clemson on top there it is again those physical posts up by Clemson they get their backside on you and they keep it on you until theyve secured that ball you can hear how loud it is and you can feel how tired these guys are banging against each other for the majority of this first half very physical contest you can be tired you cant play tired not in this game theres some action out top Breo with 4 seconds will drive and thats denied terrific play by Chanty Wiggins Zachary dagger whoa the energy and the fight level of Clemson has him right now on a 10 run the physicality inside to post up and bang first of all by locken but then you talk about a team that just continues to be dog tough inside and outside and to cap off that 10 run our guy Zachary at Brad Brownell ravy for some big time highprofile wins and say hey dont forget about us just yet major opportunities tomorrow night with North Carolina and Duke on their home floor and Clemsons got one right now you lead a team last year for the second time in the schools history and the first time in 44 years how of the last three minutes play out here in whats been a very tight game they get it down low Almanor boy he switched to his left hand avoided a block and laid it in what a tough shot I mean Clemson was hugged up on the weak side that should never happen youve got to load to the ball Ravi when kuy run their action on the outside third Chaffin working on Williams tough guy to work on given the height now t on the shot clock and its lockin works his way into the paint ball knocked away good defense Almanor Robinson to the ra hes blocked by lockin another shot that wont work in this game by Robinson the athletes are too good and too long Clemson has five first half Applause blocks Almanor lock and he came over you could see him from our angle he worked right behind Almanor who never saw him and it was an easy Applause Music Applause block Victor lockin is 611 and after that work he did at Cincinnati he actually was married this fall wife Julie celosi former volleyball player tough pass went right by brup and off the fingertips of CA I talked about it again this is the first time for Kentucky to be on the road in a brutal hostile loud environment and the communication Ive been there before as a coach in the first half very difficult to talk to your guys offensively not an excuse Everybody Plays through it but this is the first time for Kentucky this year five turnovers in the game they had to make some halftime adjustments against Duke and that comeback win Applause Music Applause Che puts up the jump hook and a friendly roll here at Little John and finally the ball Falls for him he just has a knack talking about Shufflin only 68 over a sevenfooter Williams got off his feet another turnover for Kentucky thats a half dozen and now a foul Williams Kentucky has lost their composure a little bit on their offensive event Jackson Robinson has fired up a couple of mishaps that time Williams trying to make a play thats just not there no his first in Kentucky ninth his first half its interesting the pace of the play does Clemson want to keep it a tractor pull in the 60s I dont think so and Brad branell talking to us today he said Im not going to tell you exactly where I want the number to be Im going to see how the G game plays out theyre tracking right now 70 or more man thats a really good sign early for for Clemson well they missed a free throw there did Zachary were at a minute to go in half number Applause one Almanor will take the three no good Kentucky four of 13 from three a hanging shot no oh he missed an easy one cheffin keeps battling out of bounds off Kentucky hes now into double digits for rebounds is sheflin and he is working his tail off and R he is a below the rim rebound guy and those kind of guys just wear your tail in out with maximum effort hes all ACC motor guy if you put a team together and probably the captain he was a baseball pitcher a high school quarterback he stopped playing both right around ninth grade he didnt like being outside yeah how about that first guy Ive ever known this set to cold elements let me get inside play hoop got an older brother too not as tall as sheflin hes there battling again what a fight and that is that is Ian shefflin personified look at him yeah if you think you play hard watch the highlight film of this kid Ian sheff because is a whole another level that you can go to as a player and just the effort the big valentine that four plays with and PJ Hall and he last year was just a monster in the high low game Joe Gerard was a terrific shooter got him to the lead eight but he is the heartbeat the pulse the vibe the tone Setter of this Clemson Team without a doubt next point for him well give him a double double hes got 12 rebounds and nine points on three of 13 shooting Applause but there are certain guys made for a stage like this a game like this you can tell hes loving every part of it simple aint easy and everything he does on the court is simple stuff but he does it at such a high level thats extremely difficult theres Brilliance in his Simplicity about a sixsecond difference between the shot clock and whats left in the half Hunter spins fades and hits it Kentucky will push down seven with five seconds to go in the half ceso will launch no good and shefflin picks up his 13th rebound of the first half it is wild here 13 rebounds in the first half the game Begins for Kentucky when the balls on the glass in this second half Clemson with 13 offensive rebounds Ravi Kentucky only seven yeah you know one thing kuys done early this season passed the ball really well 21 assists for game they have three assists tonight Butler missed some time with foul trouble hes back they set up o and thats an assist for Butler and a welldesigned play out of the break Big Time F and a great hard cut to fill that corner Kentucky knew exactly where they were going coming out of the halftime timeout and how about it in the first minute here Butler picks up another foul which gives a smirk to the face of Mark Pope Kentucky ride on Pace theyve taken 15 threes in this game they come in averaging 3 threepoint attempts a game if youre Clemson youve got to stay in the airace and make Kentucky beat you from the twopoint part of the floor theyve done a good job on chasing Hunter only four Music points he averages almost 16 and 1 half a game pretty spin move in the base line count it thean shefflin now a double double and try to complete a threepoint play its hard to guard Relentless its its hard to guard tasty its hard to guard a DA WG dog and thats what this kid is man he just went right right at a former twotime Defensive Player of the Year Williams just refusing to be denied in this game so far as Ian shefflin too strong there with shefflin Williams foul was his second Clemson sixpoint lead for Clemson sorry R Clemson continues to jam that ball in the back court every time they get a chance to slow Kentucky down theyre playing Five Defenders and 9000 in the stands Carr locken came over for a block Williams will get it to Applause drop be a smart play by locking not to try to block that one pick up another foul heed it heed that Applause whistle on the floor reminder this weekends college football lineup the championship games Friday night its 800 eastern time toan and army Saturday noon ABC Iowa State Arizona State the big one that has everybody a you want to watch Georgia Texas the meaningful one perhaps is Clemson and SMU and certainly for Clemson a win gets them into the playoffs and they got a gift and now theyre going to try Doo Sweeney and Company to take advantage of it well its college basketball all week and then our eyes go back to college football on the weekend this the opening night of the SEC ACC challenge the SEC has been Magnificent the first five weeks of the season and the accs got a chance to say hey dont dont forget about us and it starts tonight right here with Clemson in Kentucky good job to keep that ball alive Here Comes Kentucky Butler dumps it off we got a chance for three theyll count it as o will go to the free throw line Rey what an unselfish smart play though by Butler to give that thing up cuz he could have forced it right through the chest of the defender but a late drop off and look at that Kentucky Run game Jackson Robinson in the middle of the floor with a pass ahead right there Butler could have gone through the chest as city gives it up to oay who draws a contact as hes leaving the floor thats an n one as hes trying to go up and down missed a free throw and it will be Clemson basketball awaya 13 points lock into the bench with Applause Music Applause two foster knocks one down a rare three miles Foster he was huge last year against Kentucky and thats a pretty good close out just making a hard guarded shot from the corner hes got seven Great defensive Play Foster will have it really good job Chase Hunter seventh turnover for Kentucky theres a pick away Music not a surprise shefflin comes away with Applause it round and out for Zachary look at Butler push Ali hoop got it nice play Hes A Difference Maker when hes on the floor Lamont Butler now hes down on the floor and this is concerning Applause yeah Applause hter thats a good sign for Kentucky Butler walking it off and he just blew right past that Clemson jamming the ball in the back court right here theyre trying to jam him and you youve got to fight your way through thre that jam in the second half oh yeah came down and rolled that ankle no contact right there youve played ball youve all done Applause Music that so Butler they likely take off the sneaker and tape it up hes on the bench right now crease up back in for Kentucky and here comes Williams hell spell Garrison Applause Music Applause halfway down continues some cold shooting he was the unsung hero that a leite eight run last year shefman had 11 double doubles he averaged 14 nine in the tournament so well keep an eye now on kentys offense thats a good shot from o with Butler out of the game theyve now made four of their last four field goal attempts and thats that Zoom action that we talked about in the first half that time Kentucky drives the ball at three different guys very difficult to Music defend chef will try again that one is Applause Music short theyre going to get a foul against Clemson on the floor well take a timeout as we do shefflin just challenged and the good news after the timeout Lamont Butler addressed the the ankle hes back on the floor hell inbounds underneath the Applause basket a lot of contact and Williams threw it down into the basket that is a grown man basket because those are two big bodies man you talk about a body Blow That Was Won by Williams that was it Kentucky by one got good back door cut and from be h o denied Hunter the flush go back to the other end rabi the body blows that Amari Williams and shefin delivered each other legally and theres a lot of contact here and those are just two grown men man going at it and Mari Williams to your point actually shot the ball down hes all of seven feet and he goes to that right shoulder where Carr goes to the left shoulder pretty difficult Scout when kuys changing their Five Guys right in front of the rim couple of anal itics the analysis have Williams is arguably the best defensive player in all of college basketball hes right there with the best of them I know that and he he can get out and cover ball screens hes a great talker how about Chase Hunter at the free throw line hes had two games already this year Ravi that he has ran over five miles within the game they track that with something they wear inside the uniform but this is a kid thats durable and a massive amount of effort they pressure Butler in the back court with two Defenders def Robinson got the floater to go much better by Robinson I got on him in the first half cuz he was taking some Runners and floaters that time he gets in the paint plays off to really well done by Jackson Robinson so a little remember Kentucky in their win their last game shot 80 from twopoint land 80 theyre relying on the two tonight as Hunter the younger brother takes it to the rack Jackson Robinson tried to shortcut it and go under that screen is say was from behind the entire time pretty play by Butler again probing into that lane lays it up and in weve had 10 lead changes in this game Applause Music Applause Music o picks up another foul and a reminder this SEC ACC challenge tomorrow ACC Network undefeated Miami women 81 Vanderbilt 500 Eastern time then Mississippi State squares off against another undefeated Georgia Tech the mens side 915 Eastern Virginia Tech 7 and one Vandy that game is in blackburg its all on the ACC Network talking about the womens game about this Kentucky is one of two programs in the country that both their mens and womens team are unbeaten coming into tonight Tennessees the other one what a job that Kim Caldwell has done at Tennessee in her first year Kenny Brooks the same at Kentucky with that with that womens program thats going to be Kentucky basketball yeah and youre right and how about Rick Barnes Tennessee performance tonight well no surprise Tennessee sitting there as the number two defensive efficiency team in the country they absolutely give you nothing they are one of six teams this to start the night rabby that are inside the top 20 both offensive and defensive efficiency Clemson crowd thought that ball should have gone the other way Robinson extends that left arm to push off five on the shot clock as Garrison has it he checks the clock throws it up no good Robinson had a chance to tip it but it doesnt go lets go boys Li that Music time some pushing and shoving down low between Applause Wiggins and anley Almanor hes coming out car back in those Clemson post up theyre theyre so low and strong and physical they put fouls on your defense by how much pressure they put on the rim by posting up and its multiple guys weve seen lockin do it obviously sheflin different guys rotate in there but they all to they they all rotate in there with a Applause purpose shefflin out theyll probably use this 12 minute time out to get him the extra rest so he sits Music Applause five now on the shot clock hunter gets it to Wiggins hes going to have to fire oh the window Music Works Clemson by two and the windows in Little John might explode man is this place rocking theyve done a terrific job keeping frea in check making him Bounce It Carr working hard in the paint he got hit and he will shoot two free throws you have to cut through contact against Clemson and you got to get shots off through contact like Carr just did Im not sure Carr really liked to see that threepointer go in off the window so he went right back at Wiggins you that youre going to have to make some tough twos in this game youre going to be guarded hard and youre going to have to be hard to guard just like car was another forceful Drive weve seen by both Kentucky and Clemson neither team Rabbi backing down in a hot building one of the things that Mark Pope saw in Carr was his ability Jimmy to stack decisions very much reflective of the coach who was once a medical student at Columbia University and said I want to get back into the basketball thing likes his decision making on the floor tied at Applause 49 Wiggins oh he elevated before he let it go he was up well Kentucky switched off on him and Wiggins Under Pressure realized Ive got a height Advantage so instead of kicking it back out just elevates right over the top Wiggins in the double figures with 10 Carr stacking decisions the fade no good out of bounds off Williams good defense against Andrew Carr that time when chony Wiggins scores Clemsons really hard to beat he does a good job you see the switch off right here he recognizes I went from 610 to 63 guarding me keeps his patience keeps his Poise rise Rel is much closer with Clemson on top but theres a chance its SEC 9 ACC nothing before this game concludes I cant recall a more dominant start by a conference and what weve seen this year from the SEC again Joe lonardi projecting 12 teams as of right now and LSU won the first four Applause out no good for Jaden Zachary Auburn won Maui Oklahoma won Atlantis Florida one the events in Orlando kuys had a number of these 2 minute 40 45 second Windows where they havent scored theyre in the middle of another one now almost 3 minutes without a field goal they double them someones got to be open its Butler its good hes open because of the gravity ability of Brea he was tucked away in that far far Corner they didnt want to come off of Brea they were outnumbered on the backside Kentucky finds that backside bomb theyre back on top the runner no good shefflin came in whacked it out of bounds think about Butler and the transition hes making Jimmy at San Diego State he ran an offense that ranked 307th 268 262 and 267 in adjusted Tempo no doubt this is like a top five yeah but he is a winner is what he is at his core number one in blues who were talking about he was born Im pretty sure in a defensive stance thats how good he is watch out good pass there to car too strong Jackson Robinson caught it in the air and found his man in the Applause corner theyre laying off shefflin the take right by Carr and a frustrating night for Andrew Carr whos one of seven from the floor and just got left there in the dust Dell Jones is fearless man everything he does for a true freshman is 100 mph a top 65 guy out of high school according to ESPN hes got a gear now first couple of points Butler that would have been an ideal shot for for Brea but it was the hands of Jones deflected away theres the hands of Jones again good Hot Hands by Clemson defensively Butler knocked that out of bounds lets go back to kuys last threepoint shot I talked about the gravity ability of number four the top left look at Brea right there hes got too many guys concerned about him they forget about Butler up top sometimes the guy thats shooting 61 from the threepoint line is just as good of a weapon when the balls not in his hands because that gravity ability where he drags guys to him because of the shot threat Kentucky just brought four fresh bodies into the Applause game Applause Tigers Jones uses that speed again Hunter thats a tough shot hes going to get bailed out on a foul he get up in the air and then he made contact with the body of Kentucky now he got Robinson in a close out I I think Robinson may have lunged a little bit with a foot and gave up an angle opened up his hips its only one on Robinson as Dylan Hunter misses the first the younger brother of Chase he had a chance a handful of SEC schools including Kentucky wanted Dylan Hunter well Chase hunter in his sixth year right yeah at Clemson Dylan Hunter a junior Here both those guys have stayed loyal and true to Brad Brownell in the development under him as a head coach I just saw that Alabama North Carolina promo pop up in the corner when was the last time we talk about North Carolina not having a dominant inside game that is their downfall right now and that that ones hard to answer lack of personnel love their guard play Mark Sears and RJ Davis will go out it tomorrow night but that North Carolina inside game theyre going to have to grow up quick spoiled by Bott the last few no doub and a bot Burger we had last year about this time you love that Tennessee at North Carolina in the challenge I remember it well six on the shot clock oh away a lot of contact they call it on Hunter Chase Applause Hunter o will shoot too you mentioned Alabama how big an injury which well talk about in a second just watch the contact I dont think thats the right call I mean that that that Defender has a right to move laterally hes in a legal guarding position I I thought o way initiated the contact I was going to ask you about rils injury for Alabama thats a huge loss ritell down the stretch last year on the run to the final four was the best threepoint shooter that NATO put on the floor now they got a CR Chris youngl thats about to get eligible they could take up some slack leading score last year at South Florida Alabama expects him to be a 15 16 point guy when hes ready to roll CA misses and kuy struggles from three continue tough take Zachary how tough is Zachary I mean bulldog tough off Robinson quick three to answer no and shefflin rips another one thats how Kentucky plays hes got 15 rebounds oh he missed an easy one shefflin first chance no good boy keep an eye on that 5652 and physical play down the other Applause end johy Wiggins nearly bounced that ball into a technical but Roger SS held the Applause whistle rabby this building is intense o covers up the ball theres theres a lot of hands on the ball theres a lot of hands on his arm as well thats what you get though when youre the best athlete Kentucky has and the most physical driver hes going to get some favorable whistles D zero in blue will put a lot of fouls on the opponent this Music Applause Music year Wiggins will go to the bench with Music Applause three o now has 17 points it is 1120 local time at night and this is when college students are at their Peak and they have peaked right now with just 8 minutes ago my goodness how would you describe Jimmy Dykes at 1120 at night since weve been up since the 730 am shoot around locking yes sir the big fella knocks down a three hes got nine theyre going to call Williams Moving and he banged in a hunter here we go again at Little John Applause locking locking in from three times think about Auburn right now they already have four quad one wins and when Bruce Pearl plays Dylan Cardwell and Janai broom together man they are a monster the ACC is getting knocked around right now they can save a lot of face with a win over Kentucky and a win over Alabama and Auburn tomorrow night but man that is a steep hill to climb back here shefflin figured I got a smaller guy on me going to try to take advantage Butler a pushup thats good help from Zachary to knock it away and no give up by Zachary at all from behind he drives pretty play boy Jaden Zachary has made some tough Baskets at The Rim Ravi from the steel to the push by Zachary outstanding thats on Kentucky sure is no doubt Zachary may have just flipped this game I know they got the lead but watch the effort the massive effort by 11 and white to come from behind and swipe it and then he actually finishes off this possession driving right through three Kentucky jerseys 1 2 3 gets the finish and 10 seconds later he draws a charge man the toughness of this Clemson team has just jumped off the court and filled this building with noise its amazing too like Zachary wasnt here last year and hes the guy whos leading the chance of the 9000 how quickly we can adop players the same way they move schools we love Jaden Zachary shefflin three no way off the mark misses dont bother shefflin no clearly big test here for Kentucky down the stretch 6 and a half to go and they Trail by seven yeah and a travel on car Kentucky comes in undefeated I know they won on a neutral floor against Duke with this deal right here is different you can just feel the pressure and the intensity the energy right now that Clemsons playing with in his Force 12 turnovers and force is the right word Hunter a little too strong Williams with one arm was holding locking off while he used the left hand to rebound the basketball kys almost in the double bonus and Clemson I mean excuse me Clemsons almost in the double bonus and Clemson does a good job of defending their tails off without fouling only 16 fouls still by Brad brells guys keeping Kentucky off that line till late in the half big part of this game one of those scoring droughts for Kentucky theyve gone the last 433 without a field goal see what the bigger Williams can do deep in the paint right over shefflin yeah he took a pretty good hit but then he was able to adjust in midair and finished with that big left strong paw lari Williams with Applause Music Applause seven Zachary out of the corner thats way too strong and here comes Kentucky now to cut into this lead with a Chance oh Williams S shefflin one more time body to body no foul how about the job by Jackson Robinson big time by Jackson Robinson man a nose for the ball that shot came up short and Jackson Robinson just ate it up hes got 10 the lead for Clemson three Wiggins open three no ins o way a euro into traffic sheffet on the floor he and Williams in a good Applause battle possession arrow points Clemsons way watch Jackson robins and R his guy actually goes to double team Williams Chase Hunter did and as soon as he stepped up the floor he did not only impact the shot but he gave Jackson Robinson a free run as an offensive rebounder to the front of the rim they gamble by Hunter did not pay off 15 offensive rebounds for Clemson 12 for Kentucky basketball over the years we love you we know youre into this one 6158 Clemson on top of Kentucky he is a battler Dicky V texting him myself several time so many people praying for him and what a finish we have in store for us right now that the SEC has just knocked the AC around great set there and that sets up an easy one for Wiggins up until tonight Clemsons the one thats got a chance to pull off a big win and man that after timeout set you know it was going inside that is Brad Brownell at his core no good in a three Williams off his hands shefflin now has a career high in rebounds as Zachary absorbs the contact and gets it to Applause go Jaden Zachary 61 gr kid he doesnt shoot as well as Joe Gerard but man this kid is tough to take that space up from last years Elite eight run and to carry that momentum and toughness and fight and Kentucky theyve been negligent Ravi a handful of times in this second half Zachary has gone right through a very soft defensive wall in transition feels like he has 20 points it does he now has 11 and we got a love fest going on right now between the folks at Little John Clemson fans and Jaden Zachary this building tonights as good as youre going to find in college ball I am wowed by it the SEC has clinched the challenge already but what a statement Clemson has a chance to make tonight Robinson tough shot again coming off that Zoom dribble handoff NASCAR turn the corner and get downhill action I Like It by Kentucky not being a finesse jump shooting team down on the road with under four to go Robinson double figures hes got Applause Music 12 great bounce pass contested at The Rim Carr clean Applause block wow deflected Away by Hunter like a defensive back hoping to see that Saturday night maybe a touchdown prevention play Hunter knocked the football out of bounds a massive truckload of effort really both teams have played with this one Im talking about with Jackson Robinson he turns that corner makes a sharp Uturn with the ball and gets to the right side what a finish we got in Clemson Tucky to show were not hitting threes we can come back in a hostile environment win the close ones no doubt Ravi the the notes on our table right now my notes are literally moving shaking yeah thats this entire Little John Arena right now theyve got Kentucky down six for 320 to go go you got to go with his back dribble hell rise and fire if you dont they got five on the shot clock Williams Baseline against shefflin up and in good job because hes actually underneath the backboard R he had to get back in front of it to find an angle just a hard fought basket by Williams Bon scoring hes got nine Applause Music Applause shefflin needs one too strong followed it and theyre going to call it just out of bounds off Clemson shefflin has missed 15 shots in this game5 but he has not been offensive sensitive for one second you cannot play harder than forign white has played and the jump shots not falling what a lesson for a lot of folks watching this game right now as a player when Hall and Gerard and Godfrey and Clark moved on there were some serious questions about where this Clemson program would go a Boise State slip up one four in a row and what a chance for a statement here in the last 230 where just Kentucky go with the ball you like being able to go inside on the road and get some tough twos we know kys got multiple threepoint Shooters on the floor as well Williams hands it off to O who ran away and its going to stay Kentucky basketball only six on the shot clock really good defense by Clemson to blow up any of that dribble at handoff action here Clemson you do not foul right now with a short clock what does Kentucky do short clock out of bounds play drive it Go Butler fight good defense by Clemson they didnt have much Plan there coming out of that defense by Clemson shut off any Applause Drive shefflin denied Williams the long arm of the law there o who what a job by Butler o again no good and lockin pulls it down they had a couple of chances really good look for Kentucky and Brad branell now the sixth guy on the floor the point guard getting exactly what he wants these last couple of possessions Kentucky from threepoint land tonight Jimmy six of 24 thats a hard number to overcome s its a big big trip for Clemson locking with two with one no thats going to be a shot clock violation good job by Kentucky man when youve got to get a stop and your your Lifeline is on the line youve got to be able to lock people down and Kentucky did a good job just guarding the ball with tenacity well this crowds going to carry them the last 1 minute and 6 seconds and well let them Music it looks like Roger airs is over looking at something on the video monitor Lee Castle Bill comington the officials tonight make sure the game time correct confirmed confirmed making sure the game the game clock matches up with when that shot clock violation occurred you got 106 to go right now man some games just feel bigger than others and this one has had that feel an hour before tip when Kentucky comes to town they havent been here since what 1933 91 years this one had that big feel at 730 this morning when they were at their shoot around Clemson Rell says we got freshman we want to get into class let him take a nap during the afternoon and theyre ready for this challenge here with a minute to go leading by four Kentucky has to at least Ravi get to the free throw line on this possession Robinson all the way across Court oh away no good and wouldnt you know it shefflin rips down another one he has got 20 rebounds tonight Mark Popes going to play this thing out it is a must must stop for Kentucky this feels like an Oscar sheway type performance no doubt call by you 10 Music over Brad Brown now the whole crowd went silent when the whistle blew and you can hear the coach have a clean look as the inbounds guy but man if youre Kentucky you would love to run through one right now and get a run out Hunter tough defense he got push to and there is a whistle and thats an absolute foul the only thing if youre Kentucky you cant do man you came out of that timeout with 5 Seconds you got a guy taking a hard guarded two under pressure just the push off enough byga away to draw the foul still a two possession game even if he makes him Mo 20 seconds for Kentucky to work with 21 on the game clock Applause Music home seven points for Hunter tonight hes made all three of his free Applause throws game changers and Hunter now will try to increase the lead to six it feels like a Corp storm is about to break loose at close to midnight in Clemson South Applause Carolina branell wants to talk over his defense against a team thats desperate for a couple of Threes work hes going to extend his defense make Kentucky still work defend without fouling and stay outside that threepoint line if Kentucky makes a tough two so be it no threes right now and no fouls now there is a foul and that did not sit well with Brad Brownell at all they call it on Zachary which stops the clock Kentucky did the right thing though youve got to burn that pressure off with the ball with under 20 seconds to go and youre down six you cant mess around with it and dance with it and Butler just lowered his shoulder and and L lit L drug the officials into this game having to make that Applause call Butler is one of one from the stripe Applause tonight important Clemson has a timeout if they get in a troubl spot and Brad Brownell needs to make sure hes communicated that with his guys as you know the pressure is going to Applause come whose ball its going to its going to be Kentucky theyre going to look at it though the first initial call Kentucky basketball they go to the monitor see a couple of screens Jackson at 67 also a tall guy that can make guarded threes Here Comes Brea Jacksons the second guy around here comes again he didnt have it Robinson with 10 fires airball theyll get another chance Butler with three seconds to go gets it to go it cuts that lead to two but only 22 seconds left guarding with their life depending on it Pope tell Williams you run the entire way keep those arms up the ball is in and Hunter who gets fouled immediately and that will send Chase Hunter to the free throw line who while he hasnt shot well from the floor has done very well from the free throw line r it was an oldfashioned pick play Clemson put their two handlers if they wanted to have the ball at the at the Timeline at half court and kind of ran off of a moving pick to get the momentum coming downhill and a good job by Chase Hunter not to travel yeah 80 free throw shooter season four for four tonight no no timeouts left by Kentucky if theres a miss one will put him up by three two will win the game so if there is a miss and Kentucky comes down with a rebound they have the opportunity for probably no one dribble maybe two to fire one in Hunter is five for five this will be to win the game and knock off number four Kentucky Applause Music Applause Music Nails it little John will explode after 19 and there they go cover up Applause
