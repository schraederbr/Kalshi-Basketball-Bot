and Malik Renu at center floor start this ball game off tip controlled by the Hurricanes as Delaware State starting with a two3 zone Ive seen a lot of teams open up with the Hurricanes in the zone defense You know we spoke about that last game Teams are going to force University of Miami to shoot the basketball coming in Miami hasnt been really a a threepoint threat and its not because they dont have shooters Theyre not really taking the shots So looked at a lot of teams that start with Miami uh playing his own defense Thats a lot of the same if youve been watching Hurricanes basketball Malik Grenu in the paint and finishing over Miles Webb as now Delaware Delaware State will get their first offensive possession The Hurricane starting lineup a little different with Ernest Uday Jr out for a second straight game and Drew Washington out with a lower body injury as well He was phenomenal versus Elon 18 points and 10 rebounds He sits out for the first time this season as theres more A pullup Jay is good You know I like this lineup for University of Miami as they can switch a lot of things Look for them to switch pin down screens Look for them to switch ball screens If you have an athletic team everybody can guard one through five This is a very unique lineup for University of Miami Premier Moore the sixth year at his third school Gets the scoring going for Delaware State A nice cut from Henderson Cant finish Cant finish But you want to see guys cut to the basket when Lick has the basketball A lot of times when he has the ball down low teams are you know kind of trying to clutter him up Soon as you get an open cut you make that layup its an easy basket Pon Shames with the rock He was the hero against Division 3 Keen The 66 to 64 victory for Delaware State A gamewinning layup with 1 second to go Now six to shoot Delaware hasnt got the ball inside the threepoint line Moore sizing up Malvette deep three Misses the rim Hurricanes the other way You know thats what that does Like I said Miami is able to switch one through five If youre not ready for that youre not going to get really too many open shots You got to get in the paint get a paint touch look for your teammate Malvess first shot of the ball game is off the mark Obasogi tracks down the miss Miami making it tough for the Hornets to get even inside the threepoint line Miami switching a lot up top Saw that against Elon but the Phoenix were able to outplay Miami on their offensive end by hitting a lot of deep shots That pass goes out of bounds and Miami will get the ball No one do early substitution for Dante Allen who had his best game of his short Miami career to this point against Elon 14 points five rebounds and high three triples If you look at that quick substitution you know thats a learning experience for a young freshman Dante Allen and Jay getting his freshman and speaking to him on what he did wrong Delaware State showing a little half court pressure as well Its tie ball game here Nice find inside to Malik Renu and another finish over Renu Hes a tough check down low You know once he gets the ball down low and you dont collapse hes going to score against anybody oneonone leads Miami with 21 points a game at a game high 19 last time out but four turnovers wants to keep the ball in the right hands this time round three minutes in and Miami holds on to a 42 lead as James gets hounded by Donaldson theres a bump on Shelton Henderson and hes been great so far as a freshman Jack but the one area for concern is the foul trouble hes had multiple games with at least three and two with four fouls you know Shelton plays with a music lot of contact offensively and defensively As I said earlier as the season progressed hes going to be able to look at film and understand okay maybe I may not need to shy away from the contact so I dont get in foul trouble early Hes the University of Miami is going to need him down the line A wacky shot for Delaware State doesnt go and the Hurricanes are running fast And theres another finish from Renew Sixpoint paints from the Indiana transfer One thing about this University Miami basketball team theyre very very great in transition and look at him to get to transition to get easy baskets Theyre scoring just under 50 points a game in the paint Its one of the top totals nationally Obasogi no luck working on Renew Has to reset things The clock now under 10 for Delaware State Heres James now Lines up a three Rattles in and out No good Henderson with the board The freshman kicks out Doat Corner three Short I like that look in transition You know do is a great shooter You know transition threes are one of the best shots you can get in basketball especially if you got a shooter cuz nobody on defense can really identify where their man is Great shot Look for him to continue to shoot that basketball A pullup shot for Obasogi from 10 ft out is no good Nice defense by Renew getting the hand in the face Donaldson knives through the paint kicks out now Door another three Another miss as the ball goes out of bounds And Miami doing what theyve done all year long getting stops running in transition and scoring in the paint Kanes lead early against Delaware State 62 Kanes up 62 Jay Lucas in his first year at the helm for Miami after a lengthy career for Jim Larenega One of the best to do it not only for Miami in the ACC 41 so far Nice start for Jay Lucas whos passed all the tests hes expected to so far start the year Yeah great start for Jay Lucas Obviously you know at the beginning of the season with a brand new team expect to see a lot of changes Expect to see him make a lot of different movements but hes doing a great job leading this basketball team And talk about the future schedule for the Hurricanes what they have dialed up next with BYU either Dayton or Georgetown and Orlando and then a road game against Old Miss Theres a miss shot there from Marcus Allen for the first time today But all the coaches for all those programs have championship pedigrees Not only would a team be tested but Jay Lucas as well For sure You want to have somebody you can look to your and say You know what I trusted my coach And I think coach Jay Lucas has instilled that into his players to believe in him and trust him just as Jay Lucas believes and trust in his players Baseline floats A triple goes Its nine to2 Miami And Delaware State scoring ground of over four minutes now as we reach the 15minute mark in the first half Thats a great shot by Trey Donaldson You know if you if you watch University of Miami basketball you want to see him get going and shoot threes earlier You notice I said shoot threes not make threes Guys like that when he sees one go in hes going to continue to shoot the basketball Now Miles Web a triple try No Teo Malovitz tracks down the miss Hurricanes want to move fast and get the zone out of system and reach in foul as we were talking about just finding that soft spot and zone behind the arc For sure Find a soft spot Like I just said Trey Johnson hit a three just now His next play he was attacking the basket offensively because he saw the ball going I think thats really big for athletes to understand Shoot the three cuz if you make one it does something to your frequency your energy You get downhill you shoot another three But you got to shoot it to get to that phase At least 11 points in every game in a Hurricanes uniform And something thats improved upon in the short season so far is his passing He had 10 assists for StSon which is a careerhigh for him Marcus Allens been moving the paint now You know Trey is the ultimate point guard Hes a pass first point guard that can score and shoot the ball Thats the type of point guard that you want leading your team and an offensive foul Moore with the push off Henderson comes in to replace Donaldson On the other side Admar Santos getting his first burn of the night along with Mu Zabini Adamu The bigs in for Delaware State And that was the question mark They have a lot of skilled and experienced guards the Hornets do But can the bigs match up to Miami where theyve been so dominant this year Only time will tell I like how coach Jay Lens put Sheldon Henderson at the point as a different look Put Dante Allen off the ball Theres going to be a lot of different lineup that the team is going to use in the future You know you want to use a game like this to you know change up some lineups to see what you got when it goes to the future in March Well so far Delaware States defense has only allowed nine points in 6 minutes Thats a area where Miami has excelled so far this year A couple of triple digit totals in backtoback games against Pthu Cookman and Stson before the loss last Sunday against Florida But that test really showed that Miami could hang around with some of the best teams in the country Never mind the former national champion Yeah if you watch that game that University Miami basketball team was in that game I think they shot 48 from the free throw line Sheldon Henderson allowed early fouls And you know couple more free throws made couple less turnovers a couple less fouls You know Miami can come with a victory Theres Henderson using his physicality and athleticism to give Miami their largest lead of the afternoon Its 11 to2 Dat almost comes up with the ball Now its Ponch James the leading scoreer for the Hornets out of the MAK Conference Altunis gets a hand in there Now a kick out to Santos A three goes and that breaks the scoring drought of over five minutes Man when you break a scoring drought with three points man that does something for you Dorat shuffled in his feet as take a look Altunus gets his left hand but nice job by Pon James to regain the possession and keep that one alive and it ends up in a triple You know you look at Dra in that last three He missed his first two As a shooter he stepped into that shuffled his feet They called trout but this shows you he wasnt ready to shoot the basketball As a shooter you must take that next three because you never know That three goes in you get another one and another one He kind of shuffled his feet because he overthought about thinking that last one because he missed his first two Doat didnt play in the first couple of games due to an injury but now playing in his third as he chats with the referee right near us about what he did there But in your mind doesnt even matter if you shuffled or not just to pull up and get that confidence going to the ball and shoot it Can Delaware State string something together Zion Betheia guarded by affforementioned dovat Perkins a senior Delaware kicking it back out and theres a tip pass in the hands of Miami and a great switch of pace the other way its James Santos another three front rim no Miami continuing the transition offense will Dante Allen slow things down he will but not for long Henderson kicks back out one four How about Dante Allen The the ability to slow down find his spot set his feet let it fly Great play I mean that all started by a good paint touch by Dante Allen swinging to Shelton Henderson Shelton Henderson get Henderson gets a paint touch and then kicks the ball off That is the key to an open shot Getting a paint touch make the defense collapse and kick it back out to an open shooter Man Jay Lucas would love what youre saying right now Thats what he preaches to this team And a lot of the players they understand that They know that inside out offense gives you a lot of higher percentage opportunities outside of the arc Shot clock winding down Santos gets something up but well defended by the Hurricanes Grenu back in the game He has six points leads all scorers Goes inside and a turnover Now transition opportunity Santos Nice finish at the rim on the side Nice finish by Santos He came down a lot of shot had a lot of offbalance shot Came in strong got a layup How about even stronger Shelton Henderson embracing the contact Watermans had a very positive effect on this Hornet program For sure You look at college basketball in the age of NIL you look at some of these teams and some of these teams dont have as much resources to work with as other teams So you look at that record right there and you talk about the path that the record was Hes done a tremendous job with his Delaware State basketball program live for them to continue to be great in the future Coming off their first winning season since 2010 after they went 16 and 14 last year finishing top four in the MAK Conference As long as you get to that conference tournament hot you never know what could happen especially the low major level And you look at Delaware State on the football side they bring in you know exNFL guy Deshawn Jackson as their head coach You know you want to see small changes like that You know those things attract talent to come through So look for Delaware State to continue to make those moves continue to get this program to the next level Miami comes in the timeout with some fullcourt pressure Almost gives Delaware State some fits but they get the ball over Almost got a good look Adamu too strong Heres Dante Allen who had the triple before the break Nice footwork from Teimo Malovitz Nice find but for new cant hang on But the possession continues and Trey Donaldson has been one of the best guards in the country inside the cylinder He has just been phenomenal at embracing the contact for sure And hes really great in tight spaces You know a lot of times guards to make that spin move theyll be spinning wide You know Trey spins and hes so tight His pirouette silhouette is on the money right there Kanes up double digit says it almost was a great connection from Malibitz to Renew but you got a Duo in front of you whos standing at 610 211 lbs And Trey Donaldson all six three of them able to muscle up a layup off the glass And in the opening game against Jacksonville he might have looked a little out of control but since hes really been able to find his poise in the paint which has been Miami strong suit offensively for sure You know first game new team high expectations You want to show the world and you want to show your coach what you can do Obviously coach J Lucas knows what he can do as he brought him in At the same time look for him to calm down as he has and hes been an amazing player Adama with a turnover Hes one of three Delaware State Hornets who played a couple of years at Harkham College Jo School in Pennsylvania Theres Donaldson again The hoop and the harm and chance for more Great take by Donaldson You know Trey is a very underrated athletic basketball player Finishes off two feet Absorbs the contact Finishes with the M1 Kind of scared of the contact as well Throwing his whole body at Damu Certainly something to be excited for For sure You want to see Trey knock down his music free throws Hes hes hes an amazing free throw shooter but this season he hasnt shot the ball I think to his expectation of how he wants to make shots You got to finish your breakfast I would say lunch right now is a 122 You got to finish your probably would agree with you there Pretty mature cash machine Cash machine Before he shot he he put that machine I guess he just knew He knew it was going in 21 to7 Hurricanes largest lead Its 14 Trey exits the game Says Coach what happened You got to end one I think you know Jay is trying to use this game to get multiple lineups get guys some run to see what hes got when the season gets real It gets real next week They got a couple days off before heading to Orlando to take on one of the most talented rosters in the entire country in BYU featured by number one player in the class of 2025 AJ Dansa Dovat crosscourt now to his fellow international and another one Talutis How about that Great play by Teimbo To be honest when I see that play I want Teemo to step into that shot and shoot the three Obviously he made the right read Got a paint touchdown His big man great big great finish by the big fella But once again I want these guys any guy thats playing college basketball be shot ready Shout out to Steph Curry He has a book that just came out called Shot Ready You got to be shot ready when youre playing basketball Renew one two Remember Norad Omir they said thats baby food That like right there Great move in the traffic Your big man Youre splitting two guys See it right there with only seven points 11 minutes in Yeah If you look at Delaware States offense a lot of their shots are very heavily contested Theyre taking a lot of contested shots from outside Miamis getting the ball out in traders and getting easier baskets If Im the head coach of Delaware State Im going to say lets try to get some better shots see the ball go in to get our offense flowing Well see what they do coming out of the timeout An offensive foul on Luazabini Yadamu wont help the case Hell take a seat for Suril Obasogi the Nigerian native who started this ball game off as the big has taken some time on the Delaware State bench Now the Hornets back in their zone Over the top pass is tipped away by Kareem Watson Tough look by Teemo there You know one of the keys to an entry pass to post You dont want to stare at where youre passing Maybe look right and then throw it over the top That play right there Teemo was staring at his man and then pass it You know the defense can react to that Use your eyes Ziona out of South Orange New Jersey with the rock Seven to shoot for the Hornets Theres Ponch James but gets taken away from Altunis How about his hand so far in the early going Dante Allen right wing three just short Not a bad shot in transition You know transition threes are your best threes you can get in basketball The Hurricanes two for six from long range today Pon James stops kicks That free is good and its Zion Bethea knocks that shot down cuz he was ready to shoot before the basketball came fade away Jay goes on the baseline for Draat So not the catch and shoot three but does it himself A little craft down by the baseline Craft and pace He got to the baseline looked at the big man as he was going to pass Like I just said last minute use your eyes to throw the defense off Use his eyes looked at the big and got a wide open shot Betheia maybe a bit of a heat check A deep right wing three doesnt go But nice back door cut Goes up and gets fouled Dante Allen is down under the stansion Hes saying that might have got an elbow into the stomach maybe but Miami and Odum respectively Jay Lucas doesnt want to get caught behind Yeah I think thats a actually a good standing for the University of Miami on on two accounts You know one you can sneak up on people you know right If you look at this University of Miami basketball team you see they have an amazing team And and the second thing is you know the players and the coaches really dont have that much pressure because theyre not a top three or top four seed So its a good thing for Miami I believe to be at that AC because youre right in in the cusp with things And with a new team you dont want to let anybody know what you got up in your pocket especially after last years finish Trey Donson gets the go from the far corner Two for two for Trey from deep look for him to keep letting the ball fly up to 11 points a game high Hes reached that total every game so far in a Kanes uniform Ziona another poke away by Sally Alunis You know if you look at Sally hes got his hands on at least three or four balls Thats something that you dont see in the stat sheet but as a big man with lymph like him you want to see him utilize his lymph on both offense and defense Hes got his hands on a ton of balls today Great basketball plays by the big fella Hes become real familiar with the passing lane 6 and 12 minutes to go Kanes up 19 Paint touching side to New who went for the highlight reel poster Ball just slips out of his hands Well get two free throws though Great attack where to finish strong at the basket You know Renu hes very hes a super super finesse player but he will try to dunk on you if he has the opportunity And again another play for Altunas that might not show up on the stat sheet but look at him boxing out over getting renew that ability to take off You look at Alunis hes played basketball in Europe played in Turkey You know these are small things that you youre taught and you practice that at a early age you know small things that dont show up on the stat sheet As you watch basketball and youre in basketball Savant you see those things Great play by the big fell I repeat great play by the big feller Blake Renu 78 from the free throw line this year Hes one for one today Another free throw will get him to double digits Hes up to 10 How about Donaldson and Renew The two Big 10 transfers right now A combined eight for eight from the field Thats what you expected out of them coming in being the main leaders of this young Miami team and theyre putting that on display today against Delaware State for sure You know shooting below 50 against Florida in the last game and coming in shooting 100 now Thats what you want to see You want to see a difference in your shooting cheering Donaldson again Nice find from Henderson to Marcus Allen And Donaldson caps off that turnover Now Miami up 3411 We talked about it in the the open if the defense will be able to step up and not struggle in the first half Its safe to say they answered that call The Hurricanes have 11 points And how about this for Delaware State Only 15 shots in 14 minutes You know one of the things you watch this game right now University of Miami changing up their defense a lot They go for a 122 press to a 221 press You know the strategy of 221 press is not to necessarily get steals Its to slow the game down and make the team turn the ball over You look at that last play Miami didnt have to trap the ball Delaware State passed the ball up and turned the ball over just by the defensive pressure and presence by University of Miami The Hornets have switched to man themselves Patterson after the risky take from Santos goes up over Oasogi Santos trying to get that steal Set his big fell up for a drill Once again look at our boy Alutas getting the big fell out the way making a clear pathway for Shan to get an easy basket and one Hes been real impressive so far doing the little things for Miami But weve seen not only Henderson but Donaldson as well playing off two feet Henderson cant convert but gets his own miss Dont see that one too often Nice find inside Great find and great finish Its like you know what big fella you created the pathway for me last last shot Let me get you a bucket And thats what you want to see as a big man that does the small things in the stat sheet He also you got to get him the ball and let him get an easy basket to get his confidence up because everybody loves scoring that ball Pon James layup misses the mark Do a nice spin move Steps away from James resets Five to go in the opening half Miami up 3811 Henderson open look from three Oh yeah Great shot Great movement and as you see when Chelton caught that ball he was ready to shoot the basketball Everything becomes more intact Everything becomes more smooth when you are shot ready Miamis offense has kicked it up a notch the latter part of this first half now up 30 Delaware State is having a hard time scoring If you look at where their offense is initiated its almost initiated by half court Theyre not getting to the threepoint line to create easier shots and get basket touches Look for them the second half to get better offensive stability by starting the ball down by the threepoint line to get better shots and better looks for your team Theres a great look Doesnt go St Clair kick out Pump fake from now Twopoint jumper is no good But an offensive rebound the first one of the afternoon for the Hornets Banks not open for Santos Now Dorat the other way Hes got it Great shot Great paint touch by Trey You know Dorat is one of the better shooters on this basketball team Thats why I was disappointed in the last shot where he traveled in the corner Like you got to let the ball fly when youre a shooter Let it fly Let it fly Let it fly And the lights show is going on after that triple That will send us to immediate timeout with the Hurricanes up 31 team points a game high See him on the bench for the Hurricanes They lead by 31 Doat using his body to try to find some space Goes inside to renew works around Adamu If you watch Dovat get into the paint hes never sped up He almost looks like hes playing slow motion Great basketball guards They get into the paint and they play at their own speed Look at Dovatra Hes getting in the paint looking around using his eyes and making the right play But once again making the right play playing at your own speed is what you want to see with the ball handler The Hurricanes on a lengthy run as Pon James tries to spin one off the glass hits the bottom of the rim but gets a hand in Theyre going to call a foul Thats the eighth for Delaware State So free throws on the way One and one opportunity under three minutes to go But talk about Doat We said Salis has had some experience overseas but Doats 23 years old played 91 career games overseas now brings that here to Miami And weve seen a lot of players come internationally that are four or five star recruits but how about the people with really good experience that show it in the little ways Yeah for sure You could see it You know if you look at European basketball versus you know American basketball I think one of the biggest things is speed In America we play so much faster on transition on defense In Europe in European basketball theres a lot more slower pace getting into sets And as you can see Dovat comes here plays at his own pace never gets sped up When you dont get sped up you can make the right reads Playing fast was what we just saw there as Pon James F1 driver going fast down the lane and gets two free throws James a preeason first team selection after making the rookie team last year Hes the only player for the Hornets in double digits First Keen with a twopoint win a few days ago Pon James make sure before he leaves Miami they get a picture on Pon Deon street right around you You got to go to the sign Its right out here Its right Its right around the corner Go take the I mean if they won maybe you know if you this is my city punk down with the team around but you know cross the arms Cant do that 4815 4615 I say Yep 4615 is the official score I think some of the other scoreboards around us say 48 So theyre fixing that right now after both those free throws fall for James Now finally the Hornets they get a bucket Theyre able to go full court But Miami a couple good passes between Dante Allen and Teimo Malovich That tes up Marcus Allen for three Well short goes out of bounds and will give the Hornets possession You know you look at if you heard Jay Lucas right there he said Good shot You know thats a great shot in transition Get the ball up You know Allen is a great shooter You know you want to see him step into that shot and be confident and shoot that basketball Dean Shepard getting this first action late in the first half with the Hurricanes up 31 points Cory Perkins son of assistant coach Shaheen Perkins also in for Delaware State Ramir Moore works around TMo Malib Oh my that was a tough basket by Ramir Moore Great body Slow his steps down Right left euro finish left hand off the left foot Great play by Ramir Mor That looks like Is he from Philadelphia Is he from Philly He is from music Philly I know it Thats Thats a Philly move My guy Rodney Green that great Philadelphia basketball player that played in Lasal he loved to do the slow step finish off either foot finish with either hand He started his career in Philly with St Joes before a couple years with the Wagner program 120 seconds to go in the first half Kanes up 29 Back to his zone for the Hornets Doat loses his man rises up cant go Nice rebound from Dante Al who waits cant get it to go but Marcus Allen picks it up Although that shot did not go in Mo called for a switch and did not switch Teemo not Teemo Do missed the shot but on defense you see small things that you cant say switch and dont switch If you say switch you got to switch on defense small things that you got to change if you want to be a winning basketball team Webb goes up with the right rattles around No gets his own miss Second try cant go as well Altus with the rebound Closing minute and change in the first half Dock gets the ball picked away Santos the other way on the left side Another shot that just goes in and out Altis gets the board and gets fouled So free throws for Sally Alutis with 63 seconds to go in the first half Sally is all over the floor Offense defense making plays You know if you look at this basketball game you look at the stat sheet Sallys stat sheet may not look the best but hes doing so many things that dont show up on the stat sheet Hats off to Big Sally from Turkey right now four points five rebounds a free throw away from a double nickel but also zero turnovers I think its a big thing with bigs who like to touch the ball a lot is they lose it every once in a while but Alundis been really strong with the basketball on his hand Burning on the one and one is short Marcus Allen trying to get the rebound and save it for the Hurricanes but slides out of bounds If I was alternative shooting coach I would tell him Big fella when you shoot your free throws make sure your fingertips are facing the ground Thats going to make the ball go up and rotate the way you want to rotate When he shot the basketball his fingertips were kind of still facing the basket To all the shooters out there point your fingertips down to the ground Well Jack youre a Hall of Famer so Id probably take your advice as well I would take it too You dont have to take my advice Im just trying to give you guys some tips out there You know I youre watching a great basketball game right now Why not get a couple tips every now and then cheering See if Delaware State can get a score before the end of the first half Theyve been few and far between Only 17 points to Miamis 48 You know I love the defense by Miami right now They went to a onetw2 press One of the toughest things to do in a onetw2 presses after they break the press is identify and guard your man They did a great job of Delaware State breaking the press and Miami getting on their man Perkins with four to shoot Finishes at the rack You look at that last play Jay Lucas was telling his team Dont grab the ball because the shot clock and the game clock wont start till you grab the ball And they want to get the last shot And so now its 2 seconds left for Delaware State to potentially get a shot off As you go down deeper in the season small things matter Let the ball go so you can get the last shot and leave no time on the clock for the opposing team Looks like Lucas will not use his use it or lose it Timeout No look pass Nice find to Renew Great pass by Trey Donaldson Paint touch And what did I say earlier Its all about the eyes He looked right through it left Great play by Trey Donaldson Great finish by Malik Reneu Miles Web shot cannot beat the buzzer Miami upage even without Ernest Uday Jr a 286 paint advantage Theyve been doing it to every team that theyve faced this year Second half is underway here from the Watsco Center in Coral Gables Florida on the beautiful University of Miami campus You look at this Delaware State basketball team right now They just ran a pin down screen for James but Bethe didnt set the screen He kind of like went through and didnt strugg music The small things matter and getting your man open matters Go down if youre setting a pin down screen set the screen and make contact Obasogi does it himself to start off the scoring here in the second half to get the Hornets on the board Cut the deficit to 29 Siri playing in his first game since Niagara That was back on the 10th of November Dante Allen driving gets hit go to the free throw line for two You know I Im almost getting mad at Teemo not shooting his basketball but every time he does a shoot he makes the right play to get his player a shot But as you play against better teams and you go down the road you need to shoot that ball to open up the floor for your other players cuz when he knocks one down now next time instead of this guy closing out you know hes going to be able to get a basket touch or a paint touch for his own basket Look for Teemo to be aggressive and shoot the basketball Dante Allen connects in the first We talked about it during one of the breaks In the first three games Teimo Malovitz was eight for 11 from three in his last two And then adding this game in 0 for three So the numbers have dropped significantly in threepoint attempts from Alamance Yeah they drop significantly because hes not shooting Exactly You know if you dont shoot the ball your attempts are not going to increase or decrease Hes going to let the ball fly to see the ball go in the basket But pull away three No good Goes out of bounds after Henderson falls on the ground gets tripped up but it will stay Hurricanes basketball You know if Im Delaware State I might try to pressure University Miami right now to just change the game up jump the game a little bit You know laying back in the zone being down 30 points I I I dont think thats the right way to play in the second half the right the right you know strategy But you know this coach is he knows what hes doing Lets see what Delaware State goes on moving forward Another hard drive from Dante Allen This time the finish You dont want to give up straight line drives at any point in basketball but Delaware State is going to have to watch film and get better if they want to win some basketball games Know basketball terms youre not necessarily supposed to dribble through a zone Might want to pass around it but Dante Allen finds a soft spot goes hard to the rim Ptheilla has been a spark for the Hornets offense in terms of starting it and getting some decent looks That one falls short into the hands of Malik Renu who hands off to Trey Donaldson Ball has touched Dante Allens hands the last three possessions One more to Trey Donaldson who remains perfect from the field and perfect from distance You know I always talk about the universe in basketball When the ball moves and people move it always ends up with a great shot Teemo with a hard basket cut You know Shelton with a hard basket cut The ball swings to Trey Great wide open three Nothing but the bottom of the net Basogi throws that shot up off the glass Cars off the left side of the rim Now heres Malovitz Your threepointer Jack No good But it leads to a second chance opportunity Give and go Give and go Great pass Im glad Teemo shot that basketball Even coach Jay Luke was excited to see Teemo shoot that ball As a basketball player you want to see your coach tell you Shoot the basketball That breeds confidence but you must shoot the basketball They all came off the miss from Malovitz and then a nice find from Dante Allen A shuffle pass to Malik Renu Great Special delivery Finish Special delivery Stoppage for a delay of game warning on the Miami Hurricanes Jay Lucas just a smile on his side Miami continuing the fullcourt pressure music Its giving the Hornets some troubles But heres an open look for Pon James And those are the shots that you want if youre Delaware State Now its about converting those The ball goes out of bounds Well stay with the Hornets Sure A great look You know once again when you do a press or one two press that theyre in its not always about getting steals You want the other team to rush shots And thats what theyre getting Delaware State to do Delaware State just needs to knock down these open sides that theyre getting Well weve seen that they havent started a possession with more than 17 seconds since the opening possession of the second half Just wears you down and gives you a limited shot clock to work with for sure You know Im looking at this University of Miami basketball team and their defense And at the side of my ear I keep hearing coach Lincoln say go go go Pretty much insinuating trap the basketball University of Miamis yet to be able to trap the ball in this press theyre trying to do Its almost like a threequarter court press Theres the press but now its P James on Malik Renew A kick out to Santos baseline drive and a block Renu with the stuff now Twoon one Theres Dante Allen Great pass simple fast pass Amazing athleticism by the young fell Trey Donaldson up to five assists again doing it passing the ball as well Theres a wideopen look for Santos and that shot is going to help you out if youre Delaware State He leads the Hornets with eight points now You know thats the kryptonite of doing a press You get that trap If you dont trap and get a turnover or trap and make the defense speed up you give up open shots Confident take from Dante Allen Henderson and Renu converging at the rim for the putback Both kind of push each other away from the play The ball ends up in the hands of the Hornets Moore tries to go inside but the pass is tipped away Theres Dante Allen again Flips it up to Shelton Henderson who goes into the sky Pls it out of the air Kick out Renu for three Dot Great shot This basketball team is a lot better team Malik is hitting down his open his threepoint shot Malik Renu 18 from beyond the arc this year One for one today I would like to know how many shots Malik has shot cuz he hasnt shot a lot of threes this year which makes his percentage maybe a little bit deceiving Great pass Great ball move by Delaware State James has to knock that shot down Being the starting point guard at any level these days at high school middle school your point guard has to be able to knock down an open shot And theres Donaldson doing just that He is Dante Allen is getting an amazing opportunity as Tru is out to show his worth to show what hes capable of Hes out here playing basketball right now He does not look like a freshman He looks like a welled machine Somebody thats been playing college basketball for a couple years Thats what you want to see in recruiting freshman in college basketball Jay Lucas has said over and over again how much Dante Allen impressed in the offseason and in the preseason and its shown on the floor in his first handful of games for the Hurricanes Got his first start against Elon last Thursday and finished with a careerhigh 14 points Now hes up to eight in the absence of Drew Washington with a lower body injury alongside Ernest Udai free to shoot Santos up to double digits I like what Im seeing from Santos Hes very very crafty around the basket Can go right can go left can shoot the ball He has decent size I really like what I see from Santos on the offensive end Size and length of those arms Malovich tries to go to Marcus Allen but the ball gets back tapped away Heres James Floats it for Adamu Gets his miss And we have a timeout Well step aside as the Hurricanes lead this one by 40 music It has to start to get real This is the last game that they have before this stretch where you know obviously getting a win like this is going to definitely build your confidence but at the same time you cant become lacto and and and be and think you youve done something by winning by 40 points or beating a team by 40 points right now but I know coach Jay Lucas will have these boys ready to play when it comes to playing these teams like BYU Georgetown or Dayton Both those teams and Georgetown have picked up some good nonconference wins Dayton just recently beat Marquette on the road Georgetown beat Maryland earlier in the season So those are two teams that whoever you get after the BYU game Youre going to have a real challenge on your hand Theres not one or the other that you rather play theyre both really solid programs this year Heres Teemo Corner three There he goes Teemo is an amazing shooter I mean look at his form Everythings tight Ball goes up ball goes down I always believe as a shooter you want as soon as you lift the ball up you want those fingertips you want that release to go down No wasted motion Santos No good Now up the other way for the Hurricane Shelton Henderson back in He just bodies Premier Moore but misses it And how about Ponch James to the hands taken away from Malik Renu Great defense but as a big music you want to keep that ball high When its heavy in traffic you release the ball bring the ball down low Look up for Showtime right now Was looking for the alley Henderson just corrals it and hits the hardwood then goes up gets fouled by Pon James I couldnt even see what happened They got big oasis in front of me Im trying to see whats happening Showtime A man comes in blocks from view and do Roats pass just a little too high and wide for Henderson to do anything crazy with it or else that would have been on Sports Center top 10 Hell get two free throws Henderson nine points three rebounds two assists Someone whos trying to learn a division one game and get more comfortable at a division one level a lot different than high school basketball where he was so successful and he committed to Duke and followed Jay Lucas Most family friends of the Lucas family Thats loyalty right there Well I guess its double loyalty You know loyalty You commit to Duke but I commit to Duke for Coach Jay Lucas And that shows you the strength of coach Jay Lucas You know a kid commits to a team and you were his main recruit and then he moves where you move Just like that man Santos got up there but couldnt finish The Horns will have another look at it Now Perkins trapped gets it out to Santos Corner now its Clemens for three Short and Miami now gets the rebound A lot of offensive rebounds and opportunities for Delaware State in the second half more so than the first Marcus Allen a try for three Doesnt go Hes been short on both of those shots so far today Hes got to lift his elbow up You know on your release you want to be able to see your elbow above your eyeballs Thats how you know the ball wont fall short Dante Allen looking like an allp pro defensive back picking off the pass and able to draw the blocking foul Thats only the third on Delaware State So Miami is still a far cry away from the bonus Donaldson Donaldson checks in for Renew Both have 19 points Both havent missed a shot either as Hendersons man falls down He drives finishes as it was John Clemens who tripped up on the left wing and that allowed Henderson need to look in the lane Good play by University Miami That play you just saw with two men at the elbow and your strong guard goes over the top That is called an Iverson cut ladies and gentlemen Allan Iverson the Philadelphia 76ers started that play You get two Youre watching the ACC Network alongside the Hall of Famer Jack Mcquinton Im Gavin Bish Show and the Hurricanes have continued their dominance for the first half to the second half especially on the defensive end Great defense You know we talked about at the beginning of game is that Miami need to come out and set the tone defensively Delaware State has only scored six points in the second half within you know nine minutes 10 minutes of play Only six points given up Not a lot of easy looks especially inside of Damu trying to create a shot himself Heres the side iron Donaldson working his way up the floor the other way Delaware State started this ball game in zone and theyve gone back there sparingly but Miami having success against most that the Hornets have to offer Mismatch down low Oh my Sweet move from Salutis A little dream shake Great play You know you look at that the initiation of the offense We had three dribble handoffs The first two dribble handoffs were just to kind of get the ball moving The t the third dribble handoff was to a ball screen to get big fella the shot But you know deceiving offensive set by University Miami Santos with seven to shoot Hes the leading scoreer for the Hornets Might have gotten away with an offensive foul Wont get away with this extra step You know it was coming You know a lot of times youre dribbling and pounding the ball and not going anywhere It always ends up to bad basketball plays I love Santos trying to get the ball downhill and try to create a shot for himself but great defense by University Miami Renu comes in and almost throws it away Nice defense from Cory Perkins but Donaldson able to regain possession for the Hurricanes who lead 73 to 26 Immediately going inside to Renew over Santos gets it and finishes at the rack Yeah you look at a play like that you just call weight room Santos is is very tall but he needs to put some more meat on the bones right there Malik is a big power forward and once again when Malik gets the ball down low and hes oneonone I like him against anybody in the country to score the basketball if theres only one person guarding Malik 3 in taller 40 lbs heavier thats a mismatch that you want to take advantage of and the Hurricanes doing it immediately upon Renus return threepoint play gives Renu 22 on the afternoon now the new game high in total Donaldson trailing right behind him with 19 points Miami shooting 67 from the field 30 for 45 Really impressive clip and almost as impressive as the 9 for6 from deep and theres a takeaway from Donaldson Bump Santos clears the way and finishes Man it sucks for Santos Im mad I mean I know hes you know a little irritated like why they keep bodying me up At the end of the day thats a great offensive play by first Malik Renu getting to the body and next trade down by identifying let me get into this body to make my layup a lot easier with those long arm for Santos If you dont clear that lane could get a hand in there Fadeaway three from Cory Perkins goes great shot by Cory Perkins Theyre going to need a lot more of that to make this game close Miami not slowing down Another no look pass from Trey Donaldson this time to Altois No good but a rebound from Malik Renu looking for a corner look at Shelton Henderson The ball gets tipped out of bounds in the process Well stay with the Hurricanes You know speaking of European basketball you know you got you got a Teemo you got big fell Alutish you got um Doat in there as well You got Doat in there as well One things that Europeans do when scoring the basketball theyre very good at using their off arm to shield the defense before they shoot the basketball Please pay attention that all the viewers out there watch how European basketball players use their opposite arm to shield the defense when trying to finish Blake Renee continues to do damage in the paint Its a 42nd paint point for the Hurricanes compared to only eight for Delaware State Hasnt been easy going in that area Perkins though trying to get it to go Theres a nice pass to Santos but denied at the rim Teemo Malibits a three He falls down gets hit Thats going to be a landing space foul on Pon James and Miku now up to 10 rebounds The double double for the senior Just think if he doesnt shoot that three he doesnt get that foul Great things happen when you let it fly Pon James obviously does not have the height advantage on Teimo Malovich will try to get his hand up there maybe too aggressive of a jump towards the shooter collided knees and now Malovz will get three free throws first one is butter and we look at the European game a lot of just crafty ways to find open shots you have the Spain screens where youre manipulating a pick and roll and I always love watching those highlights you see something new that you dont see in college basketball on the American side yeah for Sure If you think about European basketball and American basketball you know over here in America we have a lot of freakish athletes and sometimes you know guys are getting drafted just by athleticism But in Europe you may not have the same type of athletes but you have you know athletic sets You have sets that are deceiving sets that set you up for one thing but obviously that was just a setup You know I love the European basketball offense If I was a coach Id be taking a lot of stuff from the European basketball Malivits the first two and then misses his first free throw of the year on the third attempt But now Miami up 8229 Heres Santos again whos been holding the ball a lot in this second half Theres a good look inside That time its Surreal Oasogi Teemo thought about a corner three This time its Dovat inside to Altutis gets hit and finishes at the rim I love how theyre getting Altunis involved in the game today Its a great confidence build for Altunis Ernest Uds out of is coming in shielding the man off He knows he has a smaller guy on him Go straight up finishing and one You want to see his fingertips go down on this free throw If youre watching lets see how his fingertips react to the release of this basketball shot Again that was on Santos Thats his fourth Got to be careful with 835 to go Check out the form on Altutis A little better Little better It went in Fingertips still went out to the side as JJ Laboy comes in for the first time this afternoon Hes playing in his fourth game Cory Perkins takes advantage but goes corner and sails that one out of bounds You know JJ Little Boy comes right in the game and Delaware State is trying to go directly at him Great help defense Great defense by JJ to commit a turnover for the other team Cause a turnover for the other team I think people know Le Boy Another close family friend of the Lucas family Had ties there in Texas Was initially committed to Colombia in the Ivy League and then followed Jay Lucas to Miami Marcus Allen There it goes Hes had a couple of those a little short Great shot If you look at his release there his elbow he finished high Its above the eye Finish high above the eye increase your percentage of shooting a basketball shot I feel like I can cut this broadcast up and get a handful of basketball lessons Well for sure Thats what we do We got to We got to give him something Exactly something to take home We got We got your notes over here You got the rim Yeah but that could be a basketball tour It could be basketball But we get you practiced it with the volleyball You did You did Great job Great job I appreciate it Great word play And thats a team thats trying to get a hosting opportunity in the NCAA tournament in just a couple of weeks The team on the court though a long way to go till March for sure If you look at Shepards free throw look how shooting hand taps around the ball before he shoots it Its moving a lot A lot of extra movement on that shot You want to keep the ball firmly in your hand before you shoot the ball His thumb moved his index finger moved I wouldnt recommend that if you want to become a shooter Keep the ball stable on your hand before you shoot We got Jordan Keyi in the basketball game now Transfer from Georgia The Florida guy in the game 730 left The boy shot is off the mark Alukas hits the deck trying to get the offensive rebound but goes out of bounds La boy and Kei both playing in their fourth game He was limited to just a couple of minutes in some exhibition matches last year for Georgia but you mentioned it returning to Florida to play for the Hurricanes You know these opportunities for guys like JJ Laoy and Jordan Keane You want to show coach Lucas hey you could trust me to put me in the game when its game time You want to see them to come out be aggressive be confident and be in the right places on defense Thats the key Offense will take care of itself be in the right place for defense And also for the situations where weve seen Miami get into trouble with is with fouls Today thats not the story But in previous games against Florida they found themselves in some not good spots when it came to foul trouble And so youre going to need some guys off the bench to give you a couple of minutes so you can have your starters and key role players in the final stretch of those basketball games For sure You hit it right on the head there Dorat also getting a lot of play for the Hurricanes today Boy thought about another three sets tend to shoot now for the Hurricanes Malloy thought about a baseline drive stopped Stan Waterman the next of us wanted to travel but got a steal So a turnover regardless And theres a hard drive and a foul You want to feed your big fella down there He had a mismatch down low Hes posting up for about five six seconds You got to get the ball inside and reward your big fella for all the things that hes doing on the defensive end and rebounding basketball Jordan Ke the guilty party will send Zion Ma to line And what a journey hes had from South Orange New Jersey playing at his fifth school Started his career at Hopstra then a year at St Francis Brooklyn before they ended their basketball programs division one A year at Delaware a year at Pepperdine So hes going coast to coast here now Bringing it back Oh boy Coast coast to coast How is that how is that even possible Co year I would I would believe so That first year with Hofra Sure You love to see the these young men get opportunities continue to showcase their game and opportunity to play ball after college How about that Love to see it for Bethea This is not his first time playing the Hurricanes He had four points in 18 minutes versus Miami back in 2022 A part of the St Francis Brooklyn squad Santos looking for a receiver Cant find anyone Now Miami on the break Dorat up with the right Easy You never want to take it to the basket and jump to make a jump pass You want to play off two feet Once you jump you got to throw the ball Sometimes someones open youre caught in with a turnover just like the last play by Santos Early in this broadcast weve seen Donaldson Renew emphasize that playing off two feet and they both are extremely good at finishing in the paint You know two feet is a paint killer cuz once you get in the paint you absorb the defense So now if Im off two I can pivot right I can pivot left I can shoot I can pass When you finish off one and jump all you can do is shoot or pass You remove the the ability to pivot right the ability to pivot left Obasogi gets knocked by Marcus Allen His first foul on the afternoon right a team five Delaware State was six So the Hurricanes in the bonus the rest of the way out First free throws no good as a team Delaware State 5 for 10 from the charity strike Usually a 70 free throw shooting team but not that many looks today from the line Miami playing very clean defense which makes the 33 points as impressive For sure Great defense great team defense great help Thats what you want to see Defense is not an individual sport just like offense is an individual sport You have to talk You got to be helpside You got to be ready You got to be there to support your teammates Well you cant cash in on either free throws Heres Malovichs left wing three No good An opportunity for a second chance for the Hurricanes And Marcus Al comes up with it Now Malovitz crosscourt pass Jordan Key No good Another chance And Alunes this time makes no mistake about it Alunes offensive rebound Finishes with the left Well that right hand is right near that left hand to block off the defense Great finish Great rebound by the big fella Miami up to their season average in points in the paint at 48 as they lead by 59 points Great defense by Le Boy Thats how you show your coach coach I can be on the court I deserve to be on the court Great defense by JJ Lab Boy You see Drew Washington Malik Renu Trey Donaldson all hyping up their boys on the floor Turnover though for Delaware State They got numbers up ahead Dean Shepard goes to the rack Its tough play Two turnovers in a row by JJ Loy I hope it doesnt haunt his confidence and haunt his aggressiveness Stay aggressive Be ready to shoot the basketball and make a play for your team There it is Straightaway three off the mark Ball tipped around Obasogi comes up with it Just over four minutes to go in this contest Miami steamrolling Santos might have got away with an extra step Goes up with the right in and out Boy looking hard inside Alunis nothing doing Key Another triple try Missed again Short But there is Sally Altunis again with the put back I really love to see this from Sally Altunis Hes going to be a great great contributor to Miamis future if they want to compete at the next level in March Jay Lucas Burns a timeout and well step aside for the final media timeout with Cadence up big Hopefully that experience in that environment against that competition can help Miami in Orlando on Thursday against a talented squad and then theyll have a quick turnaround and play again on Friday night against either Dayton or Georgetown You know thats what you want to see early You want to see where your team is early on So when you know what to do when it comes to March you come to February what are the things we need to work on What are the things we do well What are the things we do bad have these these opportunities early to kind of have a trajectory or to kind of have some type of scale on what you got to do if you want to compete later on in the season It reminds me of you know Hurricanes team two years ago played a couple of tough matchups versus Kentucky and Colorado Got blown out in both but the rest of their music schedule was low majors and mid majors and they had success They I think were good at 17 and seven and they lost 10 in a row to end the year against ACC teams you dont challenge yourself enough You dont put yourself in that good of a situation early on You dont know where you stand when you get into a schedule you get in the ACC where it could be the same football any given Sunday but any given night in the ACC youre have top tiers And you got to think in the ACC you know these teams have a lot of film to scout you know you face the ACC team you know youve already had 10 to 15 games worth of film that if a team has a great scout and great coaches you know how to strategically plan yourself for that potential game against an opponent A boy or runner no good You know one thing I will say about this Delaware State team right now theyre down 94 to 37 Not the best look overall but I will say the sneakers that Delaware State is wearing No this is like some of the best things that Ive seen in college basketball right now You got the Codes you got the you got the old Giannises you got the Jaws like very unique colorways colors too They got they got they they might win the shoe battle today I We got a couple pinks and a couple green and oranges but JJ and Marcus who got the foul I give Delaware State the win on the sneaker battle tonight Now what are your thoughts about the players like Jordan Key Trey D that wear two different colors of the same shoe You know its funny because I believe that that shoe in green and orange they come together as two different colors But the confidence to do that you got to have the confidence You look at Jordan King and Trey Johnson theyre very loud Theyre very light color So I would see guys like that rock the shoe They make it look good You be a lightskinned lightskinned brother thing Jordan Key who has the mismatching shoes and they got the tats on the leg You know guys that wear mismatch Most guys wear mismatch shoes have tats on the leg We should do a poll about that Mismatch shoes See if they had leg music taps Ill start barking it down from here on out laughter Key on the bump on the rebound on the other side puts Bethea at the line No relation to Jalil Bethea You know its funny Every time you said that I kept thinking about Jalil I looked it up I had to make sure because Well he was Miamis highest touted recruit last year and now hes with Alabama Miami brought back no one from last years squad Delaware State very minimal bringing back only 13 12 of their scoring Lost all players in double digits that averaged that much Great ball movement You understand that this is a well coached basketball team It doesnt matter whos in the game They all play the right way Swing the ball Hurricanes havent had much success from three as of late but Delaware State trying to take advantage Cory Perkins rightwing three Got it Just the fifth made three on the afternoon for Delaware State Comes a little too little too late No rat Nice finding key He might have got bump and braces Nice pass Great play Broken play Great finish Great pass A lot of movement in the paint Always got to slow yourself a little bit Try to find the Dovat Now Jayen St Clair true freshman Kicks out to Kareem Watson Now 11 to shoot Cory Perkins will look over the offense and a foul again on Marcus Allen on a bump That will be his third Im not mad at that call on the bump You know it just shows youre playing aggressive Youre getting your body onto the defense Im not mad at that You want to see guys like Marcus with that build that he has Make the offense feel you cheering Damu one and one misses the front end and the Hurricans get the ball I would love to see Damu hold his follow through Every time he shoots hes bringing it down This is another tip for the shooters out there Hold your follow through See what you did wrong or right on why you made or missed the shot Do not shoot the basketball and drop the follow The boy skips through the lane gets hit on the way up Two free throws for the freshman We talked about Miami playing BYU on Thursday Up next for Delaware State a game against Division 2 Virginia State on Wednesday at 230 in the nations capital Their next division one opponent next Saturday at UNMBC I want to see JJ Leo get a point right now There it is Shot JJ Thats his first basket or point you should say of his collegiate career Its got to be thats got to feel good Always got to coming in as a freshman seeing that ball go in at this level of basketball Great feeling Thanksgivings coming up A lot to be thankful for First basket in college basketball Big milestone especially for the boy Its a crucial time on the floor Watson works around Malabes A nice move Cant finish Adama with the offensive board Cory Perkins with the affforementioned color colorful shoes Nice pull away shot over Doat Almost out of bounds Will stay with the Hornets but way to create a shot You see both Perkins and Santos is on the bench When things havent been going well for Delaware State theyve still been able to create good shots for themselves See thats what happens when you have crafty guards and crafty guards are the confidence that demand the ball Perus is very shifty with the ball and hes looking to get a shot for himself first and second for his teammates You can see that he might be a scorer in his past life and life before basketball Most likely the last possession for Delaware State Dump off pass kick out Clemens left wing three No good Miami gets it Lavoy moving up and finds Key who will reset Things the shot clock turned off 10 seconds to go and that will do it here from the Watskco Center The Hurricanes an impressive 97 to 41 win over the Hornets
