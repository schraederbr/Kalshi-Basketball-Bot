Music the Demon Deacons in black and gold Notre D in the home white our officials tonight Roger SS Bill Covington and Justin Porterfield we are underway in South Bandit Notre Dame that starts with the Applause ball go inside to Tay Davis attacking Andrew Carr great defense by Carr rips it away and Davis goes over the top of bopy Miller and you know what Jay I I I think its really important for these other guys besides Burton to get involved early on get him feeling good get him going guys like booth and and uh Davis just to get a feel for it early and then going into the game theyre engaged take a look at the Wake starting five poopy Miller the point guard hes back playing in the midwest a Chicago native transfer from Central Michigan number zero has it here hildr lines up a three and knocks it down to open the scoring Jay a much improved shooter he he hes a guy whos really the heart and soul of this team he brings grit and toughness but you see by his shooting numbers that he is definitely an improved shooter and you see him knocking down to three right there Notre Dame starting five this is a young group all five starters are underclassman three freshman two sophomores and theyve turned it over twice early and Miller puts it up and in Jay thats a big thing for Notre Dame being able to take care of the ball not giving extra Poss to Wake Forest you see right there boy Miller doing a great job taking advantage of the turnover getting the bucket in transition Braden Shrewsberry off the mark from three he has been 45 from deep in ACC play Burton swipes it away the steal and the Finish thatll count goal 10 for Notre Dame to compete in this game Jay they have to get easy buckets theyre not known as a uptempo team but if they could get up and get in transition game get easy buckets create turnovers its better for them going deep into this game now this is a Notre Dame team that is playing a lot better than their record theyve won three of their last four actually had a threegame winning streak snapped Saturday against Syracuse Hunter Salis connects on a three and we talked about it you know before the game Salis hes a guy whos the NBA Prospect hes hes put himself in first round consideration oh no doubt about it he has been so consistent for this Demon Deacons team Burton nothing but the bottom of the net D if he can start being consistent hitting the jump shot hes already a guy who can get to his spots at will but now the defense has to get up and play tight makes it even easier for him getting by get to the basket make plays for him and his and his teammates Salis in attack Music mode and now hildr trying to spin his way free fade away it falls and Wake Forest is redot they are four for four to start the night well H let me know man because I youre not just the heart and the Soul youre bringing a little bit of offense to the table five ear points for hildr hes hes looking to be aggressive scoring the ball early on Davis open for three left it short gets his own rebound and rocks the rim great hustle to stay with it Tay Davis Jay Im looking at the matchup you know they have car on Davis Davis is a guy whos versatile forward you got car out on that perimeter Davis has have the advantage all night being able to get by off the Applause Music dribble poked away michah Shrewsberry year one is the head coach for noted a he has prioritized defense for this young group and they are dialed in defensively back door open Davis denied o looks like a goal t that would have been the second goal tend to the night hriff for three left it short foul on the floor lets take another look you you said go tend immediately well it looked like the ball was already Above the Rim going Music down yeah thats a go thats a go that was already down the Music Applause rim and the officials would be able to review that but they would have to call it and look at it immediately they probably should have did it now we we have the benefit of a replay Miller so crafty in the lane it doesnt drop counted and plus the foul staying with the play cleaning up his own spill boopy Miller and just be able to stay with that play I mean coming from Central Michigan but hes from Chicago and we know Chicago they produce tough guards I mean bopy is a guy whos come from a mid major and produce at a high level in the ACC in ACC play but hes a guy that has been a major contributor for Wake Force along with Salis in that back court completes the threepoint play he shown he belongs in the ACC no doubt about it Steve Forbes has done a great job hitting the transfer portal and you know getting it right and really this is I mean thats the name of the game now Jay with the nil and the transfer portal its kind of like the Wild Wild West just to be honest but youre youre going to see a lot of guys who maybe didnt get that time at at Mid majors and then come up to high level where they can really prove Music theel shot clock down to seven contested three goes Applause Music begging Bob and Reed hammers it home Eon Reed well and that was strwberry he he was late on the coming over on the help you got to be able to bump him early right by that a in a in ACC you got to go over there and bump him and he was late and you see what happened lob dunk for Reed well if there was any doubt that Wake Forest would come out a little flat on the road after a big win against Duke they have answered that in the opening five minutes red hot to start this game Shrewsberry answers with the floater Im not just a threepoint shooter coach showing that he can put it on the ground getting the floater I think thats the next level for Shrewsberry in his game putting it on the deck and being able to create now this is a young team for Notre Dame but theyre playing their best basketball right now theyve won three of Applause Music four Wake Forest an early 159 lead here in South Ben lets take a look for our Food Lion Food For Thought of the night Wake Forest one of the top offenses of the ACC Notre Dame theyve struggled at times offensively this season but a really good defense and theyre going to have their work cut out for going against this Demon Deacons offense well you know what they got to be able to try to put wake force in the half court put bodies in front especially these good guards they got to surround them with bodies and then when they do get it down low like coach said theyre going to send that double team and they got to make it tough for the passes out of the double team but I think offensively for Notre Dame they got to be able to try to get out in transition play Fast get easy buckets they got to be able to rebound the ball they got to be able to create turnovers if they want to do that you look at that nugget in the bottom corner Notre Dame has held ACC opponents below their scoring average at 15 of 16 games the one game they didnt was Saturday at the Dome against Syracuse snapped a threegame win streak so no doubt this Notre Dame team is much improved the Wake Forest has come out hot theyve hit six of their first eight shots Shrewsberry off the screen heres Burton step back three tough thats a thats a tough shot great defense by hildr you want to get a better look if youre buron Salis goes Coast to Coast rejected at The Rim by Roper and now roer running in transition kick to the corner good luck and boo buries it get a good block on one end push the tempo get an open shot down on the other end boo hes a talented young freshman a guy who could play inside and out yeah two freshman connecting there the future very bright for Notre Dame but they want the present to be bright trying to knock off a Wake Forest team with backto back big wins to boost their NCAA tournament resume car spinning his way into the lane Miller tries the floater and it drops and you know what boy Miller just just poised and composed you see the pump fake took his time get to a spot the guy didnt come up read the floater knocked it down boy Miller is Elite guard yeah you see him right here pump fake getting burned up in the air with the nice touch great look by Applause Music Miller heres Burton attacking Reed kick out Booth another three backto back triples for Carrie booth we talked about it in the beginning Jay Burton needs to be able to get his teammates involved early on just get him engaged and then when it comes to the crunch time its his time with the ball in hands great job finding care hitting his second three of the game you know working with Eric dendor for the first time its funny to watch you watch a game your eyes light up every time theres a three you still love that three ball well you know what I I feel like I can go out there and get 20 right now but I just I love the game I have a passion for the game and I know what these young fellas have been through you know being in the wars in in in the old Big East you know now the ACC just uh just love the game and and love seeing these guys go at it Fon Reed a chance to complete the and one opportunity and I think going in Jay you know coach Shrewsberry he knew it was going to be a battle down low with with Reed and Carr uh you know two veteran guys you know versatile with Carr and then obviously Reed down low its a load so Notre Dame has their hands full only down four though doing a good job yeah Wake Forest has been a different team with Fon Reed in the lineup missed the first seven games of the Season wake was just four and three without him and since his return theyve just hit another level now in the top 25 in the net and Steve Forbes has done such a great job building this program Year bye this seems like the they finally get into the NCAA tournament after a few years on the bubble yeah well I think if if you ask me Wake Forest is an underrated team I I mean you look at the lineup you look at the balance that they have and you talked about Reed totally different team with Reed on the floor he just brings a whole another Dynamic I mean if you take Burton count it plus the foul just to finish the Wake point if you take their metrics with Reed back in the lineup theyre a top 20 team no doubt about it yeah no question and like I said right now they theyre one of the best teams in the country coming off to win against Duke this could be a trap game on the road against a much improved Notre Dame team but you know coach fores hes he talked to his team about it hes going to have him ready and you know theyre playing well early on but you see Burton right there getting into the lane playing off two feet pump fake getting into the body getting the and one hes been doing that consistently all year he has eight points early to lead the Irish the Notre Dame giving wake everything they can handle a travel there by Miller four turnovers for Wake for first in the opening 8 minutes yeah Jay thats thats one thing that you know Notre na has to do they have to be able to create turnovers and make it tough for Wake On the offensive end get up and pressure the guards make him uncomfortable Logan Imes into the game another freshman for Micah Shrewsberry team Burton showing off the handles it off Big Time finish Tay Davis Burton just show him your playmaking ability splitting it dropping it dropping it to Davis and Davis we talked about the versatile forward transfers from Sean Hall he can do it inside and out and I think he has NBA potential when you look at Davis and his body and just how hes built it says NBA all over him Notre Dames first lead tonight Salis trying to fire the Demon Deacons back in front cant connect this is where you push it push attack now Burton hes been in attack mode tonight he sees it right now he sees it trying to feed again bounces right back to him and he finishes Marcus Burton taking over I tell you what if he improves that jump shot and gets a little bit more consistent with his decision making I mean this guy has a chance to play at the next level despite his size Jay yeah only stands at 5 11 but hes got great handles great awareness and for a freshman hes been excellent Monsanto oh thats pretty step back three to tie it at 22 and thats why hes out there thats what he does hes a shooter but a great pullback crossover dribble to create the space and knock it down everything going through Burton right now and why not rotates over to Tay Davis attacking Monsanto trying to muscle it in and he does great job Davis he saw the space he ate up the space he got into his chest great feet when he gets down there great finish mon Santo that one off the Mark hes got the unlimited green light from Steve Forbes though you want to have you want to have that green light if youre a player now you certainly had it when you were shooting the triples at at Q thats for sure coach didnt mind made a lot of them uh fun back and forth game a tomorrow on acc Network you got to see number 10 Duke host Louisville at camon indor at 7 Eastern and end you really dont want to miss this the premere of Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited Mike Shashi Roy Williams sitting down together for an extensive conversation for the first time thatll be a special special conversation 9 Eastern Time right here on acc Network tomorrow how about USC last night RJ Davis Roy Williams had to be smiling at that A Smith Center scoring record draft 42 yeah I mean RJ Davis I think he secured uh you know the ACC Player of the Year 14 to 22 711 and efficient 42 ildr back into the game hits the three and fires the Demon Deacons back in front hildr he heard me talking about him Jay I mean he said Im more than the hard in the grid I can shoot the ball ball too e all right I see you out there hes a big time Defender for this Wake Forest team as well they missed him while he was on the bench Irish have hit their last six shots this is a team that has really struggled offensively for stretches of this season but theyve looked really good in this first half here at home and J you know what Im really a big fan of Tay Davis just his build his length his versatility you see him ping up right there in previous games you seen him extended to the threepoint line he can handle it I mean this is a guy whos going to keep getting better especially under Co Shrewsberry I just think he has NBA potential written all over him makes the first to tie to 25 Eric dorf J alter with you as our ACC double header continues on this Tuesday night its been a really fun offensive explosion of a first half didnt know what we would get because Wake Forest is is so good offensively Notre Dame so good defensively but its the offense certainly winning out right now yeah when you see Notre Dame they just got to be aggressive they got to look to be aggressive to the rim when youre aggressive to the rim youre going to be able to suck in the defense and be able to kick out and hopefully get opportunities with jump shots but right now theyre doing a good job of you know getting the ball inside and making stuff happen Yeah Boy Miller so crafty scoop to the hoop both of these teams just having no problem scoring look they got a threeheaded monster out there with Hill Salis and bopy Miller I mean they have to be some of the most talented guards in the country Shrewsberry catch and shoot got it Braden Shrewsberry one of the hottest hands in the ACC Jay I dont know if the audience watching knows how tough of a shot that is coming off full speed catch body was twisted but he had it Square to the rim and shoulders he knocked it down Carr catches and finishes at The Rim the degree of difficulty on a couple of these shots that have gone down tonight its been fun to watch yeah I mean we got a high level basketball game you talked about Notre Dame known for their defense but theyre bringing it right now offensively went inside that time couldnt finish it yeah and we talked about thats another part of his game that he wants to work on but you got to be able to Falls to Miller he cant connect another offensive rebound Fon Reed just swatting it back out to the three point line not once but twice heres hildr through the contact camon hildr he has a chance to complete the and one Wake Forest has taken control a back and forth game but the Demon Deacons lead by Music three like offense this is the game for you on a Tuesday night Wake Forest to Notre Dame both red hot in this first half yeah we know we we know what Wake Forest is capable of but I think its its more about Notre Dame right now theyre being aggressive you cant be hesitant as a team you got to be aggressive you got to look to attack if you miss the shot you get back and play D and then you come back and be aggressive on the next possession but Notre Dame is doing a great job being aggressive getting to the rim and you saw the couple getting out in transition where Booth hit a couple open threes for a team that Sports a record of 10 and 17 you would never know by looking at the energy the passion the confidence that Micah shrewsburys team is playing with not only tonight but they were on a threegame winning streak go on the road to Syracuse they lose the game but a tight one 8885 you look at those last four games they look like a different team well you talk about three of the five starters are freshman and the other two are sophomore so its going to take a little bit for these guys to you know play with the system buy into the system know their roles and thats what coach shrewbury was talking about at shoot around just guys are fitting in their roles now knowing what theyre supposed to do and you could see it on these you know on these last four games and then going into todays game mat Zona tries to Triple Off the Mark Demon Deacons went full court pressure out of the timeout trying to mix things up Music defensively heres Hunter Salis leaves it for Reed too much its a great pocket pass but you see Davis over there taking the assignment guard in one of the best players in ACC tough task we got to give that up Shrewsberry creates his own shot but cant finish early on hes showing us that he could put it on the deck a little bit I like the attempt to get into the hole and being aggressive despite the misses he just has to keep being aggressive thats going to open up his jump shots even Applause more ild lines up the Triple got a good look could connect theres a great screen by by car but thats what Notre has to do they have to make Wake Forest execute in the half court offense and make it tough for them no easy shots Burton going against Reed step back three cant hit it thats a shot you can get anytime I think right there you want to try to get into the get to the bucket get into the paint and create something Carr knocks down the three the trailer delivers Jay hes another guy that Ive I really like uh you know hes an older guy he can play inside and out I think he is a guy who could play at the next level just his versatility he has to get a little bit tougher and More Physical down low but he has potential to make money at the next level or possibly overseas Wake Forest on an8 nothing run right now theyve grabbed control after what has been a very back and forth first half Burton from the same spot he just missed this time he drills it great ball movement and what Im liking from Notre Dame right now is just theyre not getting discouraged by Miss shots theyre not getting discouraged by wake fours getting some good looks at the back so theyre coming down and theyre staying aggressive credit to coach shury and his staff for having his guys ready to play tonight car nice pump fake leads to a Miller three Miss fires Burton great D Salis all over him those two have been electric tonight Burton goes right into Salas and draws the foul I tell you what he set it up with that hard jab to the right getting into the middle and young fellas if youre watching this game right now watch how Burton is playing off two feet a couple possessions earlier you see the hildas do the same thing playing off two feet gets the guy up in the air gets his body into him now hes going to the line shooting too playing off two feet more balance more in control able to make better decisions Burton already 13 points tonight he has had seven straight games with 16 or more well on his way to making it eight straight Saturday right here on acc Network this is crossover season weve got a double header womens lacrosse at 1100 am Notre Dame who has a huge win to start the season beat the reigning Champions Northwestern they in champ Hill to take on Carolina and then mens lacrosse top eight matchup Johns Hopkins at Music Virginia you know thing or two about lacrosse being at Syracuse all those years and you know what J I was just going to say so being from Michigan we never had lacrosse growing up I didnt even know what it was so when I get to Syracuse Im I see lacrosse Im like what is this two out of the four years out are there they win the national championship I I got to know uh a little bit about lacrosse being in Syracuse definitely Im trying to think whos the great player on those those national championship teams oh now you put me on the spot its been a while dont worry about it well every time Notre Dame gets within Striking Distance Wake Forest seemingly has the answer Zona tangled up with hildr Burton goes up with a shot and misses Salis the trailer cant connect great job by Notre Dame getting back getting bodies in front Music Applause just look at hildr man he just how hard he plays Logan Imes a triple he missfires diving again for the offensive rebound Julian rooper and he draws the foul the Wake Forest to fourpoint lead the Demon Deacons looking for a road win and then theres storm in the court of the Dome we wont bring that up with Wake Forest fans if you looked at the box score Demetrius Nichols had 22 in that game your former teammate now in his first season as an assistant coach on Steve forbes Wake Forest staff well first off that might have been the hottest I ever been when they store in the court 30000 people on top of my head Jay I had to find the scores table that was the first time I found the scorers table the second time was the 6ot game but uh you talking about Demetrius Nichols just one of the best teammates I ever had the hardest worker I I mean hes a guy he couldnt do it he was going to figure it out and and its no uh surprise to me that hes having success you know on the coaching staff at Wake Forest when you were playing with him did you think to yourself that guys going to make a good coach one day I I just knew at whatever he wanted to do you know I he did a little bit of broadcasting coaching I knew he was going to be good at it because he worked at it he was one of the hardest workers you know that I ever played with so nothing surprises me with with d Nick hes a great guy great family man and and Im just happy for him and the success that hes having future your head coach absolutely no question rer seals it away leaves it for booth Carr great transition defense to stop what could have been an easy bucket for the Irish and I think for booth Jay thats his you know the next Evolution for him put on a little bit of weight be able to bang down there we seen him hit a couple jump shots but he hes another guy who you know screams NBA at Music you Music Fon Reed such an impact coming over from Gaga one of the best big men in the ACC I asked you is there a player he reminds you of and he said not a player but I got a celebrity lookalike for you this was a great call by Eric dendor I tell Jay and and its no slight to him the weekend is a great musician but I tell you what when Im looking at warmups and I see Reed I saw the weekend and everybody whos watching right now on acc Network I think theyre in agreement with me it is its uncanny I couldnt believe it when you said it Im like I dont know if I see it cuz it reads 7 foot you know but then you do the side by side our terrific ACC Network crew Derek Coleman our producer great job turning that around I mean that is as good a celebrity look alike as you will find and and Jay can you name a few songs for me well you got blinding light everyone knows that star boy maybe Ill work him in throughout the night on a on a read bucket who knows and I hope Reed has a good game so we can have him right here in the middle yes to show him that yes right now a two possession lead sixpoint lead for the Demon Deacons on the road Marcus Burtons been terrific has it here finds a fellow freshman Logan Imes and now back to Burton into the lane he is so crafty I tell you what what a half hes having and again playing off of two feet getting in the lane on balance and control finishing at The Rim Marcus Burton hes going to be a great one here at Notre up to 17 points tonight that is now eight straight games with 16 or more he is on fire give it go between Carr and Reed Reed couldnt Corral it and off his heel Notre Dame ball a great idea by Carr I know it was tough pass at his knees were a sevenfooter but you know car is actually a great passer for a big man save your tears another weekend song save your tears save your tears on the turnover I cant lie but Im not a big time weekend fan I guess but that doesnt shock me what what what are you playing in in the car right now Drake and uh 21 Savage I wouldnt have had that on my dingo card Music either hild steals it away cam HR the steal and the finish I tell you what hes known as a defensive guy hes guarding the best player on the opposing Team every game but right now you see he in double digits hes showing that he can do it on the offensive end from inside and out great action got a good look couldnt connect from Applause three and Jay we really havent heard saless name too much he has to look to be a little bit more aggressive for Wake Force yeah only three points for Salis boopy Millers been terrific tonight though he has 11 yeah hes been picking up the slack hes been getting to his spots playing in control on balance making great decisions these Wake Forest guards are just tough and this ties the Demon Deacons largest lead of the night Shrewsberry off the screen this is the three offensive rebound zonea keeps it alive this is danger time for Notre Dame I think they have to get a bucket right here to be able to cut into this lead before half Shrewsberry gives up the three Runner in the lane doesnt drop but hell get two at the line I tell you what Jay Ive been impressed by Shrewsberry getting his off the dribble game going getting into the lane and you see boy Miller right here hitting with the Boop getting to the free throw line knocking it down hes crafty hes quick and these Wake Forest guards are a handful you for as good as Shrewsberry and Notre Dame have been tonight youre right that couple of points to cut into this would go a long way timeout use it or lose it before the end of the first half well step aside for 30 Music seconds Music Music the Saturday afternoon the first baseball game of the season on acc network has Miami playing the second game of a three game game series with fourth ranked rival Florida our coverage starts three Eastern in Coral Gables its also available on the ESPN app Eric devendorf Jay alter with you its been a very close back and forth game this is actually the largest lead either team has had tonight eight points feels like wake Force has been in control but Notre Dames done a very nice job punching back throughout this first half Ive just been impressed with Notre Dame staying aggressive keeping the foot on the gas and not getting discouraged when wake for comes down and makes a bucket Burton obviously with his 17 points but you see the other guys getting involved Davis screw Berry and for Notre Dame to have success they need those other guys to contribute and Jay I dont know if you know I I was uh I was an okay baseball player growing up I did not know that yeah little Le well how would I know that you wouldnt but you do now I dont know that anybody needed to know that no but now they do timeout Michel Shrewsberry they will step aside for another 30 seconds final possession of the first half coming 61 from the floor Notre Dame though a chance to cut into this lead right before halftime what are you drawing up here if youre Michel Shrewsberry well Im giving the ball to my best player Marcus Burton you know putting him in a pick and roll situation letting him come off make a decision just be aggressive off that pick and roll and make the right Music decision Music here we go yeah Burton with 17 points of this first half takes the timer down to Applause Music 10 ildr called for the foul and thatll send Burton to the line for one and one they Wake Forest didnt have the foul to give so Burton a chance to make it a fivepoint game before halftime Music here you know buron hes going to hes going to knock down these hes a high level player we saw in the in the shoot around earlier when they had the the free throw games at the end it came down to him and Music Shrewsberry they kept going punch for punch Andrew Carr and Tay Davis getting into it after the made free Applause throw Roger As quickly assessing technicals and Jay I know you know me Im a fan of the back and forth you were an elite trash Applause talker lets take a look a car and Davis just getting tangled up and then words exchanged you see Roger As there immediately calling technicals on both players so they offset yeah you saw a car with the elbow high but I listen were getting towards the end of the season its almost March when youre when youre playing with passion when youre competitive thats going to happen all right its basketball theres going to be some contact let them know dont have any stupid fouls get back in play just offet so offsetting technicals really no harm no foul either team gets free throws so its still wake ball 5 seconds left at the end of this first half bopy Miller pull up pop cant hit it but the Demon Deacons will still take a fivepoint lead into halftime defense trailing by five wake fours looking to follow up what was their biggest win of the season on Saturday with a road win here in South bent Salis he was quiet in the first half missfires there to start the second Hunter Salis only three points to his name well below his season Music average Shrewsberry off the screen and back to Burton 7 Seconds to work with Marcus Burton has the hottest hand in the gym right now passes it up a boo three Off the Mark and they had good movement on The Possession but it was too much side to side there was a couple times off those down screens where they could have turned that corner got to the lane two feet into the paint Salis F going hard to the hole you know a guy like Sal we we know what hes capable of doing he struggled in the first half missed his first shot in the second half but hes a guy whos going to keep putting the pressure on the defense you cant be hesitant especially at a guy of his caliber you just got to keep being aggressive I think right now him getting to the free throw line being able to knock it down see the ball go through the rim is just going to help Applause him the one thing you dont want to do is send Wake Forest to the foul line they lead the ACC third best in the nation shooting better than 80 from the free throw line Salis buries them both see a little full court pressure right here trying to change the pace up a little bit make Notre Dame play a little bit faster now they break the press and Booth fouled on his way for the jam just you see wake for is trying to switch up the pace a little bit Notre Dame did a good job handling advancing the ball ahead and you see Booth showing off his athleticism get to the rim high flyer knock down these two free throws Young fella Booth another one of these talented freshman that Micah Shrewsberry has in his first season as head coach of Notre Dame and we mentioned it in the first half such a bright future that Shrewsberry is building here in South Bend but this group theyre not satisfied with the future theyre playing really good basketball right now they were on a threegame win streak that was snapped at Syracuse Saturday but the play very very well tonight I just like what coach Shrewsberry is doing and what hes preaching to his team we talked about how young this team is three freshman and two sophomore staring I mean this group is going to grow together and you know the sky is the limit for them theyre just going to keep getting better and keep improving and I I think the future is bright for Notre Dame Booth working on Carr in trouble here has to get rid of it Burton right back to Booth Corner three no Applause good great extra got it poopy Miller makes Notre Dame pay and when youre not knocking it down make that extra pass and Salis is a guy who doesnt have to score the ball to make impact you see him making that extra pass getting his open teammate a shot and bopy Miller has been playing high level this game Demon Deacons up by nine that is their largest lead Applause tonight shoot the ball now he missed from the opposite corner this time goes inside count it plus the foul you look at these guys booth and Davis just to lengthen the athleticism that Notre Dame has on their roster and again I think Booth is a guy that you know screams NBA potentially you see him right here oh I thought it was a shot pump fake get by get into the lane hang a little bit finish with contact over Reed aka the weekend you are trying to make that stick as boo completes the threepoint play the oldfashioned way oh its stuck its not going to its already there and the one thing Wake Forest has failed to do tonight is theyll get up but they cant separate Notre Dames always punched back back to a two possession game here you got to give credit to Notre Dame there and we talked about it against the loss against Syracuse they were down 26 at halftime fought back only lose by three but this young team is theyre going to keep fighting theyre never going to go away ildr tough take doesnt drop good decision bring it back out Applause again I I I think with Carr being out on that perimeter booth and Davis they have that advantage and be able to go by rooper gets his own Miss tries to find Shrewsberry intercepted by Music hildr Salis into traffic ripped away Marcus Burton and hell get two at the line he is a fun player to watch explosive three steals tonight 19 points you know this freshman hes making a case for ACC freshman of the year and I and Im going to make a comparison Jay a guy that I used to to play with at Syracuse who I think was one of the best to ever do to come to cuse the Johnny Flynn whoa thats high praise for for Burton not saying he is Johnny Flynn but Johnny Flynn he was much more athletic he could shoot it better but Bert has that potential if he continues to approve his jump shot his decision making you know I know hes only 511 but this guy is explosive Dynamic he plays with good pace and we talked to Coach Shrewsberry in shoot around hes a guy whose decision making has improved throughout the year and I think at his position I mean thats one thing that you want to be able to have is is an elite decision maker and hes turning into that well to your point about Flynn hes certainly an undersized guard that doesnt let his lack of height detract from his game 21 points tonight to lead the Irish and he is on Pace to do something that no one has ever done in Notre Dame history which is average worth at 16 points four assists and two steals per game think about of all the great players that have played here at Notre Dame hed be the first to do that offensive rebound car contact no call great defense great possession by Notre Dame right there and Burton goes flying right into hildr and hildr is called for the blocking foul now hildr cant believe it Wake Forest the fourpoint lead Notre Dame battling the ACC tournament starts March 12th on ESPN lets take a look at the ACC tournament bracket projection this is entering the night and you know Wake Forest critical for them to get the double buy advance all the way to the quarterfinals if they can hang on to that four seat yeah you know what we talked to Coach Forbes earlier I I think hes just focusing on one game at a time and you want to be able to control your own destiny and how do you do that by winning this game and then focusing getting to the next game and winning that one you cant get too far ahead of yourself if you do you know thats when bad things happen obviously coming off what was their biggest win of the Season Saturday against Duke you want to follow that up with a road win tonight just just as you said keep stacking wins and the ACC standings and tournament will take care of itself and then getting seated in the NCAA tournament will take care of itself and with Wake Forest net at 25 that seems to be the the metric the committees been leaning on and the last couple of years I think they should feel very comfortable with their resume you just cant stub your toe tonight in South B and you know we talked about it earlier in the season they were playing without Reed a totally different team now with Reed on the floor and I think this game was a trap game after coming biggest win of the Season against Duke coming in into Notre Dame you know obviously you despite Notre Dames record that really doesnt show what type of team they are and theyre showing it tonight so wake Force you know still with 15 minutes left has their work cut out for him foul called against Wake Forest Andrew Carr with the hold thats his third so ball stays with not name underneath their own hoop trailing by four five minutes into this second half the Irish have done well to hang Music around big reason why Marcus Burton hes got 21 points to his name tonight find shrewbury in the corner left it way Applause Music short ELD tried to squeeze it into car kicked out of play you know what J on the offensive side of the ball for Notre Dame with how good Burton is getting to his spots all eyes are going to be on him so you know Notre Dame players have to be a good job of filling the spots getting to those open spots so they can get open looks but buron does a good job probing you know his teammates just have to move without the ball so they can see him and and get those open looks and and Shrewsberry is one of those guys who does a great job moving without the Music Applause Music ball heres bopy Miller and now hildr great handles hildr rejected at The Rim though couldnt finish it Carrie Booth with the block and Burton goes Coast to Coast to cut the lead in half I tell you what just seeing this guy in person I Im that much more of a fan how hard he goes to the basket putting the pressure downhill on the defense finishing off at two feet right hand on the left side hes having an excellent night tonight bur Frederickson couldnt knock down the corner three take another look at this great transition defense into offense and you know it was a good job of hilders getting into Lane playing off of two but its hard to finish over that length with Boot and then you see Burton coming down going head at boopy Miller finishing off of two feet two Marcus Burton tonight has 23 points that is half of Notre Dame scoring he leads all ACC freshman in scoring but 23 for him 23 for all the rest of the Notre Dame players combined well you know what Burton has to be uh you know tops in consideration for ACC Rookie of the Year and you know I havent seen all the teams playing college basketball but if you ask me this guy is one of the top freshman in all of the country mon Santo kick out triple cant connect Wake Forest getting a couple of good looks cant knock him down Shrewsberry he misses in transition his head coach and his father not happy with that shot sele and it leads to two on the other end hild is having himself a night just being aggressive to the basket and I love how hes in control on balance seems to always be playing off of two Applause feet foul off ball and Micah Shrewsberry living and we we talked about whats it like to coach your son well when you dont like a shot you react like that yeah you know the last eight games Shrewsberry has had 313 so I think he does have a little bit of the green light he just has to get his legs up under him a little bit more I mean he was on target just short but I mean shuberry is a guy who they need you know this offense to have a good offensive game you know being one of the elite Shooters in ACC play just not feeling it as much tonight he told us you know I try and treat him like I treat all my players but there are times where Im a little harsher harder on him yeah of course just being Dad out there you know first and foremost I think hes just ecstatic that he hes able to coach his son but hes trying to win basketball games too Jay so when hes not playing well hes going to let him know and he can do it over dinner a lob to booth at the rim and hes fouled so the foul starting to pile up for Wake Forest they already have seven committed fouls in this second half so Notre Dames going to be in the bonus for the remainder of this game thats 13 minutes plus of shoot shooting free throws on every foul and I tell you what when you have a guy like Marcus Burton on your side being in the bonus the rest of the half that puts a lot of pressure on the Wake Forest defense especially when Marcus Burton is in attack mode each time he has the ball Im impressed by Booth this game I I you know hes not average hes averaging eight points a game but hes a guy Five Points a game but hes a guy who has NBA potential um I just think sky is limit this guy hes doing it inside it out hes showing his versatility his athleticism youve been throwing NBA potential out at a lot of guys tonight Im starting to feel like Ive got NBA potential I tell you what Im Im the two guys Im talking to Davis booth and then obviously we got we got uh you know Marcus Brit those are the three guys that they really do with the length and athleticism that they have I mean they they do have an NBA skill set basketall and theyre young they have a lot of room to grow Im just giving youre a hard time oh yeah absolutely and I guess it runs in the family too with Booth right with Kelvin being you know a former Embry player now of the GM of the Denver Nuggets no doubt about it a lot of Talent on the floor a lot of talent in the ACC Booth hits the three and just like that Notre Dame back in front make me look good Jay Booth make me look good right here doing it inside and out see him icing the Irish on a 122 run over the last 5 minutes see Burton getting in the lane kicking it out Booth showing his versatility booth has been uh exceptional tonight on both ends of the floor and Wake Forest has gone cold at the wrong time they shot 60 in the first half just 16 in the second Carr misses it Marge cant tap home Wake Forest just one of their last 12 and it has allowed Notre Dame to grab the lead here 12 minutes too go in regulation stay in attack mode young fella in traffic gets his own Miss battles through it finds booth for three cant hit it this time what does Wake Forest need to do differently off defensively well they need to get good shots all the shots theyre taking right now are tough they got to get Salis involved or they got to get bopy Miller being able to drive and create but you know what Notre Dame was doing a great job defensively its funny when you score the ball you you want to go and play defense on the other end its funny how that works I I dont know I wasnt a guy who really liked to play defense J Id like to score though I tell you that Notre Dames been playing it dialed in defensively in this second half and thats been their calling card really this whole season defense and rebounding and now you see playing against a and there he is Salis weve been waiting for you seven points tonight he is double figures in every game this Applause season Kev knocking down Matthew March righty hook falls with the backboard coming in handy there sometimes we need it back and forth we go on a Tuesday night in the ACC Wake Forest trying to avoid stubbing their toe here in South Bend Miller cant connect Ball B bounces to Shrewsberry you know what Burton has been doing and not only on this end but hes been playing really good defense on boy Miller whos exceptional offensive player Shrewsberry cant connect again hes got a couple of good looks just cant find his stroke from three just one for seven from Deep tonight keep shooting the ball keep shooting the ball theyre going to go in Burton too much another offensive rebound Music Applause these freshman playing unafraid against a Wake Forest team battling for their NCAA tournament lives the Music time the Wake Forest for the last few seasons they have lived on the bubble and same thing this year theyve been on Joe lardys bubble really since the beginning of the Season our ESPN braile just moving Wake Forest into his projected field into the last four buys after the big win against Duke the last thing Steve forbess team can do is after that b big win after getting into the projected field is losing this game in South Ben tonight yeah well I mean I think this is an NCAA tournament wi obviously they have to win tonight but I mean it just goes to show you how tough the ACC is you know we talk about Notre Dame whos at the bottom of the ACC and theyre fighting here at home against one of the top teams in AC see a Wake Forest but Wake Forest controls their own destiny if they can win tonight I think theyll secure NCAA tournament B and the metrics are great the numbers really support that wake force is no doubt an NCAA tournament team you just have to prove it this time of the Season theres just extra importance put on each and every game feels like every game in February and March is a quote unquote big game and wake Force has been great in February 52 the only loss are at Duke and at Virginia in fact we just showed you that they dont have a single quad three or quad four loss on their resume and you just dont want to stub your toe in South Ben Salis contested shot great defense by Notre Dame in this second half and I think especially on the road Jay you want to show the tournament committee that you could go away from home where Wake Forest is undefeated and you want to be able to win games on the road demon Deacon shooting just three of 18 in this second half its allowed Notre Dame to come back and take the lead Davis open three too much on Applause Music Applause it Miller Lost to dribble trying to do too much yeah just out of control right there Demon Deacons in a thre minute scoring drought you got to see you got to see the mismatch right now get with Boop there they go they recognized it shot clock down to four Carrie Booth pull up pop missed it offensive rebound stays alive with ji he cant finish it Music Applause Music Demon Deacons desperate for a bucket struggling in this second half Salis nothing but air Wake Forest is now shooting three of 19 from the field in this second half its allowed Notre Dame to poke in front onepoint game 73 well for as good an offensive game as it was in the first half its been equally strong defensively in the second half both teams making great adjustments defensively and they have been dialed in look at the difference first half to second half for Wake Forest down more than 40 from the field yeah well we know Notre Dame is one of the toughest defensive teams in the conference and and Wake Forest is a solid defensive team as well I think the difference right now is the rebounding the offensive rebounding Notre Dame is doing get allowing their themselves to get second chance opportunities and then the free throws 13 for 16 overall and then 6 for seven for Wake Forest a Wake Forest had a ninepoint lead in this second half since that point Notre Dame on a 144 run in front by Applause one weve said it throughout the night but rightly or wrongly because Notre Dame playing a lot better than their record in the last couple of weeks this would be because of the metrics a damaging loss to the Wake Forest NCAA tournament resume we just told you that Joe lardy has the Demon Deacons in his projected field I think their resume would reflect that but this would be a puncture even though its a conference Road game Burton makes the front end of the one and one you dont want to lose to a team thats 10 and 17 when the entire committee is watching you very closely because youre on that bubble yeah and we talked about it coming off big win you know biggest win of the Season against Duke coming into Notre Dame this this was the Trap game and Marcus Burton is doing you know all he can do to make sure Notre Dame pulls off this upset Burton now up to 25 points tonight Salis is struggled he only has seven averages 20 be Carr who finishes and what do you do when youre struggling as a offensive player you still got to be aggressive you got to look into the lane and be able to get others involved and there you see him with the drop off the car and Cars getting himself involved Shrewsberry a three rims in and out no good he is just one for eight from Deep tonight and the Freshman coming into the night 45 from three in ACC play he has been ice cold that rims out no Applause good Corner three Booth Miss fires so Notre Dames Fallen cold as well both of these teams have really cooled off Jay regardless of the shots not falling you got to continue to stay aggressive especially with Notre Dame being in the bonus you got to stay aggressive theyve been doing a great job getting to the free throw line and there you see boo Miller doing a good job of drawing the foul now the Irish have missed their last eight shots one of their last 11 and yet they still have a one point lead in this game yeah like I said theyre doing a good job of continuing to be aggressive getting to the foul line and and getting their points from the foul line right now Carr lines up a three cant connect Wake Forest shooting four of 22 from the field in this second Applause half Booth driving on Carr heres the fr Im drives to the hole rejected by Salis great defensive play showing his athleticism Miller Coast to Coast too much on it cant finish at the rim and now up ahead Burton transition three Off the Mark yeah I dont know about that one right there Jay Im attacking the basket we already in the bonus getting in there getting to the body I know Reeds a bigger guy but get your body into his chest and get to the free throw line Applause Salis got lucky there you know Sal hes playing hesitant Reed cleans up the spill time out Steve Forbes Wake Forest back in front we step aside this is a fun finish in the East now the dancing leprechaun might be the highlight of the second half this has been ugly basketball from an offensive perspective Eric dorf Jay alter with you Notre Dame has missed their last 10 shots but their defense is keeping them in it 5 minutes to play only trailing by one well yeah I mean you see right here Notre Dame is one of the best defensive teams in the ACC and I think probably one of the best defensive teams in the country you know Houston is the best team in the defensive team of the country allowing only 55 points but I mean Notre Dame thats what their staple was this season rebounding in defense and they could be scary once they put this offense together Wake Forest coming in averaging 79 points per game theyre stuck at 56 clinging to a onepoint lead they would love to close out this road win even if its ugly they just want to escape Southbend with a critical win really to just avoid a loss that would puncture their NCAA tournament resume Burtons killed them all night into contact off the window and in Marcus Burton 27 points tonight tough finish using his body hes 511 going in there Jay amongst the trees using his body contouring finishing with the right hand hes a special special player Irish back in front by one Miller rejected Burton from behind Marcus Burton has done it all tonight A special performance for a freshman who very well could end up the ACC freshman of the Applause Music Applause Year shot clock down to Applause eight Davis on the drive T Davis right to the rim for two yeah we talked about the advantage that Davis has going against Carr bringing him out on the perimeter he just took advantage of it right there getting all the way to the hole with a tough finish reach in foul we step aside 334 to go Notre Dame a threepoint lead Marcus Burton has been the Superstar all night he is willing the Irish to the Finish Line on both ends of the Music floor too shy of tying his career career high he is battling for this win it would be the best win of the season for Notre Dame the best win of the Mike Shrewsberry era 334 to go and this young Irish team leading a very talented Wake Forest team by three because of Burton and I tell you what man he he he is just a tough guard hes so hard not to follow hes hes quick he uses his angles and his body to get to his spots I mean hes having an excellent game on both ends of the floor and and I am a even bigger fan after watching him tonight Marcus Burton is one of the top freshman in the country and while this would be the best win of the season for Notre Dame it would be the worst loss of the year for Wake Forest they are undefeated in Quad three and four games havent lost one of them this would be a quad three game Reed on the Block goes with the righty hook and catches in and you just think you know they got to be able to go down to their big guys and try to be able to play play out of the post look at the double team kick out either Salis or goopy Miller and play off of those long Applause Closeouts the hot hand Burton pull up pop sticks it ties a career high 29 hes just having his way that was good action coming off the dho right there getting to his spot getting into his midrange pull pullup hes just having his way Applause tonight hildr lobs nobody home but a foul off the ball will stay Wake Forest ball hey J we we talked about it in the beginning of the broadcast just S as being a you know first team all ACC potentially but you see him right now just standing in the cour if Im him regardless of the game that Im having right now I want the ball I want to be aggressive you know I want to look to get into the pain to make plays for myself and my teammates he cant shy away right now with 238 left he has to be able to look to be aggressive and get the ball in his hands Fon Reed makes the front end of the one and one oh and as the postseason push continues on the womens side Thursday you dont want to miss it nothing but net right here on the ACC Network theyll tell you everything you need to know in womens basketball the best conference in the sport nine womens teams projected in Charlie creams NCAA tournament field Wake Forest currently projected on the mens side and Joe ns tournament field who knows if that would change if they cant win tonight in South Bend same action right there getting Burton in the hand off Davis battling puts it up no good dont run away from it Salis come look to get the ball and be aggressive Salis only seven points tonight he has scored in double figures every game this year except this one feed into Reed couldnt handle it thats a turnover and you know what right idea just the wrong pass 7 foot you cant throw it at his knees throw it up high to where he can get it and just go right up now wake having to bring a little full core Music Applause pressure there you go thats who needs to have the Music ball 29 Points tonight ties a career high the freshman in attack mode down the lane floater doesnt fall kept alive shot clock doesnt reset Shrewsberry HS it Bren Shrewsberry buries it keep shooting the ball Jay regardless of the game hes having shoot he hits a big one tough Left Hand by Boy Wake Forest the instant boopy Miller timeout Steve Forbes Shrewsberry before that made three just one for eight from three but he made the biggest of the night Notre Dame clinging to a twopoint lead we stepped un finish here in South Ben and its the coachs son Braden Shrewsberry who drills a clutch three yeah and you see him right here not having the best shooting night but knocking it down when it matters Jay and then you see on the other end Miller with a tough finish with the left hand in the lane wake for is down by two and Miller leads the Demon Deacons with 15 Wake Forest trying to avoid what would be their first quad three or four loss of the Season tonight that just after you get your biggest win of the Season against Duke on Saturday trying to avoid stubbing their toe here in South B and you know what I think coach Forbes knew it coming in that this was going to be a tough game on the road against a much improved Notre Dame team the Irish have won three of their last four but if they can hold on this would be by far their biggest win of the season one minute remaining in regulation Davis great pass blocked Fon Reed swatted it and now heres Salis off his foot who did it go off of last the officials say it touched Salis obviously theyll review this at the monitor lets take another look Salis built up ahead of steam yeah kick it off his right Music foot so this is going to be Notre Dame ball with 49 seconds remaining Irish a twopoint lead Wake Forest only one timeout remaining Notre Dame with three yeah J Im just giving it to my best player the guy whos been the best player on the floor the whole night Marcus Burton get him in that high ball screen and just let him go off and make a Music Applause Music decision now the demon Deon squarely on the bubble feels like theyve lived on the bubble the last three seasons the last two years they missed Stout this year theyre trying to squeak in look at their remaining schedule at Virginia Tech Saturday they Georgia Tech Clemson at home where they are undefeated where the Demon Deacons resume is weak is outside of Winston Salem just three and nine away from the Joel two and seven in True Road games you said it earlier dvo tonight would prove look we can win on the road they have 49 seconds to try and change their FA their F and you know what I I think a loss here on the road against Notre Dame would all but you know really diminish that win Sunday against Applause Duke yeah that Duke win best of the Season vaulted them into a lot of projected Fields would this loss knock them out Applause perhaps and this would be by far the biggest win for Notre Dame in the Micah Shrewsberry Applause era see Bon use this whole clock go down about 9 or eight see Davis going into the ball side ball screen right here shot clock down to 10 Burton starts to move down to Davis working on Carr trying to muscle it in and he does was tough by Davis getting positioned to a spot using his body to finish over a taller car Miller draws the foul with 183 two possession gain see right here Davis getting low getting into the chest creating that space with that little bump right there then going right up for the Applause Finish Hiller shooting one and one 84 on the season from the line missed it but it stays Wake Forest way theyll review it at the monitor which really acts as a free timeout for Wake Forest to the Demon Deacons could use that cuz theyre only down to one yeah but that thats a big Miss Right There by Boy Miller being able to knock him down by two or knock two down and be down by two and then be able to set up the full court press the car pokes his hand through but who touched it last Davis or Carr I cant really tell thats your best angle right there yeah I think they made the right call Davis followed through on it so it would be Wake Forest ball underneath their own hoop trailing by four well Jay you got to get a quick look right here out of the out of bounds you know whether its a quick shot or you know quick Cross screen right into the finish it at the rim and then set up your full court press and even though Hunter Salis has struggled tonight a season low seven points hes been your most consistent player all season do you feel like you got to go to Salis here well yeah I mean Im either going to boy Miller or sales unless you want to try to get Reed into a cross streen where he can just get it low and then go right up for the Finish but then if you do make it you got to be able to set up into your full court press right away I think go for the steel quick if you dont get it you got to foul right away and you know Notre Dames been doing a good job at the free throw line knocking him down but how about this win Jay if if Notre Dames able to hold on and pull it out and we talked about the Improvement that Notre Dame has been making throughout the season this would be a probably one of the biggest win of the season for Notre Dame no it would be would be their best stand now Roger SS comes over and says call on the floor stand so Wake Forest ball 17 seconds remaining in regulation poopy Miller is the Music Applause Music inbounder there it is Salis got a clean look left it short Miller tosses it to nobody and its Notre Dame ball with 122 seconds and even though it was a great play coming off wide open shot you couldnt ask for a better look see right here coming off you know what the shot it just seemed lack ofical the shot Sal doesnt see the whole game he doesnt seem like hes been engaged just two for 11 from the floor a season low seven points and Wake Forest in real trouble here now cuz its Notre d ball Micah Shrewsberry took a timeout still has two remaining and with a fourpoint cushion the Irish just need to kill the final 12 seconds of this game and again day I think this just goes to show what type of conference the ACC is you know Notre Dame 10 and 17 5 11 in conference going against a you know top four top five team in Wake Forest the AC cc is one of the best conferences in in college basketball without question well you and I agree on that Notre Dame has to take care of the ball right here Davis the inbounder squeezes it to Burton who will go to the line still shooting one and one Applause here and Burton with a Chance to go over 30 and add to what is already a career Music high I think whats impressive about Burton is its its not only hes doing it on the offensive end but hes doing it on the defensive end as well you know going against a guy like bopy Miller who is you know as crafty as they come and hes done a great job defensively this whole game and Burton is a perfect 9 for n from the foul line tonight so this is the last guy you on at the foul line if youre Wake Music Forest so they add a little more time onto the clock Burton steps to the line the weight of this game on the freshmans shoulders shooting one and one Wake Forest down to one timeout nothing but the bottom of the net for Burton 30 points tonight a career Applause high only the fourth Notre Dame freshman with a 3point game and now its a sixpoint lead for the Irish Now or Never time for Wake Forest Miller lot of time coming off the clock car a three hits it cuts the lead in half one possession game Steve Forbes uses his final timeout 39 seconds remaining yeah you see right here got to push it up got to get something quick good job by Carr popping out knocking it down and Notre Dame right here they just got to be able to get inbounds the ball get it in and and know wake Force has to foul him get it to your best fou shooter bird hes now 1111 from the line and for Wake Forest you have to feel you mentioned it throughout the night Eric Trap game trap game well they came out very focused they had a n point lead in the second half couple of times this year they have led on the road pit and NC State come to mind and they just havent been able to finish and theyre falling into a similar theme tonight yeah well I mean you got to give credit to Notre Dame we talked about you know last Saturday against Syracuse being down 26 at half despite the loss the effort and the enthusiasm never left they fought back they only lose by three you know same type of deal here you know get down they continue to fight they continue to fight and now it looks like theyre going to be on the windy end of things in this game well you still got to inbound this ball Wake Forest out of timeouts Notre Dame still with two its interesting right here they having Burton inbound the ball oh wow okay now very creative to throw it to Davis who then inbounded it to Shrewsberry and he actually ran more than a second and a half off the Applause clock I guess thats the uh basketball version of the Flea Flicker yeah maybe exactly Music yeah and that is legal after a make you have the ability to run on the baseline or pass it on the Baseline so long as the person is fully out of bounds and for Cameron hildr his night is done five fouls he has fouled out of this game and it is Applause still Shrewsberry at the line to shoot two two possession game a huge free throw make with only two seconds left shrewsburys got him both Micah Shrewsberry telling his team not to foul the inbound comes in the Miller a half court heave its not going to matter Notre Dame earns their biggest win of the Micah Shrewsberry era and
