of the New Year Pat Driscoll John Gaffney Matt Potter our officials just the second Road Third Road game of the season for Louisville and they control the opening tap the aforementioned Chucky heurn getting us going here for the Cardinals heper High post for James Scott sophomore lays feed inside for the back cutting Waterman who finishes off the glass I love it you go run your offense to one side of the floor knowing that Virginia is going to flow in some of their packline defensive systems you get down get a guy cutting from the corner and it helps when Noah Watermans right at 7 ft tall able to finish UVA starting five today including tane Murray a late change DayDay Ames had been starting for the Cavaliers hell come up the bench today a deep three the shot clock winding down just grazes the front of the rim the attempt by Andrew roie the starting five for the Cardinals and their record of nine and five on the season heurn is the headliner Noah Waterman the first basket of the game also had the gamewinning basket a week ago against Eastern Kentucky in a tight Victory heres heurn one dribble into the threepointer that comes up short and Isaac McNeely the rebound and into the front Court threepoint shots theyre going to present themselves whenever you play against Virginia you have to have good shooting nights and its going to have to be over High hands quick foul call Terrence Edwards you got to jump to the basketball cant let that guy get around McNeely had a step going to the basket Edwards called for the foul just underway here a little more than a minute gone by in Charlottesville Kofi the impressive looking freshman out of Seattle getting better and better as he has entered the starting lineup mcney stop fall back and a smooth touch for Isaac mcney a born scorer saw him for the first time they better get back in transition that cannot happen when you play against Louisville theyre really trying to push the pace and the tempo those things cant happen Hadley beating everyone down Court second field goal for the Cardinals as they lead four to2 speaking of transition thats certainly always a key in a game that Virginia has evolved in absolutely and whenever that initial push just like that previous possession happens you have to get back in front and communicate if youre the Cavaliers because Louisville is really going to try to speed up this game and then on the opposite side Louisville in the half court theyve been able to generate quality looks throughout the course of the season they havent necessarily shot the ball all that well when the game slows down so youre going to have to find ways to manufacture some offense when going up against the packline defense T Murrays first free throw attempt is a good one the foul is against Noah Waterman his first Murray making just his second start of the Season averaging over 10 a game in his last three and he ties it early at four so heres heurn coming off a big performance in a New Years Day win over North Carolina had 26 points in that one for Louisville Edwards trying to get free on the far side backing his way in couple of pump fakes inside but he comes up short scooped up by roie great defense by McNeely staying vertical and letting the helps side come over and attempt to block the shot cant get off your feet when playing against Terrence Edwards loves to get to the foul line heres Saunders averaging over 18 over his last four McNeil would love to get free for a look there it is near the logo spins out and the rebound is taken by Hadley heer wents the pace into the front Court Murray switches on to him his pass is intercepted Virginia forcing the turnover Music there heres saers trying to get free dangerous pass Kofi now mcney shot clock under 10 against Scott couple spin moves switches to the left thats off the mark good defense by Scott James Scott terrific versatile Defender getting better and better on the offensive end really talented on that end of the floor though block shots switchable can stay in front its helpful when youre about 610 and can move laterally good looking athlete good job by UVA there getting back in transition back door cut for Edwards gathers underneath bottled up and still finds a sliver off the window now wheres the pass come from James Scott well the only thing he cant do right now in his career is shoot the basketball you get past that a lot of other valuable things he can do that helps with winning play started with Scott on the defensive end nice pass from underneath into the corner but Murrays line drop three is no good Kofi the offensive rebound Virginias missed four of its first five now roie Kofi puts it on the floor switches to the left hand counted at one for Jacob Kopi come on thats just silly 610 freshman from Washington able to put it on the deck you see why he has such a promising career in a Virginia uniform Drive left get around James Scott little up and over with the left hand Virginia Louisville just getting underway this is going to be a good one lot more relaxed and deservedly so he looks younger right now but its its braon Sanchez its a different time right now whenever youre trying to piece rosters together via the transfer portal its not quite the same so youre having to bend a little bit more as opposed to having the players Bend to what you want them to do over the course of four years so youre constantly adjusting and thats something he spoke with us about earlier today its a little bit of a different VI and you have to coach a different way than what theyve become accustomed to over the past 15 or so years that the staff had been here at Virginia part of Tony Bennett staff for several years two different stints in fact Jacob kofis free throw has given Virginia its first lead of the game Kofi to the bench Blake Buchanan is checked in and he commits his first foul of the game and just off the bench rain Smith Reigns one down from the corner to put Louisville back on top rain Smiths a bad man he can get hot and hit four five in a row on a given night did a game a couple of years ago at Charleston Pat Kelce said rain Smith is the greatest shooter on planet Earth now a little bit prone to hyperbole sure I think I would give Kobe Brea that nod right now at Kentucky especially the way hes playing lately but R Smith can get hot in a hurry hes going to need a big game today if youre going to go against his pack line Waterman from nearly the same spot off the back of the rim offensive rebound though by The Freshman Kai Roots heurn against Saunders cut off there gets it back still 10 seconds to shoot now hes trying to drive on roie from the left side little spin move along the Baseline and goes to the reverse come on thats just silly and it was great defense to begin with by ro staying in front keeping his discipline Chucky hurn just show Shifty little trouble getting it inbounds there Murray has to come back to help out near midcourt a good pressure here being shown by Louisville as they lead by four 5 and a half gone by here and Charlottesville you Canon a sophomore out of portline Idaho hands to roie two Defenders run at him and theres that man again heer coming up with the steel in transition down the lane off the knee of Javon Hadley its out of bounds itll go back to UVA good defense there getting back by the Cavaliers yeah terrific defense and they had the numbers got a little bit lucky that he brought the basketball down around his waist but on the other end of the floor you have to protect the basketball when going up against Chucky head bur but nice job Andrew roie caught one in the forehead there as a result but turn the basketball over you got to get back in as a group second turnover committed by Louisville Day Day Ames is checked in been in the starting lineup for most of the season coming off the bench today heres ases the transfer from Kansas State isan Sharma also in a freshman out of Ontario the base line its Saunders staying hot and thats what hes good at you get him in the mid post and he can angle his way there cant turn around though you better get ready to play turnover number three Ruth stepped on the sideline right in front of the UVA bench before he made his move but you see early in this game the contrasting Styles right Virginia very methodical willing to use the first 26 seconds of the clock on the other side you make a shot you better get back and communicate no home run tries against this Louisville team because theyre willing to shoot in the first 3 to 4 seconds and maintain that aggressiveness throughout the clock twopoint lead right now for Louisville Ames trying to find a seam in the defense jump stop and he kicks it back out for Sharma heres Saunders guarded by Tori who just checked in Sharma tripped up heurn trying to reach in and come up with another steal inadvertently tripped up isan Sharma isan Sharma like hes still figuring it out and how to be a productive college player but this was a guy that you see him drive down the middle heurn reaching in and trips Sharma nothing intentional but Sharma big time scorer for you play Canada comes to Virginia and now hes having to learn how to do winning things other than scoring and thats something that was the biggest emphasis today well youre not scoring all the time now that youre at a new spot how can you impact winning and that goes for sh and also goes for TJ power the man who just made that swing pass number 23 Second your man transfer from Duke power on the floor for the first time start of the season in the starting lineup for the first five games shot clock winding under five Ames has a look in and out from the right wing another rebound for Scott here theyre pushing again heurn being pestered by Ames Terrence Edwards Jr one of their leading scorers on the season quiet so far heres heurn trying to get a step high arker off the top of the backboard very high arker good ball movement here Sharma in the front court and now UVA into its offense I think the collective discipline defensively so far by Louisville for the duration of the clock has been pretty good the problem is you have to sustain that discipline for the entire game and you have to rebound thats exactly right possessions ases again Off the Mark Edwards clears the boards UV 0 for six from downtown heres Smith who came on hit his first from Deep hasnt had another look since Edwards working against roie pump fake inside uses his size advantage that was halfway down hasnt been a beautiful offensive game so far for either team but I I just continue to Marvel every time I watch Virginia play how well they just stay in front of the basketball they dont lunge out they dont reach they just focus on staying in front staying on balance if they make a tough shot like that one youre willing to live with it Andrew roie pretty talented young man off balance tough bucket heading into that timeout free throw coming trying to give Virginia the lead once again a transfer from St Thomas whose role has significantly changed here in Virginia since the beginning of his collegiate career yeah and he had to be a little bit more patient last season being a scorer when he transferred from St Thomas in Minnesota he was a Kyle Macy freshman of the Year award finalist because he was able to score the basketball so well now at Virginia much different role asked to begin the offense for Coach Ron Sanchez do a lot of different things for teammates its been an adjustment but over the course of the beginning of this year youve seen hes starting to get more comfortable now shooting almost 47 from three on top of initiating the offense is he turning it over sh but hes also being asked to guide the ship where at the beginning of the year that wasnt necessarily going to be his role on this team teren Edwards forcing the issue there gets himself to the free throw line first foul against DayDay miles edwardss first one is pure and heres next Saturday his ACC Network basketball triple header Clemson host Florida State and little John to start us off at 2 Eastern then North Carolina and NC State Square Off in Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech takes off Cal should be a great afternoon and evening of Hoops on acc Network Edwards splits the pair Sharma though has the ball out of bounds off of his foot so itll stay with the Cardinals tough mistake there for the young freshman but now you look at Louisville having to inbound the ball in the corner of the floor this is the hardest place to inbound the basketball but at least when youre trying to find a scoring position doesnt seem like thats going to be the case Smith trying to get free Sharma doing a good job to close out on him treor along the Baseline went up it was sent back by Kofi but he stays with it and finishes tror coming back just a few games back now from a broken arm but you saw the athleticism right there contest stays with it gets the two Kofi there can meet him at The Rim Im a big fan of Jacob Kofi and what hes going to be in the future a lot of natural skill big size solid athlete shoots a good ball here he is trying to make things happen off the dribble too strong off the glass rebound taken by Edwards Louisville has done a great job on the board so far there have been a lot of Misses theres treor from the perimeter again working against Applause Power and clear out for him power falls to the floor and tayori finishes again trayor had the power there nice move faces up attacks finishes over the top and you see what hes able to do Long Beach State transfer plays so hard and with so much force and physicality able to get a quick four points out him 12 of Louisvilles 16 points coming in the paint so far theyve opened up a fivepoint lead a Louisville team for a lot of this season has played with a sevenman rotation trayor has just returned that has helped a lot as Sharma cant answer from Deep kofs put back spins Applause out drori takes it off the backboard takes it all the way up Court tripped up inside the paint and took an extra step I would like to see that again and see where the extra step was because I didnt think he traveled quite frankly but youre still seeing it Virginia finding good shots just not able to connect Co missing a layup wide open three for sha on the opposite side of the floor and and heres the thing two freshman right against a Louisville team significantly older than them collectively got to be able to knock down shots the game hasnt quite slowed down enough for them to see success consistently theyre over seven from Deep 44 of their threes were made over the last two games heres Saunders theyd love to get him going some of those looks have been good ones Terence yeah they have Baseline Drive Baseline drift heres another one quick release roie 0 for eight another rebound for the partal in Hadley theres Waterman along the Baseline run into by Sharma who commits the foul his first heres the thing Virginias running good offense setting good screens getting good shots its the little things so on that last play for Andrew roie he gets open but the pass isnt there on time little bit of a bobble doesnt get his rhythm and it seems like theyre just half a step off in terms of either knocking down a shot or making that pass and put their guys in good position those little things add up it certainly do they certainly do when you dont score a lot not a lot of margin for error either I would imagine exactly knocked out of bounds good job defensively underneath by Buchanan you know its a unique challenge when you play against Pat Kels lisal team because if you miss a shot and youre back on defense theyre not calling plays so theres not necessarily A scouted situation for your defense thats a nice set too utan off the pump fake two Defenders go with him Hadley on Saunders flips it up gets the nice roll and its a sevenpoint lead they scored the last seven points have the Cardinals they just flow into the next best option right and thats what happens when you have so many older players you dont have to hover over him and call sets every single time the guys just understand how to play with each other nice fade thats the look that you want mcney from the corner stops the seven nothing run take the lid off mcney I love the footwork excellent shot in the corner and burn working on Roadie defense there by roie to cut him off great pass slip pass into the high post right back out Smith with a hand in his face short good box out by Saunders Loops ball scooped up CR into it a little bit its amazing what one threepointer can Music do heres Murray in the starting lineup Music today hatleys all the way up on Ro theyre trying to get a look Murrays pass was deflected out of bounds into the Louisville bench itll stay with the Cavaliers they Trail by four looking to get some offense generated in front of their home Music Applause crowd e e e e Music Isaac mcne got free for that threepointer a couple of moments ago UVA one for nine from downtown they would love to get him going yeah and youll see number 11 down at the bottom of your screen being guarded by Chucky heurn who loves a steal so were going to pause it right there he reads that Chucky hurns trying to cut through the screen or Play Over the Top he slips over to the corner and then watch the footwork as he turns his body feet set ball right in the numbers and fire away Isaac mcney finally takes the lid off for this Virginia team who struggled from the threepoint line early when you could shoot like that you do whatever you can for a look like that dont you thats exactly right you have to continue moving when youre playing against a player like Chucky watch your head off the inbounds and water was right there to break it up I mean what a terrific defensive play by Waterman understood he was beat didnt give up on the play thats a big time defensive effort Waterman 611 out of Upstate New York transfer from BYU and a host of other schools the well traveled man nice pass another lob pass inside Scott gathers good ball movement here around the perimeter Edwards loves it inside and theres James Scott forget about it thats what he does right terrific Lop threat vertical spacer James Scott starts it off with a nice Baseline pass ends up being rewarded for the unselfish play his 28th dunk of the Season ninth in the nation in that category heres Buchanan out of the post Murray passed on what seemed like an open look now hes matched up with Waterman shot clock under 10 Ro off the curl flips it up and Scott Skies again for another the Applause rebound if Im Coach Ron Sanchez I I know Virginia plays a certain Pace however tane Murray you cant pass up good opportunities that was an open shot that ball needs to go up Scott little pitch and catch here with heurn rolling to the basket again lilles got the shot clock at five so Edwards wants to go to work on Murray who blocks it out of bounds still 32 to shoot terrific defensive possession by Murray and you look at the lineup on the floor this is the group that started without Jacob Kofi youre a little bit bigger across the board but you stay on his hip stay vertical nice block shot rain Smith back in as Louisville looking to get a quick shot off here Edwards to the bench urn will throw it in five and a half assists a game for Chucky heurn to lead the Cardinals some extra curricular is happening right now y John Gaffney trying to get things situated Little Help from Pat Driscoll and were ready to go Smith trying to get free they have to lob it inside to Scott the quick touch pass Hadley just ahead of the shot clock got a good look those terrific scout team defense off the Bas line out of bounds they knew rain Smith was trying to go to that opposite corner Virginia all over it pitching catch here mcney hit his last one trying to get free again along the Baseline to a cutting Saunders nice floater from the paint and thats terrific two man game on the opposite side started by Blake Buchanan able to create just enough of a highway to get to the paint and create a little bit of something again its Louisville hurrying it up Court Smith against the taller Buchanon lobs it inside and theyre not going to count that was that going in we would have to take a another look at it but I was a little bit shocked at how quick it went through after James Scott slides over you see James Scott stuck a little bit on an island this was a nice pass slash shot SL Im not quite sure yeah the ball was going in I think that was going in I dont think intentional yeah it was over the cylinder good call it was a lob for Scott tough to lay off of those as he just finished one a moment ago but the basket doesnt count so Louisvilles lead is four and I reference this earlier with Tay Murray in Virginias offense you have to take the first Best Shot available because Andrew roie typically an offard before he came here very smart player but they dont have this break you down off the bounce guy that theyve had in recent years to create some open looks you get a shot available you need to take it Saunders trying to create here takes a peek at the shot clock Little Fall Away from the paint and Elijah Saunders out of Phoenix starting to heat up so talented more explosive vertically than people given him credit for a big fan of what Sanders is able to or Saunders is able to do give him six points Virginia back within two Smith doesnt need a lot of room that time back rims it UK Canan grabs the rebound off the caram see rain Smith though it goes off the flare screen catches it doesnt bring it down you said it doesnt need a lot of space he can get hot in hurry hes dangerous that ones the collected Murrays attempt deflected on the perimeter Louisville has numbers if they hurry Hadley drives right at Roadie purns three rims out Cardinals have missed their last six Virginia could tie or take the lead here with a three good move by roie to the basket and were tile 20 i love it use the defense is physicality against them nice move to the middle and spin back to the right Ro using his size to get up over the top Crow into it at jpj Arena to the basket ruths tough shot late whistle hell go to the line for two and a good call sevenpoint lead a 92 Run for the Cavaliers to tie it a 20 finally able to get some looks around the rim because both teams right now combined two of 17 from three its kind of a crazy thing because you look at both rosters player for player and you would think these are two good shooting teams mcne can knock down shots Murrays been known to knock down a shot or two Ro same thing then you look over at Lille Waterman whos not on the floor now was a good shooter last year at BYU they just havent really found the Rhythm two free throws good for the Freshman out of Washington DC Kai Ruth he goes to the bench abubacar trayor who has given Louisville a big Lift Off the Bench in this first half hes back in heres roie heon giving him some space Jacob cop hes been playing really well quiet so far here in the first half mcnees is trying to get free his pass deflected by Smith here come the Cardinals tayori hes athletic to the basket against Kofi switches hands no good nice transition defense by Kofi yeah terrific job getting back hurrying to get in front and using your size and I cant get over the strength of Kofi as a freshman treor is not a weak individual he just bounced off of him hes very well put together comes up with another steal here heres Edwards from the wing Kofi Cuts him off again Smith off the pump Pi look at the feed inside for tayori and thats communication right you get in you dont get the initial fast break opportunity sure L will show some patience passes back out miscommunication on defense leads to an easy one Virginia if they set their defense so tough to guard nice pass he he jumped over that man he waited him out though and was off balance shot no good he did jump right over him drawing oo and Oz from the crowd here Trays got six points off the bench and limit time in this first half Smith he likes that spot forget about it he got to bring it down a little bit more there Chucky heurn on one end jumping over the offense and on the for Louisville out of the last timeout answering a 92 Virginia Applause run points have been at a premium especially for the Cavaliers MC Neely from the logo cuts it to four he never stops moving eight points for mcne Edwards trying for the quick answer comes up short out of bounds back to UVA yeah Im not going to lie I hate that shot thats tough but McNeely if youre defending him you better never stop trailing you go under a screen forget about it we saw it earlier with Chucky heer going over top you go underneath at the top of the at the top of the Court you can forget it there too and hes going two for a dollar terrific pass up top Murray had a really good look straight on couldnt connect Here Comes Applause Smith heurn oneonone with Murray cut off coming up in a minute and a half to play in the first half heer again around Murray just grabs him from behind as heer clearly had the step McNeely on one side of the floor is Relentless in his moving without the basketball if youre guarding Chucky heurn on the other end you can never relax he attacks gets stopped backs out reack a ball of energy on both sides of the floor and so difficult to defend 82 free throw shooter tonight after the conclusion of our basketball triple header with nothing but net crew will get you caught up on the day around the ACC coverage is expected to start at 8 Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN app heer hits some both a sixpoint lead for Louisville each team with five f FS with a minute and a half to play until halftime dday aims back in for Virginia its roie up top for Kofi Saunders working hard down low tayori bodying him on the Block mcne starting to heat up shot clock under five Ros got to create tough shot from the foul line area really tough shot nice job we have some extra jawing Elijah Saunders and Trey or getting after it in the low post on both ends of the floor here Scott hands it back to heurn under a minute to play Scott rolling to the basket trar is going to let fly from the wing and he gets the friendly roll on the road no less hey thats extra work in the gym we call that a members bounce its what we call that hey its no surprise when trayor is in the game Louisville has been s significantly better a menace on the defensive end of the floor his activity is contagious and then these two guys defensively really a handful wow this is phenomenal and Im not sure that was a foul I disagree wholeheartedly theyre sitting right in front of us for that Chucky heurn is cutting off every angle Relentless effort here by Chucky heurn again poking at the ball staying in front never losing balance I mean this is that he Day Day Ames gave him the ball thats not a foul terrific defensive possession and that one hurts because hes the head of the snake to everything you do on both ends of the floor he goes to the bench with two fouls next foul will put Virginia in the bonus but were under 15 seconds to play until halftime shot clock is off Ro gets a screen MC Neely trying to get free roie all the way to the basketb free slipped through two Defenders just ahead of the buzzer slipper is Andrew roie tal mcney does have the two threepointers trayor nine points in the first half he had five in the entire season coming into todays game Virginia ball to begin the second half trailing by five Andrew Ro had eight points in the first half Saunders had six see if they can get McNeely going a little bit more held that pivot foot shot clock under 10 his pass is picked off and then a foul after the play committed by Jacob Kofi I love James Scotts activity and and look hes going to be a lob threat defensively but hes got incredibly quick feet whenever hes playing post defense hes pretty frail relative to some of the Players Hell play in the front Court in the ACC but hes so quick and so active he makes up for a lot of those things two points four boards and three assists so far in this one 611 220 out of fville North Carolina just a sophomore Edward steps back a couple of times side rims it Louisville after a N9 for 16 start from the field theyre three for their last 12 Tay Murray has been really physical on both ends of the floor and Waterman able to take advantage crashing the offensive glass but you look at Terrence Edwards who ticked that shot I talked to Pat Kelce about him before the season started and hes one of those guys you have to let play a little bit like you you have to let him take a tough shot every now and then because when nothings going he can get it going on his own because hes always in attack mode so youre willing to live with some of the mistakes appropriately scored basket for him there as you were describing his game staying with it inside this is the third time this afternoon Louisvilles had a sevenpoint lead their largest of the game McNeely looking for the high screen hes got to get free slip pass inside Kofi it was bumped by Edwards no excuse me by Applause Waterman this tough but Louisville doing a nice job defensively keeping the ball on one side of the floor whenever you play against Virginia these elongated offense they like to shift the defense second and third side offense theyre having a hard time moving the help side if youre Virginia Louisville doing a really nice job heres off the curl again McNeely shot clock under 10 Edwards working McNeely steps back finds some room in the corner halfway down another rebound for Scott tough shot there for Isaac mcney on the other end its heurn all the way to his spot muscles his way to the basket giving up about 4 in in height Chucky heurn jump stop ball fake uses the ball fake to create space wasnt an offensive foul creates easy look six points for Chucky heer their leading scorer on the season Ill say this they just ran that exact same play for Isaac mcney because the ball pressure was so Good by Javon Hadley not able to find anything wow that another logo three he knocks it down hes got 11 and pulls Virginia back with at six but again its Louisville hurrying it up court in response to a UVA bucket Rumor Has It thats pad o ke range you read The Scouting Report threepointer Hadley well off the mark but theres Scott for another rebound inside Edwards getting free passes on the open look rolling to the basket his pass is knocked Away by McNeely Here Comes Murray running the floor soers up and in over Waterman how about that for athleticism was that Virginia playing early in in the clock am I confused what a finish back to within four Waterman trying to answer its an airball remember UVA had a big second half in their win against NC State on New Years Eve heres Ro slip pass Kofi spin move on the Block spins back the other way switches to the left hand its a twopoint game and Pat Kelce wants to slow the momentum as Virginia has clawed back in were not used to seeing this all that often Pat but Virginia the team thats often running in a fast break and who finishes Elijah Saunders Up Up and Away Virginia is this a mini run sure seems like it like they had on Tuesday against NC State when they erased a 10point halftime deficit 7 for 13 from three in that second half when it rains it pours its just a matter of if you can get a couple of sprinkles before everything starts going but uh really nice performance for Virginia finally starting to put some things together under Ron Sanchez down 14 that means you have to hit shots and this is Virginia team throughout the past bunch of years that hasnt been great at playing from behind thats certainly encouraging if youre a Cavaliers fan Elijah Saunders a careerhigh 22 points in that win on New Years Eve seven straight points for Virginia that run comes to an end courtesy of a rain Smith three pointer meanwhile we have a foul underneath the basket its against sers the basket counts the threepointer counts for rain Smith and the Cardinals will get possession after the shot so the shot goes off knockdown foul called after the shot on Elijah Saunders who now gets an earful from Ron Sanchez thats a big possession Virginias making their way back into this game playing well that could be six points right there its not he comes up short but he chases down his own rebound third attempt on this possession that ones also no good Waterman battling inside and he goes over the back good box out inside by TJ Applause Music Applause power Pat Kelce thinking Noah Waterman had possession before the contact looking for an explanation he had the size Advantage John Gaffney not going to give him one Gaffney let a lot go as play continued he finally blew the whistle so Waterman to the bench it has been really physical inside about 10 to 12 ft of course its had to be because there hasnt been a ton of made shots up until the last two three Applause minutes heres power passes on the open look mcney trying to get free two Shooters matched up here power from the left wing comes up short Robinson chases down the long rebound on the corner Anthony Robinson just checked in for the first time down the lane Buchanan shot is no good hit the back of the rim heurn trying to spin away from trouble and he was fouled by power and if youre Buchanan you have to finish that right you get up an offensive rebound got to find that shot Louisville playing really well and getting all those extra half back home and he always talked about this was the next step in his basketball Journey if you will coming back to coach and I think its pretty cool but watch your head look at the drawn up play out of the timeout another slam dunk for James Scott hes got four Louisville back to a sevenpoint lead no but I think its cool whenever players come back and want to be a part of the program and want to help uh both of those guys have homes here at Virginia and now moving it on to the next batch of players Ro trying to answer from the far Wing in front of the UVA bench does so a fourpoint game Ros got 11 thats the Andrew roie that a lot of people in the summit League became accustomed with heer gets a step right to the basket in and out RO with his head up heer Cuts him off Ames now joins the party from the back court and we got a whistle away this ones against Anthony Robertson Robinson the sixth turnover for the Cavaliers and his first Applause foul so Virginia had a chance cut the lead to two or one needing another stop here still plenty of time in the second half Ames runs with heurn Smith gets free too strong another offensive rebound Edward Skies looking for his shot Ro Cuts him off now Edwards wants to go to work jump stop finds the cutter heer reverse layup no but he drew the foul but how about the pass from Terrence Edwards reestablishes himself in the post backs in good cut from Chucky heurn nearly a phenomenal finish its already the sixth foul against UVA its been more physical its been much more physical in this second half and as the SL the the game slows down there just going to be more so second foul against DayDay Ames Robinson getting a lot of playing time here in the second half and weve got to whistle away from the ball underneath and again were going the other way McNeely found his way on the Applause floor abar trior with the foul Applause tror incredible job in the first half injecting some energy doing some of the other things especially on the defensive end kind of what he brings to the table though those extra toughness plays heres Virginia down by four theyve only LED for 22 seconds in this game McNeely along the Baseline cut off by trayor trying to free himself up for a look Robinson lob pass deflected Kofi stays with it shot clock at one Kofi doesnt hit the rim play continues and now they recognize its a violation I I I I want to point this out right now rign Smith gets stuck on a switch and battles his backside off to make the pass difficult and because the pass is difficult and thrown High James Scott realizes that he can come down and help at the end of the shot clock when youre a smaller guard and you have to switch off like that just maintain your verticality and your physicality when Switched Off a bigger player urn turning the corner finds the cutter abubakar trior with 11 Off the Bench my goodness how good is Chucky Hepper goes Baseline helps a second late terrific pass treor just academic at that pointor gets off the ground in a hurry Neely trying to get free catch shoot off the mark and Scott able to save the rebound heres heern again a hop in his his step Louisville by six heurn just working on AES inside the pain finds the cutter again two times in a row trayor just making his way to the basket its amazing what whats happening with tors man and its Kofi a freshman whenever the balls picked up hes turning his head and trayor is cutting right off his backside done a really nice job largest lead of the afternoon so far for Louisville an eightpoint advantage FES sometimes just to run to the basket yeah a little 45 cut Kofi coming over a little bit on help and thats not his help position thats not Kofi excuse me thats Anthony Robinson he gets over there on help side thats not his help its the other guy in the far Corner hes supposed to drop uh you got to know where your guy is but trayor knows youre on that opposite 45 as soon as you see the back of your defenders head you cut to the rim and your players will find you Ro gets a look after the defender fell down he rushed it tayori grabs the rebound quickly the other way Hadley looking for some opening Smith coming off a curl his pass deflected saers steps up numbers for Virginia Ro to the basket switches to the left hand and its fouled by rain Smith I thought rain Smith got back in front and played his verticality pretty well but regardless cant turn over the basketball this was this was a nice play by Andrew roie whos quietly putting himself together a nice ball game 11 points four boards three assists Ron Sanchez said hes our smartest player so hes being forced into a point guard position more natural score to begin with but had success at the point and he still has to score as he does here first free throw good heres next Saturdays ACC Network

state was slowed down here on New Years Eve against these Cavaliers but they Trail now 4539 after Ro pulls them closer Kofi inside tayori stays with it shot clock did reset to 20 tayori along the Baseline goes to the reverse and is fouled Louisville fans have been waiting to see what treor is this is what AB bubacar trayor is All Hustle cutting to the rim those other things the offensive glass in continually attacking look at this offensive rebound toughest guy quickest man of the ball gets out sees that he can take Kofi off the bounce and while its not the prettiest thing hes always putting pressure on whoever hes matched up with Music Toris first is good this is his third game back he returned last Saturday against Eastern Kentucky after he had missed 10 games with a broken left arm its a Louisville team that has been besieged by injuries this season theyve already lost Corin Johnson for the season theyve already lost case prior for the season and case prior was arguably their best player 610 could score it put it on the deck kind of a wing forward kind of player uh that one really hurt and that and taking into account that they had two players coming into the season they knew were going to red shirt with Ali Khalifa transfer from BYU among those Kobe Rogers the other terrific defensive player who followed Pat from Charleston as did a couple of other Louisville Cardinals heres Saunders from the top quick release adley with his head up drives right at Murray keeps going off balance shot but Waterman grabs another offensive rebound out to trayor kicks it outside Edwards faking the pass and deflected into the Louisville bench they just keep going and grabbing the offensive glass and Louisville has done that at a high level 12 offensive rebounds Virginia 14 defensive rebounds thats not a recipe to for Success Louisville even though theyre not shooting the ball all that well still finding extra opportunities around the bucket so far today when Louisville misses There is almost a 5050 chance that they will grab the rebound nearly a turnover out of the timeout heurn lets fly from Deep another chance at an offensive rebound will not come as Waterman threw bur to the ground but still the same thing applies take a long three towards the end of the shot clock and not only that and this is a small thing Pat but when they attack the offensive glass from the wings if theyre in the corner of the Wings they go through the foul line and they go on the top side of the guy boxing them out and the reason being is youre eliminating any transition offense for the opposing team if they do dont get the offensive re or yeah if they dont get the offensive rebound Noah Waterman just picked up his fourth personal foul so he goes back to the Louisville bench the Cardinals have pulled off significantly from three also theyve missed their last five but here they are with an eightpoint lead isan Sharma back in the game out of the high post Saunders along the wing driving Murray cant hit the first one stays with it blocked against the backboard by Hadley and Sharma finally gets free for the floater but even so nice shot by Chara good but tane Murrays wide open thats a shot you have to take instead he put it on the floor Virginia on the offensive glass that time head bur off balance trayor trying to save it and he cannot good effort crowd here at Virginia starting to get a little bit more juice a little bit more energy and lets be honest too the first shot defense for Virginia has been pretty good they just havent been able to finish possessions louville is not shooting a high percentage today good crowd here John Paul Jones Arena 2 student still on break nearly a full house if not completely full theyre begging to bring energy you can just feel it at this point back door cut McNeely bottled up by two Defenders kicks it back out Kofi puts it on the floor to the basket that left hand is no good tayori skies for the rebound defense from Javon Hadley crossover jri hurn doesnt even go to the left hand slick finish inside just tough always probing the defense continuously attacking and he gets a tough matchup I I mean hes the Energizer Bunny hes got eight scored 26 when they beat Carolina on Wednesday under 10 minutes to play second half that lead back up to eight Saunders going to work Kofi was cutting didnt get there numbers Louisville Edwards out in front of the pack Smith leaves it off heurn down the lane another cutter Hadley cant finish neither can tayori uba catches a break there can they capitalize McNeals got a couple of logo threes already today around the Kofi screen get some daylight cant finish Saunders trying to Corral it and here comes Applause Music Edwards he always looking to make something happen finds the cutter in the corner Smith got wide open hes not going to miss too many of those come on but that I mean you look at Chucky heurn drives right hes cut off quick spin continues to attack and then R Smith understands if I just get the spots Chucky heurn so good hes going to put it on the money he relocates from the 45 to the corner gets there in a hurry catches it in Rhythm forget about it R Smith has a dozen this is the largest lead of the game Saunders again this has been an entertaining match up in the second half Saunders tayori tough shot by Elijah Saunders really nice move Saunders using his strength to create just enough space hes into double figures with 10 fifth straight game in double figures for Elijah Saunders under eight to Applause play UAs got to start getting some stops Sharma working against heper backing his way in heer burn tough fall away from the foul line the rebound bounces to Murray it might be the first tough look theyve taken over the past two or two and a half three minutes ball just kind of stuck it looks like HB bur a little bit fatigued right now the time out at the next whistle Saunders gets free along the Baseline no hesitation thats a really good shot for him yeah for him going over his right shoulder that spin move tough to defend and thats a shot that he relies on when times are hard the crowd trying to implore Virginia back into this game and Pat Kelce sensing his team needs a little bit of a break calls timeout yeah Chucky heurn he needs a break too little shimmy little shake a little right hand finish up and under thats a big time move and then two possessions later he says in the early going of the season four time ACC rookie of the week and I I think I want to throw in a couple of player of the weeks as well I mean supremely talented this Cooper flag and that whole team quite frankly is supremely talented and he just turned 18 years old a couple of weeks ago as rain Smith knocks down another one out of the timeout Louisville back up by 10 its the second time theyve run that play coming out of timeout last time I want to say it was in the Under 12 they ran it to the other side of the floor and he came over and hit in the exact same spot its his fifth threepointer tied for six in the nation in made threes coming into today with 48 Saunders gets free from the top that comes up short Edwards chases down the rebound were less than six and a half to Applause Music play Edwards with a hop cant finish taken by Applause Buchanan Cooper Flag by the way 24 points 11 rebounds today as Duke beat a good SMU team on the road 8962 and were going the other way thats an illegal screen against Blake Buchanan what you say what you say the points and the rebounds were 2411 is that good its okay seems decent for 17y old for an 18y old for somebody of any age be really good at 36 years Applause old but you see Terence Edwards driving Baseline Drive and what happens is the defense sinks in and a lot of times people turn their heads nice in scream for GRE Smith to come around to the 45 and like weve said time and time again today doesnt need much time or much space that was the third foul against Blake Buchanan on the offensive end Javon Hadley straight line drive right at Saunders and finishes off the glass six points for Hadley 50e man out of St Paul Minnesota transfer from Colorado its a modern day utility player quality Defender switchable Defender can guard one through four sometimes five he a really nice player they love this Baseline spin well its working for now as McNeely knocks it down from the Baseline giving in 13 back to a 10point Louisville lead as Louisville looks for its 10th win of the Season Smith with those five threepointers already crowd wanted to travel Matt Potter right there shakes his head no adley will try a three and knocks it down Big Time shot talk about his versatility the thing that Im most impressed with Hadley about is just his General basketball IQ understands the next right play I mean just so versatile on the floor with what he can do 27 on threes this season looked very comfortable there now theyre trying the other Baseline Andrew Ro had a big first half quiet here in the second you Cannon trying to go to work Saunders cutting knocked out of his hands saved shot clock at two Saunders fakes has to Fire and theres Edwards Louisville not slowing the pace adley right to the basket bobbl up by Sharma and a foul against the Freshman isan Sharma from Milton Ontario and I thought Sharma did a nice job staying in front his problem was they attacked his chest and he wrapped around if he stays vertical thats a terrific defensive possession and heres the problem too youre offens is struggling if youre Virginia youre not knocking down shots and youre forced late to the clock and what ends up happening is Louisville can get out and run and play with pace and when they get moving and theres a lot of body movement away from the ball that veteran presence in the veteran team so good at finding the open guy ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tanon bound wheat days at 4 Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN app one more for Javon Hadley a 76 free throw shooter love Mark Packer lots of love of course 14point lead this is the largest of the afternoon and they add to it Applause here points for Hadley excuse me Im sorry Pat it its its been the consistency for Louisville right like even when shots havent been falling their approach has been the same the entirety of this game theyre playing quality defense theyre finding looks and the first half they didnt make them but now things are all starting to click together because they are always there Ro to the basket how much of that is what theyve done on the boards today but I mean its finishing possessions and the thing is everybody knows when you play Virginia youre guarding for 30 seconds its m maintaining your discipline for 30 seconds thats a whole another conversation and Louisville has been really good at that today Virginias built an whole era of topnotch basketball on that premise a steal of the corner here by roie Kofi calling for the ball sets the screen instead pops out hell let fire straight on three for the Freshman another rebound all red short shirts on the glass and Virginia not an offensive rebounding team by Nature they like to retreat get back on defense but I mean the glass has been completely controlled by Louisville 3925 136 on the offensive boards Cardinals closing strong theyre on a 10 to2 run pulling away late he bur around the defender slip pass inside Scott couldnt handle but still finishes with two look what I found how the ball movement changing sides of the floor the next best play Charlottesville impressive performance this afternoon by Louisville thats whats coming up 600 Eastern on the ACC Network Syracuse Florida State Louisville just over two and a half minutes away from picking up win number 10 on the season and Donnie Freeman for Syracuse this is a conference that has a lot of really talented freshman hes one of them good shot by Roy wide open from the corner gets that to go d Freeman though I I mean 69 versatile Inside Out type of forward long arms Syracuse has a really talented young freshman there its a season High 16 points for Andrew roie on that make bur running some clock here shot clock is under 10 gets it back from Hadley now heer goes to work inside the paint falling to the floor and a whistle oh meaning to be were hearing a lot of booze right now and and I understand why they thought Murray had position Murray has gotten away with a lot today and to say the least he has been physical bordering on Rugby style he doesnt play for the All Blacks he plays for the tall blacks yes the New Zealand national team but hes played today like he plays for the All Blacks because its been physical hes been mismatched some with some of the bigger players from louville he gets called for that one but I think thats a nice tradeoff considering the fact that he has been so physical over the course of the game we were both impressed with the nickname of his basketball team when we found it out Im very impressed with you partner for working it into the broadcast and you got it in just under the wire well done took me 38 minutes and a second not a moment too soon thats right back to a 16o lead for Louisville hey you know what this Louisville team just kind of big picture here this Louisville team played really well battle for Atlantis theyve been crushed with injuries and yet here we are in January Pat Kelce his team continuing to compete play well Edwards to the basket splitting two Defenders and draws the foul just get a big win at home over North Carolina come to Virginia barring anything insane getting a win here dont be surprised if this Cardinals team come the end of February is at the top of the league and they have the pieces they play well together theyre unselfish theyre older sometimes it takes a little bit of a Readjustment I mean a Bart Trey or coming back to this team today has changed the dynamic of what they have off the bench because there were times over the last month they would go to the bench and you didnt really get that spark of energy today hes been awesome for Pat Kelce and Company because it just his impact goes so far beyond just scoring with all those injuries Louisville spent about a month playing with a sevenman rotation now trayor is back this is his third game back but as you said hes back today he has announced himself as back so clearly he makes it an eightman rotation at least well just to continue to talk about treor now hes picking up Day Day Ames in the full court guarding a point guard his responsibility has been Elijah Saunders the entire game so I mean just impressed with his effort level impressed with his impact a lot of guys talk about winning things well what are in winning things its extra effort its cutting away from the ball its being a tough screener he does all of those things and he just adds another element to this Louisville team impressed with his athleticism also because thats off the charart trayor is blocked Robinson coming from the weak side to send it out of bounds with 7 seconds on the shot Applause clock as Pat Kelce goes to his bench under a minute to play this is also going to be for Louisville their first win in Charlottesville since February 1 19 1990 and only their second win here uba had won 18 of the last 19 games coming into this Music one Ro to the r with a cherry on top cany roof the fresman off the dribble giving Louisville 70 points and they are just the second team to score 70 points at jpj in the last 63 games and they got there Applause emphatically we dont talk about Kai ruths talk about talented freshman hes one of them hes just stuck behind a whole bunch of older guys you see the kind of athleticism he has pit was the other they scored seven 74 on February 13th of last season four players in double figures for Louisville how about the company man Patrick Antonelli coming up and grabbing the basketball just to make sure that Ruth doesnt get the turnover thats a company man thats Debs kid thats Debbies kid right there he understands he knows the game hes going to be a coach great young man and a great win on the road for Louisville and got to take
