an alltime meeting between these two programs Ted Valentine Michael Roberts Jenna Reno are three officials tonight Nico hudis and Blake Buchanon inside the center circle off we go from Applause jpj UVA with that mover blocker kind of offense a lot of twoman games a lot of screens by the big for the littles wide open underneath the returning Ryan Dunn sophomore from Freeport New York in Nassau County and Virginias on the board first D really burst on the scene last season does some just incredibly athletic things out there on the floor hudas on a pump fake goes up with the left hand and swirls it down through the contest of Buchanan yeah they got him late uh kind of a just a friend of a friend at uh at St Joes and uh and Temple and um worked out really well St Johns actually played a role in that too rck patino of course he coached in Greece for a few years and that connection with the a ncent coaching staff the reverse layup good for RO you know you have to close out on Ro hes such a good shooter but hes really developed that drive to the basket also firste Cavalier after moving over from St Thomas Summit League freshman of the year a season ago cam shell the other member from Coffeeville Community College with Glasper he cudas on a kick Trey Off the Mark rebound done theres that athleticism youre talking about Mac yeah he really can do a little bit of everything but a spectacular rebounder runs the floor beakman on a step back somebody opened up the door Beakmans played very well offensively so far this season his distribution and his scoring Music shell on a handoff for Jeremy Robinson continues to back down dun on a pump the elevation and the Miss Buchanon squeezes it starting lineups here for Virginia we mentioned bu Canon had 18 points against Florida back on Friday he gets the knot over Jake Rose this evening coming off a really big game against the Florida Gators mcney off the heel hi cudas secures the board NCA and has used the same starters for the first three games as shell is Off the Applause Mark shell and Glasper gives him a really solid backourt Applause two guys with a lot of familiarity with one another play together obviously at coffe bille and cam cam shell actually recruited Glasser told Coach Monte Ross hes the best shooter Ive ever been with you should take a look and dun is fouled on the way up by one of those Coffeeville guys Applause Music Glasper back in the end done nice job of just taking your time you have the advantage in there nice its good to be methodical down there Music low done to the free throw line on his career 15 of 30 the young sophomore for the Cavaliers averaging 7 and A2 and 7 and A2 early in the year small sample size but you can tell hes trending in the right direction and hes done an incredible job too on the defensive end seven steals against the Gators in that 7370 victory at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte starting lineup here for NC and as the officials have an issue with the clock Jeremy Robinson comes closer to home tonight played his high school ball at Paul the 6 in Chantell Virginia Monte Ross assembled a a pretty good roster with only two rur e coming back from last year hes done it before hes built a program at Delaware and of course hes been a part of some big programs like Temple and St Joes when they were in their Heyday with Phil Martin Jamir Nelson Delante West some of the players hes coached before 10 Seasons at Delaware 2014 CA tournament champions udis Buchanon bodies him up on a back cut Glasper reverse lab with the English now its a great pass and a great shot it just didnt go in offense has not been the issue so far for NCA and its the defensive then theyve struggled yeah giving up almost 100 points a game a 100 52 loss against Pittsburgh last Monday 9478 the final in a defeat against UNCG on Friday theyve really struggled on the backboard of course Tony Bennett hadnt been real happy with the defensive rebounding either giving up 28 offensive rebounds in the first two games in total the Cavaliers were outrebounded by 17 against the Gators but Florida has a lot of size on their team inside bu Canon on the flush ball screen and roll its worked since the beginning of basketball it aint broke dont fix it right doing a nice job of staying a little longer on the Hedge when Glasper has the ball and accepts a ball Applause screen meanwhile Hi C gets loose on the other elbow hes very skilled and just a freshman you know Monte Ross is happy about that oh yeah no doubt about that 69 215 a lot of raw talent offensively a whistle inside Buchanon was held and we head to our first timeout Monte Rosss team hanging in with Virginia so far Cavaliers though do have a fourpoint Advantage off the jam from The Freshman bu Music Kennan these moves looking in the future familiar with the agies they come from Greensboro had a big run in the Mak in the 80s winning seven consecutive championships 10 NCA tournament appearances overall and with a fall enrollment this year of nearly 14000 students the largest HBCU in the country now for 10 straight years yeah a historical program the uh the Elder Jeff cable coach there a long time and of course now theyre in the ca which is the coastal Athletic Conference instead of the Colonial as we known it for years second season in the CAA they were in the Big South for one year after four decades in the M out of the timeout McNeely along to Kan it thats so good from an awful little screen didnt have a lot of space but shot it in Rhythm mcne the twotime West Virginia Gator eight player of the year now a sophomore for the Caps the polka dots yes sir one of the best names in the country I I dont know that they could be better no here you see the screen Cannon just created enough space to get that jumper off and you give McNeely any space typically he cashes in udas in a tie up maintains control and weve got a foul underneath its on the arm cudas has all of the Aggies points so far and is going to the free throw line Music now the Greek freshman at the line misses badley on the first Fray we have two featured ACC mens basketball matchups first Bucknell takes on number nine Duke and Durham at 6 Eastern then UC Riverside is in Chapel Hill to face number 20 North Carolina at 8 Eastern catch all the action on acc Network and the app have you caught the starts of the Season that Armando Bott has had for Carolina yeah oh my goodness yeah last year was kind of uh maybe uh but but this year he is making up for lost time 47 points 33 rebounds in the first two games for a player who might win the N Smith Player of the Year ages with a little s go 122 press back to manto Music Applause man Ro had it stripped Kyle Duke checks in for ncent ball continues to squirt free he cudas Dives on top of it and a foul or do we have a kick ball here think it was a foul so possession to NC and well you mentioned the different defenses that ncent was using Tony Bennett we spoke with him before the game he said when we schedule the noncon we want to see different types of teams different times of defenses as well yeah I thought that was really a good way to approach the nonconference schedule youre going to see a variety of different styles in ACC on a back cut Duke I really like Kyle Duke saw him last year and uh in the CAA tournament uh kind of a combo guard lefthanded long arm guy can really defend hes the one who initiated that turnover on the last possession and then on the offensive end in the blowout lost to pit he was pretty productive leted the team with tying a career high of 15 points against the Panthers Harris to the rack misses rebound up in the air dun puts it back in D looks like a PO off of pogo sticking there just keeps on jumping really nice followup by Music Dunn ham shell fakes locates Duke extra pass in the corner heres the Trey no dice that time for Joiner got a good look at it made that one more pass which always ends up in an open shot Dante Harris Virginia swings it around the horn out of switch him by entt mcne finds an open pocket and connects sport Reigns and again hes its not like hes wide open just needs a sliver right he does and that is a pure stroke coaching staff really encouraging him to take more shots this season that goes off the bracket from glasur good job BYOB mcne on the defensive end that time contesting the shot by Glasper at the Applause rim and its in Jake RH that forces a timeout from Monte Applause Ross Virginia up by a dozen from Bonus land so far the two leading threepoint Shooters on the season small sample size but at the end of the year they probably will still be the leading threepoint shooters for the Cavs Virginia over the season sometimes theyve been prolific from threepoint range sometimes they havent been as great they were terrific in the national championship season theyre trying to get back to those efficient ways from Beyond The Arc this season yeah a lot of folks think this can be an outstanding threepoint shooting team and so far this season theyre right 17 of 40 from threepoint range entering play tonight ncent tries to get back into this one an 8 nothing run for Virginia its now ended on a floater from duke duke with the off hand little floater in the lane you see why I liked his game mhm hes got four hudas has four and that represents the eight for ncent Dante Harris the Georgetown transfer to Jake roves who comes over from Oklahoma and now its Leon Bond his first action tonight on red shirt freshman everybody who saw Virginia practice last year said wait till you see this kid this is Virginias second game at home this season in the first one Leon Bond when he made his debut he admitted I I was super nervous coming into it Im not going to Applause lie see nice Baseline Drive little help and bomb with the midrange jump he said he was out there and he was just hoping to score he said it was a really surreal experience against harlton State oh crafty play from duke nearly went in he put it off the arm of tane Applause Music Murray Rees beakman the Limelight shines larger on her him this season Applause Music elbow jump shot Off the Mark from Bond and NCA and T closes down The Music Applause Possession jalo McKay with the Miss in the corner Virginias Applause ball just a freshman M stroke the ball speaking of that so can reys bakman playing with such confidence you know went through the NBA draft process decided to come back Defensive Player of the Year preseason First Team all ACC all the accolades and all deserved and hes such a great distributor as well last season he was second in the nation in assist to turnover ratio only behind maccaffrey at Iowa tane Murray Rings it Applause down 162 run for Virginia those folks I was talking about earlier that think Virginia can be a great shooting team continue to be correct back there four of four Glasper hounded by beakman four of four is good out here by yourself with nobody Applause watching Jeremy Robinson misses beakman plucks down the Applause board Bond on an island a repost off the pass from beakman double Ares Bond beats it really nice play use that athleticism to get open and Virginia you mentioned four for four and theyre theyre doing such a good job on the other end when you do that kind of thing you make a high percentage and you limit the the opponents to 0 for seven to start the game youre going to be ahead by a lot mhm up by 20 right now shell off one foot fouled contact from Music Harris they like Harriss game too but we mentioned Leon Bond make a little contact create just enough space to elevate and Bank it in love the bank shot old school Leon Bond the third the red shirt freshman from woso Wisconsin just west of Milwaukee of course Tony Bennett with roots in the Milwaukee Applause Music Applause area Tony Bennett brings in Jordan Miner for the first time BR transfer from Marram as T cus is in for ncent Jordan MERS is a a a different kind of guy a big bodied physical Banger down low if he uh as he gets acclimated he could be a big help to the Cavaliers yeah it just brings a different dimension to this Cavaliers Applause team Marie had a stripped re gathers shot clock in single digits beakman PS and Monte Ross lets it go out of Applause bouns beakman now one of three from the floor enjoy talking with Monte Ross he has a he has a plan in place and uh I think the program is in good Applause hands Kyle Duke open space cant finish beakman the rebound he said look weve got 14 newcomers on the team we could have scheduled some division 3 cupcakes to begin the season but games against Pittsburgh and Virginia will find some things on the tape that we can see going into CA play moving forward Virginia continues to dominate though over nc up by the ACC he finished up his eligibility Arman Franklin Jaden Gardner the list goes on and on and so Virginia this season only returns about a third of its minutes from last year in fact only five players who scored from a season ago and the Cavaliers are piecing this thing together but so far theyve been really good on the offensive endb yeah and while the new guys get acclimated and understand their roles the old guys are still doing it beakman McNeely Dunn and minor have and Bon Im sorry Bon dun mcneel and bman have 21 of the 28 points and thats way its going to be as these young people find their roles wellrounded attack as well eight different Cavaliers have scored so far tane Murray is open in the corner could to get it to go but a nice athletic offensive rebound from Applause dun we had an interesting conversation with Tony Bennett prior to the game about roster continuity how that has changed in college basketball over the last handful of Seasons yeah and and because of a program like this that is that is a that is kind of system built uh its its taken him a little bit longer to get everybody on the same page if you will on both ends of the floor we asked him which one was a little more challenging and uh you know he said they theyre so sophisticated on defense even though what they do is relatively simple how about this back door pass right here just a a little hesitation by miner I think hes going to be a big contributor later in the Season Pro NEC player of the year last season with meramac a lot of promise from him off the Applause bench Dunn has been all over the glass so far yeah and I think the the Cavaliers have gotten the message about blocking out on the defensive end too theres Miner right on Q I meant later in the season not not the next possession up youre CLA voyant yeah Duke called for an offensive foul good positioning from mcney yeah mcne you know he was a good player a year ago just but it just seems like hes playing with so much more confidence on both ends of the Music floor got to move your feet stay in legal guarding position if you take it in the sternum its a charge every time Music you mentioned that hes playing with more confidence on both sides of the floor associate head coach Ron Sanchez said look we believe that last season he was a bit of a mouse too quiet hes got to speak a little bit more and hes doing that so far this year yeah but there were so many return e last year Im sure he was feeling his way through the program and and exactly what he was supposed to be doing when he should speak up Applause really nice play right there by Evan Joiner EV Joiner Hometown product out of Greensboro started his collegiate career at Tennessee State went to Yavapai College in Arizona last Applause season beakman bolts to the basket and lays it in thats a big time right there great first step used his body to protect the basketball ball that looked easy it was not we were at shootaround this morning and Monte Ross said Reese beakman loves to Pro heres a lop towards the ren oh man Ryan dun nearly capped it off those two connected on some of those last year but watch bman first step and now hes got position look at him use his body to protect the basketball thats just really smart basketball does it it seem like hes taking what the game is giving him yes he he really does that I mean thats why he has 12 assists and one turnover coming into this game Sunday catch a womens college basketball double header on the ACC Network up first Oklahoma visits Virginia at 2 Eastern followed by Buck Nell taking on 19th ranked Louisville at 4 Eastern both games are also available on the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere second free throw rims out for Dunn and Buchanan runs into a plethora of people hes hard to avoid at 611 he is he is he hes hard to avoid for that basketball on the offensive glass too he goes and gets it rewarded with a spot in the starting lineup tonight replacing Jake Rose you Canan had the 18 points against the Gators in the 7370 victory in Charlotte I was at that game and he was just so all over the place getting to the free throw line yeah he was 10 of 16 from the stripe former Idaho Gatorade Gatorade Player of the Year and very interesting story about how he got here so Tony Bennett with roots in pman during his time at Washington State one of Buchanans aaou coaches was Tony Ben its dentist and the other one was the beat writer for Washington State so thats how those two got in contact I dont know if Ive ever heard that before no that was that was an unusual one but hey McNeely from Deep five of seven from threepoint range are the Music Cavaliers Helman Nichols couldnt get it to go easy board for UVA another goodl looking freshman from mon Ross this is going to be a different looking team in January and February when they enter CA play done fouled on the way Music Applause up Isaac mcney they nickname him iMac automatic from from Music distance these moves looking nice in the Applause future Isaac mcne Paces all scores with eight points so far as Virginia enjoys a 24o lead over ncent Tony bent and Company have a history of elevating players games from their freshman year to their sophomore year yeah and again its all about understanding your role and where you fit in Isaac mcney 67 last year already at 12 points a game even in the small sample size eight points tonight in a very efficient 11 minutes its very interesting because Isaac was asked about his increased role going into his sophomore year and he said look the coaches want me to shoot a whole lot more and some people were kind of speculating ooh that might be a problem and Isaac responded and said I think a lot of players around the country would love to have the problem of their coaches telling them you have to shoot more yeah I I dont know any player that would have a problem with Music that and the coaches arent going to say it unless theyre pretty darn sure thats what they want smile on Tony Bennetts face on the bench hes got to be pleased with just about everything shooting 61 71 from three and 75 from the free throw line which has been a little bit of a problem some astronomical numbers as ncent gets the response from GL his first three points of the game 0 a five prior to that coach Bennett likes the fact that they theyve been efficient from the free throw line and have only allowed one offensive rebound despite the fact that ENT has missed 17 times mhm bond in the post bond connects he plays bigger than he they list him doesnt he KN nice position that time a little righthanded jump hook yeah you look down at the roster sheet and Hes listed at 65 and you say what glur quick trigger fouled Jenna Reno makes the call McNeely and Bennett in Music disbelief lasper has had trouble getting started tonight virgia has done a really good job on him only three points hes going to have a chance to make three more right here it looks like aser maybe kick those feet out a little bit I think McNeely and Bennett may have been right on that Applause Music one you see the 32 points from Glasper against UNCG Glasper last season played at Coffeeville Community College in Kansas he only only scored 31 in a game for Coffeeville so that was his career high not only in division one but at any level and really wasnt going to North Carolina ENT until his his buddy cam shell and cam Woods left North Carolina ENT to go to NC State late and cam sell said coach I got the guy that can shoot it better than cam woods and so Monte Ross calls land in glasberg and says hey wed love to have you here were were pretty interested and they finish the phone call and Glasper says okay let me just talk to my parents 30 minutes later 30 30 minutes later coach Ross gets a phone call and Glasper says yeah Im ready to go yeah having coached 30 plus years that doesnt Applause happen little two3 Zone by North Carolina ENT this time mixing it up on the defensive end it leaves Groves open for three Cavaliers now six of eight from distance tough to play zone against this Applause Music bunch he cudas on a screen Duke sizzles it left side three Glasper cant get it to go buan in the Applause rebound clasper now one out of Applause seven and he shot the ball a lot against Pittsburgh last Monday in the 152 loss one of 16 from the floor so he is not shy no no but he backed it up with a great performance against UNCG and you mentioned how late that NC and got him I mean for a guy to come in not only as late as he did but to be the focal point of this offense yeah its nice when your point guard goes and recruits him a a backourt mate its nice that he wanted to play with Cam shell again too tell you something about those two young men building pieces for the future B with Music position Im not believing that hes 65 to be honest you are he just has Springs in those sneaks he really does eight points for Bond so far as Monte Ross makes a Change Kyle Duke is out uchina kelman Nichols Returns the fresh from Orlando Bond and McNeely with eight done with nine the returnees are doing just fine course Bond was on the team but did not play but isnt it refreshing to see a guy who accepted the red shirt didnt transfer came back for his second year believed in what the coaching staff had to offer tells you about the culture of the program overused word but fifth in this Music situation Ted Valentine animated call what else is new Saturday tune in to our week 12 ACC Network football lineup starting with Louisville against Miami at noon Eastern then the hokes host the Wolfpack from blackburg at 330 cap off the day with Syracuse taking on Georgia Tech at 8 all games are also available on the ESPN app so you can watch Music anywhere some full court pressure here from NC following the free throw make yeah really using that just to slow the game down a little bit not really to try to force a turnover staying with their game plan regardless of the score oh Bond off one foot so variety of moves the jump hook the reverse dribble the jumper from the elbow and then the one footer if I told you Leon Bond would be the first player in double figures tonight I dont think youd believe me not on my big go card Applause no Groves with good hustle back but oh McNeely falls down here for UVA nice bounce pass little fade away thats not the first time he shot that thats something you work on in the summertime good to see McNeely here back on his feet but hes clearly in some pain he looked like maybe he got stepped on after Music the eight points so far for mcney T Murray is the replacement under a minute to go in the first half Virginia at 64 from the field ncent at just 25 shot clocks at three oh Harris swaps it away and Glasper misses rebound Groves coaching staff extremely excited about the quickness defensively for Dante Harris game clock shot clock differential of 10 Harris to the basket foul by glasberg second on Glasper who now joins Duke and Joiner with two personals Dante Harris started his career at Georgetown won the Big East tournament most outstanding player back in 2021 you know people forget with georgetowns lack of success over the last couple of years you go back a few years and they won the Big East yeah sure did he was a big part of it he really was and uh he is uh again fitting into fixing to fit into his part of this team but he brings a dimension hes really quick you you listen to the other players talk about he is the hardest player to stay in front of on this team and then on the defensive end he is really challenging Ree beakman Applause cam shell organizes Glasper hauls it in then throws up a wild try its out of bounds off UVA so it stays with NC andc with under four and a half ticks left Juniors got nice offensive numbers but this all started on the defensive end Helman Nichols scans Glasper spins Waits hoists it up partially redirected by Guess Who Leon Bond his fingerprints are all over this match up tonight want to see before they walk out of Charlottesville tonight he wants to see Improvement he wants to see better execution especially on the offensive end they took care of the ball but they didnt get really good shots because Virginia was just so good and then he also wants to see continued aggression on defense but a little better job of finding those threepoint Shooters and a little better job helping in the post on done and bond Cavaliers six of eight from Beyond The Arc in the opening 20 tonight NC and just committed its third turnover thats it beakman fakes elevates rims out Buchanan slaps the board to Dunn lost it on the way up Bons on the floor Joiner is there and a wrestling match two points for both Applause teams you call wrestling too uh give me a call Im ready Dam buan and that those are two really good offensive rebounders they combined on that one to keep Virginia in possession certainly an encouraging sign for Tony Bennett tonight and Florida had a lot of size in Friday nights matchup in Charlotte but the gator out rebounded the Cavaliers by 17 Buchanan from the free throw line he said I can rebound it but I can knock that midrange jumper down too points three and four of the night for bu Canon freshman from Quarterlane Ido now 35 minutes east of Spokan Joiner on a triple buries it there he goes heav joined the Richard sophomore out of Greensboro graduated from pedmont classical High School played AA ball for garner road which was coached by David West now National Player of the Year at Xavier back in 03 outstanding Applause Music Applause program course Harris played for one Curtis Staples his numbers in the Raptors as Buon finishes inside Canon was kind of quiet in that first half hes off to a good start in the second half yanon making his first career start tonight done look out you saw it coming partner long strides as Glasper answers on the other end and a timeout yeah I dont think coach Ross was really excited about giving up that transition basket I think this basket might be shaking till Music breakfast these moves look yeah sure the Cavaliers theyre not known for their pays weve heard that so many times but the first fast break field goal tonight for UVA it goes to Dun it was memorable yeah Ryan dun the sophomore out of free Port New York he got loose took off from the logo I thought I thought initially it might have been the free throw line but it was just the ACC logo and it was fun to watch Mack there is only one player who played in the ACC who can go from the free throw line you know who that is come on I dont even have to say his name no we dont want we wont say his name tell you what though Dunn has been very active tonight 11 points nine rebounds hes been great at the free throw line five of six just 13 minutes for him yeah hes been getting hes been very good on the defensive end too earlier we referenced the elevation for Isaac mcney from freshman to sophomore more year and its going to be a similar story for Ryan dun this year if the Cavaliers want to build a successful Applause year hes a different guy bouncy you saw him run and jump but uh but hes really got nice skills and an outstanding Defender Mac everybody thats around this program if youre a coach or a fan everybody wants to make the comparison for Ryan Dunn to DeAndre Hunter how do you view that ah not a not a bad call H was a little little further ahead uh offensively but uh but yeah I like the comparison okay he said okay hadnt he yes makes a lot of money in the NBA exactly money that we dont make another turnover for ncent Harris up ahead missed the layup may have been affected by Evan Joiner for ncent beakman agitates Joiner here and another giveway for c roie beakman Applause Music roie little hot potato there yeah ni nice box out effort by AT its very surprising when UVA misses a three and its been very surprising when ncent has made a three tonight this one cashed in by Landon Glasper yeah Glasper is starting to heat up its up to 3 for 12 3 for seven from long range hadnt made any side anything inside the arc start at 0 five tonight open triple this time for the Caps beakman couldnt get it to go offensive rebound though for bu Applause Canon heres the lob that will not be the last time we say beatman to D for the dunk six assists now for Music beakman Joiner backing down roie joiners only at 180 lbs at 68 Joiner swerves and gets it wall uped away bu cannon on the rejection you got to like the Music Freshman youth showing up for UVA heres the sophomore done and then the Freshman bu k a fly swatter inside for the Music Cavs just over four minutes gone by in our second half here from John Paul Jones Arena thanks so much for being with us on acc Network extra with M McCarthy Cory Spectre our producer sha fton director Dylan Bailey Cavaliers up by nearly 30 over the agies an ncent program thats picked the finish last out of 14 teams in the Coastal Athletic Association variety of different players getting in on the fun for UVA so Applause far 6 seconds on the shot clock here for NC and shell tries to get open Dante Harris with the robbery bu Canon had it poked from behind out of bounds Dante Harris is a change of pace too you know he came in from McNeely and Harriss speed and quickness on both ends of the floor is is a real boost its a really nice play right here gets a hand in it says it to a teammate not just inbounds Tony Bennett said Dante is one of the quickest on ball Defenders Ive ever coached that includes guys like Kei Clark Rees beakman his teammate and even jontel Evans who was with Virginia in the late 2000s early 2010 so those are remarkable names that Harris is exceeding so Applause far you know reading a bunch of stuff by the Virginia players about who the toughest person on the floor to guard is and almost to a man they said here its just because you cant stay between him and a basket we referenced that in the first half but they were pretty unanimous on that hes a guy who averaged 12 points per game at Georgetown in the 2122 season on a good team yeah yeah coming off a Big E Championship made the NCA tournament with Patrick Ying at the Applause time Leon bond is back in for UVA he had a remarkable first half short Corner Jay from Buchanan is off and theres Bond and Glasper knocked it off of roie but theyll say it stays with UVA but I think we may have a change here as Michael Roberts walks over to Applause Jano and she says my bad Applause as long as we dont go to the replay were fine oh were going to see it replay Mac I dont know what youre talking about replay what what happened with replay I dont know oh went off glaspers foot see if it pays dividends for Glasper now whos isolated on roie pudus on the screen and roll the D down low and Robinson lays it in well thats really good basketball sharing the basketball good penetration head up one more pass got a little high percentage shot money Ross likes what he sees right there youre going to score in the interior against UVA youve really got to squeeze some passes in there against the packline D yeah theres not a lot of angles small Windows as they say in the NFL yes shot clocks at four roie had it blocked hudas and Robinson tracks down the loose ball hudas with back to back good plays the assist and then the block shot Glasper now from distance yeah rose up over Harris hand in his face asper he was quiet in that first half but he is lighting it up here in the second heating up now with 15 points four of eight from three of course hes 0 of five from two you see beakman come up there I have a feeling that uh that bman may come in here and guard Mr Glasser if I had to guess raining ACC defensive player of the year that makes sense whats this Harris not in bad shape just gave him a little too much space was Glasper has range it was in Community College lets keep that in mind but last year at Coffeeville he shot 39 from three its the same distance yeah Music different stage for sure beakman on a bounce bond to the rim how good has he been 12 points six of seven from the floor and everything within 12T of the Applause basket hudas on a fade Applause nope beakman glances ahead beakman isolated down to the rim and theres Applause B Blaser just Chucks it up misses roie the board Bond and dun are wearing that Rim out on that end of the floor well Leon bond has had to wait he didnt play last season he was a red shirt hes got fresh legs is that what youre telling me yes Applause clearly br the former Tommy spin shot off the glass in took advantage of the mismatch on a switch right there he had Snell to 510 and backed him down and Ros at 66 step back Jay thats good Kyle Duke you love his game Ma I really do he can do a little bit of everything and great defender good passer can run the point but he can he can shoot it too saw that nice oneonone play right there Junior from Toronto a gold medalist for team Ontarios 15U in 2018 Ro bonds got the mismatch Groves Twirls swirls Music out sweltering defense from the Cavs hudis with the left hand and one that was really a nice play understood where his body was the defender weve talked about Leon Bond a bunch the red shirt freshman making up for lost time go get it young Music man but since halftime the agies outscoring the Cavaliers 1814 that has to make first year head coach Monte Ross happy yeah Mons been in a game a long time we we talked about the fact that he was at St Joes a long time while they were really good with Phil Martelli his first season here at okina but was the head coach for a decade at Delaware in including the ca Championship he was also a player at Winston Salem State for Clarence big house gains and his back court mate there was a guy by the name of Steven A Smith I wonder if he yelled all the time back then I wonder if Monte ever felt Hoodwinked Bamboozled let astray run a muck flat out deceived I wonder I imagine all those things 25point pushing here for the Applause Cavaliers Groves is pressured down low fires a crosscourt pass working around the horn this is excellent ball movement and Ro cant get the three to go grov the offensive rebound two free throws I think all five Cavs touch the ball leading to that shot good job good job okay two shots first one Music first Jake Roes the graduate student spent his first two years at Eastern Washington the last two years at Oakland Oklahoma Friday we have two featured ACC mens basketball matchups first Bucknell faces number9 Duke in Durham 6 Eastern UC see Riverside in Chapel Hill to take on number 20 North Carolina at 8 catch all the action on acc Network and the app but thats what youre going to see this season from UVA right Reese beakman is tremendous offensively but its going to be scoring by committee for this Cavaliers team you got to the ball around theyve got a chance to be very balanced and I I think Tony Bennett would like that very much hard to prepare for a team when everybody out there is a threat to score you know you look at the stats tonight Reese beakman only has five points and if you didnt watch the game youd be like ah ree kind of struggled but no hes just organizing everything out there while hes on the floor for the Taps yeah and including playing great on the defensive end as always shot clock in single digits beakman pulls it back Groves Bluffs Groves dances to the rim I thought about halfway through that step he was going to dunk it but well he missed a slam dunk against Florida back on Friday and then he committed a careless foul and after the game Tony Bennett said were going to work on his Music dunking good box out that time from grov beakman scans beakman to the rim misses gr fighting for it but NC an has it yeah I think Monte Ross is pleased with how his team came out at halftime more competitive finally getting the ball to go in the basket a little bit and mat conversely Tony Bennett a coach who has coached seven different number one scoring defenses throughout his career hes got a high standard 19 points for ncent here in the second half hes not going to like that no but he hes looking at a lot of different combinations hes missing a key piece in Isaac MC Neely so uh I think hes accomplishing what he wants to do who can play together who can he put out there as a fiveman group and and trust them on both ends of the floor well he tinkered his starting lineup as well tonight he brought in buan and for Applause Groves and of course Harris got the start in the second half for McNeely moving beatman to the to the two a position that beakman played when Kei Clark was here Groves asserts himself in the paint locates roie for an 18footer its really nice and when youre a great shooter youve got to have that move shot fake show the ball one dribble pull up hedge the ball screen Joiner Jabs and delivers it to Duke six points so far for Kyle Duke the Junior from Toronto Joiner no space Ro stays in front shot clock trickles down to four Duke waiting waiting goes up and does not score Groves the board well a really nice individual effort that time by Dunn he got on the stand stay between his man to basket didnt go for the Applause fake stay on your feet thats a message every coaching staff delivers T Murray tur the corner on the screen a little curl cut Junior from Auckland New Zealand coach Bennett played in New Zealand after his stint with the Charlotte

triple regains possession back out makais three is off the window without the rim and the rebound down to Dante Harris preseason poll in the ACC Virginia picked fourth behind the three teams that right now are ranked inside the top 25 Virginia not ranked in the AP Top 25 in the preseason first time since 20178 Cavaliers had a very successful year in the regular season that year they finished with over 30 wins yeah they were number one in the country and uh you know the the poll the preseason poll gives Virginia a lot of respect and that thats the Tony Bennett Factor right there the the national poll uh not so much but uh the folks who vot in the ACC poll no not to count Virginia out that is correct I would never doubt Tony Bennett six of the last 10 ACC titles shared the title a year ago lost to Duke in the ACC Championship down in Greensboro anybody lower in the pack in the ACC who youve studied and youre like hm this team may have a chance this year to surprise some people no you know I I not that theyre being overlooked but uh I think Miami is probably better than folks think I think wake could be better than folks think with so many newcomers theres going to be a surprise out of that bottom half for sure Miami last night really struggled with FIU that was a game that went back and forth bunch of runs Miami ended up Music winning kans coming off their final four appearance of season ago NC and comes from the ca thatll in all likelihood be a one bit lead so coach Monte Ross knows that this season is a learning Applause process yeah theyll play their tournament back in Washington DC at the mystics Arena and Monte Ross said you know throughout my years whether it was at Delaware or even when I was an assisant coach at St Joes under Phil Martelli

her first two the transfer from markette Harris has it poked away hudas Dives on the floor its like Jenga on the hardwood Harris somehow peels away with it and then doesnt H cudas he stole it twice on that possession I think I feel like I was watching a football game in like a frozen tundra and the corner three is in for JAL Music maai maai an undersized post but he can step out and shoot the ball freshman from Atlanta had six points and the loss against UNCG on Friday tane Murray getting some extended minutes inside for Groves too strong on that layup the offensive rebound for Miner minor was not a great free throw shooter at mirac only 58 but he is a as you can see theres a physical presence in there 6824 four years with marac coc player of the year last season alongside Josh Cohen of St Francis he was also the defensive player of the year a season ago led the conference in rebounding offensive rebounding blocks and rebounding is a concern for this basketball team they particularly on the defensive end its been a problem in the first couple games now again weve talked about the small sample size not jumping to conclusions but coach Bennett was certainly concerned about that number the other number he was concerned about was the free throw percentage but I think that one will take care of itself yeah very early but we will point out that they were just 60 at the line in the first two games which last year would have been the worst marker in all of D1 Glasper from Applause Harrisonburg he has full economy to shoot wherever he is looks like a good decision by coach Ross yeah Pond from just inside the threepoint line offensive stick back in for Groves glaspers got 18 points the only player for ncent in double figures tonight five of 10 from three as Robinson pulls the Music Applause trigger Murray the F down low Bond keeps the pivot foot Harris with the shot clock at five Harris denies the ball screen goes towards the basket offensive foul as Teddy Valentine makes

team that won the swack last season Johnny Jones in his sixth year they lost in the first four to a team that everyones now familiar with fdu then the fort Meers tip off coming up after that yeah some good test right there with Wisconsin and then you see there and Texas AM off to a good start under Buzz Williams and then your team the Syracuse Orange trying to survive tonight against Colgate three losses in a row to Colgate would be bad yes Glasper misses the three Bryce Walker is in the game for UVA 42 and white Junior from Beltsville Maryland in Prince Georges Applause County fans went nuts when he was at the scores table during the Applause timeout you think Buzz Williams is excited to return to the Applause Commonwealth he stays excited hes always jacked up yes he is yes he is he you

the Music Applause Music strike fourth year on the team played in four games a season ago with only nine minutes scored three points against MTH back in November of 22 as Groves goes to the bench udus back in for NC Music and well Mac before we run out of time tonight Monte Ross head coach for NCA and hes leaving this game and what is he thinking about oh I think hes first of all really happy that his kids continued to compete and improve their performance in the second half executed a little bit better got some better looks at the basket uh and and they battled all night long on the defensive end but Virginia was just so good in executing the offense that uh and they had it balance they had the inside attack with Dunn and bond they had the perimeter Shooters on on point so uh it was it was a tough task but I I think money Ross is happy that his kids competed the way they did well hes going to look at the half by half separation what well find out how this finishes of course but right now ncent has 30 points in the second half Virginia 29 yeah and and hes going to show him that this is what were capable of and again everything for him is pointed to when youre in a one bit League all that matters is March so be playing your best basketball then Leon bond with the two for UVA the other thing UVA has not hit a three in the second half Cavaliers were six of eight from three at one point now theyre six of 12 yeah again exper with a lot of different lineups but give give North Carolina Credit too they they located the shooters a little bit better and and of course Virginia has been missing McNeely who went out with the apparent ankle injury in the first half just over a minute to play here from Applause jpj Helman Nichols to Kyle Duke amont Hamilton 23 and gold is in the game Duke on a hesi Duke tries to split the double fails to do so recps and theyve run out of time thats a popular thing here in Charlottesville the shot clock violation well since the national championship season in 201819 the Cavaliers defense has averaged 27 shot clock violations per year so at to the total in 2324 I love how they keep that stat by the way oh theres no question its got to be a giveaway associated with that doesnt it has to be marketing opportunity Walkers got one final try here to get in the score sheet the bench is fired up Walkers three they were ready to Music Applause explode Applause 31point Advantage for Virginia final offensive possession here for nc Duke to the basket fouled these free throws by the way will matter to some continue with the front line folks leading their scoring Bond Off the Bench done and Groves all in double Applause figures Tony Bennetts going to love looking down in that stat sheet Groves four of six with 11 points dung just for a five for 13 Even bond has 16 hes only taken 10 shots very efficient yeah and didnt play that many minutes either he did all his damage from 12 feet and in and was explosive around the rim course dun got loose in transition and he was as good as as much fun as he was to watch on I had more fun watching him on defense he can guard anybody Kyle Duke with two free Music throws and Virginia salts away the remaining Applause time Leon Bond circles around as the Cavaliers polish off a 29point victory
