out for a third straight game with a head injury his backup Benny geler hes out with an illness so were going to see the sevenfooter max R play some point guard today hes going to have some more decisionmaking responsibilities but also sellers hes going to have to make some decisions he have to be a little bit more aggressive looking to score the basketball now sers has the ball now hes their second leading scorer raino leads the ACC in scoring and rebounding and he throws this one into the front row an early turnover for Stanford starting lineups for NC State oconnell again played at Stanford graduated in three years Marcus Hill is their leading scorer at 18 a game and then Dantes Styles has been uh playing well over his last three an off shooting night Wednesday against Cal but played well against Clemson and Duke wol pack trying to snap a seven game losing streak middle Brooks too strong the keing for Middle Brooks whos fighting an illness today is going to be to stay out of foul trouble and they have to be able to find another guy besides styles to really help them offensively talk to coach Keats and I think Middlebrook is a guy they need to give some inside threat some inside scoring and then on the other end he has to be able to be physical with raino without fouling oiah sellers able to get to the free throw line Line Eric in conference play 15 a game and hes pretty much a 50 4090 guy hes an efficient guy he has to look to be aggressive I mean without Blakes playing without gerer playing those are their two primary ball handlers he has to be able to make decisions but he cant let that Tak him away from being aggressive looking to get to the basket looking to get some opportunities and Ben Middlebrooks who only played 16 minutes in the Lost Wednesday to Cal because of foul trouble just picked up his first and thats big for North Carolina state with Huntley out if middle Brooks gets in foul trouble who is going to be that second guy to step up in guard right now likely it would be Styles which you would think favor Stanford yeah we may see a little bit of ishmail dof again he played our season High 24 minutes and the loss to Cal on Wednesday here is oconnell over Reno and the rebound by Styles and styles stepped out of bounds so a turnover by NC State you mentioned Clash of tempo NC State wants to press they want to speed up Stanford a team that doesnt have a ton of depth and Stanford wants to make this a halfcourt game well honestly North Carolina straight has just been struggling scoring the ball in half court really any type of way theyve been struggling scoring they have to be able to create turnovers and then look to get out and get easy opportunities in transition so you saw Reno bringing the ball up and the turnover off the hand of oziah sers here Kevin Keats told us we want to run they want to pressure Stanford wear the Cardinal down and it needs they want to run because theyve been struggling scoring the ball in half court theyre 17th in scoring in the ACC its second to last h no open look here for Marcus Hill hes not a great outside Applause shooter our not our foul is on Styles his first oh yeah oh yeah n another guy right here agall is a guy who could hes capable to handle the ball hes hes not super comfortable but hes another guy that Stanford needs to step up be able to make good decisions and and just be aggressive look for opportunities at The Rim two minutes in neither team with a field goal theres Jaden Taylor second season with NC State after time the butler blocked by raino one thing you cant do if your North Carolina State you cant be hesitant going to the rim just that little second right there allowed raino to come over and get that block on Taylor great job right there by Taylor getting into the paint but just a little bit slow on the finish and Reno was able to be there and get the good block for Stanford Middle Brook setting the pick for oconnell Hill picked up by Donovan Young The Freshman jump stop turn around offensive re rebound Reno quickly up ahead to shellers defensive rebound by Reno and yet another turnover thats four now for Stanford sloppy early and the other way the layup no good raino another rebound and we get a foul and boy neither team with a field goal more than three minutes in and you think this pace right now would favor NC State they they want to try to junk it up a little bit you saw that turnover by Stanford getting out in transition North Carolina state has to finish those opportunities at the rim and when theyre in half court they cant be hesitant you got to attack the basket and go up and look for your opportunity when it presents Applause itself so dant trees Styles at the free throw line 24 against Clemson 18 against Duke and Kevin Keats told him hey dont dont let him Miss impact you he wants styles to keep shooting whos going to be the goto guy for North Carolina State I believe is dant Tre Styles regardless is youre missing or making you have to continuously be aggressive looking for your opportunities when you do that not only does it present more for you but it presents more for your teammates as well sers on the drive and still no field goals in this game it was a good look for sellers you see him coming off that hand off and just attacking downhill keep it simple just attack the bass to get to the rim but you have to be able to finish another Miss off an open look that time Paul mcneel The Freshman who one scored a NC State record 71 points in a high school game is M doof number 33 and red in there for NC State Aiden camon in there number 52 in white another big for Stanford Reno getting a breather five to shoot sers contested that grazes the rim Tracked Down by Hill bounce pass doof and we finally have her first field goal of the game and an this is how North Carolina State can really score the basketball turnovers tur into transition or long rebounds off a bad shot getting out playing fast you see that opportunity present itself North Carolina State took advantage Stanford coming off backto back losses they are without their point guard Jaylen Blakes hes a big part of their offense big part of their defense best perimeter Defender a captain shot clock winding down young hoisted up and the three is good Stanford with its first field goal just the eighth three of the season for young whos been in and out of the lineup all year with a leg injury talked about Blakes being out we know R know and his sellers can score the basketball but whos going to be that other guy that really steps up young is more than capable stepping up and scoring the basketball how about is M dof meanwhile the Junior from Quebec couple of points here for NC State hes got four of the five Ryan Oger wall brings it across came to Stanford with a reputation as a threepoint shooter hes been inconsistent with the shot and that three from the outside goes Jaylen Thompson whos making just his second start of the Season today this is what Stanford needs and we know they dont want to play a super fast base but you dont want to get stagnant in the half court and not have good ball movement good ball movement in the half court creates open opportunities McNeil through the contact and called for the offensive foul take it what it take Applause we have come to our first media timeout almost 6 minutes in took a while for the scoring to get going took a while for somebody to hit a field goal it was Ismael dof with four of NC States five and then Thompson a big three for Stanford Music AV basketb Music Music this game has featured more turnovers than field goals and E former Syracuse standout Eric devendorf for Stanford theyre down their top two point guard today its shown early its showing early have to be able to take care of the ball they have to get some ball movement to create advantages either driving opportunities or getting to the paint for a driving kick and then when R is in the ball game give him the basketball R knows had to carry the ball up because of again the injuries to Blakes and geler and he had three turnovers for going to the bench briefly hes back into the game and NC State were going to see this the pressure to try to speed Stanford up no call there Dennis Parker collided with Chisum okara now the Harvard transfer okara backing down Parker and he stepped okara was somebody that Kyle Smith said hes looking to to kind of be that number three guy offensively with Blakes out well hes capable hes kind of a under undersized forward but he could shoot the three he could handle it a little bit and hes really strong you see him right there hes able to get into the post Just sh with his feet a little bit but hes another guy thats more than capable of stepping up and and being that third option for Stanford yeah so is Trey Parker The Freshman has had his moments of late at the 15point game against Duke and he knocks down the triple heres the freshman and two shots for Anthony Batson athletic freshman from Scottdale Arizona and again with the guard depth depleted youll see a little more of him today and I think a a big thing for both teams a lot of these guys are stepping into roles that theyve never had they have to do a little bit more they just have to be aggressive dont be hesitant in your decision making if you have an opportunity at the basket you have to attack and look for those opportunities dont second guess yourself as a basketball player thats really how you make more mistakes and what they miss with Blakes those are just the offensive numbers you lose leadership you lose defense you he generally guards the other teams best perimeter Music Applause Music player Parker Jaden Taylor Here Comes Trey Parker the drive the kick and the three back irons for Dennis Parker offensive rebound Second Chance guess whos there raino the ACC leader in rebounds at 11 plus per game North Carolina state has to be able to hit some jump shots to loosen that Stanford defense you see everybody is boxed in the boxes and elbows and its tough for North Carolina state to really get in there yeah we really havent seen raino get a post Applause Music Applause touch shot clock winding down raino the high post no room Hees it up and the rebound snagged by Bryce herd The Freshman from Chicago its only been eight minutes in the game and already three or four possessions for Stanford where they had to get a shot with two seconds left on the shot clock and the foul is on Batson and it needs to your point about not getting the ball already note thats the absence of Blakes a guy who knows how to get in position to get him the ball these other guys arent arent used to playing that position so they have to find out a way to get him the ball to where he can be effective now rno is scoreless he has four rebounds he also has three turnovers that one spins in and out for herd NC State shooting only 32 from three in conference play they have not been a good threepoint shooting team this year settling for those jumps that I really plays to Stanfords favor theyll take those all today lets see if raino goes at middle Brooks whos got the one foul he does and he knew it he knew middle Brooks didnt want to pick up that second foul and with Blakes out he has to be ultra aggressive you got to look to get the ball and you got to look to attack Parker gets free Hees and hits he look hes a guy thats really capable of of making tough shots really with him its just his decision making not trying to be so erratic when you get to the basket or get to the basket play with Pace make good decisions couple of Threes for Trey Parker Donovan young left it short but drew the foul lets go boys up and with Blakes out raino is the man you see him going to the chest of mid Brooks who has one foul finishing with the left Music Music Stanfords Maxim REO is a true Parisian renaissance man lets count the ways hes got the height SF footer you want height youve got the Eiffel Tower hes got flow like the sen River little shot fake will flow down the lane you want some more well how about a threepoint shot a little Arc de trium he can do that too shooting 34 from Beyond The Arc its part of his game he can rebound Allah staining the glass like the stained glass at not Trum leads the ACC in rebounding at almost 12 per game he can do it all uh mentioned to us when we were talking to him today one of his favorite things to do in Paris just sit at Cafe watch people go by things are slow for you fast for everybody else one of the great cities in the world and hes got the personality as well which is kind of what makes him a superstar in this league hes got the personality and hes turned into more of a vocal leader this season for a team which is huge if you want to be a leader of the team obviously you could do it by your play but then vocalize it a little bit more and really get these guys in position to win basketball games and we know hes capable of bringing the ball up and making those decisions but for Stanford where hes most effective is in the post get him the ball where he can be most effective and then let him be aggressive how much does bringing the ball up Court take away from him and how much of that does it take out of him well it takes a lot especially when North Carolina state is going to pick you up full court when you get to the top of key youre already tired to make a decision or make a play so you got to have somebody else besides him bring the ball up sers agar wall one of those guys and then get him where he can be most effective in half court which is in that mid post area Middlebrooks coming all the way out near the logo to pick him up he knows middle Brooks has the one foul they go down low okara into the corner Donovan young too much and if thats on middle Brooks thats going to be two and that is two on Middlebrooks oakar has to see that mismatch he he had Hill on him all he had to to is turn and just go right up to the Bas middle Brooks who again battling a bit of an illness which has been going through the team in his previous four games 10 points 13 rebounds 14 fouls yeah he has to be able to play basketball physical without fouling they need him on the court now Kevin Keats told us now this was going to be part of the plan they were going to pick up raino wherever he was they wouldnt be afraid to switch off of him even when hes on the perimeter oara battling down low against Styles wild hook I dont think that hit the rim and it is a shot clock violation well you even see him right now look how tired is hes handling the ball all the way out by half court for 5 seconds and then he gets to the threepoint line hes exhausted you have to have somebody else get the ball get him in position where he can be most effective whos that guy for me for Stanford it would be sers sers is a guy who can handle the ball he can make decisions hes more of a score but hes capable of handling the basketball Here Comes Styles over the Freshman young and styles draws the foul in half court NC state has been struggling mightily right they cant shoot the ball at a high level who are you going to go to whos the guy whos going to stepped up we talked about donrees Styles it has to be him hes versatile he can get into the mid post he can shoot to three let him get the basketball be aggressive and look to make plays in the half court both in the midst of a seven game losing streak its the longest of the Kevin Keats era the last three have all been double digit losses ACC mens basketball Wednesday uh these are some high IQ teams right here Stanford at Georgia Tech Cal at Duke playbyplay and analysts will uh we need to freshen up on their vocabulary absolutely well were both Syracuse guys we got some high IQ we get into those schools absolutely Applause not and another call and Anisha I just think hes just using so much energy and effort out there on the perimeter perimeter dribbling the ball you have to be able to get him into areas where he doesnt have to use so much effort he could just turn make a move and then look to be aggressive towards the hoop its a clock issue that theyre working on Clarence Armstrong Isaac Barnett and Michael kits the officials today now you start to think about NC State and what they did last year they limped into the ACC tournament losing their last four four regular season games then win five games in 5 days to get the automatic qualifier eventually get to the final four you win the ACC tournament as a 10 seed you get to the final four as an 11 seed you were on a similar run with Syracuse back in 2006 where you knew you needed a big week in the Big East tournament to get into the NCAA tournament four games four days Jerry mcamera goes nuts you try try to bottle that up if youre NC State you have some guys from that team like whats the secret sauce that that gives you belief and gives your faith that you can pull off one of those runs I think the biggest thing is every every guy has to be able to buy into their role what can they really do to impact this team the difference between NC State this year and last year is last year they had a guy who hey Im going give you the ball you go ahead you can score whos that guy this year for NC State is it Styles is it Taylor they really have to have a definitive Guy step up into that role yeah is it Marcus Hill you guys had Jerry mcnamer you had your moments too well we had Jerry mamir and then we had other guys when defensively they took him out that could step up and get a Music bucket Applause two short NC State from that final four team horn and burns were the big losses but eight new comers five transfers three freshman the Wolfpack have not won a game away from home this season 0 and8 in neutral and true Road games and even with that basket by Hill five of 18 from the field and its allowed Stanford to stay in this game despite just nine field goal attempts and six turnovers well honestly the way this game is being played NC State wants to play like this half court theyre theyre not great we talked about that score in the basketball they want to be able to junk it up a little bit theyre physical defensively they want to be able to cause some turnovers if they can get space in the half court their guards are more than effective driving Applause downhill a guy like Marcus Hill you just want to give him a little bit of space and then hes strong and powerful to get downhill you see him scoring right there with the right hand over R Taylor took the rebound from his teammate Styles Off the uger Wall Miss Styles against Thompson faces up and it rolls through and heres the press and styles has that in his game he could face up he could jab he can go get into the paint hes more than capable of scoring the basketball in that area Styles began at North Carolina Georgetown last year where he averaged a dozen a game Reno down low the Frenchman no good with the Lefty hook uger Walls tip not there stays with it and eventually mops up and these are the other guys in N who really need to step up whether its an offensive rebound dive it on the floor they need to be able to add value to the team and for R know in the half court you know theyre going to bring that double team NC State you have to be more decisive in your decision making and just Applause attack def Hill from d and thats a goal Applause tend sloppy 12 and 12 minutes at Maples Pavilion NC State now Stanford they got here on Monday Kevin Keats was joking with us this morning he said yeah we basically West Coast guys at this point and this is it is what it is now like teams are going to have to deal with this travel schedule coming all the way from the East Coast to the West Coast you cant make any EXC excuses you got to come out here you got to be ready to play and Stanford and Cal for their East Coast trips theyve been doing the same theyve been leaving on Monday and then just staying all week on the East Coast before heading back NC state has probed a weakness they dont think Stanford has any reliable ball carriers look how far theyre picking up Stanford not just in the back court but in the front Court as well well their their offense is starting out by the half court line in the time that they get to the threepoint line or inside the paint they got five six seconds on the shot clock yeah and it results in another turnover Styles off balance and it draws the foul fourth team foul on Stanford and again it need this is how North Carolina State wants to play they want to be able to create havoc on the defensive side of the ball create turnovers and if they have to play in a half court set give it to your guy d Tre Styles give it to one of your guards and attack try to get downhill if you cant make it get an opportunity at the F line like you see Styles right Applause now Stanford seven turnovers today they average a little under 11 a game and you look at know the last game against Wake Forest 11 assists 17 turnovers turnovers the last few games without Blakes has been problematic for Stanford well 31 turnovers in their last two games not only without Blakes but without geler two of their primary ball handlers I mean youre seeing it right now Stanford is struggling without those two guys camon looking for help thats not the guy Stanford wanted to bring the ball up thats North Carolina state is just doing a great job of being in NC State doing a great job of being in Stanfords pocket making him make a quick decision Mike you know better Michael oconnell you know better Mike picking up the foul first game back on the farm after three years and a degree from Stanford and here is sers he gets the front end of the one and one sers and Reno only have five points in the first half and again with Blakes out Stanford needs those guy needs those two to get at least you know 35 to 40 this is not a particularly deep Stanford Squad well 6 minutes left in the half 645 R not has three shots and sellers has two shots you should at least have 8 to 10 a piece in this first half especially with your best defender and best ball handler not playing Styles nearly lost it turns it over Stinson up ahead to stellers in transition wipers pass the def and then Stinson the follow and Anish I think for both teams if they can create turnovers in the half court and then get out and get easy opportunities and transition where they dont have to play against a set defense that favors both teams Stinson picks up the foul see Styles right there just stumbling turn it over and then its just creating easy opportunities for Stanford at The Rim good job by cson following up the Miss but both teams they need to be able to create turnovers to get easy transition opportunities on the other end ishma D misses the free throw hes the def facto back up big Brandon Huntley Hatfield did not make the trip out to California out with a shoulder injury and thats a a big loss down low given the foul trouble issues Ben Middlebrooks has had and coach he said ishma is more of a offensive guy but right now you see him moving his puppies a little bit hes hes able to stay in front and and cause Havoc for these Sanford guys hes got five points and a rebound in 9 minutes Stinson The Freshman out of cheny Washington just outside of Spokan and this what has to happen when you have guys injured it presents opportunities for other guys to come up and you just have to be aggressive nobody found Taylor on the back cut they need Jaden Taylor to bust out of a shooting slump just 28 over his previous four games heres oara tie to season high with 14 last time out hard drive and the rebound snagged by Trey Parker Taylor calling for it Parker didnt see him D on the drop off a Applause scramble and it goes to Stanford honestly Anish you Pro you probably dont want ishma driving and trying to you know make a decision and drop off pass like that if Im North Carolina state in the half court set we know youre struggling shooting the ball you have to be able to get downhill or you have to be able to cut to the basket like you saw Taylor on the previous possessions to get those opportunities but really want what they want to do is create turnovers and then get out and get easy opportunities in transition Applause baby I do like what NC State is doing putting on the Press they know that Stanford doesnt have a primary ball handler who could really make decisions and Stanford has been struggling this half even just getting it across half court getting into a flow with their offense seven turnovers for Stanford in this first half auger wall turns it over making eight up ahead Parker in trouble Styles right Applause there and again this is how NC State wants to play one thing my coach told me growing up never drive jump and pass dont jump in the air and then try to pass the ball land on two feet get in a good position where he can make a decision sers coughs it up turnover number nine Hill leading the break too much offensive rebound camon the block on dant Tre Styles really NC State is leaving the door open just by missing those opportunities at The Rim young missed a bunny cant get it on the follow o Connell almost walked that sort of sums up the first half doesnt it well me and you could go out there and play right now honestly oh one of us could its just been a sloppy first half but I think a guy like oconnell he could get him in their set and get a good shot in the half court oconnell misses the wild layup sellers the rebound Stanford six of 18 from the field NC State 9 of 24 sers with the bucket to make it a fourpoint game and youre going to have to be able to make some shots like that those are tough shots but to sustain a whole game you got to get some flow in your offense when you do get in transition you have to be able to make the right Applause decision Trey Parker with his third threepointer of this first half hes been really the one bright spot on both teams we talked about having a guy you could go to when you have nothing a guy who can create and make tough shots and Trey Parker is stepping up and being that guy for NC State sellers at the other end now Parker with nine points in the opening half thats double his season average Lise if Im sellers Im Im looking to be aggressive on every single possession if I dont have an opportunity at The Rim the defense is going to collapse and you got opportunity for your teammate Dennis Parker went right around Aiden camon NC state has made Seven of its last nine from the field Anisha another thing for Stanford right now is they dont have a guy out there whos recognizing the mismatch Oar right now Im Im if Im Oar in the half court it was a great great take by sellers he has to continue to be aggressive but o par right now he has a guy like Parker on him you got to be able to take advantage of that in the half court right now with the scores table and I think he made a great point on sellers having to take over there was a moment not long ago where again hes calling for it he says Ill do it myself thats what you have to do especially with the Blakes out whos going to step up and and be the man theres Oar threw a double it for two I mean he has a mismatch every single time in the half court six he super strong giving the ball and get an opportunity at The Rim to make it or get foued and have two shots car averaged 16 and a half last year for Harvard in the ivy league oconnell who had that great ACC tournament last year Parker rainbow po a gold oh the Freshman feeling it a dozen on four first half threes I tell you one thing basketball is a game of confidence regardless of your shooting percentages when youre feeling good youre feeling good and thats how Trey Parker is feeling right now for NC State sers wants a screen trying to drive past Parker knocked away tend to shoot Stamford ball Reno and Stinson coming in for the Cardinal his name is Trey Parker four for five from the field four or four from threepoint land the rest of the team is 8 for 23 hes hitting him with the slip and slide we talked about in the beginning North Carolina State excuse me NC State is looking for that goto guy right now Trey Parker is say Call My Name yeah Trey Parker with some Matt Stones tonight hes got a dozen four for four from three the rest of the team uh just eight for 23 raino hes got four been a quiet first half offensively for the accs leading scorer thats where he needs to get the ball at get the ball turn over that left shoulder right hand hook left hand hook whatever it is just be aggressive in that spot on the floor Taylor driving on Oar back iron rebound comes to Evan Stinson and Ana I think Taylor is another guy from North Carolina state whos more than capable of getting into the paint and creating something he has to look to be more aggressive and look for opportunities sellers iron sides it def defense about a 4 and 12 second differential between the game clock and the shot clock OK Connell measuring sellers six to shoot OK connells pass deflected by Reno this is Dennis Parker with one no good good rebound Young and the first half comes to an end that will not count teams when stuff breaks down they always have a guy to go get the ball and create something with nothing is it going to be Trey Parker for this NC State team is it going to be donrees Styles who had eight points in the first half at a chance for two here if Im dant Tre Styles and I get the ball that deep Im turning facing ripping through and going putting my shoulder into his chest if I dont finish at The Rim Im going to get opportunity at the free throw line Donovan young picked up the Applause foul you said earlier you felt styles with somebody who could be the alpha in this wolf pack why well hes versatile he could do it inside he could do it outside he has the ability to be able to change direction on the dribble and I think defensively hes a guy who can guard multiple positions he can guard a big and then he can also switch and guard a guard hes a guy whos highly recruited coming out of high school and I just think he has that capability to be able to do it on both ends of the floor wolf pack again picking up 90 feet after the ma basket the made free throw shers with 10 in the first half he led Stanford almost a turnover Anish without Blakes they just dont have that guy to be able to make those decisions for sellers in the half court Stanford has to find a way to get him into the handoff and get downhill get into the rim and thats a desperation threepointer by Stinson your NC State you say okay those are the shots that youre going to get you tip your cap Im guessing Kevin Keats is okay with that hes okay with that but on the other hand if youre Stanford youll take those shots as well you need other guys to be able to step up and make an impact and sometimes thats hard for guys to come in and play a role that theyre not used to playing Seven for Stinson thats a career high that one rimmed out for Applause Styles Stanford can tie it with a three Hill defending uger wall now Reno against Middlebrooks middle Brooks got into foul trouble picked up two in the first half raino and one for the Frenchman and that is three on Ben Middlebrooks rain rain is more capable from starting outside and working his way in Middle Brooks has to learn how to play defense without using his hands right here Rao just a good job getting into his chest and great players make tough shots middle Brooks has to do a better job of sliding his feet and beating raino to that spot yeah thats twice now where it felt like Maxim Reno baited middle Brooks into a foul hes a high IQ player he knows if middle Brooks is going to play with his hands hes going to take advantage of that and draw the foul hes a math minor a computer science major and a chess player so it checks out I was a CRS major communication rhetorical studies communicate guess what I can speak my butt off you spoke some French on the court too didnt you theres hill with a chance for a threepoint play different kind of French a different kind of Applause french hill strength is really getting to the rim if he can turn that corter and use his strong body put his shoulder in his chest hes going to have a greater chance of finishing at The Rim opportunity for an an one an RO Eric dandorf I had to say I was surprised before the game how friendly and cordial the officials were with you when they came over to say hello yeah they weve had our backs and forth in uh over the years yes over the years so now Im Im on the other side so its a different type of relationship that we have oconnell guarding his former teammate auger wall now Applause R sson good shot good shot good shot Music Styles wants to drive on Stinson boy he saw that went right at him and able to draw the foul really a semi transition opportunity for NC State great job by Styles recognizing it he was laid on the close out just ripping grow Ripp and go be simple get to the basket be aggressive Applause Styles has done most of his work at the free throw line tonight seven for nine from the stripe only a 66 free throw shooter entering play but what thats telling me inish is hes being aggressive and for NC State you want styles to be aggressive Trey Parker into the game he had the big first half with the four threes oh yeah auger wall gets free off the screen drops it off to Oar for two Stanford has to just look to attack stop playing with the basketball up top your favor in NC State doing that look for the advantage attack the advantage if the defense rotates look for the open Man styles attacking Reno turns the tip by Middlebrooks not there but a whistle Stanford ball handlers keep it simple if you see the downhill opportunity take it if he steps up make that right read great decision right there by agall with the drop in the dunp two shots for B Middlebrooks and Middlebrook still looking to get on the scoreboard the foul was on Stinson his third Middlebrooks last four games just three of 15 from the field we mentioned the foul trouble hes got three already today J Jaylen Thompson in for Stinson whos given Kyle Smith some good minutes off the bench with guys out opportunities present themselves you have to be able to take advantage of those opportunities one out of two for Middle Brooks the former Clemson Tiger who conratulations spent his first three Collegiate Seasons backing up some pretty good bigs PJ Hall at Clemson then DJ Burns at NC State an one thing about playing against pressure defense is you have to keep it simple but you have to attack the pressure attack the pressure and then make a decision Reno went right at middle Brooks and drops it in for two keep it simple be aggressive if theyre coming at me aggressive Im attacking that pressure and then looking at the opportunity that presents itself nine points for I know to go along with six rebounds hes the national leader with 19 double doubles oconnell over Reno rebound uger wall Stanford can take the lead with a three they go down low Reno drops it in for two more and thats great recognition right there by Agger wal just seeing the mismatch something that they didnt do in the first half getting into Reno an easy finish at The Rim 11 for Reno seven in the first four minutes of this second half middle Brooks for three way short four for 16 from three on the season just 5 for 35 for his career I think thats a shot that coach Kevin Keats does not want to see Middlebrook take auger walls three hits the back rim middle Brooks wants it size advantage on sellers theres the double Taylors three rattles home great job by middle Brooks being patient seeing whos open hitting the crosscourt pass great extra pass in the corner and if you get an up an opportunity at three point I dont care what the percentages are you have to be able to shoot it Reno is fouled if thats middle Brooks that is four TR back it is four fouls on midd Brooks for Stanford Reno just has to be aggressive he know Middlebrooks is foul prone put the ball down on the ground attack his chest great job recognizing he was in transition Reno with the easy finish Music Eric dandorf Maxim Reno three for three seven points in the second half hes got 11 and seven for the game closing in on double double number 20 and on the last possession he drove on middle Brooks this time hanging in the lube hes smelling blood first half was a different story than this half he smells blood and now he is attacking Maxine Reno hello he got middle Brooks out of the game with the four fouls as the three goes for Jaden Taylor 33 from Deep hes trying to shake a little bit of a shooting slump and theyre going to give it to raino he has done what he has wanted to do in the second half raino from the corner now the entire crowd Odd as that shot went up Parker had the hot hand early thats Styles who couldnt handle Styles against Reno step back short tipped rebound number eight for Reno and I think for NC State thats the advantage that they have on this end Styles has to attack Reno great job by oakar attacking the rim right there semi transition opportunity Stinson back in for Stanford Applause Parker four threes in the first half Taylor down low dof well NC State is going to continue this ball pressure throughout the game and this time its isma dof picking up the foul when raino touches the ball good things are happening for Stanford this is a different raino in the second half hes just being aggressive right here taking off 7 foot one attack in the rim and nobodys going to get in the way of that right there we need to see more of that from raino just being aggressive towards the rim Reno thought about the three the handoff sellers well they are looking for 42 raino looking for sellers Stinson playing wingman I tell you what and these theyre looking for that third guy besides sers and Ray no and right now Stinson is taking advantage of the opportunity that is given hes two for three from threepoint range he was 5 for 24 on the season entering play Taylors three back iron rebound Donovan young Stanford can take the lead oiah sers fouled on the drive its on Marcus Hill Stanfords capable of getting out and playing fast and getting opportunities in transition you dont always want to have to play against a set defense in half court get out and try to get easy opportunities the doubleedged sword for Stanford is theyre not necessarily built to play for long stretches at an uptempo Pace like NC state has just dont have the depth and even more so without Blakes without gerer but when the opportunity presents itself you have to be able to take advantage of it opportunity presenting itself for maxim REO hes got 15 and Im 64 but if I was 71 Im attacking the rim every single time Ray no has found his Groove in this second half first lead for Stanford since it was 85 Parker thats his first Miss from three tipped back Parker blocked from behind by young but theyll get Donovan young with his third Music foul now in this age where guys leave and seeing a player at three schools in four years has become something were accustom to how much does staying at one Program help you look at Maxim Renos development Ill tell you what the grass isnt always green on the other side if youre transferring every other year it takes a lot to get used to this system r has stuck here with Stanford hes a loyal guy and hes developed every single year and now hes put himself in position to be a first round NBA draft Pi yeah he initially did enter the transfer portal when Stanford made their coaching change and then chose to return and you dont hear this often but in a place like Stanford it makes sense a big reason that he came back academics academics a smart kid and also you got to give credit to the coaching staff and Coach Kyle Smith heck of a guy personable guy and Im sure that had a decision in Rain stain as well 14 points now for Parker oneof a career high he set just recently against Duke raino that time too much knocked out of bounds itll stay with the Cardinal new 20 and 1210 to go in this second half competitive game Stanford at 7even and five in conference play looking to snap a two game losing streak you got NC State 2 and N in conference theyve lost seven in a row they have yet to win a game outside of Raleigh this season nise you see the difference when Reno gets the ball inside the threepoint line compared to starting outside of the threepoint line get him in a position where he could be more effective hes capable but get him it lower so now he can just make a quick move and get to the bucket R wants it augur wall on the drive and a chance for Applause three how do you attack this NC State pressure go right at it Ryan agarwall get you an add one young man Music Applause Maxim Mareno has a chance to lead the ACC in scoring and rebounding he currently leads in both categories the last five players in the ACC to do it all one conference player of the year now historical season for raino the problem is generational Transcendence season for Dukes Cooper flag and with all due respect I would be stunned if anybody outside of the Duke freshman was ACCC Player of the Year well hes not only going to be ACC player of the year but I think hes in the running for NCAA Player of the Year in my mind hes the best player in the country and thats not discrediting anything that r no is doing any other year he would have been ACC Player of the Year and Ray no is still is an AllAmerican candidate no doubt No Music Doubt that doesnt fall for dof camon the rebound and Stanfords got some size out there the 610 camon Reno its 71 opara at 68 its a small lineup for NC State Reno over D to strong now Music Parker spin cycle hes got Reno on the switch Reno Falls sellers bothered the shot Second Chance dof three is not there and Reno one rebound away from his 20th double double in an N were going back to the kale game when NC State had five assists on 24 field goals its too much ISO ball going on all thats going to lead to is tough shots you got to get some ball movement side to side create those driving Lanes so you can get easier looks at the basket yeah thats been an issue all season long for the pack uger wall driving on Parker leaves it for okara and Stanford extends its lead to four really love how agarwall has kind of settled into that point guard role this half making great decisions Kevin Kats wants a timeout Maxim raino from the city of Lights as little fire under the Stanford team theyre a 102 run Music Music la Music Music Music Music Im Music Music got Music tonight after ACC basketball the nothing but net crew will break down the day and the night in the ACC highlights analysis of all the games and uh some significant changes in Bracketology Wake Forest going 2 and0 in California beat Stanford on Wednesday they beat Cal today winning on the road has been challenging for Wake they have now moved into Joes projected field Joe lardy theyre the last team in SMU off this weekend theyre in action at home against pit on Wednesday big game both teams on the bubble SMU part of that last four in group or first four out group as is North Carolina which beat pit so UNC now one of the first four out pit goes from first four out to next four out were in the part of the season right now where every game counts its a big Clump in that middle of the conference Duke Clemson SMU really separated their themselves but everybody else is right there within each other raino has taken over in the second half 13 of his 17 since halftime 122 Stanford run and seven unanswered Applause oconnell Hill hes not a great outside shooter thats a long two camman snags the caram every single shot that NC State ends up in ISO theres no shots off a ball movement off a drive and kick opportunities every shot is a tough shot oar is open instead they go and play through raino he does it again 19 for the Frenchman I think they found out where hes most effective at down low in the post yes we know hes capable of bringing the ball up but get him down low right there where he can just turn and attack and the Wolf Pack stem and 9 run Stanford with its biggest lead and theyre going to get camon with a reach in on styles Applause and Anish it was it was a good play from Styles being aggressive but its so hard to play like that cuz now all the defense is is loaded up looking at you ready to play you have to get some more ball movement and Ben Middlebrooks about to check in for NC State with the four fouls I think Kevin Keats realizes he needs some resistance against Maxim Reno and if middle Brooks fouls out out I mean listen he hasnt been on the floor a whole lot because of fouls anyway right now if Im right on Im telling give me the basketball first of all middle Brooks cant guard me second of all he has four fouls and Im going to attack him and Im a foul out of this game or foul middle Brooks out of this Applause game NC state has missed eight of its last nine field goals including seven in a row theyve got almost five minutes since their last field goal Aug wall guarded by a pesky Parker Reno against Middlebrooks picked up the bounce T to Music shoot aaal on the drive pulls up uses the window deposit slip for two and thats a tough shot a a good make for Stanford but again why is Reno playing out on the perimeter get him down low where hes and foul middle Brooks out of this game what does NC State have to do to get the offense out of hibernation they have to get some good ball movement some side of side and they got to create those driving opportunities where you get a chance at The Rim or if the defense helps you get a drive and kick middle Brooks no battle for the board one by Applause oconnell Parker hierarch in three his fifth triple of the game game okay Trey Parker we know you can make tough shots but again to your point in thats not sustainable basketball you have to be able to figure out a way how to get some easier shots Trey Parker hes been hitting him with the slip and slide all game go ahead and get you a another Trey Ball young man Trey Parker knocking it down Music Maxine Rayo has taken over in this second half 15 of his 19 points here in the second half to go along with 11 rebounds he just tied the school record today for most double doubles in the season and yes hes capable of doing it out on the perimeter but get him the ball where hes most effective and thats down low in the post and when he gets it there turn and be aggressive and attack the basket 19 points nine of 14 11 rebounds 20 double doubles on the season number one in all of division one thats 20 double doubles in 24 games oara wild Wolfpack looking to push theyve got numbers okara finally gets back Taylor the turnaround no good and a foul against St Stanford well packed ice call from the field one for their last 10 just five of 19 in the second Applause half and each now like when NC State gets those opportunities in transition they have to be able to explode and just and look to take advantage of that theyre struggling getting anything in the half court right now the foul on Reno Stanford seventh so middle Brooks to the free throw line itll be a one and one single bonus itll broke Music Applause 73 okay can Middlebrook stay on the floor thats going to be key for NC State if if Im Stanford right now hes out of there after this next possession right now I have to go if Im Stanford I have to look for Reno in the post you see right now they have St on him but you have to be able to try to get him into a switch situation to where you could attack middle Bros Trey Parker away from the ball 16 foul on the pack so the next one puts Stanford in the bonus and even right now with Styles Garden right you have the advantage go to him okay youre not going to guard me with Middlebrooks put me down on the post and Im going go go attack Applause Styles shot clock at six uger wall leans into Styles tried to draw the foul Styles held his ground well thats the last thing you want if youre Stanford and you see right now raino hes hes tired hes hes gasping for air right now dont make him do too much just get him into a spot you have to set a screen so he can get the advantage coming off and get him will look easy at the basket okell without a point today Parker he put some helium on those shots raino with a dozen Music Applause rebounds here comes sers inside fouled its going to be on oconnell his third and if theyre not going to get Reno the ball down low in the pulse we havent really talked about sellers at all in this second half get downhill put your shoulders to the basket be aggressive and look for an opportunity if you dont finish try to get an opportunity at the foul line make two up two two sellers at the free throw line 89 in conference play womens basketball for you every Sunday here on the ACC Network this weeks double header the Commonwealth clash between Virginia Tech and Virginia and then we get to see the great Hannah Hidalgo and Notre Dame their home for 21st rank Cal first two points of the second half for osiah sers the USC transfer hes in double figures for a 10th straight Music Applause game Taylor picked up by raino deep three over the backboard Stanford ball and those shots just arent going to cut it for NC State theyve been playing the whole second half shooting those type of shots they already struggle shooting the ball now theyre not getting good opportunities and good looks this is the way that their offense is going to play NC State five of 21 in the second half theyve missed 11 of their last 12 Stanford meanwhile shooting 70 since the break sers rebound down Applause hill hill likes to drive downhill against uger wall for two if youre going to attack if your NC State attack early in your offensive step when Stanfords not set up defensively nine for Marcus Hill the teams leading score in almost 13 a game Music Applause I think theyre going to get middle Brooks with a foul they do and that is five and he is done wow that is a horrible horrible foul to to foul out on that type of play right there he has to be smarter than Applause that Ben Middlebrooks now in his last five games has 13 points and 19 fouls yeah not a good ratio right there and so Kevin Keats for the last 541 in regulation with his team down four does not have his top two bigs going up against one of the best big men in the country Brandon Huntley Hatfield who normally would be the backup five he didnt make the trip to California dealing with his shoulder so these are Big minutes now for Ismail Duke now if Im NC State I watched him in practice the other day theyre working on a little bit of Zone do they junk it up and do they show a different defense put it into a little Zone and try to you know mix it up with Stanford and keep him off balance in the first half what worked against Reno was Reno was bringing the ball up and NC State was able to wear him out he only played about 11 and A2 minutes in the first half Stanford adjusted they stopped doing that with Reno in the second half hes been able to park in the post and hes been cooking guys got a little bit more comfortable handling the ball for Stanford Agra wall sellers in the first half NC State did a good job of getting up and under them now theyre theyre comfortable theyre attacking the pressure and theyre able to make decisions at The Rim whos the guy for NC State in these spots last year you could go to DJ horn you could go to DJ Burns Hill the Bowling Green transfer offline Applause sers got free Reno bats it back and its going to be a one and one foul on NC State and Max stre Maro to the free throw line and right now Stanford if they just take their time and execute in the half court they have the advantage every single time offensively you have to find out how you can get raino coming off a cross screen defense is going to be in a scramble on that screen and now you can hit him in that mid post low post area where he could just catch it and turn an ACC play raino 37 of 40 at the Applause stripe Anish NC State they have to find out away offensively to get some ball movement and to get this Stanford defense moving side to side every single shot in this second half has been a tough shot and again you cant sustain a whole game playing basketball like that and Kevin keatss team they are searching for answers who steps up in the big spot who gets you into the offense and well get a foul on cam away from the ball his third so a one and one for NC State Stanford from here on out in the double bonus so in the first half NC State was able to create havoc and and Stanford was turning the ball over now Stanford is doing a good job of taking care of the ball how else can NC stfe score in half court they havent been to get been able to get any type of ball movement in the first half they were scoring off the Stanfords turnovers Stanford only has one turnover in the second half they been doing a great job of take care of the ball and against this pressure defensive NC State you have to be able to take care of the ball theyve been turning the ball over these last two games last two and a half games theyve been doing a great job in this second half just calming down and handling the Applause pressure the free throw line is whats kept NC State in this game in the second half 13 out of 15 at the stripe six of 23 from the field and the Styles has had a big hand in it 15 Points 11 to 14 from the line able to break the Press Here Comes Reno over to sellers Applause blocked and in Niche for the rest of this game NC stay shooting 34 from the field for the rest of this game if Stanford can stay composed and not turn over the basketball theyre going to be in good shape to win it do they double raino plenty of time to shoot Baseline Drive tough angle side of the backboard NC State with numbers Parker over to Hill strong to the 10 twopoint Applause game with NC State struggling to score the basketball in half court they have to be able to create easy opportunities at the bucket Marcus Hill with the Finish Music Applause their pressure is going to come ramp up you expect NC State to turn the dial pressurewise Stanford no field goals in almost four minutes and this is not a deep team Stanford even more shorthanded with the injuries to Blake uh Blakes and then to to geler being out with the illness so weve seen Stanford sometimes run out of Ed down the stretch thats going to be something to watch here in the last 4 and 12 minutes NC State can get after you well you know NC State is bringing the pressure the rest of the game you have to stay in Poise bring the ball up over half court not turn it over and what was working for Stanford in this second half was getting REO the ball closer to the rim you have to find ways to get him the ball closer to the rim where he can be most effective Renos been on the floor almost the entire second half Im not sure hes taking a rest and we get a foul underneath as Styles and raino battling for position and theyre going to get styles on the foul so thats now a double bonus two shots for Stanford and theyre not going to make it easy for raino to catch the ball but he has to be able to get his position seal off and make it a clear pass for his teammates right here good job by Styles just being aggressive but just over aggressive and theyre going to call that every single time but thats how NC state has to play at 66 trying to defend Applause 71 22 points a dozen rebounds for the Frenchman so Anish if I see the advantage that we have if Im Stanford against NC NC State Im going back to that every single time down the floor until they stop it or until it doesnt work Applause I think sometimes an Nish you see Reno going out the game getting the blow yeah a very Savvy breather for Reno with the under four mediate timeout coming and uh you can steal maybe a couple of possessions where you give Rano a breather just a couple not a lot just a couple Styles spell tied up possession arrow Stanford Stanford ball the Cardinal with a fourpoint lead can NC State figure it out on the road or will the Cardinal Prevail fun finish coming up chfa chfa basketall returns to to take on cforia on Saturday February 22nd at 7 pm for more information and to purchase tickets visit c Music all Music Music you Music Music 354 to go here at Maples Pavilion Stanford 14 out of 24 from the field in the second half they have started to take care of the ball Maxim Reno has done most of his damage offensively since the break he recorded double double number 20 on the season tying Adam kefs single season School record these last four minutes for both teams what does it come down to if Im Stanford just keep it simple take care of the basketball when you get into the half court set give the the ball to your best player Maxine renold and if Im North Carolina State you have to try to find some turnovers you can create and get easy opportunities at the basket if not in half court you have to get some ball movement to create some side to side movement from the Stanford Music defense Oar defended by Applause Music Taylor raino a three short side rim and doof controls lob up ahead Styles has been the aggressor today 14 free throw attempts for donrees Styles Parker The Freshman on the floor hes got a career high 17 Hill the leading scorer with a chance for three the oldfashioned way Applause and Anish if you dont get any ball movement I guess just give the ball to Marcus Hill let him get downhill be strong at the rim and get an opportunity for an one again its not sustainable basketball but if Stanford is going to let them get to the rim like that NC State is going to take it all day on the other end Stanford is making it hard for themselves get Reno the ball where he is most effective Donovan young picked up his fourth 14 points for Hill he had 20 Wednesday against Cal and a basket a score it allows NC State to set up its press and thats when theyve been most effective because it takes Stanford longer to get into their offense and even if Stanford doesnt turn over the ball NC State almost has an effect where theyre making Stanford Rush more and making a quicker decision and they havent been great at making those quick decisions Aug wall fighting through traffic AAR the put back Applause threepoint game 240 to go Applause def Styles faces up no good hugall with the Applause board goo setting the high screen auger wall inside wild shot tries to keep it in bounds he cant back to NC State last three possessions for Stanford Reno has not touched the ball in the low post he touched it one time and he got the ball with three seconds left on the shot clock and it was a desperation three Stanford has to be able to recognize what was working for them in the second half I have no clue why theyre going away from it yeah remember Ben midd Brooks has fouled out Brandon Huntley Hatfield the top two bigs not available for Stanford theyre playing without their top two point guards jayen Blakes and Benny geler Parker ran into the trees and dof is fouled its on aall both teams in the double bonus it was a shooting foul nonetheless so ishmail de will go to the line and Anish one thing that ishma has done a good job is just being available at The Rim these guards are going to get downhill and theyre going to create opportunities where the defense has to help hes been doing a great job of just being available at the rim and when he catches it going up Applause strong he missed them Applause both onoin right now when do they go to Maxim Reno now caught it low in the post fouled immediately by dof and two shots Reno at 23 and 12 with a chance to tack on well and heres my thing theyre also in the double bonus so even if you dont get him the ball look at him theyre being physical with him and theyre more likely going to commit a foul five for five at the stripe tonight Music Applause 20 points in the second half for Applause raino and Anish hes been playing like it but it just goes to show you when you dont have your primarily primarily ball handler coming in and making decisions they miss Jaylen Blakes yeah hes missed three straight with a head injury def Applause def fivepoint game Parker Styles and the three is good 18 for donrees Styles and that time we saw NC State create and get a teammate a good look if you can get some ball movement you want to be able to get downhill you see getting to the top of the key John TR Styles knocking it down Music Music in the conference right yeah I just its just crazy how theyre not going to him every time I dont know what I mean I know the ball pressure has a a lot to do with it Stanford will inbound twopoint game after the Styles three both teams in the double bonus Stanford as a team 86 from the line in conference Play Tops in the ACC Reno down low poked away 14 to shoot Cardinal ball and if Im raino when I get the ball yeah you want to see what you got but you have to go before that double team comes sellers to inbound Reno on the perimeter backing down doof five to shoot to a cutting oakar blocked by Styles we get a jump ball possession arrow to NC State and now now the wolf pack with 101 can tie with a two and to take the lead with a Applause three and this is the challenge for NC State in these spots whos the guy its been Trey Parker today its also been Don Tres sou so you have two options you just dont want to get put in an ISO situation get some movement from side to side off the pick and roll downhill so you can have the advantage like that right there Trey Parker making a great play at The Rim I dont think he had Dall on the bingo card we are tied at 71 but it was Parker created Stanfords missed nine of its last Applause 10 19sec differential game clock into shot clock sers on the drive lost it cam lost it but a foul they get styles Applause Trey Parker get into the pick and roll opportunity get down hill make that defense help great drop right there to ishma for the finish at the bucket Trey Parker has been making plays all game The Freshman is continuing to improve he had the assist to Styles as well camman only a 53 free throw shooter gets the first 11 of 20 now on the season from the line the foulon Styles his fourth now Nish coming down go to what worked with your NC State go back into that ball screen try to get downhill and create an advantage big Miss NC State can take the Applause lead Parker using the doof screen Styles gets free his three blocked by camon the put back by the Freshman Parker and Clarence Armstrong wants to take a look at the monitor I wonder if this is a timing issue how about Trey Parker hes not even six foot at each hes just going up there with the big boys and hes fired up right now hes been having a heck of a game for NC State Anish Ro Eric dindorf and Eric Trey Parker has made winning plays now he had the assist to styles on the three he had the assist down low to do it for the two to tie and then the offensive rebound and the putback to give NC State a lead they are looking at the clock and its 173 for Stanford the Cardinal can hold for one theyre in the double bonus down one they just need a two I dont think this is a mystery as to whos touching the ball well if Im Stanford if if they take away right know we havent really heard a lot from sellers in this second half but he has the capability to turn that corner and be aggressive at The Rim NC State looking to snap a seven game losing streak they havent won a road game in almost a calendar year aall on the drive all the way switcher Stanford by one final a seconds Here Comes Parker and we get a timeout Kyle Smith uses his final timeout NC State with the ball Stanford with the lead well we said sellers we said R know how about Ryan agall right here just taking it to the rim playing through the contact tough finishing the lane the Up and Under finishing with the right hand go lets goord this morning with Jaylen Blake outout we asked Kyle Smith whos your third option behind Reno and sers he paused for a good bit before he said okara and then you brought up uger wall and you said yeah thats a guy that you know we see signs of him coming to life played pretty well in the Wake Forest game had a dozen points nine today along with seven rebounds and eight assists well look you dont want to have injuries if youre Stanford but what it also does is present opportunities for other guys to step up and see what theyre capable of you see Ryan oll really taking advantage of his opportunities and if Im NC State on this last possession go back into that pick and roll try to get downhill if Im Stanford Im loading up defensively and making them take those jump shots I got to imagine Trey Parker has earned to be at the controls in this moment absolutely if Im NC State Im giving him the ball and Im letting him make a play but you have to know theyre going to load up so you have to be able to make the right decision see whos open they added some time 82 Parker with a careerhigh 19 points five Music assists Styles will inbound and he can run the Baseline great decision by Stanford to pick up full court not let him get comfortable bringing the ball up Marcus Hill the teams leading scorer and Kevin Keats calls a timeout 39 seconds to go this doesnt leave NC State a whole lot of time what do you draw up with about 4 seconds to go so you got to get something quick Im trying to get Trey Parker coming off this zipper right here into the top where he can catch it and go right into the ball screen and try to go downhill if they help in you got to have a shooter in that corner just to give Parker another option Parker with five assists and he has been the Catalyst of this late comeback by NC State the wol pack have made five of their last seven shots Stanford battling today without their top two point guards NC State without its top two bigs middle Brooks fouled out Huntley Hatfield did not make the trip to California Wolfpack last won a true Road game at Clemson on the 17th of February of last year on the season 0 and six in True Road games 0 and2 on the neutral Court overall theyve lost seven in a row Stanfords been pretty good at home 122 this season and hes really the game started out super sloppy right the first 12 minutes both teams were sloppy with the ball not making shots but you got to give both teams credit the effort and the energy has definitely picked up and both teams are really competing at a high level giving themselves chance to win the game Applause Clarence Armstrong the head official at the scores table and theyre just looking at the timing one more time to make sure that the scoreboard and the clock shows the correct amount of time Music remaining 410 of the second added so 43 on the game clock styles with 18 Parker with 19 Hill with 14 theyve been the top three offensively today for State Jaden Taylor to inbound in front of the wolf pack Applause bench Here Comes Hill three two kicks to the corner shot on the way it ribs out and Stanford holds on
