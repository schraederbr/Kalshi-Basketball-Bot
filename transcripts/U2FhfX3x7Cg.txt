your head coach music for Murray State Oh but hes been around the game for a long long time More than 20 years as an assistant in college basketball Tiff is won back by Murray State in the Navy Blue Great to have you with us tonight in Dallas Briana Sorson the third member of our crew will be along in just a few minutes Hand off Javon Jackson and he rises and hits the transfer from UIC and Chicago with the first two tonight Yeah the leading scoreer He had over 30 in a game against Murray State last year Coach said looking back at the film hes a guy we had to have in our program Theres the SMU starting lineup Changing it up a little bit BJ Edwards Boopy Miller and Smetu Those are the same along with Cory Washington But Jeron Pierre Jr is in the starting lineup An absolute score from the wing Early foul on Fred King Yiko is a tough guy to handle inside at 72 I mean not only that but hes just a grown man Hes been playing professional basketball and hes now in his second year Hes playing the ACC so hes not afraid to play against anybody thats his size or below I love how both these teams have a really deep bench Ryan Miller will use 10 maybe 11 Corner three doesnt go down for BJ Edwards but Washington attacks the glass Cory Washington the up fake and kisses it home Cory Washington has been the early difference maker on this team in the Corpus game and in every game along with that just his toughness he does all the little things like you just saw there Murray State starting five Theyve already made a substitution by the way but Fred King did get the start at the center spot JJ Trainer Braden Sharter Javon Jackson and KJ TENER LEFT WING THREE GOES DOWN FOR GERON Pierre Jr He has been knocking the bottom out Six of nine for three now this season Tell you what one of the best scorers in the country just transferred in to go with that talented freshman class This young man can absolutely fill it up from anywhere in the floor Yeah CSA player of the year last year That ones just off for Braden Shorter Speaking of guy who can hit from deep this will be SMU basketball Theyre going to call that a long two instead of a three Yeah Pierre top five score in the country and hes getting his first start in Mustangs uniform And there you see him off the dribble just kind of get into a zone When you start in a game you get to take some of those shots and see it go in Sometimes when you come off the bench its a little harder because the games a little more set Lets take a look at the keys to the game tonight as Washington leads it a little bit short Coach Burton Yeah weve talked about a little bit Murray State threepoint shooting Theyre going to get up about 30 to 40 threes per game So thatll be a big key for them making shots in bench scoring cheering as well for SMU The consistent defensive urgency as you just saw there and dominating the paints and the boards Well Pierre Junior normally coming off the bench today starting So theyll have to live with those points in the starting lineup tonight Tell you what Coach Infield will live with those points any day of the week They need that extra scoring punch And here you see it leading to defense Iu knocks it away Miller in transition Boopy handing off Pierre Jr Another one No not quite just off But again both these teams living with a lot of pace and Yigato again adjusts it here Junior comes out with it boosting MILLER LOBS IT UP AND BJ EDWARDS ON THE OTHER END TRANSITION bucket for SMU And what you see from SMU as coach has been talking about early on play hard and cheering defend and then share the ball on offense and play with pace All those boxes so far the Mustangs have checked Seven of the nine points so far fast break points for SMU And if it wasnt for Cory Watsons missed layup they would have the another two points Thats a great point So Jackson trying to run the point here and a moving screen Another foul on a big man Dylan Anderson the transfer from Boise State who started his career at Arizona Now Murray State comes in 2 and 0 but they have a big exhibition win against music Xavier which anytime youre at a mid major youre looking to get those power conference wins however you can get them So that gave them a lot of confidence coming into this game feeling like they can play And a lot of the players on this roster have transferred down from power conference schools So this is a cheering great start for SMU because this Murray State team is very talented Mason Miller the coachs nephew He is on the floor for the first time wearing number 13 Hes played four years at Greatness Boofy Miller calmly knocks in a runner What a hot start for SMU Just absolutely under control Murray State already going into that bench looking for the five They can score it Mouse at the house and definitely turning to the glass and slamming it in JJ Trainer as he turned away from Boopy Miller and he gets the foul too Yeah they had a switch on that one where Boopy had a mismatch He fronted in the post Great job throwing it over top by Murray State Finished above the rim Man Ryan Miller you know sometimes you know youre thinking maybe Im a career assistant Well he finally got the opportunity It was the right job at the right time for him after four seasons of Miller coaching in just his third game as a head coach Sierra Jr lobs it inside Gigu to score but erase all that A righthanded hammer for the big man from Turkey Great job right there Pierre getting deep in the paint and decide you know what Im going to give this to the big fella Let him get an easy finish Great finish with authority Lane Taylor a transfer from UCA where he was a Bear Out front for a threepointer by Anderson Then hard off the heel again Rebound by Washington Edwards wants to push He can totally run the floor Quick turn Cant jam it Glabs his own miss Leaves it a little bit short Another rebound Edwards Pierre Jr with three off the mark Iu cant bring it down but three offensive rebounds on that trip Yeah SMU winning all the 5050 balls so far in this game Jam Jackson hammered and heads to the line on the other side of a timeout So SMU focused they are engaged They know how good Murray State is and SMU has brought their agame on offense up 13 to four Are great players but a lot of their subs could be a starter as well A great problem to have He said theyll play 10 or 11 players every single night And the margins between them are slim They expect to have between five to seven guys in double figures every single game And tonight it looks like theyll have to look through that for those bench players Ryan and John to get back in this game Outstanding Brie Thanks so much Yeah but the Racers are just going to keep ringing it And so theyre going to find a five thats going to work Yeah coach talked about its going to be a little bit of a not a revolving door necessarily but itll be a rotation of whoever is playing well theyre going to stay with that hot hand New player in for SMU Number four Sam Walters A stretch four Miller fires from out front Rough shooting start to the season for Boofy Miller from outside but no more His second three of the year Ill tell you what the defense for SMU talking to assistant coach Jay Morris he talked about they had 10 kills in the last game They got the job done defensively but couldnt score Right now theyre doing it on both sides and its definitely helping them get off to a good start Now remind us what a kill is Kill will be three stops in a row So defenses and staffs love to track when you can get three stops in a row They did that 10 times Typically their goal is to get seven cheering and usually when you get seven you give yourself a chance to win Meanwhile Murray State starting to get into it Their bench erupting after a big defensive play Javon Jackson who just scored on the other end helped create a turnover Yeah Murray State starting to settle into the game and get some defensive stops themselves Started the game off a little bit slow but starting to get into a rhythm Fred King with the hand off to Javon Jackson Back to King on the pick and slice to the hole The layup does not fall Somehow a hit every inch of the rim Junior wont stop his front Quick spin move and goes to the line Tell you what you can see how talented this young man is and hes made a difference in the lineup because he scores the ball so easily Hes also done a good job in the Corpus game He made some winning plays down the stretch The coach definitely acknowledged him getting better on the defensive side of the ball But when this young man is engaged on both ends he is as good of a scorer as youll find in college basketball Give the foul to Mason Miller Yeah Nor more than 1600 points in his career He did test the NBA waters uh before transferring into SMU What do you think Jeron Pierre Jr needs to do to be a productive pro at the next level Well again I think it goes back to that focus Its not about his talent Its not about his ability Can he show up with the approach every single day on every play to be that level of player I think thats the next step in his growth And hes done a good job starting off in this game A sevenpoint start for him He was averaging 16 and a half coming into the matchup Into the game for the first time one of the freshman the heralded freshman if you will Germaine ONeal Jr Yes that guys son out of South Lake in Dynamic Prep A 65 wing in there wearing number seven Drive by Corbone the Frenchman finds another Frenchman in Dolman Dolman giving some ground against Mitchell Holmes trying to cross him over Domen to the free throw line Keeps the pivot foot on the ground for a moment but not long enough as he travel against Murray State Thats one of those where coach Miller loves him being able to create loves the mismatch that he brings but that one hes like You got to get off of that one Keep the ball moving Dont try to do too much Similar to Yiglu Murray State has a couple of those freshman that come in from overseas after four or five years of pro ball So yeah they are freshman in your program but very much uh protype prospects as well at this level Well this is experience playing against other pros playing against older players That gives you a different experience than when youre playing against 18 19 year olds Good denial But Miller gets free Elbow jumper hard off the heel right down to Lane Taylor I love this kids game out of Arkansas Top three scorer all time in Arkansas high school history Number nine Yeah And was a star at Central Arkansas and a great pickup for Ryan Miller Really fits the system that he wants to run Similar to what he did at Kraton It was the offensive coordinator there He got to run the offense for that high highowered highscoring top 25 program And here hes bringing those same offensive ways here to Murray State And he raved about Taylors vocal ability on the floor And you see this young man yelling at his team in a positive way but with a sense of urgency of hey this is the play were running Were down here wanting to get things done Yeah he was dominant as a freshman in the ASON for Central Arkansas tore his labroom his left shoulder in January Wasnt able to go the rest of the year but hes been healthy since the summer Corbone little push off Nothing comes of it Jones defense for SMU Threepointer in and out but Taylor cracks down his own miss and kisses it high off the glass A natural point score L Taylor What theyre starting to do too is theyre starting to win some of those 5050 plays Early on the first fourminute game SMU was won majority if not all of those So now Murray State started selling to the game a little bit themselves ONeal off the curl pull up shot little long King with the rebound and the Racers have a chance to slice into the lead It was once really big for SMU Started out with an 110 run a lead of 10 Its down to eight now Well the last few possessions theyve really been behind the threepoint line They havent touched inside of the paint to play inside out Taylor kicks it out to the corner Miller slashes baseline leaves it for King drops against Yuku rolls it in Yeah thats a tough shot for an experienced player One of the young men that came over with coach Miller from Kraton and his per 40 Coach Miller said if he played 40 minutes he would averaged a double double almost 17 and 10 So they love his upside and what he can bring to Murray State And talking to one of the assistants before the game they think hell be the player of the year in this league if he can keep playing at the rate that hes playing Well how about that for Fred King Yeah 136 against Mississippi Valley State last time out and he did it in just 13 minutes of work By the way Mason Miller picked up his second foul in short order and Braden Sharter comes back on for the Razers again Luckily for Coach Miller his teams pretty deep And off to Miller out front around that screen Comfortable shot for three Thats a big old screen when Yikatu sets it Hey one Miller goes out of the game One Miller in big time shot off the ball screen like you said plenty of space created and when SMU is making threes this team is really hard to stop coming downhill right at you Corbone and hell head to the line to shoot Brian we saw that insanely fast style of play within the first few minutes of this game SMU already has nine fast break points Yeah just a style of play that players want to play in I mean youve seen the success with his recruiting having eight draft picks in seven years while he was at USC and the style of play is conducive to the transfer portal cuz kids are attracted to play this way They scored 80 points a game last season and you see a little bit of that pace of play like Brees talking about in the opening Yeah the 80 a game third in the ACC top 40 in the nation Of course in the Enfield with Florida GF Coast thats when everybody really became aware of him as a head coach and what an impact they made in the NCAA tournament Sam Walters theres that stretch for activity He is so capable of knocking it down from deep Yeah super experienced player has played in some big time moments in college basketball and been in some of the best programs in the country and much needed shot that he needed to see go in to get his confidence back going I mean hes a career 38 threepoint shooter King cleans up the trash inside Again all the big man does is produce Yeah you got to love when a a young man gets an opportunity to play a bigger role in his career and takes advantage of it Trippy Miller unable to hit King right there for the rebound Long pass up the floor and Corbone back to the corner Threepointer is way off But Braden Short who led division two for more than 103 last season at Washburn in Topeka Kansas Miller thought he saw you but its going to be on SMU for the foul It will be on Yiglu to pick up his first Yeah got to throw that one just a little bit higher but got caught pushing in the back against King And King again another guy whos played high major basketball He played at Kraton played in big moments played behind a pro and one of the best big man if not the best big man in the country last year So hes used to playing against that size and that talent in practice Absolutely and Ryan Caulk Runner Just one of the best big men out there the last few years at Greatton And King able to spell his minutes helped them be a sweet 16 team one year and a eight team another Little short corner action for Dolman Roman Domen backs his way in turns and fades over Washington That is a nifty move for Roman Dolman Yeah a lot of skill right there Again we talked about the talent on this roster They can make shots and that young man with a very creative Allah Im somebody who played in Dallas that looks a little similar that probably watched a little bit of Dirk growing up Absolutely Nextdoor neighbors those Germans and French Yiku jumping off Washington No Yiku knocks it to himself Washington grabs it And SMU again getting after those loose balls Washington just one of those guys who just ends up with the ball in his hands cuz hes a right place right time kind of guy Knows how to put himself in position and not afraid to just go grab it and make a play Oh yeah he brings the juice Theres no doubt about it King outside the arc He shoot a lot of threes in this Murray State offense as weve told you Taylor closed down on threepointer out of the corner by Corbone and he cinches the strings Thats the first triple for Murray State They average 12 a game Well was just about to compliment SMU on how theyve defended the threepoint line so far And theyve done a good job of it And speaking of defending no defense on that one BJ Edwards making it look easy DJ Edwards wants to be the defensive player of the year in the ACC but hes off to a good offensive start this season King lofts a three Does not fall SMU up by seven looking for more Terron Pierre Jr Seven points in his first time on the floor back out there after a short rest Finds the elbow Pull up shot doesnt fall Tolman continues into the lane hits the shot but its not going to count The foul is on the floor says Isaac Barnett our third official No continuation for Momen and on Washington or rather theyll call it a region on Pierre for foul number two Yeah thats where Pierres got to get a little bit more in a stance Just sit down and slide in front of him Wasnt a terrific move necessarily but got caught with his hands and picks up his second personal So a high pace game just like we thought it might be with SMU shooting 48 Murray State at 47 Glad to have you with us in Dallas The crowd rapidly assembling on this 11th day of the 11th month Hi there and hello to you on this Veterans Day T2 goes down for Javon Jackson He leads all racer scores with eight Yeah kind of that lost art of the midrange His second one of the game plays with an enormous amount of confidence on the offensive side of the ball Edwards has gotten better more confident offensively over the course of his career And Yiku helps his buddy out leaning back into it Ball gets loose Yiku grabs it A five on four back the other way as Edwards shifts into position gives it to Washington and in the corner Space is closed down and he is fouled by JJ Crraer right in front of the Racers bench Well hasnt been a lot of turnovers in this game necessarily but Murray State picks up their fifth turnover that leads to this open three that was open then it was blocked but the effort to get there for the block led to the contact on the landing for the foul that puts Washington at the line All righty Miller says JJ Trainer at 69 he is an elite athlete a 1enter if you will nearly had a clean block of a three and thats difficult to do that high release of Cory Washington We told a story about how hes the only player that hes ever coached The second player to get injured from the rim said he injured his elbow on the rim jumping so high his elbow his first player that he mentioned that got hurt is an NBA player named Justin Bane who happened to hit his head on the on the rim Oh my goodness I I think uh thats big time right there Hitting your elbow on the rim Cutting your elbow on the rim Thats ridiculous Cory Washington career 72 foul shooter This year he is nine of 10 He gets one more His third division one program Started at St Peters went to Witchah State after that Its two of three this time to elongate SMUs lead to nine Yeah just a guy whos done exactly what coach recruited him here to do coach wanted him to do all the little things defend rebound loves how he can score as well And he has been outstanding And speaking of Anderson was an outstanding triple Yeah Coach Miller said We havent seen it yet in games but in practice hes about a 50 threepoint shooter so well let the sevenfooter trigger the tray And he hits his first of the year Edwards on the pirouette does not fall The tip down to Lane Taylor wants to run Crossover by Jackson Feeds it back out Taylor looking to move the ball into the corner Finds Trainer Stuck a little bit but Taylor grabs it back Double teamed against the baseline Wraps it around Bounce out to the right wing to Trainer and he nails the three Great ball movement for the Racers to get a triple out of it Make it a threepoint game Well Taylor just continues to kind of coach compared him a little bit to Steve Nash He continues to probe and probe and pass and probe and its leading to kind of that one more pass that you saw there Good ball movement that time by Murray State to get the shot they wanted Racers were down by 10 Theyre within the bucket now but BJ Edwards makes it a fivepoint game Yeah BJ Edwards much more engaged than he was the last game One of those guys average right in double figures all time season last season getting the most steals in SMU mens basketball history Like you said wants to be that defensive player of the year showing some of his offensive game too Little late in the shot clock here Jackson leans in fouled headed to the hole and hell have a chance at the line They love to utilize whether its from deep or attacking the rim or shooting free throws like we see right now Jacksons proving he can light up the scoreboard from anywhere and he currently leads Murray State with 10 10 points at the moment Absolute instant offense Thanks so much Bri Well hes a guy from Texas so hes coming home So I would imagine he probably has some people in the building CE King graduate all state performer and started his career at the D2 level at Southern Nazarene Thats right baby Went to Utah State has bounced around but has definitely one of those guys whos always been about his buckets and he has found a great home and a great fit here as he leads this team in scoring in the game and on the season I mean he was the great American Conference Freshman of the Year man For the Crimson Storm as Goofy Biller fades fires and hits and becomes the first Mustang in double figures with 10 We talked about it some open with the keys to the game This game is definitely going to feature a lot of scoring Its who can string together the stops and make the other team have more difficulty on the offensive end Well be watching that see which team can start to have some defensive success Taylors a tough cover from outside on the rebound out of bounds Last touch by the blue jerseys of Murray State And I tell you one thing about Murray theyre not off on the size Theyre similar match size And this young man doesnt matter the the size and height on the roster He has big game and with a timely shot that was much needed for the Mustangs All right we got a little fun for you Weve got a review coming This is we are on the headset instead But I love that coach Miller wanted this early game Call is upheld The timeout is charged Murray State will have no remaining challenges for the ball game Thanks so much 30 seconds on the shot clock And there you see Coach Miller And again this is part of what makes coach Miller what he is and who he is Hes an elite recruiter Hes well proven Hes working for some of the best coaches in the country prior to getting here And hes not afraid to go for it Hes a bold guy Hes fearless and thats why he went for that challenge and gets his team knowing Hey coach we know you got our back and his players theyre playing like it And there will be bigger challenges this season I think as a coach youve got to figure out when should I challenge when should I not I mean its new to the game but something thats been around in the NBA and the WNBA for years But this is something you got to figure out as a coach Whats a good challenge Whats not So the timeout is lost No more challenges remaining for Murray State in this one but they do have Javon Jackson and he is plenty And I think part of the challenge is almost like getting a technical foul sometimes in a game right You just want your team to know hey Im fighting with you I see you Were going aggressive Were here to win Were not just here to play And Jackson just goes and responds with that bucket right there And I love how you said it gives the coaches a chance to influence the game because there are only so many things that you can do Yep talking to a coach on a game yesterday and something that he brought up is that he doesnt want to see the one in one or the half go away in mens college basketball because its a way you can influence the game because its a part of the game uh where you can come with some strategy uh when youre starting to get down between the sixth seventh eighth foul of the half Who do you foul Do you foul Yeah You take that away and you got one less thing that you can influence the game with if youre a good coach Well this is a great college basketball game just the second week of the season Both these teams 2 and 0 You can see why Similar styles proven players on the floor from all different levels coaches with great strategy And this is fun And we only we still got what a whole half left and four minutes Come on John Oh Im here Im here for the duration Dear Jr couldnt get it to go and King again there for the rebound Always seems to be in the right position Hard to get around that wide body all the way inside Couple opportunities Jackson was there So was Trainer Both of them go Arai And this ones going SMUs way off the foul on Murray State Javon Jackson Well Bree said it so well talking about the bench and the depth of Murray State Coach feels like he has 10 starters on this team Anybody on the floor at any given time can play as a starter And you can see theyre playing with so much energy because you know they have so many different guys playing and that energy starting to really pay off Theyre holding the SMU to one shot every possession Edwards the REVERSE PIVOT WASNT FULL BUT Washington always there So smart crashing the glass and right on time as its been one stop He said No Im getting an offensive rebound And then he gets the tip there This man is everywhere leading SMU transition Edwards out OF THE CORNER FOR THREE YOU SMU big time in the running gun Well Pierre will get the assist and Edwards will get the three but Washington is the catalyst that started all those plays with the offensive rebound and then the tip on the defensive rebound 14 of their 41 points coming in transition Does Murray State need to do a better job getting back defensively I mean theres no doubt about it Some of its from the turnovers but also they just know if they can stop turning the ball over and plays transition defense They feel confident to score with this SMU club And that young man right there from Houston Texas Jackson is letting his name be known Hope youre locked in Yeah Jacksons got 15 Edwards drops it home BJ Edwards did not used to look for a shot like that Yeah I love the fact that BJ Edwards responding to the last game Hes a big time player one of the top recruits in the country going to Tennessee out of high school Has found a home on the hill and he is playing some good basketball in this first half Much needed response from his last game Its his third year in an SMU uniform Leaves everybody arai Washington gets a wide open look out of the thing but leaves it a little bit short Yeah great extra pass too who could have shot that had a highlight play Crowd is going on He makes the unselfish play to Washington for the open look King countser inside Crater for two You talk about again offensive dissection The curl around the man with the ball Coach Miller in his bag a little bit in his offensive package I know that smelled from Maldahhide Somebodys doing some dissecting missing on the hook shot And again King there for a monstrous board has five And good defense by King too giving resistance to Yugato Couldnt just get exactly the position he wanted Makes that shot pretty regularly But good defense by King King inside loses it Yiku helped dislodge and Hoopy Miller so smart Lets King run right up his back music and hell be at the line for a one and one Thats him back to SMU was such a big thing for him to do for this program Finished fourth in the ACC last year 24 wins in season one under coach Infield And this young man is the engine that drives this bus The Pony Express some may call it And he is the playmaker and the closer for this program Averaged five and a half assists last year that was fifth fourth in the ACC Hes averaging five and a half again this year and added more strength in the offseason and better conditioning Playing with more physicality and music better balance this year It shows Yeah he talked about it just wanting to get in elite shape changing his body and really focusing on doing whatever it takes for his team to win Knows he can score but wants to be able to playmake and defend is the next level for him cuz he wants to get not only in the tournament but wants to make a run Yeah wants to be a twoway dude for sure All the way inside KJ Tenner able to drop one in A former Tennessee Mr Basketball in class 4A while at Cordova High School Timeout called by SMU A use it for loop But reasons that Murray State head coach Ryan Miller decided to take the job is the commitment to basketball to big time mens basketball that this uh program and everybody around it has They want to be good They know the resources its going to take Yeah Theres a big time history of coaches of success of NBA players like John Mor Cameron Payne Ye got to Yeilla dropping that one off Two back the other way for Dylan Anderson Well as much as the highlight on one end the defensive stop doesnt come on the other end And Murray State now shooting 53 in this game Edwards Bad Eagle Baker doesnt go but he gets it right back Leads all scores with 13 Yeah Which team is going to be able to string together more stops and sustain a run by keeping the other team from scoring instead of just trading baskets This feels like an NBA game Feels like wed be just fine with the 24second shot clock What do you think Yeah I dont even think anybody would have a shot clock violation if it was 24 Both these teams very good offenses that play with great pace great ball movement They do it a little bit differently Murray State built a lot more around the three where SMU is built more around getting to the paint and playing inside off of dribbling penetration and postups Both teams in the bonus Single bonus Threepointer doesnt go for Miller had a broken foot last year for Kraton It had a really off year but the year before that led to Big East in threepoint shooting Game clock to shot clock difference is minuscule About 1327 I think Yeah Miller is the son of Mike Miller the nephew of coach Ryan Miller This Miller not related Yeah not related at all but will hold for the final shot It shoots threes pretty well like the Miller family ONeal on the reverse pivot doesnt fall and that ends the half But yes some of you Mustangs able to elongate to a threepossession lead at the end of one half thanks to some excellent shooting The officials though say theyre going to want to look at something Theyre going to do so as we head to the half here in Dallas So the nine teams in college basketball this year on the division one level that dont have a single returner on the roster Meanwhile for SMU theyve got a half new roster three returning starters and trying to figure out exactly what theyve got this year Briana Sorenson and Brian Burton Im John Little Little post up for Ceette Yeu and the secondyear sophomore going to work down low Yeah that goes to that dominating the paint and dominating on the glass SMU plus six rebounds have done the job in the paint as well with 226 Meanwhile the threepoint shooting for Murray State just four of 13 and along with the bench scoring they have been plus 11 So keys to the game have definitely played a factor Miller Smecku you back with the follow jam And thats the pace of play SMU wants to play with the big man cleaning up the glass with two more second chance points Is in double figures again all three games so far this season the man from Turkey getting it done in doubles Low to the crowd Oh what a dribble by Jackson to split the screen The double team up top the hard hedge and he makes it right to the glass Yeah Jackson one of those guys He just makes it look easy He plays at a great pace He accelerates when its time to and he has really kept his team in this game Junior side steps it out to BJ Edwards off the mark Washington another offensive rebound And I think Cory Washingtons making a huge difference in this game with his eight and seven so far Yeah I just think he makes a difference in this team on this season Everyone wants to be able to score and do all the things that look pretty and go in the highlights That play wont go on the highlights but he is definitely putting his team in position to win every time with the way he plays and does the dirty work that goes unseleelebrated Hear that replay Were challenging you to put that play in the in the roll out All right Pierre Jr trying to get to the cup and fouled Now early in the possession JJ Trainer looked like he got popped in the face went right back out to Pierre Jr tried to guard him couldnt stay with him Yeah Pierres a really tough guy to keep in front Hes so physical so strong One thing about elite scorers is they have an ability to draw contact and get to the foul line Pierre making his second trip to the line and a guy who has all the physical tools Weve talked about it early but can stretch it from three can create off the bounce Hes distributed Hes made a couple plays Uh defensively is where theyre challenging him and the consistency But when this young man is locked in boy is he dangerous Hes earning the start after the beginning of the season 16 and a half points a game You know Chuck Harris pretty much came off the bench last year kind of as that sixth man that the scoring guard off the bench for Andy Enfield I thought thats how they were going to use Pierre or what they were tending to but he gets the start today and I wonder if its going to stick The one thing we havent talked about is maybe the most talented player on the roster Mr Tombs the freshman hasnt played yet this season He will start I would imagine every game most likely next to Yugu at the four So one of these guards will probably have to come off the bench but whatever the situation is theres enough talent to go around to make this team even more dangerous as tools get back in the lineup SMU has been fantastic in transition Miller was trying to get King to run up his back again EDWARDS NOBODY STOPS THE ball and he drops it over SMU is fired up making a stand early on in Dallas Well Miller kept it a transition play by keeping King behind him and made it an advantage break great shot fake by BJ Edwards to get the easy easy walkin layup you know and something small little like that for Boopy Miller probably not something he does as a freshman at Central Michigan or even two years ago at Wake Forest right music well I think thats just a part of his game that he really wants to get better at is that floor general IQ and being able to again make things easy for my teammates he doesnt necessarily care as much when you get to a point in your career where youve done enough statwise you dont care as much about the stats you want more winning You think about certain teams whether its uh the Celtics when they put all those guys together with Garnett Ray Allen Im dating myself a little bit but you get to the point where the individual accolades dont matter as much You just want to figure out how can I win and how can I do something that I havent done yet which he wants to play in the tournament and be dancing Yeah the talent is there not only for Bookie Miller but around him Its the intangibles that are going to decide whether or not this team wins in March and into April Oh what a fade away See theres the talent from Bookie Miller Nearly behind the glass when he let that one go Well and when you tasted it they were right on the the knocking on the door They were the number one seed in the NIT They didnt want to go to the NIT but injuries late made it where they didnt have much of a choice And now they want to give the committee no choice by the play One of them to Miller and dancing to the glass Geron Pierre Jr makes it go Ryan Miller needs a timeout Well maybe now theyre going to keep playing down the baseline Floating shot by Tener Comes up way short and SMU smells blood in the water Up by 15 Theyve been able to elongate this lead since the break Poopy Miller stops Pops the dirt ITS GOOD SMU BY 17 Talk about cooking points and five assists for Poopy Miller Plus the three rebounds as well Big part of the reason SMU is up big 162 in fast break points and shooting 49 as a team with Brian Burton and Briana Sorenson Im John Little Now what can Murray State do to recollect themselves Maybe a threepoint bucket No its over the top by Lane Taylor Well it starts with getting stops SMU is six of eight for 75 in the second half Theyre doing it in transition and doing it so easily As you see you got to give more resistance to this team and then yes you can get the scoring going yourself Jackson to King King getting down and running in transition For a big dude he can really run that run that rim Yeah youre at the point of the game if youre Murray State say you cant just trade baskets We know you can score Youve proven that Can you slow down SMU team No you cannot Doesnt look like it as Pierre dots and eyeball at the top of the key for three Pierre with 13 points Four of the five starters in double figures and the other one has 88 eight rebounds for SMU Dean Dolman on the fadeaway gets bumped and fouled music music music SMU on a big run to start the second half throwing their lead by 11 uh to 18 out of the timeout A couple free throws on the way for Roman Domen Over the first two games against Omaha Mississippi Valley State Murray State had almost 30 free throw attempts per game This is only going to be free throws number 10 and 11 of the night Yeah this young man has an extremely bright future His size for his position his skill level his feel for the game And again you can think you can see why coach refers to this team having so many different guys that can start and feel so confident about his bench When you have a young man like this coming off the bench wearing 77 you got to have some swagger to wear 77 as it is But this young man has made some impressive plays Absolutely And we do it in Dallas Out of the timeout Washington trying to get to the hole Block going up Jackson on the run outs for three Rims it out Long rebound Crashing to the ground Still alive Getting down for it Germaine ONeal Jr And SMU has been great in transition all night This time the Racers are back music Somebodys got to step up for Murray State other than Javon Jackson Hes got 17 Nobody else has more than seven Well SMUs done the job defending the threepoint line Murray State Racers is shooting four of 16 at 25 from long range Team that was averaging 12 threes a game coming in had 15 that they splashed last time out against the Delta Devils Rocking the baby There goes Giron Pierre Jr Hell go to the hole to shoot two And Briana Sorenson has more on number five in white Yeah Coach Enfield told me that Geron Pierre Jr gives this SMU team an experienced scorer and playmaker with next level potential Pierre comes from Jacksonville State where he was the Conference USA player of the year averaging almost 22 points per game fourth in the entire NCAA in scoring And coach Enfield said they recruited him because hes a music proven scorer who can really create for others Hes lightning fast in transition and hes been sharpening his defense over the summer all part of his goal to reach the NBA a dream hes been chasing since his 400 am shooting sessions back in high school You heard that right He used to wake up at 400 am every morning to put up shots And you know from those last few shots his hard work has paid off Brian yeah St St Augustine caught up in New Orleans Louisiana Hes that toughness in that dog And here you see Murray State Miller in the corner says were not going home yet A lot of time left on the clock when they can score like Murray State can Absolutely Remember how good they are from three Miller knocked it into the back court Racing after it on the ground for it What do they got Its out of bounds Last touch by Miller Just could not collect it Frustrating moment And those are the kind of plays that are winning plays that they want to see more of from Pierre He didnt try to reach for it He dove on the floor and competed on the ground As you can see great job in the passing lane by Miller Just loses the handle a little bit but a big play to get on the floor for the ball Wasnt too cool wasnt too casual He said I have a sense of urgency And those are the type of plays that the next level wants to see from him Murray State trying to get in the passing lanes Open three in and out for Germaine ONeal Jr Rebound trapped down by Lane Taylor The Razers look for a spark to get back in it Its only a sevenpoint game at halftime but that is a moving screen and a big one at that by King Jermaine Jr just has this presence of music a older player He plays with very little like rattled emotion That three wanted to go down almost had a shot before the half elite defender NBA level athlete in the 1 as similar to what coach Ryan Miller talked about with his young man as well And Junior lots of promise in this top recruiting class in the history of the school He is definitely one who has a tremendously bright future here on the hill Yeah just a steady confidence Nothing is too big for him That would have been a tough finish by Pierre Miller comes out with it A five on four up the floor Taylor sinks into the defense kicks it out Threepointer by Dolman Rattles out but SMU getting after the defensive glass in this one Only of four offensive rebounds all game for Murray State Theres one for SMU No good BY HOLMES BUT ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SAM WALTERS who puts it in Yeah the 5050 plays Two freshman and Holmes and ONeal on the glass and the upper classman Walter says Ill clean this up fellas Yeah theyre plus nine on the offensive glass in this one Well theyve done the things in the toughness categories that really has been a difference in the game Obviously the transition stands out but music the way theyve dominated the glass the way theyve dominated the paint theyve made it known hey youre coming into our house youre going to have to take this from us music Were not giving it to you Its led to an SMU lead of 17 over Murray State And theyre just getting more opportunities in this game than Murray State is Shots than the other teams Yeah the raw numbers There you go 40 attempts by Murray State 59 for SMU Wow And not only that plus 11 on the glass turning them over again Thats just big brother basketball when youre playing against your younger brother Yeah you can score younger brother but youre not beating me unless you do these toughness things Murray State still fighting but they have to find a way to get stops and make more toughness plays in this game if youre going to beat this SU team Its the fifth offensive board as Miller gets fouled coming across midcourt cuz its not as though the Razers dont have adequate size for this matchup They match up pretty well physically against SMU for the most part Theyre just getting beat on the glass Yeah And they have talent Again Coach Miller is doing a great job Hes building this Murray State program back to what it wants to be One of the best mid major programs in the country Theyre theyre they have the the roster compilation and the style of play and the makeup all the things you check And they played well in the first half but the second half SMU has done the the things that you have to do to win a game like this And they continue to And it starts with defense Murray State has to be able to slow down this SMU team They are now shooting over 50 in the second half and you cannot win letting a home team do that on the road That is just elite body control for Goofy Miller Hes up to 18 again Taylor never stops the dribble Great take there by Carbone and scooping to the rack Hes fouled Threes and free throws That may be the way back into this thing for Murray State Its going to be an uphill grind but they got to get on that track right now Matias Corbone out of Leon France heading to the line Part of the France under 18 and under 21 program was Murray States cheering first French snee In the second was his teammate Dolman Corbone had a careerhigh cheering 12 last time out against Mississippi Valley King coming back in for Murray State replacing the sevenfooter Anderson And this Murray State team again this kind of talent night in night out the way they can shoot the ball theyre only going to keep getting better Again this game is far from over with their offensive firepower Here you see them looking to press after the free throw You the outlet off the middle There are three players for Murray State with three fouls a piece Mason Miller JJ Trainer and Fred King all have three So watch that Edwards retreating dribble against a bigger player Carbone still takes it toward the glass Little push off Gets away with it Offensive rebound and a good job to throw it off the defender Carbone by Booby Miller Kind of goes back to it though Those kind of plays Murray State the second 10 minutes They were really competing getting these plays These 5050 plays that rebound could go to anybody Goofy finds a way to come up with it and earn his team another possession Murray State had to limit SMU to just one shot Stop allowing them to get offensive rebounds and second chances Oh rebound number 16 in this one Edwards loses it to the corner Taylor comes out with it Murray State trying to make their way back in with 12 minutes left in regulation King hands off back to Jackson Jackson been one of the most impressive players cheering in THIS GAME SLAMS HIS WAY PAST MILLER WHO PACKS the shot cleanly from behind And there you see the offseason work and the commit adding almost 10 lbs of muscle and focusing on durability Coach Enfield called him an amazing leader whos improved as much as any player theyve seen Thank you so much Bri And as good as a season of a season as he had last year you know really SMUs season kind of crumbled when he went down with injury That really stunted it They were still a good team but that upside wasnt there anymore Absolutely Youre losing a guy 13 points a game top four in ACC in assists a guy who again makes plays for his team has several game winners in his career including last year So yeah you need that Thats exactly what Murray State needs to get a little run of their own going Just down 12 Chopping away Leads not safe It was once 18 Its down to 12 Miller gets doubled in the back court Cant skip past the sideline He steps out and the official Isaac Barnett was right on it Well these are those little things those little possessions that you just steal back We talked about how many more shots music SMU has gotten the turnovers for Murray State That was only the sixth turnover music in the game for SMU while Murray State has 11 So stealing those little possessions back and with the threepoint line and the threepoint shooting of this Murray State team no lead is safe Been a high scoring affair already especially in the first half Taylor guy with more than 3000 points of his high school career Finding Jackson in the paint Tough shot Eigatu cant believe he got called for that touch foul but thats the respect Javon Jackson naturalb born score is going to get Were a little bit away from the bonus but were one foul away from being automatically in the bonus And that will also become a big factor And its a good call Lucu has to get his hands up earlier You cant make that contact while the ball handler has the ball Jacksons will again coming back home to Texas started his career freshman of the year division 2 not too far up the road in Oklahoma and Southern Nazarene has been all over college basketball but has found a great home to end this success story and he has got his team down 11 47th career double senior game IS GOOD AND ONE FOR ROMAN DOLMAN starting to make Big impact here in the States The Frenchman A defensive play to make it a 10point game Tell you what backto back plays off of the press And Taylor getting his hands in there doing all those little things Maybe the smallest guy on the floor today but playing with big heart big passion and big energy And the lead is now cut Lets go to Brie State has a pretty simple motto this season and thats the scores always reach 0 0 So coach Miller told me that no matter the situation up 10 down 10 They want to play with the same energy the same urgency and the same unselfishness every single possession He said if they believe the scoreboard always says 000 then theyre going to play hard play together and play their way because the winning and losing will take care of itself So dont expect the racers to take their foot off the gas We can see them applying pressure Brian Yeah pressure bust pipes but both teams playing some great basketball in this game 90 run and SMU has not scored And now the bonus comes into play John we are 1026 in the rest of this game and Murray State is shooting the rest of the way as is SMU But a big thing for Murray State because points were getting hard to come by in the half court as a great shooting team This run can continue with Jackson at the line Absolutely love the way Murray States bowing their music necks and it did start on the defensive end really creating a couple turnovers in the back court Well you can just tell theres a lot of belief in what Coach Miller has already instilled in this program Theres a togetherness by playing so many guys Theres a style of play thats really fun Uhoh we got a technical on Junior cheering To review we have a double technical foul on five white 22 blue We will shoot one shot Line up and shoot one shot No free throw So basically offsetting technicals and Jackson will complete his time at the line Meanwhile for Pierre Jr that was his third foul and coach Enfield gets him out of there Germaine ONeal Jr is on for him The free throw makes it a twopossession game Remember SMU led by as many as 18 just a few minutes ago Five minutes ago you got a kick ball in the back court but Murray State not known for their defense starting to force the issue against SMU Well again goes back to that style of play Youre pressing youre picking up full court its a fun style of play to be able to rally behind And with two point guards in the game you would think SMU would have no trouble but see what they can do here They got a fouron two high off the glass Cory Washington becomes the latest Mustang in double figures Tell you what every time a big play is needed whether its on defense on the glass or scoring it seems like Washington is always on time Yeah Washington just a rebound shy of a double double King against Yikatu They both got three fouls Quick reel move by King I didnt see that coming He had a grin about that one Hes like Yeah Ive been working on this one in the driveway And he brought it to the court Big time play You he wants it in the post Oh this is getting fun now BLOCKED FROM BEHIND CLEAN BY CRATER Yugatos best when he gets deeper position Got pushed off the block The answer three Edwards have fallen down Trainer cant hit the three And Hoopy Miller crashes down for his fifth rebound Tell you what this is a fun basketball game Lots of hooping going on both ways Miller baseline fade away Its good for Boofy Miller Hes up to 20 points for the 22nd time in his career I think hes got cheering and applause a cramp He said too but he looks like Chris Paul the way hes sneaking through those screens creating that space for his midrange falling away for Cash Hes creating a brain cramp for Murray State Taylor way off the mark Hes got that range but maybe an illadvised shot Edwards up high Germaine ONeal Jr couldnt gather it Edwards does Its out last touch Well well see You need to know what the call is first and then see if there wants to be a challenge Its going to be SMU ball So you dont want a challenge The SMU players are already saying challenge Yeah And it feels like if that pass is a little bit higher that could have been a big time highlight music as as you see it here Yeah Taylor doesnt have the same bounce that Germaine ONeal has No disrespect to Taylor Just a little bit low of a pass And I agree that shot Taylor shot although hes a very very high level threepoint shooter probably not the one they wanted in that moment in time You got a team on the ropes You want to make the smart plays You want to make the plays to continue to come back You dont need them And youre in the bonus And youre in the bonus You want to put the pressure on them because youve done such a good job having them on their heels Now if its wide open his toes are on the line Hes got to knock that down every time But that was a little bit deep and early in the possession Taylor a high school coachs son He comes out Tener is on Play a guard spot Edwards stopping starting delay dribble Hes in trouble Absolute jail but finds Pierre Jr Eight to shoot And he stepped out Turnover on SMU A team that only had three turnovers in the first half Starting to give it away now And Andy Enfield says You got to be kidding me You didnt see the bump there Yeah I love the intensity of this game both ways Anytime the ref the coaches start getting involved to the referees looking for certain calls Not saying coach is wrong on that at all but that just means the intensity is picking up Crater against the smaller freshman outside Open three Around and off for Dolman THE OFFENSIVE REBOUND KING STICKS IT BACK IN King playing like a grown man inside like a man who has played in the Big East in some big battles He is showing up really big for his team 10 and seven for Fred King Ball on the floor Edwards gets it back from Yikatu SLIPS DOWN THE JAM FOR THE FRESHMAN ONEAL Thats the one theyve been waiting for here on the hill to see Germaine ONeal Jr get one of those type of plays Cant celebrate it too much Not as big as his papa but certainly has the physical ability Edwards one of the best defensive players in the ACC TAKES IT AWAY FINDS HIS MAN UP FOR WASHINGTON IN TRANSITION PLUS THE FOUL Has a 611 wingspan can really defend can really rebound and just hes a quiet killer as far as how he able is able to execute on the floor And with this run BJ Edwards has been outstanding Just got the steal to lead to that possession Got the assist to Germaine ONeal Junior Five assists on the evening BJ Edwards has responded with a 14 excuse me 15 and 54 But its down to six Its an 11point game now Racers arent done though King with 10 to shoot handing off out deep Tener was being denied by Miller Slithers through the defense Quick riser over to Yigolu KJ Tener Man a flash of a start there Yeah second time hes made that floater deep in the lane Highly skilled guard Another one of those guys who can really make plays in attacking paint Miller Eigatu Power dribble over King And King hates the call cement Yukatollu will tell the line Thats number four on King Yeah Yugu just such a tough guy to play against because hes tall hes got long arms and hes physical Coach Miller wants a little bit of the offensive push off with the off arm But music when you play against a guy like Yuku and play against him in the paint youre going to go home and probably want an ice bath or two Such a physical guy And good job using his fakes and his patience And this is an area of his game he proved it last game how much his off season has been predicated around improving at the free throw line cheering Didnt get the result on that one Big dude 7 foot2 270 lbs coming off that 12 and 10 game plus two blocks in 32 minutes against Corpus Christie and he is in great shape averaging 33 minutes a game early this season and really having no trouble handling that kind of workload Yeah a lot of minutes and again double double guy does such a good job changing shots on the defensive side of the ball too Doesnt always get the block but hes a shot changer in the paint as well Mitchell Holmes comes on to give Yugatu a little bit of a rest Anderson with the high screen Tener and the pick and pop Anderson couldnt pull the trigger cheering Tener back through the lane loses his footing going down and unless theres a foul this is a travel So the officials are going to come together and call it a block on KJ Tener That means free throws the other way for SMU So yeah and Washington comes away with his double double 15th career double double Young man who started his career on the East Coast St Peters Again just a consmate winner does all those little things that you need Talking to him before the game he said he just loves this team and how everyone fits together so well Really excited about the season but he chose SMU When he came here it felt like home The way the coaches treated him the way they saw value in who he is and that value is definitely paying off so far as he has been a warrior for the Mustangs I love how consistent hes been over the course of his career Hes the guy on this team who has more double figure games than any other player Even more than Bofy Miller Hard to believe I know But Washington music the new team in this one His 34th career 15point game And as you mentioned his 14th double double as well The guy from Little Rock having a big game Well if youre going to win you need players on your team like that who dont mind doing the things that may not show up And eventually they show up big just like that blocked shot Its the man thats on a mission to be defensive player of the year in the ACC saying I dont just get steals I block shots too I hate rejection Oh I cant look BJ Edwards showing off the bunnies man Deceptively explosive Number zero 6 minutes left Meat is back to a dozen for SMU Edwards running the point now too Two death move Little underhand scoop from the left side They call that a filt in the streets The inside hand scoop finish Edwards career high is 20 Hes at 17 Miller cranks it for three Washington cant grab the rebound Tener is in the land of the trees pitches back to Miller in the opposite corner This time he rips the cords Always in it when you can shoot the ball at that at this clip cheering Pierre wants an early shot Anderson pulls it down SMU a high pace team So the racer in his bag He is a threepoint sniper I want more playing time I dont want to come off the bench I dont want to not maybe play as much or play starters type of minutes Whether he comes off the bench here or not he knows hes going to get an opportunity and he is doing big things with that opportunity so far and they are ecstatic to have him at Murray State Man what a great test for both these teams early in the season to try to prove their medal late in a game Five minutes left Eightpoint game Lets settle in ONeal Jr has the threeon two Lobs it up Heat Cant slam it home And a chance the other way for the Razers Jackson had a big game with more than 20 Turns inside past Yatu Slips to THE CUP FOR TWO JACKSON MAKES IT A sixpoint game Your mama That goes that man That is a bad boy with a almost impossible finish SMU safely into the front court The Razers fans who have made the trip are in full throat And they travel well This is a basketball program with big history big fan base Boopy wants to take the big shot Instead hell give it up to his buddy And Edwards cant hit And looks like Washington say Look who it is Right on time Gets fouled to the floor getting displaced underneath Mr Right on time might be the new nickname for Cory Washington because that is exactly what he does when his team needs it the most This time again away from the ball Hes getting boxed out but hes so relentless Coach Enfield actually talked about this at shootound Hes so good at finding a way to pursue the rebound swim moves spinoffs just going for the ball His pursuit of the basketball is what led music to him getting fouled here because he was going for it and they had to hold him back So again one of those things that doesnt show up in the stat sheet the points will but how he got there will not Hes so tough and physical without being dirty at all Does that make sense I mean hes not throwing his body around it there but but you feel it He just gets music there Yeah absolutely Hes just one of those guys Hes got a strong will for those things and hes played with very good basketball players his whole life and hasnt had to be the star in the limelight but he finds a way to start in his role Good hard screen Taylor tangled up underneath though Back to Jackson on the pitch back with eight eight points on the deficit EDWARDS STRIPS IT AWAY CLEANLY ONEONONE AGAINST MILLER EURO DROPS IT IN JUST a little bit short but earns the foul shots flashing it in front of the paint My education in life half of it comes from Brian Burton So Cory Washington big ball game tonight and SMU trying to close things down Theyre in the double bonus the rest of the way BJ Edwards for his career 72 at the foul line but fires that one long Yeah and BJ Edwards what a big jump he made last season averaging right at 10 points a game And coach Infield said hes going to be on the floor for us a lot So we want him to be able to score more Again talking to the staff cheering they just feel like with the more offensive weapons that are on the floor you can kind of easily forget about BJ So they want him to be aggressive and attack and make plays And he has done an outstanding job on both sides playing one of his best games in the Mustang uniform No I see what youre saying I mean hes not really the guy that you game plan for on that end of the floor is he But he can still hurt you when he takes what youre giving him Well when you think about how they started this game today with Pierre in the starting lineup another guy youre going to get the second or first defender on him and Luffy So now you got another defender that may be third or fourth guarding against Edwards And Edwards again they come away with another stop But he set the tone defensively a lot in this game making blocks steals and hes really attacked so well on the offensive side in the paint too Its closing time for SMU Up by nine Igatou sets that screen for Edwards Edwards off the glass Doesnt fall Loose ball and King comes out with it Murray State needing points in a hurry Sandler hasnt shot it extremely well Trying to draw the foul Repenetrates on Edwards Kicks it out Catches two Three money for Javon Jackson Timeout Murray State making it a sixpoint too Trying to get back music to those type of days And Jackson has 26 points in 23 minutes That is efficient Thats a fire starter offensively Miller cant believe hes called for the foul there That is going to be it If they didnt fight when they played oneonone growing up if they didnt fight they get slurpies Yes I love that I mean what else are you going to do in small town South Dakota right And Bri asked Whats your favorite colors flavor slurpee Coach said I dont remember That was a long time ago I think strawberry But all I know is my dad had to literally bribe us and it was still hard because the slurpies werent quite good enough as the competitive fighting will to beat my brother And you can see that same competitiveness in Miller as he fouled out And Edwards a little different how he shows his competitiveness one of those guys thats just very poised very cool calm and collected And he is approaching his career high as this is one of his best games in an SMU uniform And hes been awesome in this one Yeah Matching his career high with 20 He had 20 against Charleton State opening night eight days ago Theyve needed all 20 of it Kenner running the offense getting it back from King Jackson playing off the ball at the right wing trying to deny him the basketball is Edwards No shot Fouls on the floor Its going to be a one and one on the way for Raman Dolman as Cory Washingtons whistle for him Yeah Dolman just six points in the game but he hes got a lot of versatility Hes a big ball handler as a four A great feel for the game and again has played high level basketball and great size for his position Very heavy play to draw the foul there and just get easy points You want to score when the clock is not going so that you can cheering chip into this lead and if you make both free throws you have a chance to set up your press that has been so successful here in the second half They get Jackson and King out Theyre both settled for four fouls Right into the one and one Domen makes it count Yeah theyll probably do a little bit of offense and defensive subs because of that foul trouble Again he cheering makes this free throw They have a chance to set up the press SMU has a few struggles in this half And Murray cheering States made four of their last five field goals Getting hot at just the right time in this game Yeah only three turnovers in the first half for SMU but six in the second half Edwards only 5 seconds to bring it across Washington secures it up high Gets it across the timeline Miller pulls it back but double teamed again Now Washington has a twoon one if he wants it but pulls it back once more Miller fouled out front So smart I mean just so smart Hey were going to take our time use as much clock and then were going to get to the line and not take a tough shot Im going to initiate this contact and put the referee in a position where they either call a foul and if they dont Im wide open to go attack How about Millers efficiency in this one 20 points hes only taken 12 field goal attempts to get there Well completely opposite You can tell again the staff from SMU and their message about how they had to respond to Corpus Corpus took the fight to this team and it wasnt a great offensive night and they got it done on the defensive side of the ball and gritted out that win But coach Infield said it there shouldnt be a night where Poopy is that inefficient from the floor If youre not scoring dont take 14 shots but if you are scoring keep it going And both him and Edwards have really responded very well in controlling the pace of this game and creating and making plays Very rare miss at the line for Miller who was 23 of his first 24 this season at the free throw line before that miss but he hits the second 21 tonight makes it a sevenpoint game SMUs led by as many as 18 tonight Miller trying to get after it defensively Taylor loses it to the ground I think Taylors going to be called for the foul here for things cool Thats what they would say To review the foul has been upgraded to a flagrant foul cheering at one Player at one and so went for the grab on the leg Shot in the ball and and the referees lets give a shout out to them the the execution and taking their time on the reviews Theres less of them now but you have to give them credit for how theyve done a good job of taking the time to music go review things and getting it right So were inside of two minutes now Coaches can challenge out of bounds plays and theyre the only ones that can challenge out of bounds plays No challenges left for Murray State There is one left for Andy Enfield Big plays too right I mean like big music big play as you have that momentum to unfortunately you fall and and youre turn it over You dont want to give away the easy bucket but that grab does result in a play that you just dont want this time of the game And obviously music two shots in the ball for SFU puts them up by nine And they can get another bucket here May make the lead rather insurmountable with his mount much music time is left here Again King saddled with four fouls So hes sitting down So is Javon Jackson for the Racers And I thought Taylors played so instrumental for his team as an emotional leader His stats dont show it He had does have those five assists And oh that is nearly a big turnover there Meanwhile there is no way to challenge this for Murray State but JJ Tenner says its not off me Well the thing Murray State fans at home and coach Miller should look at it It probably was off of him as he dove on the floor But the thing you have to be excited about is again how much this team is playing all the way through Dallas a little breather here Certainly not over with the way Murray State can shoot the basketball and their fullcourt defense in the second half has caused problems at times for SMU getting the ball off the floor SMU hasnt scored a field goal in the last four minutes Now they have been going to the line a ton and theyre 15 of 19 in the second half alone at the line Thats the beauty of the bonus You dont have to score field goals in that case Murray States not giving them a lot of chances to score field goals with the way that they are fouling I didnt get that email by the way But you know I will forward it to you Its all right Is it Yeah Is Brian spelled with a Q still Spelled with a W baby cuz we win it Come on I missed that So Pier Jr who was a star early on in this one had seven points in about the first five minutes of this matchup will help salt it away at the line Hes 80 in his career at the line Guy that spent two years at Southern Miss two at Witchah State one at Jacksonville State now wrapping up the career here at SMU Hes up to 17 points Somewhere out there Herman Hudson is calculating the last time SMU had four players with 17 or more Offensive foul on Trainer Yeah here you see kind of a push off Thats Washington in there again A little plays man Missed it right on time General Washington Well the first loss of the year after review offensive foul So just a common foul nothing more I did get the review right earlier where it was 5050 and you said it was one way another way but just No you didnt I didnt get the email but I did get that right 100 No absolutely Maybe the first two or three I got right Matter of fact but yeah its just the extension Yeah And a good good acting job by General Washington He never lies though cannot tell a lie Boopy Miller nearly got it to go Hell have a chance at the line Miller in this high scoring affair has been a big part of it with 13 of his 23 in the second half And you see SMU been up in the gym just working on their fitness and their fitness music at the free throw line looking really good this season Well we said this was going to be a trackme type of game and here we are approaching 100 points Almost 200 points scored in this game Just uh two highowered offenses SMU has been able to get more stops as theyve still shot 12 more shots than Murray State in this game Tener blocking foul Washington doesnt agree Had to be either out of bounds or blocking foul And they go with the foul on Washington Couple free throws coming up for KJ Tenner Weve seen this a couple times where it feels like Murray States out of the game and all of a sudden they hit a free throw or two they get a steal they make a three So SMU absolutely knows this game is not over until that final buzzer goes off Tenner has a big big role on this team as a lead guard just a sophomore but played 13 minutes a game on a bubble team last year at West Virginia Quality player out of Memphis goes one of two here SMU knows theyve got to be solid with the basketball Theyve got a threeon one Pierre Jr with a nose for the goal On the cusp of 100 for SNU for the first time this season Carbone Back to Tener with a buck eight Threepointer from out front Trainer drops it in Miller was trying to get a timeout Did not get that reward he wanted State still playing not intentionally fouling here Down by 11 And Millie was calling for a clear out Illadvised pass Dolman got in there Dolman skipping to the hoop Late foul call Maybe a goalend too Well see Coach music Infield did not like that pass by Miller as he asked for the clear out and then went across court You want to keep that make them foul you at least hit it to the middle But the cross pull forward is one booby wishes he had back No go 10 music Dilman will just go to the line for two Little mistakes that could matter in even tighter games for sure Coach Miller might have wish he still had that challenge that he used early in the game Maybe a little aggressively We liked it over here because it sent a message to his team But if he had that challenge you could challenge that goalend there because it probably was a goalend which gives you two points and puts you in a little closer position with just 38 seconds to go I think he would have used the challenge though with the buck 51 to play down here on the baseline that out of bounds play Its kind of like its kind of like you said though the more you get used to being able to use the challenges cheering Thats an offensive foul up here I dont think the doors quite cracked yet but Murray States knocking on it Theyre trying to use the the secret knock on the door to get in Youre running out of time but youre fighting again to get those possessions back Play all the way through the buzzer But the point on the challenges is that later in the game against you want to have those challenges so when you are in these close ball games and something can go either way you get to reward your team And remember if you win the challenge then you get another one later on Thats five fouls on Pierre So he fouls out in his first start and the freshman comes in the game as his substitute Still 19 Man dont Hes got a nose for the goal I I like his game Hes got a little bit of everything to it The threepoint got the driving Like a box of chocolates You never know what youre going to get as far as Gum said 28 seconds left Eightpoint game SMU trying to salt it away No foul just trying to get the steal in full court Nice job to break it by SMU Now Murray State is going to back off Looking over at the sideline Ryan Miller calls off the dogs Shot clock is off and the SMU Mustangs are going to take it home MILLER LOST IT OH HE WANTED A 100 and he gets it cheering 102 to 91 First time that the Mustangs earned in triple digits this season No love lost between the Racers and the Mustangs tonight It was a shootout and a fun one at Moody Deu
