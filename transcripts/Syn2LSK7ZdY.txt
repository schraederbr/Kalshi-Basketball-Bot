and Baba Miller for Florida State doing the honors at the midcourt strike Underway here in Tallahassee Florida State controls the opening tip Itll be Jaylen Warley the starting point guard bringing it up into the half court set for Leonard Hamilton and the Nles Theyll swing it to the corner and now reverse it back to Music Applause Watkins with the skip pass Back to the point guard Worley Worley in the paint Puts up the floater Gets his own miss back and kicks it up top to Watkins Logo three Green at the buzzer Wow Its going to go down I believe is a shot clock violation Florida State thinks they beat the buzzer And I believe were going to have a quick monitor check to see whether or not that shot is good Like they almost thought it might have been a shot clock reset at first Obviously not the case And then Green from the logo able to slash it But well go do a quick review right away I was going to say welcome to Tallahassee everybody One shot one review Here we go And right away though I mean a a good opening possession it felt from Florida State Everyone was getting a touch here Pass it around Not the best look you want to see at the end of it from Jaylen Worley But well see what the official review is going to come up with Darren Green got that off the time As the officials continue to look at the monitor this is a game that was scheduled initially to start at 400 pm But with the Seinals taking on Georgia in the Orange Bowl both the Bisons and the Seinals agreed to move tip up to noon And the call on the floor will stand Its going to be a shot clock violation against Florida State Well take another look Yeah balls just on the fingertips of Green as he releases Good call by the referees on staff Quickly off the inbounds Will Peru lays it in in transition This is a Lipkcom starting five You see it on your screen but more notable whos not in that lineup without Darren Boyd and also without Jacob Aknakovic who has been one of the leading scorers for some time in the A Sun Yeah Nakavid was a allconerence player a season ago Oh there he is right there And on the other side Darren Boyd I mean hes been phenomenal early on in this season 17 points per game A limitless score can score on all levels Well Florida States first three of the game was wiped off the board due to a shot clock violation They come right back down into the half court set and Jir Watkins does the honors and the Nullles lead by one I mean you talk about guys that have been coming up big How about that transfer from Florida State and Leonard Hamilton Jamir Watkins has been incredible in this early season Speaking of transfers theres Owen McCormack a transfer from Presbyterian on the turnaround to put Lipkcom back out in front Another guy that could be key for Lipkcom today A pick and pop big man down low Can shoot the three ball well Hes going to stretch out those Florida State bigs and hopefully open things in the lane for those driving guards Everybody for Lipkcom is plenty capable of shooting the basketball including their bigs Meanwhile for Florida State off the dribble penetration from Jaylen Warley He kicks it to the corner for Baba Millan Applause Music Yeah Jamir Watkins has been great this season early on Little bit of a hesitation Doesnt think Shoots it up Jamir great three 35 for him Second on the team in points Hes been What an addition for Leonard Hamiltons crew Foul on the floor called against AJ McGinness the junior out of Huntsville Alabama So Florida State gets a fresh 20 from the wing Bubba Miller penetrates into the paint Lost the handle Got it back in the corner Heres Deontay Green working on McCormack and earn a trip to the free throw line Deontay Green a guy that is Coach Hamilton will come right out and say it Hes playing out of position Florida State has dealt with a whole host of injury issues for the better part of the last two seasons that has continued this year with injuries to Cameron Fletcher Hes likely out for the year And Cam Corin who coach Hamilton told me earlier today a game time decision We might see him we might not But Deontay Green has had to fill some holes even in positions that are not necessarily the most natural for him Yeah I mean you love Deontay Greens story too Coming last season theyre expecting him to red shirt and then he ended up coming back early healing up Theres Cam Cor Not sure if well see him today but Greens been good He got play earlier than he expected in his career and and hes going to be an important factor in this game tonight Florida State is dominant down low with the height that they have compared to this Lipkcom team Theyre going to have to penetrate down low and use that height to their advantage Momentary delay here in Tallahassee It looks like AJ McInn has had to uh apply some solution to Im guessing a contact He had the uh the eyropper out and now theyre going to sub him off the floor and bring in Cody Head Come on Here we go Here we go Deontay Green missed the first of his free throws Hell split the pair Made his last six In fact was perfect from the free throw line in the nulls win over Winthro Its one thing though Sean to watch for Florida State today as foul jerkens at the logo But free throw shooting only 67 for the season for Florida State You want to see that number get up a little bit especially as you get into close games come conference play and as we get later into the season free throws are going to win games Music John Green split his pair of free throws Thats good enough to tie it early on here Four apiece on the back cut action Theres Jaylen Warley getting in those passing lanes for Florida State Nice kick to the wing Watkins plenty of time Sets the feet Lets it fly Its strong and batted around Warley How about that effort on the offensive glass There it is Right away you see the length just to the advantage And again Derek Green hustling but thats where Florida State can take advantage down low on the glass Get some second chance points Decided size advantage Florida State here over Lipkcom today Its something that the Bisons head coach Lenny Auff told us early and often was going to be a concern for them and he said Were just going to have to battle our hearts out on the glass against these nullles here this afternoon Puit off the hesitation now kicks it back out to the logo in the corner High screen action here for the Bison from the elbow who learn a trip to the free throw line Thats Puit Good job from Puit to draw the foul but on the other side good job from Jaylen Worley just to intercept as Florida State does so well get down low get the steal and then on the offensive glass be able to finish Music Will Puit comes into this game a 75 foul shooter and makes the first Music Lenny Auff describing Will Puit the junior from Mount Julia Tennessee as the blue guy of this team He said hes been a winner since he was in high school He continues to be a winner He doesnt think hes had a single bad practice over his fouryear career Yeah Pru a great leader for this squad A 63 guard leads this team in rebounding as well Swiss Army knife as he said he really does it all Phenomenal up top Knows this system better than anyone Zone defense here by Lipston Florida State gets into the middle of that zone Some interior passing and Puit comes away with a steal Music I see Jaylen Kenny just take that up strong right there into the wing McInness short on the three ball attempt Florida State clears the board and comes out with Ba Miller into the corner Darren Green Jr Quick trigger Darren doesnt need much space for him to let it fly One of the best threepoint shooters in the country Florida State coming off of a defensive oriented game against Winthre right before the holiday break Scored 67 in that sixpoint win 30 of those points though came from the free throw line Already nine quick points a couple of threes for the NLES here early on as that foul against number 15 Dylan Falner sends us to our first media break The homestanding seminals lead it 96 through the first four minutes at the tuck Music Losing the fear of looking foolish comes with age Losing

sometimes but were going to figure it out together Music With eBay authenticity guarantee its checked by experts Every stitch Music back here in Tallahass with Florida State leading by three courtesy of Darren Green Jr made a three from the logo to get this game started but it was called a shot clock violation He said No problem Im just going to casually make another one in the first 5 minutes And this is what hes done over his career Hes the seventh in D1 amongst active players in terms of threepoint field goals made Hes averaging at about 40 Yeah thats the second time in his career hes been at that number What an exceptional number to be at 40 as a threepoint shooter And and and I said it before one of the best in the country is Darren Green Hes off to a good start early this season Almost two threes in every single game hes played this year This is as quick of a trigger as it comes from behind the ark Hes been particularly hot of late Now Florida State again as I was mentioning right before that break as thatll be an over and back violation against the Nullles nothing particularly offensively hot against Winthrup So like everybody else Green wasnt shooting the lights out necessarily but did make a couple of threes against Winthre in that contest but in general over the last five or six games hes been averaging right around 14 15 points and shooting well north of 40 from the perimeter Yeah hes been great I think as Primo Spears gets back into this rotation and lineup I think its going to open things up even more for Darren Green And as those bigs get up get get operating a little bit more down low too Just creating more space for Darren on the perimeter to get some good open shots Lots of passing there by Lipkcom And at the top of the key their big man Asmin took the extra step and is called for the traveling violation Applause Florida State sends their freshman Taylor Bowen into the equation here Now on the pick and roll action Jaylen Gayy lost the handle down in the low post Still waiting to see Jaylen Gayy get back to the Jaylen Gayy we saw at Brown when he was so dominant in the Ivy League down low but also on the defensive end I think hes still just getting back to it off of that knee injury Hes the Ivy League leader in career field goal percentage just shy of 70 And theres Darren Green Jr splashing one in from the midrange Yeah not only can he hit three Sean he can do it from the midrange as well Phenomenal scores Darren Green Fourpoint lead now for Florida State Theyve made each of the last three from the floor Meanwhile Lipkcoms without a field goal in the last 3 and 12 minutes Heres Falner trying to change that In fact he will Nice baseline drive by the freshman Dylan Faulner And thats going to be a recipe for the Bison today is you got to get some drive and kick opportunities Thats a good cut on the baseline from the Falcon Are able to finish it off Applause Down to two Watkins skips it to the corner Taylor Bowen will pull the trigger and the freshman is short on the three ball attempt Asmin clears the board His ninth attempt for the season for Bowen but love to see him stretching his game a little bit more The perimeter again has thought about pulling the trigger on a trailer instead Brought it back down and dribbles it out top of the key into the corner It goes to Anderson Now back up top to lined that one up pretty well but it was strong And thats a good look right there Driving into the heart of the defense just opens things a little bit up for Puit to give him enough space to shoot Thats one thing that Akov said today They need to get around 12 to 14 threes to feel confident in winning this game Florida State though has been the team thats filled it up from the perimeter early on in this one Jaylen Gayy on second effort will run the trip to the free throw line for Florida State Music Another look underneath Jaylen Gayy fighting hard Sean we were just talking about this Five offensive rebounds already for Florida State to none for Lipkcom That was going to be a problem coming into this game for the Bisons and how they were going to operate under the glass or on the glass with this length of the seinals A chance to add on to whats already three second chance points in this game for Florida State lineup Jaylen Gayy as we talked about as a transfer from Brown University twotime Ivy League defensive player of the year missed last season with Florida State due to a knee injury So he played in their international games in Canada then had a knee injury did not play last year And its notable too that a couple of years ago when the Ivy League decided after the pandemic they still werent going to play basketball he didnt play that either Hes played one year of basketball in the last three seasons Yeah he was considered one of the Portal prizes a season ago Its just unfortunate he had to go down with that knee injury but again hes just still coming back to his own right Just got to feel comfortable on that knee Back to the style of play that he knew so well in the Ivy League Will Puit lost the handle Its a turnover for Lipkcom Now back the other way comes Florida State The lead still two for the NLES Cam Corin we mentioned hes a game time decision He is on the floor for the NLES Number three in white And theres number 23 in wide Primo Spears a new addition for Florida State with the NCAA allowing twotime transfers immediate eligibility Hes made it count So boom right there Sean Lipkcom with a great answer but that is the recipe for the Bison today Drive into the lane draw all the attention right out to the corner wide open three Thats cash money And thats Cody Hen a player that coach Auff is particularly high on He loves that freshman and what he projects to be over the course of a fouryear career Music Chandler Jackson dribble penetration off the wing Thats a smooth looking stroke for Chandler Jackson One of a few guys whos run the point here at Florida State calling his own numbers Yeah not really known for his scoring as Chandler Jackson More of a bulldog on both sides of the ball but a good finish nonetheless at the elbow Head off the three now with the right hand all the way to the basket The freshman Cody Head starting to get it going here in this first half Showing out for the Bison so far And here he comes again Head off the steel with the right hand Lays it in and one Talk to him Cody How about that Good finish underneath Good little scoring stretch thus far for Head Takes it right himself at two Florida State defenders up and in Good finish Music Of the many things that Coach Auff bragged about with Cody had he described him as a really good north south driver I guess listen you just saw it right there Theyre missing their best north south driver and Darren Boyd so good at getting to the cup But Cody head showcasing it for us right there Baba Miller kicks it back out top from the low post Applause Florida State feeding Corin Welcome back Cam Well there he is I guess he is playing today Theres some great pick and pop up top Just rolling off it nice and easy Cam Corin able to finish it Florida State has made six of their last eight from the floor Anderson coming to the jump stop now Goes down to the baseline Fuckner gets the roll Baseline cuts are causing some problems early on for Florida State Guys are getting open Theyre getting lost on that back door Excuse me That was Ryland how one of another handful of freshman as Miller goes off the glass Applause Music Applause Davidson kicking McCormick Music There he is Almost a 40 threepoint shooter is McCormick You love to see that from your 69 big Hes got three threepointers in each of his last two games Hes been hot as of late looking to keep it going Timeout on the floor here at the Tucker Center But just a few moments ago an emphatic return for Cameron Corin in his sophomore season as a seminal The alleyoop dunk for number three in white And Florida State has plenty of work to do here in the top Music Greatness is a feeling Fearless Applause brotherhood Greatness is more than winning the game Music Its changing it Touchdown Greatness

toe injury Jack On the season averaging nine and a half points per game shooting north of 50 from the floor Last played against the University of Georgia which interestingly enough his dad Richard Corin played for the Bulldogs himself Um and so great to see Cam back on the floor making an instant impact Oh no doubt And and Seminal fans got to be happy He was off to a hot start in the beginning of this season The first four games in double digits for the big man down low want to see more play and more development for him as the season goes through That last dead ball in the action here came off of a Cody head foul and thatll be a foul called likely against Baba Miller for Florida State Music Applause Music So the Nullles trailing by three will go back to work on defense Nulls have made four of their last five Lipkcom meanwhile has made each of its last five Heres Hal one of several freshman coming off the bench here for the Bison Thats a turnover Here comes Primo Spears Florida State looking to run Nickelberry from the wing Applause Davidson and Hal knocked away by Chandler Jackson remains with Lipkcom for the moment Again just showing how active these Florida State defenders are in these passing lanes Constantly getting their hands up and anticipating where that pass is going to go and just clogging the lanes It makes it so hard for a team like Liscom to play that style of basketball they want Passing it among the perimeter Pruit trying to find somebody to get it into and he makes a great decision Excellent work off the inbounds play The freshman Dylan Falner driving all the way to the basket and a fivepoint lead now for the Bisons Good move from the freshman Aggressive no hesitation right to the cup Already five points for Falner who had 12 and nine rebounds earlier this season against Waford One of a few different NCAA tournament caliber type teams that they have played K from beyond the elbow Thats one thing we we open with it too Sean This Lipkcom team could very easily be 10 and four right now They lost a close one to Arkansas and Belmont a couple of weeks ago but this is a team thats primed to make a run in the Asan into the postseason And to your point just a onepoint loss to Belmont in a whats really a cross town rivalry there in Nashville Tennessee The two campuses just a couple of miles apart And then of course going to Fagatville Arkansas They trailed by roughly as many as 20 and came roaring back and had some chances late but werent able to capitalize They ended up losing that by three Primo Spears getting in on the act Another midrange jumper this time for Spears Spears is so silky from the midrange Just able to create space dribbles Pull up with ease Big offensive rebound for Libcom Second chance opportunity Anderson Nice move to the basket Anderson the transfer from Furman Such an improved player So much praise from Le Auff talking about Anderson A little bit more veteran presence as well for this bison squad That Furman team last year won the Big South then went into the NCAA tournament knocked off the Virginia Cavaliers before losing to San Diego State in the second round San Diego State for their part went on to the national championship game Applause Music and swings it to Breuin Buit nearly lost the handle Poked away Faulner comes up with it Anderson left alone Top of the key Good look for the Bisons but Florida State comes away with a rebound Applause Primo Spears talking to his big Cam Corin telling him to get down low does just that Wants to get the pace going Not play as much in the half court This is a Florida State team that wants to play fast up tempo Nice feed from Spears to Corn Corn now has four D3 head Got them all Have yourself a day Cody head 11 points in this first half lead in the game Largest lead of the game for Lipkcom Jack Cody head is perfect from the floor Oh Head is balling right now Lipscom taking a lead early on Theyre going to try and keep

Well whatever you would imagine being a true freshman on the road at a Power Five school might stir up in somebody it has summoned quite the opposite And Cody Head whos been fantastic Oh fantastic is almost an understatement for the freshman Hes coming off a careerhigh 14 points a game ago versus Brian where he shot 85 from the field Hes perfect early in this one Hes looked great And thats what happened Sean if you take a look at the roster breakdown youre losing without your top two scorers and youre not without Darren Boyd and that allows players to step up Now Cody heads getting some more pivotal minutes for the Bisons and hes certainly taking advantage And you mentioned the two starters out This is a Lipkcom program that won 20 games last year They were bringing back four of their starting five but as you mentioned two out for the moment and so it shuffled the rotation And so Coach Auff told us before the game he said Were one of the few teams in the country that the first four guys we bring off the bench are all freshman He said But were committed to the young guys and we like where we are Oh absolutely Theyve looked great early on and without Boyd over this stretch of four or five games theyve been in We We mentioned the Belmont game Thats where Boyd went down And even the Arkansas game they were without their top two scorers yet theyre still competing It just shows the potential this Bison squad has Music Falner and uh and Head have combined for 16 of Lipkcoms 29 in this one Falner himself was actually called for the foul there That sends Deontay Green to the free throw line Second trip to the line in this game for Deontay Green who split his previous pair of free throws Averaging just north of seven points per game to this point in the season is Deonte Green Good looking free throws there Its a fourpoint lead now for the Bison Music Applause Anderson the point guard Kicks it to Puit Now they swing it around Applause Puit driving all the way What a good looking shot Music Tried to bump the shoulder down low Going to come back the other way Its a good look for Florida State off the shot fake Foul called on the floor underneath the basket after the Darren Green Jr miss from the corner If youre Florida State thats the look you wanted though Absolutely Thats the man you want to shoot from anywhere on the court But another man thats been balling for the Bison Will Puit Good take to the cup Strong finish Sixpoint lead with six left in the opening half for Lipkcom Music Puit working on the baseline Florida State brings the double Baba Miller nearly got in the passing lane and came away with the steal Andersons three ball attempt is short Thats a big offensive rebound for Asmin Knocked away for the moment by Darren Green Jr But Lipkcom controls possession Thats where one Leonard Hamiltons not going to be happy about They swap for Green unfortunately called a foul for him but there were three Florida State defenders underneath and one Lipkcoma man able to come away with that rebound Heres the spin from Amin to throw it up Job from Deontay Green to stuff it away but itll be two for 35 Masman a sophomore from Kimberly Wisconsin Applause Guy who co Jacob describes his game being elite on defense a really versatile defender A guy who can guard multiple positions and has good presence on both sides of the floor for the Bison Hes a 50 foul shooter though and he misses the front end of his two attempts here Hes going to be a big one today for the Bison Hes the tallest player on this roster at 611 And you said it Sean right He can guard multiple positions with a team like Florida State thats lengthy at the guard position and down low Hes going to have to move around throughout this game Lead up to seven now for Lipkcom as Florida State looks to push and Cody Heads going to get called for the reach And if theres been one issue for Cody Head here in this first half its Ben getting into a little bit of foul trouble Thats going to be his second Yeah just a careless foul from Cody Head Just no no need for him to do that picks up his second Weve seen how important he has been to Lipkcom so far Hes going to take a seat and AJ McInness will check in McGinness the transfer from Cincinnati whose career began at UNC Greensboro Actually played Florida State at UNCCG in the NCAA tournament a few years back Theres Deontay Green on the baseline with the jumper and Florida State trims the lead down to five Applause Will Puit nice pass Beautiful look back door Will Puit just commanding this offense with ease Little no look bounce pass Good one from number two Applause Spears pull up money Thats his spot right there Sean thats the third basket hes made almost from that exact same spot Right at the elbow just passed it Midrange Primo Those fans got to be happy to see him off to a hard hot start Three of three from the field Both teams have made their fair share of shots here in the first half The lead bouncing back and forth now between five and seven McInness now kicks it to Puit Puit lines that up He has been absolute money in this game Whether hes been dishing out dimes or knocking down shots Will Puit with a threepointer Said he does everything Hes a fouryear starter for this program He knows this offense this team this program through and through Hes putting it on display these past few possessions Lips comes in four of their last five from the floor The lead is eight Hyo Look theres Puit laying it in Who else Will Puit 10point lead now for the Bisons Applause Its the freshman Taylor Bowen working with it on the right wing now with Supreo Spears on the left Applause Spears got into the middle of that zone defense trying to kick it out to Nickelberry who lost the handle Darren Green Jr spin move Its short Thats a shot clock violation And thatll send us to another media timeout Lipkcoms lead has swollen to 10 courtesy of Will Puit Hes dishing out dimes Hes knocking down shots And the bisons out of the a sun are surging here in Floridas capital city And Doug and Doug says you can customize and save hundreds on car insurance with Liberty Mutual He hits his mark center

moms coming over So many ways to save life ready wallet happy Thats 365 by Whole Foods Market We take a look at how Lipkcom wants to run their offense This is the basic of it right there You see it starts at the top They spread the perimeter as he drives to the lane Look at three Florida State defenders converge all around him Just leaves a wide open Will Puit in the corner Thats a good look and thats the look that Lenovo wants to get for his team And thats how Florida State defense is going to react to the Bison as they cause havoc down low Its a Princeton offense for Lipkcom And the basic tenant of it is that its generally positionless isnt it Jack Oh absolutely It allows players to play outside of their range Thats what helps when you have a player like Owen McCormick as a big down low who is a perimeter shooter in his own right But you look at this team they want to spread the floor You see all of them right now outside on the perimeter and theyre just going to drive through and cut and open up things for the guys on the outside And for Florida State the objective is to fill all those spaces all those gaps get in the passing lanes like they so typically do to the Princeton offense Very pass heavy a lot of movement a lot of cutting And heres Spears on the other end lining up the three Thats short Applause Music Heres Puit Hes been the hot hand Pull up over the freshman Taylor Bowen Weak side rebound and McCormack puts it back up Florida State cannot afford any of that cannot allow that If you are Florida State second chance points and just offensive rebounds in general as an uncovered man on the back door Thats an easy bucket for Lipster FSU recorded the first six rebounds of the game Had a 6 edge It is now knotted up 13 apiece Five of those were on the offensive glass Taylor Bowen gets it back out to Cam K Corner Couple steps inside the perimeter misses and back the other way comes Lipkcom pushing pace themselves now McGinness brings it back out top and they swing it around to Will Puit Listen theyre slowing things down as they should right now No reason to push but Florida State you want to get a miss and a run in transition and thats what Florida State likes to do Lipkcom does a nice job of getting back on defense That was one thing head coach Luff told us You got to keep the game in front of you They dont want Florida State out and running and theyve done a good job thus far Puit all the way to the rim That is no good Nearly a second effort basket was put back up and through but that misses as well So Florida State got away with one there and theyll try to trim into the lead here in this final minute of the half Applause All alone Thats easy money right there Thats just getting back on defense A little lazy from the seminals Caught watching and Will Puit veteran guard taking advantage Florida States over last six Two of their last 10 They are without a point in the last 343 here of the half Was trying to dish that out to Ryland Hal who was going to drive baseline to the bucket but skip that one into the Florida State bench The NOS will have an opportunity here with about a 4se secondond differential between their shot and game clock Music 4329 Lipkcom Florida State without a single point in the last four minutes and change Could be a big one here for the NLES Just net one go into the half try and recoup come out strong The Bisons meanwhile on a 90 run over that period of time Spears pull up Got it Here comes Anderson The Bison still have time Dish out to Puit Thats good The hot hand Will it Why not 16 for the junior Theyre going to go to the monitor to make sure he got that shot off but in real time that sure looked good Applause Well take a look So still Music So just had an explanation The shot clock was wrong So its starting back up again at 22 seconds Florida State will get another look and it goes in Music Well all right Oh no Absolutely And you saw it on that little graphic right there I mean As they or excuse me Lipkcom theyre leading the ASU in field goal percentage Theyve scored over 80 points seven times this season Theyre on their way to doing that again Theyre just shooting well Florida States got to bunker down right now Play that junkyard dog defense and they play so well Anderson nice pass as McGinness cuts to the basket That was the look that Lipkcom no doubt wanted They just did not cash it in Perfectly executed from Lithkum But on the other side of the ball Florida State fortunate to get an opportunity to cut that lead down Watkins euro step in the lane He puts it up and Florida State records the first bucket here in the second half Well listen Jir Watkins scored the first basket of the game for Florida State That corner three and had not scored since Hes been great this season for the NLES the second leading scorer on the team Hes got to get going in this second half if the Seinals want to come back Florida State likes to switch on defense for the moment that got Deontay Green on Will Puit Now Puits left alone up top Green crashes in on him Thatll be a foul against Deontay Fortunate foul for Deontay Green gives three shots to Will P through it Heres another look Green just crashing out and just invades the space So obviously doesnt get a piece of Puit but thats what theyre doing now to protect the shooters not landing where he is And Green will pick up the foul Music So thatll send Puit to the free throw line to shoot a handful of free throws here for the Bisons Applause First one up and good for Puit The junior from Mount Juliet Tennessee Guy has been the workhorse of this team He leads them in minutes played and as I mentioned a few minutes ago does a lot of hard work on the glass as a guard Yeah I love he averages just over one offensive rebound a game and obviously thats not incredible number right You love to see that from your guard crashing the glass especially on the offensive side of the ball So with those three free throw makes lead is 16 now make it 14 for Litkum Baba Miller left all alone under the basket and its still shaking Thats what the NLES needed A little emphasis from Baba Miller slamming that home cutting into this lead Applause Wing three is good Owen McCormick He made one in the first half and hes got another one here in the second He was the newcomer of the week a couple weeks ago in his performance versus Arkansas Showing out a little bit today 10 points for McCormack Set it on two of three from behind the arc Stretching it well Baba Miller off the side of the backboard Got back his own miss and finishes Job from Baba to hustle after the ball Applause Music Applause looking for the corner He comes out with Florida State for the moment Anderson though retreats covers and prevents a turnover Only five turnovers in the first half for Lipkcom And they eliminate one there and then cash it in with another wing three How about Whale tying the season high 22 points for the junior Jamir Watkins in the lane too strong Out it comes with Puit and now Anderson McGinness left alone on the wing Thats good Music Applause Music Threes are falling Coach Auff said he wanted around 12 to 14 Theyre sitting at eight now draining it in this second half I was just about to say theyve made eight of 15 Warley gets the midrange down and Florida State gets back within now 20 Its amazing what Lipkcom has done here now coming out of the locker room McGinness looking for some space working on Jir Watkins Watkins tried to wrap around McInness who floats it up in the lane Offensive rebound stick back attempt by McCormack is no good but he will go to the free throw line Litco again just the drive and kick as we said before Enough space to create some separation for Puit again Another open look AJ McInness on the end of that one And the threes are falling for the Bisons But just on this last play too Char McCormick you had Baba Miller Jaylen Worley and Deontay Green underneath And McCormacks the one able to come away with the rebound And now at the line whos the ASUcomer of the week just a few weeks ago you mentioned it Jack averaging 13 points per game between Arkansas and Brian Shot 53 from the floor averaged 46 rebounds But in that game against Arkansas alone 13 points and 12 rebounds against the Hogs out in Fyenville Just a tremendous showing by McCormack showing out as of late 13 points in each of his last two games Has 12 here Continuing the hot streak Darren Green Jr nice pass to Jamir Watkins Fouled on the way up A lot of contact and both guys are shaken up Both Watkins and Owen McCormack Watkins still down on the baseline In fact hope to see Jir Watkins Okay just tough Watkins going up as McCormack is going down I just took one in the face Make sure hes all right And so while Florida State takes a look at Jamir Watkins well take a break right here on ACC NX Music State Farm Music Music State Farm buddies I

have prediabetesorg Congratulations Youre going home with a free prize pack Welcome back to Tallahassee here on the ACC Network Extra where Lipkcom leads it 6039 over Florida State here at the Tucker Center Things have been going well for the Bisons except for this jack which was called a flavored one Yeah theyre actually just had Re come over and explain to us that this will qualify for a flagrant one foul So you see McCormick coming down with his body on to Jamir Watkins Thats enough to qualify it as a flagrant one and will result in two free throws for the Nulls Two free throws and possession if Im not mistaken for Florida State Itll be Jamir Watkins likely to do the honors here the transfer from VCU the guy who was the MVP of the Sunshine Slam Tremendous showings against UNLV in Colorado 37 combined points 15 rebounds 12 assist in a couple of games there in Daytona Beach for again Jir Watkins who makes the first of his free throws here on the backside of the flagrant one Yeah Watkins was great a season ago at VCU now comes and takes his talents to Tallahassee and hes only improved He was known as that sort of Swiss Army knife at VCU but hes done that exactly here for Lenel Hamiltons crew I mean theyve hes been great early on Currently leads Florida State in rebounds assists and steals And hes a guy that Leonard Hamilton told me before the game Jack he said Look its hard to be in part of a system and then transfer schools and then have to learn an entirely new system And he said Given time hell continue to adjust Hell continue to smooth out some of that adjustment And he said Frankly when Florida State gets back to being Florida State where theyve got more of that depth that will help too Absolutely And theyve started to see the depth come back a little bit more and more as the season has progressed But hes also playing a little bit of a different role too Hes been playing more of a point forward role handling the ball now that Primo Spears is back and playing You kind of seen that shy away a little bit But still yeah a lot of lot of time with the ball in his hands Watkins had foul called on the floor against Jaylen Warley for the shove on Anderson Music lead stands at 19 for Lipkcom This is back to the monitor again Yeah check in something out Maybe again check in if that any sort of or something on that foul Its be okay Just be an inbound for Lipster But this is where Florida State Seans going to have to bunker down and really lock in defensively It arguably might have been their best defensive game of the season a game ago versus Winthrup 24 turnovers they forced Thats unbelievable take from Will Puit A phenomenal shot blocker and Jaylen Gayy underneath Thats how you limit a great shot blocker You invade their space You take it right to him and its so hard for Gainy to get a piece of that Puit takes advantage 21 now in the game for Puit Hes one shy of his season high 22 And that foul on the floor will take us I believe to our media timeout Well see Music All right Perhaps I stand corrected as Jir Watkins steps in to shoot some free throws Applause Music Music Couple of good looking free throws there for Watkins whos now made a handful here in this second half Little change up too Want to see some more pressure from Florida State You see it on and off throughout this game but picking up full court Not letting it come easy to lift scum anymore Nulls bring the double on the freshman Falner Spears heavily guarding Will Puit backing him out to the logo and hell be called for the bump Just got in there with the little hand check and the reach I mean youre saying he was aggressive He was out there right not leaving any space for Will Puit to operate Just a little too much from Primo Fourth foul called against Florida State here in the second half Now its Anderson breaking it down getting by Spears Thats a big swat by Jaylen Gayy And now here comes Florida State They havent had many chances to run the floor Theyre trying to do so here Instead its turned over And here comes Lipkcom again It was great to see from Gayy him blocking some shots Averaged over two at Brown Only had three on this season Music pass to the corner and nobody was home except for a few fans in that front row hopefully ready Lead is 19 from Loop Spears with the kick to Darren Green Jr from inside the free throw line Green gets the roll Heres that pressure Florida State bench up on their feet Crowd starting to show a little bit more life trying to steal some energy into the NLES Puit steps to the right now from the wing That is strong And Florida State brings down that rebound Now in transition Green Junior from the corner And there you have it You can get in transition in ways other than turnovers And thats Florida State running the floor off a hard rebound A big good job from coach Auff to call a timeout stop the momentum but Florida State big shot So were down 34 to zero Winning will be tough

vivid seats when you buy 10 tickets you can get your 11 free 70 run for Florida State in the last minute and 35 seconds And in so doing Jack this is how Id describe it In the last minute and a half theyve played Florida State basketball Theyve played Florida State basketball indeed Its their first fast break point of the game to Darren Green that threepointer But thats the style of basketball Tallahassee knows so well Defense turning into offense Florida State has extended the pressure out into the full court Got a big offensive rebound then ran the floor to find Green in the corner for three Thats the last three of that 70 run Now the Nolles bring the double in the paint Theres a block by Taylor Bo Bowen at Harams out of play But another quality defensive play by Florida State It looks like it will in fact be a turnover Yep And just becoming a little bit more accustomed to how coach Akoff wants to play with his squad and what weve seen with that Princeton offense driving in and kicking it out to the perimeter Florida State doing a better job filling those gaps in the space making it a little bit more difficult Good couple of games coming into this one for Taylor Bowl Bowen set a careerhigh in points a couple of games ago against North Florida also set a careerhigh in rebounds which he matched against Winthre and then led the team in blocks with three against Winthre Love to see that from Ba Hes just a big man that moves like a guard I mean its kind of majestic on the court to watch him but hes been playing great as of late Lone freshman making it happen for Florida State And that is a look that Lipkcom wanted and Florida State could not afford McInness just had simply too much space on the wing Music Applause Watkins working down low Nice passing by Florida State Spears freezes with it in the corner for a second Now the dribble penetration that has been his spot Primo Spears has filled it up from the midrange for the Nullles Yeah also right there just the pick and pop with Primo with Primo Spears Thats where he was so effective at Georgetown bringing the big man up coming off that screen and hes just able to elevate from the midrange above his defender creating enough space and put the shot in Quick hands by Jamir Watkins swatting that ball away Darren Green Jr comes away with the steal and now McInness clears the glass for Lipkcom Music 15point lead for the Bison Thats where it was at the half Falner to McInness looking for three more Too strong but there to clean things up on the offensive glass A couple of freshman Second effort Falner Third effort Hal and Hal gets it to go Seen a couple of those today Sean where Livkcom just seems to be free underneath on the offensive glass and able to capitalize Certainly were as Jir Watkins is fouled driving to the basket Florida State will shoot a couple of free throws when we come back on the backside of these messages Music Greatness is a feeling Fearless Applause brotherhood Greatness is more than winning the game Music Its changing it Touchdown Greatness is what we do Accomplish greatness Music State Farm Music Music State arm People want to define Gen Z but thats our

champion for Christ at Liberty University Back here in Tallahassee Florida State trails by 17 with 11 and a half left But Jack Kavit Primo Spears has been a bright spot for the Nles today He has now in double digits in every game hes played for the NLES But get excited NLES fans This is what Primo Spears does so well Coming off the ball screen high up from Corin able to float around it rise up and make the bucket Here it is again from Deontay Green Just enough space to hesitate his defender Is he going to drive Is he going to stay He has that quick first step to able to keep the defender on their heels And thats where Primo Spears can be deadly from the midrange And he showed it off today Five of six from the field and 10 points one of the more prolific scorers in the Big East In fact led Georgetown in points per game Also dished out over five assists per game for the Hoya And then you go back to his freshman year at Dukane He led them in scoring as a freshman And so the twotime transfer was forced out for a while earlier this year And you know Jack he told me a week or so ago when I chatted with him he said you know he found out the day before they played SMU hey youre good Youre in Youre going to get to play He said coach pulled him out in the middle of a film meeting and broke the news to him and said youre good to go Were going to play you He said it was a big rush of emotion largely because it was the first time that he can really recall in his life that he has been forced away from the game And so while he has to his credit been part of that practice team that scout team working against his teammates in practices theres still some competitive rust there despite that now in double figures in all four games as an old Absolutely And you mentioned it too Sean the practices right You imagine it for a player of his caliber You know hes still showing up to shoot around and practices and youre playing with the team You just cant get the live reps and playing the game And what that can do to a player you know we dont know But its great to see him back out here now in his fourth game with the null And hes showing out He did it in the Big East last year which is as tough as a conference as they come Primo showing off for Florida State today What a quality pass by McCormack Cody Head couldnt cash it in but that was a real nice behind the back look Two head down low as Cameron K fights for space down on the baseline And I believe theyll catch Cody Head for the foul Yeah K will shoot two 10 minutes for him in this game So easing him back in from that toe injury But again good to see him out there Curious to see how coach Ham will rotate the bigs now with a healthy Corin Deontay Green and Jaylen Gayy When healthy Cam Corin has proven that he can be a special guy for Florida State Had a double double on the road in Gainesville Also set a careerhigh in points scored against the Gator when he recorded 18 at the Odome a couple of hours down the road Cody youre up with me Yeah And so the journey really today beginning for Cam Corin to work his way back to that level and of course with plenty of time left in his career hopefully for him beyond Yeah Hes going to be great for Florida State as a as a threelevel a player You got a guy like Owen McCormick for Lipkcom that can stretch it out as perimeter big and Cam Horn has the ability to do the exact same thing Applause This free throw trims the lead back down to 15 again Thats where it stood at the half after the officials waved off what looked like could have been a buzzer beater for Darren Green Jr Cody Head was the hot head early for Lipkcom And now heres Florida State looking to run Who else but Primo Spears with the right handles tried to clean it up and could not And now here comes Lipkcom running back the other way with Anderson McInness for three more Got them all Oh Coach A loved that one the possession before you take the shot clock all the way down No rush at all Then you get a stop and then you push it quick and hit a three Big time points from Lipkcom And just like that the lead swells to 18 for the Bison And you saw it there Sean You would have never thought before this game Lipskum 14 fast break points in this one McGinness able to get on the end of that threepointer Florida State just hasnt been able to get out in transition like they normally do So well Spears has it on the wing Florida State operating now with 10 left on their shot clock Chandler Jackson pulls up from three and he got all of those of that Five for 20 on the year He is from behind the arc but stepped in no hesitation Shot that and able to connect Hes a guy that Primo Spears again when I chatted with him last week he said Chandler Jackson has been shooting the ball well in the gym And thats a good look of perhaps what number zero and white can do for the NLES Music Look just able to trap McInness in enough space for Chandler Jackson to let it fly Now speaking of Spears who I was just talking about he was called for the foul on the floor Thatll be the fifth against Florida State Each team with five fouls here in the second half Applause Head in the paint Nice extra pass McCormack though short on the laying attempt but theres Hal on the weak side cleaning it up Florida State fortunate there to come away with a stop Here you go This is if youre Florida State now Got to get in some offense get a couple of points and look to go on a run Theres the couple of points you just described Primo Spears has been the hot hand here especially over the last few minutes for the NLES No need to fear Primo Spears is here and really for the first time since the first minutes since the half Florida State has trimmed into that halftime lead for Lipkcom Theres the steel Chandler Jackson in the Nullles looking to run the floor Pass to the corner now Back up top Jackson now swinging it to Baba Miller Bounce pass Cam K down low is short and a foul called on the floor Thats a great job on that play from Baba Miller Actually hes the one that drew that foul Thats just him crashing the glass and looking to be an option for Cam Cornition to the lane Cam Korn heres heres the whole play The Nulls doing a good job reversing the ball getting Lipkcom on their toes You see Baba just cut to the basket right there being an option Takes the bump able to draw the foul Still one foul to give for Lipkcom So Florida State will have to send this in on an inbounds play Next one will put the NLES in the bonus They get it into Josh Nickelberry The transfer from Lasal Music Heres Spears Pull up once again This time banking off the glass Nickelberry crashes in for the offensive rebound Big one for the NLES here with eight minutes left Heres Darren Green with some dribble penetration but turns it over and Cody Head comes away with a big steal for the Bison Its a big steal for the Bison It just seemed like the momentum was starting to build for Florida State You can feel the energy in the tuck starting to build Good job from the Bison Grab a stop McCormack looking to turn the corner on Gainy Gainy now switches on to head and McCormick rolling to the basket Lost the handle Last touch by Anull though as it carams out of play Five on the shot clock for Lipkcom who leads by 13 USAA Yeah they have awesome rates on coverage for our car home and stuff She has a lot of stuff Dad A lot of cool stuff honey But USAA also has banking credit cards and loans plus advice and other perks Only for emergencies Thanks Mom And its all in one spot So we know shes all

you got an extra ticket to the game tonight I would love to go Yeah sure Its Its all yours Larry Thanks Billy Ill meet you out front What Yeah Okay Its Bob But okay Yeah He doesnt know your name dude I guess Im Bill now With vivid seats When you buy 10 tickets you can get your 11th free Music 13point lead for the Bisons here in Tallahassee And Lipkcom has certainly challenged themselves in the nonconference And those efforts have paid off Theyve taken on a number of NCAA tournament caliber teams including taking on and taking down UNCC Asheville in the Northern Classic in Montreal Yeah pretty cool to play that game up in Canada You see the star of that one Will Puit whos having a good day for himself here down in Tallahassee But a number of teams too Sean weve mentioned it already today A close game with Belmont one that they thought they could have had And then facing off with Eric Muslemans crew in Arkansas another game down the stretch They had plenty of shots to put that game away just werent able to do so Heavy pressure on the inbounds for Florida State Cody Head tried to beat the buzzer The runner does everything but drop And now heres Florida State with a chance to trim even further into a lead thats been over 20 at points But Primo Spears couldnt get the teardrop to fall I think Puit maybe got a finger in the eye something like that Hes squinting and grabbing at his eye Applause Now in the half court set Puit working downhill off Florida State could not get the roll No points in the last three minutes now for Lipkcom Jir Watkins working downhill and thatll be an and one Got the bounce got the roll and Watkins will head back to the charity stripe for the oldfashioned threepoint play Good job Jamir Watkins low in the shoulder a little bit initiating the contact able to put it up and in a big shot for the seminals Here they come starting to build some momentum You said it Sean a over threeminute scoring drought for Lipkcom right now This is the time where the NLES have to take advantage So far theyre on a 70 run over the last 255 while Lipkcom over that same stretch is 0 for their last four One of their last seven as well are the Bison So its been a tough stretch even beyond that scoreless drought for Lipkcom 10point lead now on the road This is as low as its been since the first half Puit doing everything he can to fight off a triple team And thatll be a foul called against Florida State Theyre going to call it on Jir Watkins as Florida State would have wanted that to have been called a tie up Yeah fans in the tuck not happy with that Good job The ball got in the ground and just Florida State able to converge around Puit Theyre trying to get the jump ball It looked like they had it Just unfortunate for Jir Watkins Hes called with his third of the game To make matters worse the possession error pointing to Florida State Puit looking for space in the corner now Dishing it back out top to Anderson Anderson now to Puit off the shot thing Five on the shot clock Puit Thatll be a shot clock violation This is tremendous defense here from Florida State Some of their best work of this entire game coming over the last four minutes Jamir Watkins two blocks a game ago and with authority on that one Big one for the NL Can the NLES make it a singledigit deficit with roughly 6 minutes left here in regulation Spears looking for three Too strong Lined it up pretty well Just too much mustard on that shot attempt Now back the other way comes Anderson the point guard Aspen and the Bisons work with Anderson now in the paint and got it on the left wing Aspens going to call his own number in and out Still no points for Lipkcom now over the last 4 and 12 minutes Spears working downhill will earn a trip to the free throw line One of the last nine from the field as Lipkcom Primo Spears will go to the line for two and try to cut this lead to single digits Spears had been perfect from the free throw line going into their last game against Winthre Missed a couple against the Eagles but was money there on that one Every opportunity every point for Florida State is going to be massive FSU on a sevengame home stand This is game number four Their next three conference games will also be here in the Tucker Center A real chance for the Nolles to string together some wins if they can grab some momentum And theres a steel Watkins and company coming back the other way Green three strong Theres that momentum you were just talking about Sean Looked like this place was about to erupt if Darren Green just put that in Feeling it though Crowd is starting to get into it The loudest theyve been in some time as Puitwood tries to break it down off the dribble Out of play Last touch by Cam Corin Florida State on a 100 run over the last five minutes of action Lipkcom without a point in the last 515 Applause Cant have that same set Florida State led up a four on the back door Spears tried to steal that ball away from McCormack Big offensive rebound by Puit Thats a fresh 20 McInness lines up a tray That is strong and McCormack crashing in on the glass trying to secure a third opportunity Knocked it over the baseline And head coach Lenny Aub looking over at McInness right there He told us before the game hes fine with this team shooting 33pointers as long as theyre good shots That one right there from McInness You get the offensive rebound you get a reset No reason to rush right now Youre leading by eight under five away from home Thats a shot you dont need to take right there And showing a little frustration after was coach AOV And now Darren Green will shoot Yeah I didnt even catch the fact that there was a foul called on Asen I was watching McCormack crash in there and trying to extend that possession and completely missed the fact that Asmin was called for a foul on Darren Green Jr Florida State now in the bonus shooting the one and one Green making the first and the second Two big free throws for Darren Green Jr and Florida State keeps that momentum rolling 120 run over the last 5 minutes 143 run over the last over the last 645 Puit to Asmin to the logo and Anderson Corin tried to come away with the steal off McCormack 10 left for Lipkcom and a reach will be called against Florida State That will put the Bisons in the bonus Music They go against Cam Court Music Applause Music Corn having a good conversation right now Just trying to figure out exactly what he was doing underneath Aggressive defense from the sophomore I think just a little too much The arm checks kind of got him shoving down McCormick Owen McCormack coming into today an 846 foul shooter Thats a big first free throw make their first point in quite some time Still though the Bisons without a field goal in nearly 6 minutes and thats now equally a big miss for a guy who usually makes 85 of his free throws Sevenpoint lead Watkins working on McCormick And McCormack will be called for the foul Watkins whos been pretty good from the free throw line here today for Florida State Well shoot a couple more Far the most trips to the line Seven attempts already at the line Does Watkins have good job just taking it downhill Able to draw the foul Game starting to slow down a little bit coming into these final minutes of the second half Music Watkins is six for seven from the free throw line in this game to this point He is 13 points in the game Nearly half of them coming from the charity stripe and nearly all of them coming in the second half Its Yep Thats a veteran taking over late As we take a look what Florida State has done in the first and the second half respectively 13 made field goals in the first 10 more here in the second But the free throws theyve been getting to the free throw line and then making those shots Jack Yeah And that was a big thing a game ago versus Wind That was their season high 30 free throws made on 42 attempts The first time all year they had been over 20 free throws made in a game Youll like to see that from the seminals getting downhill getting to the basket Got the roll on the first free throw there Florida State now in the double bonus by the way So they will be shooting two free throws for the balance of regulation and perhaps if we get their overtime Well see how these next 426 play out first though What a second half for Watkins and what a comeback this could be for Florida State who have trimmed the lead down to five Keep in mind this is a Lipkcom team that once led in this second half by as much as 21 points Applause They led 6241 It is now down to 7166 And here comes that pressure once again for Florida State with the immediate timeout approaching the last of the game Just need to look for a stop here for the NLES Puit working on Jackson Puit spun looking for somebody He found Primo Spears Here comes Spears and the Nles lobbing it up off the backboard Just unfortunate thats maybe just a little bit of disconnection Primo Spears has yet to play with Cam Cor and they hes been out and Primo now back So that chemistry will build over time Anderson inside to Puin That no good But what a follow by Dylan Falner How about that The freshman making it happen Biggest bucket of the game for him And how big that bucket is for Lipkcom as a team who had been without one for gosh seven or so minutes in this second half Lead up to seven Does Florida State have an answer Spears did everything but drop and a foul called I believe on the floor against Cam Cor Thatll take us to immediate timeout All of a sudden we got a pretty tight ball game here at the top USAA Yeah they have awesome rates on coverage for our car home and stuff She has a lot of stuff Dad A lot of cool stuff honey But USAA also has banking credit cards and loans plus

amid a furious rally having trailed by as many as 21 They now trail by seven So glad to have you with us Sean Davidson Jack Kavit here with you at the Donald L Tucker Center in Floridas capital city Looks like Dylan Falner is going to shoot some free throws and Simmerons going to continue to sled down the railing and were going to have 3 minutes and 10 seconds of whats going to be some really enticing basketball Theres no doubt about it Jack Florida State riding a big wave of momentum But Lipkcom is really doing a nice job now of trying to stem that here over the last couple of possessions Yeah that was a massive bucket for Dylan Falner on that put back dunk to just kind of seize the moment a little bit and stop that momentum that Florida State was feeling and really run with in the last couple of minutes He drew the foul on the defensive end as well Worth noting Lipkcom still in the bonus not yet in the double bonus So that front end miss on the one and one means thats it And now Florida State resumes with a chance to trim into the lead as Spears nearly lost his footing Watkins driving baseline will earn another trip to the free throw line Wanted the and one Didnt get the roll but will head back to the charity stripe nonetheless Good job from Jir Watkins drawing attention Able to hang in the air just enough Couldnt get the ball up over the rim but two shots for two Thatll be the third personal foul called against the freshman Dylan Falner who stepped up big time here in crunch time for Lipscom Watkins has done so as well But for Florida State hes made a bunch of free throws Done a good job of getting downhill Jack and creating some opportunities Yeah And and and again most of this has all been in this in in the second half Hes really come on strong in just the last six or seven minutes or so as well Jir Watkins really doing it all for Florida State A couple more free throw makes for number two in white for Florida State Watkins really spurring the NLES on as they bring the press once more on Lipkcom Something to note as well for Lipkcom Cody head back in the game We were just talking about it off air Four fouls for him right now He started off hot four in the game Havent seen much of him since There is Head working with it on the wing Bulls bring the double McCormick swings it to the corner and out of play Its another turnover by Lipkcom with a fivepoint lead 11th turnover of the game for Lipkcom Thats a Florida State team that forced 24 a game ago versus Winthrop Youre the leading scoreer Jamir Watkins Primo Spears Darren Green leading the way for the Nolles Watkins approaching his season high of 19 as Spears spins in the lane That is knocked out of play Last touch by I believe McCorman like it actually may stay the side the official pointed Florida States way actually Yeah thats right Music Off the inbounds Florida State has 20 to work with Jamir Watkins brings it up Chandler Jackson Strong take to the basket Quality follow by Cam Corin And folks we have a onecore game Thats where Corin comes in so big for the null Second on this team a season ago in rebounds They missed him He comes up big on that possession Anderson looking for space Corin on him now up top McCormack guarded by Chandler Jackson Head swings it to McInness McInness steps to the left Three ballo good Well AJ McInness making up for that shot he took before Coach Auff wasnt that happy I know hes definitely happy about that one Nolles work into the middle of the zone Kick it out Chandler Jackson looking for three Thats strong but he collects his own miss Fresh opportunity for Florida State Primo Spears drives to the basket Good court vision by Primo Spears getting two out of that possession So good from Primo Spears the start stop ability that he possesses just enough to freeze his defender right into the lane Florida State nearly collected a steal off the inbounds play Lipkcom was able to advance it into the half court set One minute left here in regulation as Anderson dribbles it away Anderson McCormick back to Anderson What a block by Watkins but there to follow is Puit Incredible hustle on that play from Jir Watkins But how about that from the Bison Little pick and roll action Joe Anderson and McCormick fooling the defense I mean get the defender up in the air and just an easy bounce pass in and up as it was called on the floor though The follow not necessary here Theyre going to go ahead and credit Anderson for the layup Theyre going to say it was goalending by Florida State That extends the lead to six for Lipkcom as our officials go back to the monitor once again Its been a long days work for Bill Cington Tommy Morrisy and Mark Schneer Theyve done a lot of really good work today and theyve had to clarify a lot of calls and and theyve earned their paychecks today for sure Oh no doubt about that I mean we had the three half court three from Darren Green at the half a flagrant flow Its been all back and forth action but referees have done a great job in this one Music So either way it looked like Lipkcom was destined to tack on a couple more Theyre going to go ahead and give it to Anderson off of a goalending call against Florida State So that follow it was unnecessary for the Bisons to cash in a couple more And now Florida State will send it in Down six with 50 seconds remaining Music Applause Music Spears brings it up Now its Watkins from the corner Thats short Anderson didnt need to touch that That was caraming out of play anyway And for Florida State thats good news That is really fortunate for Florida State You know time is obviously not your friend right now winding down but you dont have to take that shot if youre Jir Watkins You can be a little bit more patient Wait take a little bit more time off the clock but wait for that good book Florida States going to call a 30se second timeout Were going to take it with them here on ACC at X Where did the time go I dont know how I got here Youve done the hard part You quit smoking Now do the easy part and get scanned for lung cancer If you smoked you may still be at risk but early detection could save your life Talk to your doctor and learn more at savedbythescanorg Music State Music Music Farm Music You consider the opportunities Lipkcom has had what a win would mean for Lenny Auff who looks on from that visitors sideline Green off the inbounds Could not get it to go Foul called on the floor underneath the basket Well see who in fact itll be called on Music Looks like itll be on McCormick which means a couple of free throws are coming up here for Cam K Again Florida State in the double bonus chance here with 39 seconds roughly left here in regulation to trim into the lead Now four fouls against couple of guys on the floor at the moment for Libcom with four fouls He and Cody head each Both guys have done good work today Both in double figures in the scoring column but both are going to have to be especially careful over the last 39 or so seconds Florida State got it off the miss and Watkins will shoot a couple more Wow a massive rebound for Jir Watkins Just going right into that Swiss Army knife roll that weve talked about with him So good on the glass able to hustle in and get the board If youre Florida State the way this guy has operated here in the second half you wouldnt trust anybody more Applause Music 19 points for Jamir Watkins against UNLV in Daytona is his season high And with a free throw make here he will equal that and bring it back to a onescore game Got it Timeout on the floor Boy what a game What a game is right for the team of in the first half 46 points for the Bison It looked like they were well on their way to 80 They they still may eclipse that mark but again this was a team that led by 21 points in the second half Florida State has bit and clawed their way back into this one Threepoint game Theyve been outscored 346 since they had that 21 point lead You mentioned the 80 points Jack Theyve scored 80 or more seven times this season And as we take a look at what theyve done in the first half and the second half there you see 46 32 18 made shots in the first half to 10 here in the second Jack if youre lipkum what are you going to try to draw up here Theres still going to be a 74 second differential even if you milk all 30 seconds off here Yeah you just got to be smart with the ball right Youre not trying to force anything up right now You have the lead Let Florida State come to you It all starts with this inbound though Florida State is aggressive Obviously theyre going to be pressing right now making it difficult You got to get the ball in bounds Get it over the haline Start your offers Second matchup in the last three years between Lipkcom and Florida State The Nullles won it a couple of years ago 9067 over the Bisons You find the most recent matchup before that You have to go back to the 50s when they split a couple back then The nullles lead the alltime series two to one Heavy pressure on the inbounds here by the NLES And Lipkcom gets it into Anderson Anderson back over to Puit and they bring it up into the half court set There is about a sixsecond difference between the shot clock and game clock So the seminals opting not to foul right now Puit no rush to shoot They need to foul if youre Florida State Puit dishing it as blocked by Watkins Here comes Florida State with an opportunity Green Jr for three short and Lipkcom is going to hang on at the touch What a finish Sean Wow Unbelievable
