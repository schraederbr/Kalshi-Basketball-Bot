bayheim if youre youre Jeff Capel youre kind of looking at the landscape saying chance to go 20 in the league going into Christmas break I think youd feel good really good with a win here tonight Applause Syracuse coming off the win versus Cornell the other night 7863 theres a starting five for the orange the same starting five the entire season yeah look who plays a pass Gerard who goes off the mark looking inside for Jesse Edwards well as you expect I mean they want to play through Jesse Edwards early in this game just a bad angle for Joe Gerard post pass heres your starting five for PIV here tonight as the three ball goes up by Nelly Cummings thats now good rebound by Edwards Applause heres Betty Williams Applause now a three ball Greg Elliott thats good and thats on the board thats the biggest difference in Pitt this season versus last they are making almost nine threes a game shooting almost 50 percent of their shots on the year from three they have really improved from behind the arc and Elliott is one of those guys to transferred from Marquette oh youre right about that hes shooting at 70 in threepoint range over the last three games as Syracuse goes inside Edwards and thats where Syracuse does its damage they are at The Rim at the paint are in the paint rather Jesse Edwards and Judah mince off of the bounce Burton pulls up foul line thats rejected and then getting it back with Henson nice feet inside Vincent the back out five in the shot clock for three that one rattles out on the offering from Cummins this is the Freshman Chris Bell for three and thats out of bounds off of Pittsburgh Applause I think Syracuse is looking for more production more consistency from Chris Bell and Benny Williams that forward position if they could get one of those guys to assert themselves here at some point thats when Syracuse goes to another level thats the thing he would tell me earlier is theyre looking for just another guy I need one more guy right foreign how long it kind of takes to figure this zone out here and what you got to do on the offensive end its Federico Federico hits there it because you cant simulate it in practice Syracuse plays a 23 Zone unlike anybody in the country you know Jim Boeheim is the Pioneer of that and I do think Jeff taper was telling us that much today you know theres an adjustment early in these games weve been seeing as the first time nice clamp down there on Edwards pull up Baseline jumpers good by Bell its Jeff Capel about coming here and everybody always says about the Dome you know inside the Dome and he said you know its kind of more about their Zone than the length and who youre playing in the actual environment sometimes well theyve won three of the last four against Syracuse and a big reason why is theyve been patient offensively they they pass faked and theyve taken care of the basketball way off on the three is Henson and weve got a foul into the patch theres mints first foul in Federico Federico the sophomore from Finland for Pittsburgh mints pulls up and hits and got fouled he is so tough and hes taken about nine free throws a game you know he has not shot it well hes only three of 21 from three and teams are short closing out on him I mean they are not coming up and yet he closes that space so well and hes so good at drawing that contact and finishing off balance what a talented freshman particularly when he puts it on the floor and gets it in that orange painted area its really done a nice job as more kind of a scoring point guard in high school nowadays to try to distribute as well and a careerhigh 24 earlier this year this officer Raymond Hinson wow thats kind of what hes done you know Dirty Work What a fine a guy who didnt play has not played in a game the last two years while he was at Iowa State Edwards right down the middle Applause East Gerard on the assist Music long three Henson Music Applause this mince again what a crossover Applause hes tough he really is and hes super confident I mean he just believes he should be cooking Hensons going to come right back for Pittsburgh Syracuse has made their last four field goals here theyll lead it by one timeout coming at the next Wilson we played five minutes so far here in the first half Gerard juggled off his leg and weve got our first time out of the night you got two of the best finishers at The Rim edition of Blake Henson for the Panthers unbelievable person first of all and its a product I mean hes a grownup and its a product of the journey he started his career at Ole Miss two seasons at Iowa State where he did practice but he did not play in games for two years and you know I do a radio show every day called ACC today on Sirius XM and we had him on the on the show Mike and he was talking I asked him I said did you ever think you wouldnt play again did you lose your love for the game he said no I was going over to a Rec Center playing in pickup games and Nelly Cummings hits from deeb and I took one visit I visited Pitt I loved it so much they get they took a shot on me as Jeff cable was telling us today he just has a real appreciation for being back playing the game of basketball I think its probably kind of hard to Fathom you know at that young age and understanding what thats like not being able to do something you love for that long period of time I mean until youre really in it its hard to understand and now hes just one of two players of the ACC averaging over 16 points six and a half board shooting 50 percent from the field as well Music Applause inaugural Jumpman Invitational in Charlotte that is coming up tomorrow Hunter Dickinson and Michigan take on Armando baycot in North Carolina coverage tips off at seven oclock Eastern on ESPN and the app of Forest North Carolina coming up a win over number 23 Ohio State 84 on the season theyre talking a little bit before as that pass intercept that Benny Williams has it about UNC I mean theyve lost some good teams I mean Alabama four overtimes Indiana was number 10 you know how good Virginia Tech is in Iowa State as well theres mints trying to fight through traffic its a traveling violation Applause and thats the one area as as teams start to swarm he can get in there and you know sometimes you got to live to fight another day and you know he had three guys around him and hes I think hes expecting to get fouled twopoint lead for the Panthers Music good rotation over to Henson who messes on the three offensive rebound finishes after the offensive board by Federico Federica what a headsup cut by Henson next time finish Panthers by four Samir Torrance is in number 10 the ball is checked out to the wing and three is off by Williams oh its Cummings for three Pitt is feeling it from the outside to run a 100 run right now and they lead it by seven timeout Orange Applause yo this is scoring early too I mean thats the other thing when youre playing against the Syracuse Zone if you can get some stuff early heres the cut off of the Henson Miss shot he follows his own shot good little find there by fetty Federico and thats early offense right there fail to find Nelly Cummings who steps into one transfer from Colgate and you know thats where thats again that is the big improvement with this pit team they could not shoot the ball into the ocean last season and theyve got a multitude of Shooters its a really old team and they are very old in the back corner you mentioned Cummings coach cable told us earlier today start his career Bowling Green went to Colgate he grew up wanting to go to Pittsburgh I mean he went to games when he was younger hes so grateful hes now at pick and look what hes doing for this team averaging over 10 point points a game been a solid job this season and hes one of the guys thats going to make this team go the graduate student from Midland Pennsylvania so far has six points Pitt is three of nine from threepoint Reigns thats the difference in this one Syracuse is all for three from threepoint race both teams are shooting 50 percent from the field here early Edwards short offensive rebound not there by Malik Brown here come the Panthers again Music Applause and youre gonna be able to knock down those outside shots against the Zone I mean theyre doing it so far here early here it is again Henson relocates in and out offensive board Burton that pass Torrance easy one and thats a killer if youre pit because you get another offensive rebound and you throw it away foreign Applause for three thats good Applause all five starters have scored for Pitt Music and a block Time by Elliott free to shoot Edwards its off by Bell Music Applause Music Vincent good rotation again Cummins shut off on the Baseline finds Henson in the corner for three does it again they are shooting with such confidence Music shooting over 50 percent in this game and thats where you know this turnover to Samir Torrance it kills you because they have found the ability to make shots you turn it over you give Syracuse a run out give them a chance to score but Blake Henson what a start hes having been one of the fights from Allen late in the fourth quarter or early in the fourth to tie the game they won on a 25yard field goal 3229 over Miami this past weekend Music Syracuse gotta get away from it a little bit up the degrees with you come to Sunny Syracuse I wonder if this could be the year for the girls who have to say its over by bail offensive is there by Malik Brown and thats a guy Billy Brown the freshman hes got a ton of upside really high ceiling I think a guy that coach behind is trying to find more minutes for because hes a menace on a glass Music and hes been one of the best rebounders of the Freshman group the six freshmen here heres an alleyoot Federico Federico what a foul What a fine Federico has been for Jeff Capel Music count it John Hughley has been out he was expected to be in all ACC players been out for Pitt but what a find in fetty Federico the transfer Northern Oklahoma the Juco hes he plays vertically hes got tremendous length hes now hes from Finland so hes got a Euro flavor to his game hes a very good passer very unselfish has been good on really both ends Music Edwards on the bucket from Brown now its a three ball Cummings six of 13 from threepoint range to the Panthers Im Gerard from Syracuse they Trail it by 12 here immense Music now Justin Taylor checking in whos also going to take a breather from Pitt and Bell goes down for Syracuse 58 shooting from the field so far from Penn this first half 42 for Syracuse six threes for the Panthers none for the orange so far theyre oh six Music fight for that one thats over the Miss Applause way ahead I think he wanted Edwards but it went off the rim tracked down oh and what a job by Monique Brown throw it off of the Panthers and retain the ball for the orange its a really good play because that possession was almost given away on the Aaron pass from Vince and thats what Malik Brown does you know hes always around the basketball hes not going to give you a whole lot offensively in terms of skill but he around the rim hes active on the glass and you know given the minutes or the The Limited minutes hes played his rebounding rate is through the roof taking a look at a shot clock here so theyll look at that eight minutes and 14 seconds to play and well tell you about the annual NBA on Christmas Day tradition continuing weve got five starstudded games coming up on ESPN and ABC starts off with the Sixers and the Knicks the Lakers and the Mavs how about the Bucks and the Celtics the top two teams of the NBA right now Milwaukee 228 Boston 229 and 8 oclock and 10 35 games at NBA Christmas Day on ESPN and ABC long three in the way its off by Gerard and offensive rebound Edwards Applause Tim Applause again just just fighting to keep these possessions alive and what a finish through conduct there by Taylor Music one thing obviously he and Buddy bayheim look a lot alike I did a double take when you first see him on film but the big big difference is Justin Taylor as a freshman looks like buddy did it as a junior I mean he is physically developed six six 205 and a Charlottesville Virginia with ing Academy talking about number five in white for Syracuse theyre within nine under eight minutes to go first half Hensons back in as you saw heres a three ball Cummings and cannot be stopped so far in this first half hes had four threes foreign trying to count Music Applause Im gonna collapse on Henson three ball on the way Elliott not there Applause lets see what youre saying about Taylor well be watching them right now inside the foul line scores it Applause 10 point game Applause Music Cummings leads all scorers with 12 points for Pittsburgh Hensons got nine off his leg out of bounds we got a timeout Applause 6 26 to play in the first half Panthers lead it by 10 here on the road in Syracuse Music he was at Colgate back here in a pit uniform and you know again that 33 from three a product of a slow start to the season he can shoot he is wired to score what a first half 18 of 37 from threepoint range over the last five games or six games including tonight thats 49 from Beyond the yard Menses fouled he called on Greg Elliott house again and mince is very good at getting himself to the foul line but thats just a foolish play he has defended there if youre Greg Elliott you dont need to stick a hand in there and thatll be foul number six so one more one and one for Syracuse theyre down by 10 minutes for three got it big threepointer first of the ninth for Syracuse one for nine not shot it well its been his Kryptonite teams have defended him that way I mean theyre going under ball screens and giving them a lot of space but its in there I mean hes a guy who made shots in high school Henson tough Fade Away over Edwards rebounded by Brown mens thought about it got it down Edwards oneonone against Henson here comes the double Applause as they try to Brown and he couldnt convert Applause Music foreign Applause these shots to come to them open shots are getting it from a number of different guys you talked about that earlier being the key patience and not turning the ball over and so far so good here for Pat three turnovers each team in this game Cummings for three no good Edwards the ground wants a foul no fall theyre going to get a foul on this one and shooting the three its Gerard and hes gonna head to the free throw line for three free throws another silly foul and I dont blame coach behind there was a foul on the other end they missed it would have been a 11 instead theyre gonna get three free throws here with Gerard Applause Applause oh my God first points of the night for him from the freethrow line thats the other problem with that foul is you allow Gerard to see the ball go in and get the crowd going a little bit here as well 3427 now take away value let me get it to go what a great Applause Music Applause Music Applause burden looking for the Cutters Cummings has it with five to shoot Applause come on here hes doing everything tonight Applause and this is gonna be an offensive foul here in Syracuse going against Edwards hit 36 Syracuse 27th timeout here with a pick coming in theyve won seven of the last eight both teams at eight and four right now and hes trying to say hey whos going to kind of take that step up in conference play and how important these games are right now in November December yeah I mean absolutely you know youre into this this league part of the schedule now and its um I think of you Syracuse the home game against a team that you know at least in the early going here both these teams seemingly on paper look look pretty equal you know it was you would soon be buying for that you know that middle to upper part of the league and this is one of those games if youre Syracuse at home you cant drop it if youre pit here on the road you get this and then at right after break they have Carolina in Pittsburgh so its a nice twogame stretch for them as well Music Applause gonna be home for UNC Virginia and then Clemson for the early part of the month of January for Pittsburgh away thats no good by Elliott Applause yo this is what Federico out of the game this is where Jesse Edwards I mean they got to throw him the ball when hes down there hes got to go to work against Diaz Graham now instead heres mints hes off and Grahams got to rebound give the big fella a touch Federicos on the bench with two fouls let Jesse Edwards eat Music three ball Elliott listen around Graham with the offensive rebound Gonna Take It Away by Mets Applause Benz in the Cummins hes called for the foul he is Crafty and hes very good at that hes got good length I think hes going to be very good at the top of this zone for however long hes had Syracuse you know its an interesting Dynamic he originally committed to to Pitt and obviously had to decommit in order to go to Syracuse yeah coach cable had said that he had watched every single game that he had played thank you its 10 minutes now in the orange and having one outstanding start with his freshman season thats where his his shooting numbers from free are puzzling because hes a good freethrow shooter and hes shooting almost 80 percent its not like a shot is broken its just a confidence thing with Judah mints right now from three tonight three of five one of two from threepoint Reigns two or three at the foul line hes got nine points and that leads Syracuse in scoring we come up on two minutes to play Applause Jorge Diaz Graham Applause gonna be a player The Freshman from Spain here at IMG last year hes got a twin brother on the team 611 but he plays on the wing I mean he is a wing player at that size see if theyre trying to go down to Edwards like youre talking about here at the Syracuse instead of three ball Off the Mark Taylor offensive rebound brown mens for three Applause Monday has the rebound for Pitt Music hes and I believe thats going to be three free throws for him now this one area in the zone where Jesse Edwards has really excelled is coming from that middle part of the zone and contesting those Wing Shooters there just a little too say a little too anxious and so now the big guy for Syracuse has two fouls those are the only two thousand Syracuse has had all half minute 33 to play Music Applause one more so far over two for Jorge Diaz Graham its quadir Copeland is going to come in and also Monier Hima and so Edwards will head to the bench I think thats a smart move theyll want to let him get his third with a minute 33 to play in the first half this is an interesting stretch with coach big bench its this here this goes to 10 got a minute and a half left youve got to keep it within Striking Distance if youre Syracuse and youre playing with mostly bench guys Syracuse has been without a field goal in the last four and a half minutes oh for their last five Im gonna travel there instead gets the basket I mean Pitt is not guarding any of these perimeter guys I mean they are sloughing off of all of those perimeter guys a nice job by Copeland taking up that space is a little bit awkward been able to finish and thats a turnover Applause Music 100 minutes ago in the first half 3931 pick mince Graham got a piece of it Wild Runner outside of bass to Pittsburgh Music so you got an 11 second differential here shot clock in clock in the first half thats going to take that use it or lose it time out here and Coach Cables group well as you said earlier has won three of the last four versus Syracuse an eightpoint lead were back in 30 seconds 78 seconds to go in the first half Mike Cory Chris patola what do you think your so far assessment of what youve seen in the Panthers up by eight I think theyve executed very well I I think Jeff Gable and his staff have have this team prepared to execute against this Zone theyre shooting 52 percent from the field and 42 from threepoint range youre right eight of 19 headset Powers his way inside for two you know again its all over the floor with Hinson I mean hes hit threes in this game he shows you that the ability to move on the interior hes got 11 per pick five seconds left in the first half Torrance got it Applause so they got the bucket at the end of the half but Pittsburgh has been shooting the lights out here tonight eight threepointers in the first half to one for Syracuse their largest lead is 12 they got an eight point lead at the half 4133 halftime reporters that they need to do tonight yeah no in talking to pit staff you know before the game obviously Edwards was a key but but the guy they really wanted to take out was Joe Gerard you know they felt like if Joe Gerard starts making threes it changes the dynamic for shoes Pitt did what they wanted to do they took Joe Girard out of that first half three points and Henson picks up where he left off in the first half its really good execution I mean Pitt has really executed against that zone and gotten a shot that they wanted 13 points for Henson three balls off the mark and Elliott has it and thats been the Kryptonite for Pitt its just silly turnovers I mean thats their seventh turnover and a lot of them just unforced Music thankful though for the hot shooting to be able to build up a lead if that they dont become more of a factor but you know youre right seven turnovers for pick five for Syracuse so far in this game second half is underway foreign Bell oh wow stuff High degree of difficulty and I you know youre still kind of waiting for Jesse Edwards to get a touch Applause Music I make a perimeter shot you know the defense can really pack it in and make make life difficult Applause again Burton this time for three for Pittsburgh all right Music nine for 20 from threepoint range for the Panthers 45 percent Music Flames back up top and thats way off by Bell Music Y in for three that was good Applause they are really sharing the ball too 13 assists and scoring early is nice for three boom the Corey Chris patola back with you here in Syracuse you turn to me during the break youre laughing he said the analysis is starting to become very simple here Mike I mean look I went to West Point but I was by no means a math major but I even I can do this math if the other team is plus 27 from the threepoint line 10 threes to your one you cant win especially when theyre shooting 58 from the field that is the game one of 14 from threepoint range for Syracuse 10 of 21 for Pittsburgh orange back to work Williams counter in the foul well thats one way to get three if you will the hard way and hes got a chance for the foul line you know because Jesse Edwards cant get a touch and you know they try posting Benny Williams there and a good finish through the foul you know one of these other guys Gerard is a nonfactor mens had a good first half hes got a little bit quiet towards the end of that half and we havent heard much well it hasnt been we had a timeout early in this half so theres been much of a second half but you know somebodys got to step up and this is where you wish Jesse Edwards had a little of that dog in him where hed start demanding the basketball in the half court to your point I want to focus on him on the next offensive possession for Syracuse and see whats going on there the foul is on Elliott heres an interception Miss oh and he blows the top and it goes right to Henson Pinson goes alleyu and Federico Federico throws it down you got the bills uh players here in the house thats like an interception run back for a touchdown what youre trying to score cinnamon two the other way and uh one two for Pittsburgh right thats a fourpoint swing Applause yeah you know again simple analysis I mean youre in the Press you get what you want you force a turnover you gotta dunk and somehow Pitt ends up on the other end with a lot not that really any of the bills have had interceptions from doctor so Im not you know theyre having a great season so Josh Allen over there here tonight along with Stefan Diggs and Gabe Davis Dawson Knox in the house Federico Federica was fouled and Pittsburghs got the energy right in this game here Chris I mean obviously either theyre winning theyre playing well but you can just sense it over there and Coach Capel leading the charge here with this group up by 13 I think thats one of the areas where being old and having a lot of new guys is helpful kind of put away last season you can have short memories with what last season was for Penn and you got a lot of guys who have played a lot of basketball who are super confident I mean it started from the jump tonight like they came in firing aggressive and then once you start making shots now all of a sudden it lifts the energy of your team press Edwards picks up his third personal foul what do you do here you got to keep him in yeah I mean you gotta yeah you have to play youre down 14 and its kind of a Breaking Point all right lets see if they get him involved here he is rolling back to the hoop Gerard pulls up and hits instead Applause you talked about him at the break you sell the three points fights for it has it again whips it away circus finally Edwards Applause Music Marcus Torrance now its in Edwards all over him with a double team Torrance for three straight box up against a wellexecuted double by Finn Applause I mean theyre challenging someone else to beat them tonight clamp down and Gerard it hasnt been Edwards now Edwards blocks The Henson three trying to get some energy going here on the defensive end its an area where Edwards has excelled in that zone he has been very good at closing out on Wing Corner shooters Applause and he gets the rebound off a wild shot the shot clock is at three they had to put something up Edwards is open Applause hang on here 10point game Henson fouled and that is going to be Edwards and thats going to be his fourth the problem with press and hes the back guy thats a foul hes got to beg off hes got to be in the game because you need him the problem is Syracuse pressing to try to get themselves back in this and Pitt is getting these two on ones down back theyre breaking the Press theyre going two on one and Jesse Edwards is that back line and you know look you dont want to give up a dunk but with three fouls you almost want him to beg off that so thats the decision do you leave Edwards in the game but you youre youre pressing and hes your back line and just puts him in a tough spot well and he had started to kind of turn it on a little bit in this second half I know youve been asking me to get him a ball and they finally did an easy bucket he had a couple of blocks but you know to your point now four fouls on the bench still 15 36 to go and Syracuse is making a little run too now its a 12point game Music so money or Kima is in if Syracuse 55 ends off Gerard team on hemp Torrance and he is fouled you know as well as Pitt has shot at tonight one of the things that we really havent mentioned is how well theyve defended this year I think Jeff capels done a really nice job with this teams defense you know and again I think its a product of being old you know these guys they understand Concepts you can do scouting from game to game they know Personnel Pitts been a really strong defensive team their guards are good on the ball fetty Federicos been really good in ball screens hes been good at the front of the rim yeah and out of the starters you know hes like the younger classroom I mean hes a sophomore youve got Henson a junior but then you know to your point Cummings graduate student Elliott graduate student Burton graduate student exactly right and Cummings does it again what a night for Cummings Music 17 points hes hit five threepointers hes five of eight Williams trying to counter cant do so and Federicos got the rebound come on Music and you had seven five different players have been a threepointer too so I mean its its going for him tonight Applause Music Syracuse with Williams its kind of the night its been there on the flip side theyre not getting the brakes headset for three Applause minutes weve got Syracuses next game over on the ACC Network for you New Years Eve day against Boston College after the holiday break coverage that one begins at two Eastern CC Network and of course on the ESPN app Music the Beast Beast tomorrow night thats right in Boston taking on Virginia Tech how good is Virginia Tech very good I know you like Padula very good yeah has been the player of the year in the league to this point Applause Brown gets it too all right its not just Badoo though too right I mean the silly and mutts well coached under Young you know about the run of the ACC title last year driving in counts a basket phallus called Burton scores it for the Panthers I mean this is just really good execution again youve got a guard who puts himself right at that ACC logo good entry pass and then he turns faces has manir Hema on him and goes right by him and then what a crafty finish Music Applause on Brown for Syracuse his first Music and its now the largest lead of the night 6244 for pick Gerard for three Applause of the night hes one for five hes got eight points five of those eight here in the second half nine turnovers per pick up over there barking about pass faking you know two years ago when Pitt beat Syracuse in Pittsburgh they pass faked 173 times I mean they have really emphasized using the pass stake against this Zone product today I mean theyve had some silly turnovers that last one being one of them but they have executed against that Copeland knocks down the jumper for Syracuse and now here comes the Press Cummings got it knocked away save from going out mids and hes fouled this press could be disruptive can you bring guys in Off the Bench shell give you a little defensive energy nice play there to just strip the ball by Brown a good find of The Cutting mints and how about Copeland selling out to get that ball back in bounds Federico was called for the foul mens has another as the Orange is down by 13 remember all this is with Edwards on the bench with the four personal fouls Applause Henson trying to take matters into his own hands hes fouled foreign over the top how many times have we seen this against the Press Blake Henson attacking and that is a foul it is get some money on there body and on the arm and they take their back Gerard with his first I think Gerard youve got to know youve got size underneath silly reach play I think right you can see coach Mayhem passed the ball Applause around 6450 Applause Gerard that sound Music 12 minutes to go in this game bad pass in the Henson from Elliott mints the other way Applause Cummins quieting the crown again thats a big shot its getting hot in here take the BandAid off I mean not only is he shooting it well hes six of nine seven of ten from the field of course went to school at Colgate about 50 miles down the road he is feeling it got some of some of his boys in the building you got to feel good for Nelly Cummings and there they are Colgate Nation stand up yeah theyre here tonight in Syracuse watching their former teammate play and hes been outstanding look at that 20 points here tonight 17 for Henson as well for Pittsburgh top scorers in this game and a block Inside by Henson Music rebounding Advantage as well in this one 3118 in favor of pick thank you 32 Henson got free for three again what is happening how they get all these wide open looks here tonight they moved the ball and you know look I mean thats the Zone will give you open shots if you execute but the other thing too Mike like we always talk about how making shots can energize your own defense it can also demoralize the opponent like when when the other team is reigning threes it can just sap your energy and its coming from all over the place tonight yeah and right on cue Henson does it again and you know what if you if you go on the far sideline youve got Jeff Capel of course head coach his brother Jason Capel I remember doing some broadcast were gonna foul before that his brother Jason Capel okay I remember him telling me one time its kind of like to your point he says his liner was the more you make the more you make and its basically kind of what youre saying like youre feeling it youre feeling it you know and thats just kind of like Whats Happening Here with with bedtime wait so Jason Capel came up with that the more you make the more you make thats what he said I remember on one broadcast yeah I mean Im gonna have to ask him about that that seems pretty soon hes great I love the cable family Tim OToole who did a couple tours here for Coach Boeheim also on Jeff cable staff hes got a terrific staff that may have done an outstanding job with this group this year Well Jeff told us earlier when they arrived in 2018 2019 at pet he said you got to bring in people you trust and you know who more do I trust through my brother Jason you know whos been there on the staff with him we were talking earlier about his days back at VCU where he got all those things started there with those great teams back in 2002 to 2006 you know you take a look at you know what hes done and his career as father well his dad God Rest his soul his his dad was a Legend um the city of Fayetteville there in North Carolina and all the stops along the way it is a basket Applause and Im going to tell you here you know the fans are going to say hey but weve Ive seen some of these calls this season about the cylinder right you know youre in the space and I didnt even see the offensive player elbow a guy you know right but if youre in the cylinder if youre in a space its going to be a foul on the defensive player so I mean thats thats the correct call hes right up on him Applause foreign has yet another rebound hes got 12 tonight along with 22 points Music Vincent gathers and he didnt have the anger Edwards back in for Syracuse yeah and he throws it away and now Vince is called for the foul Applause and its free throw time here for the rest of the night for Pittsburgh thats the eighth team foul for Syracuse 913 remaining the lead is 18 foreign Applause line his brother Guillermo Diaz Graham both from Spain the two the two freshmen here for this pit team what do you think I think they have really high ceilings I mean theyre theyre both 611 Guillermos I think they list him at seven feet tall have guard skills you know their numbers dont show you that they can shoot it but but especially Jorge can really shoot it Applause over here Applause Music and they try to get another steal here on the Press timeout is taken by Pittsburgh you know Spartan by Blake Henson so well take a timeout with him eight minutes and 50 seconds left in the contest Panthers by 16 Music welcome back 7357 here and heres your combination tonight Cummings and Henson yeah what a night Blake Hensons hard to deal with you know and he plays that four and so a lot of times hes getting a good match up Applause I mean hes got a double double here tonight hes been all over the glass hes been everywhere you know hes made threes hes posted hes been in the paint hes got 12 rebounds four assists just a a heck of a night youre right been to the free throw line as well four or five there to take to the rack come on Burton Syracuse with plenty of time here mens for a three Edwards offensive rebound and Gerard Hess thats a two Applause Elio Pinson from Elliott heads up they havent turned it over against the Press Pitt has attacked it to score and they have lived off those two on ones down back trying to feed it inside to the post and its taken away Jorge Diaz Grand thats on for Pittsburgh Applause I feel like every time Syracuse is trying to make a little bit of a run here and he gets a crowd into it yeah and you look up and its still a 16point game all right I mean they flirted with single digits for a moment and then Pittsburgh has just kept in a day here and that is going to stay with the Panthers another timeout 7 25 to go and Pittsburghs still well in command of this one itkinson was Pits leading scorer he was their leading rebounder hes been their leader all year hes been their best player and he has been that tonight I mean hes a Swiss army knife does a lot of different things I mean the number of areas where hes catching it and finishing its all over the floor hes got 12 rebounds four assists hes also blocked two shots Music he has had an outstanding start to the season and like Im saying like hes a tough matchup because he hes got that big body at 235 pounds and so but he gets a matchup you know hes guarded by fours and he gets that patch up its an excellent point hes so athletic and hes done so much here tonight in in this season his season and career high is 27 which he had in game one of this year versus first job to stick with this one by Malik Brown for the buckets three ball Cummings I dont even know how they left in that wide open and the offensive rebound by Grant nice job there by mens and Syracuse will have it Applause Mets finishes and count the bucket chance for the threepoint play Applause Vince is really active at the top of that zone hes fantastic hes got a really good anticipation good pair of hands and then we talked a lot in the first half about his ability to finish at the such a crafty finisher Henson has caught for a second personal foul Syracuse need these free throws theyre now 10 of 15 from the freethrow line you know how do they break through this Mark right down 12 they havent been able so much tonight well any comeback starts with stops I mean they have to keep I mean theyve got to be able to keep him from scoring and they just havent been able to do it all night theres another its not threes its penetrating against that zone with a tough finish that was Elliott and minces fouled and theyre going to call it on Cummings free throws coming all right coming up tomorrow and UNC dont miss out on that matchup covers gonna be good at seven oclock Eastern on ESPN and the app got UNC at 84 in the season Michigan at 73 its our college basketball matchup tomorrow at seven on ESPN no you also got to make free throws you want to come back in a game you got to make three things are going to call him for the foul on the clear out that time as mens hit the deck hard Sophies okay Vincents gonna pick up his third foul that is his fourth actually so four on Henson lets go back and look at the last play here Yep theyre taking a look at to see whether thats going to be upgraded to a flagrant one so a regular foul was the call in the court Henson has four Cummings has four and Federico has four so all of a sudden Pittsburgh in this foul trouble situation here and this potentially could get upgraded to a flagrant one personal foul on Henson that would be two shots in the ball for Syracuse if they deem that to be the case 549 to go and its a 13point lead for Pittsburgh as Ron gruver Tim clockerty and Tommy Morrissey are taking a look at the monitor here yeah I think that meets the threshold of an F1 and I mean look he doesnt know that minces face is there but you know you extend that arm and if theres theres contact unnecessary contact to the Head they have typically called that an F1 correct and thats the point we were talking about that earlier intent has nothing to do with it doesnt matter whether you meant to do it or not if it happens its its called and wait and see what they say here and is it egregious enough thats the thing Tommy Morrisons gonna come talk to us about it Music keeping a comment down there you go all right said he didnt seek him out he didnt see him Applause Music Applause 17 foulin pit 11 then since the first looking for his 20th point he has it so all of a sudden hes got 20 Gerards got 10 after only three in the first half the lead is 11 the Press is on the fouls called on Syracuse and Gerard lets see that again yeah I mean I think thats a foul he gets into his legs Cummings had a a jump on the ball I agree with him he undercut thats thats the interesting thing Jeff Capel keeping Federico in Hinson both with four fouls on the floor so hes riding those guys Applause back to a 13point lead by 20 252 with 10 45 remaining miss hoists it up hes fouled again and he just does an awesome job at creating and drawing contact which he does yet again Applause you think its just the kind of two schools I thought there hey lets just keep them in lets try to keep our lead lets preserve it as long as we can or if you take him out all of a sudden they make a comeback you know what I mean so he goes with the first part and now Federicos done yeah I think he comes down to knowing your guys I mean I I think he you know you know if youre Jeff cable like you said you got a doubledigit lead you know youre playing this to get this down to Applause oh God you take him out you get to that TV time back in thank you lets go get in another minute and a half because were still up five and a half to go the lead is 11 half for the last five and a half minutes Applause shot clock get it inside Burtons rejected Grahams got it hes rejected by Edwards and its a shot clock violation Applause its big time what a block here by Copeland to come from that bottom Wing position and then the return block by Jesse Edwards Applause to cut this to single digits Copeland crossover step back three foul that he got him talk about this exchange for patio Copeland all right lock on one end and a made three and one on the other and he converts the free throw and its a seven point game a fourpoint play to cut it to single digits and here comes Burton for Hinson got it back Applause and were gonna foul Applause Graham got hit on the head crowd wanted to travel before that crazy sequence Graham is shaken out Applause yeah thats a travel they missed the travel and that is a foul so they got the second call they missed the first yeah thats a tough one right I agree with you I think kind of a trap s caught to the Head so thats a bang bang play for sure now Graham is at the line and he has a wanted or double bonus so hes got two free throws here and its 8072 Applause Jorge Diaz Graham three of six in the freethrow line for Pitt tonight make it 47 Applause watching the crowd on their feet here tonight inside the dome in Syracuse Gerard back to mince for three and Elliott has it Music thats a shot Pitts been willing to live with theyre giving Judah Mitch that shot Applause eight to shoot Cummins bounces it to Burton needs to put it up and does rebound by Grant and 20 on the shot clock Applause Applause Inside by Edwards defensive stand by Syracuse mens for Edwards double team in there and its knocked out of bounds same with Syracuse Brown had a chance at it and itll be orange ball when we come back 3 32 remaining its a 98 over the last couple minutes couple turnovers in that zone but its really been the rim protection Applause shots at that basket blocked theres that Copeland block followed up by Edward Syracuse six in the country this year and blocked percentage so Mike its been a strength and it has come alive here over the last couple minutes it really has eight to three in blocks eight to three in steals theyve cut the lead finally in a single digits here 8172 and they got both teams in the double bonus possession arrow favors Syracuse if we get a jump remember they have only one timeout remaining hit also one timeout now at this point heres a three ball Copeland in and out Hinson now the rebound for the moment it got tapped the Cummins big possession out of a timeout Music stretching the Zone here a little bit extending it no field goals in the last three minutes and 20 seconds now for pick Applause and that was good defense by Brown on the closeout Applause all right Mintz works it into Edwards Applause offensive board Edwards gets it back hes blocked by Graham shot clock still at 10 Applause mids pulls up got it Applause shots foreign Applause game two minutes remaining Grands Pass intercepted Down Low by Brown and knock it away Applause Gerard for three foreign Applause ball Copeland knocked it out Gerard with 10 points in his second half and Jeff Capel is trying hes hes only got one timeouts whos trying to keep it in pocket they need to calm down I mean this defense from Syracuse has been so disruptive and the scoring drought continues here theyre over their last six from the field Applause Burton Elliott Applause blocked by Copeland in a foul Applause a Copeland in there has changed Syracuses defense Applause that and the two guards up top Gerard and Mintz have been very active their hands been very disruptive Copeland comes over here and I mean thats going to be called a foul you know he comes down with his arms a little bit I thought he met him but those hands coming down its a foul a lot of contact too Bonnie contact as well foreign trying to make it a sixpoint game he does this is a big possession here if youre Syracuse youve got to come away with points here Music Applause Gerard finds Brown Powers his way in hes fouled and has a chance to get the two here at the line and the clock stopped with one minute remaining those freshmen Ill tell you what those freshmen for Syracuse Copeland and brown Off the Bench have made an impact obviously Mintz has been tough boy the second conference game of the season for both teams doesnt feel like that does it the line it really is Syracuse another one cope with the offensive rebound count it foreign point game Graham Cross Court for Henson Applause Elliott did he step out he did yeah this is where Pitt doesnt really have a point guard you know Nellie Cummins is not a point guard and nobody to come get the ball and calm this team down and yeah I mean hes out of bounds good call by the official pit is just flustered they are trying to hang on here on this one theyve led by as many as 20 that was at 10 45 remaining it was 7252 Gerard for three oh no way one point game 30 seconds left 19 to shoot for Pittsburgh Elliotts got it foreign that is an offensive and again Jeff Capel keeping the timeout in his pocket decided to let his team play through that there and thats a good call thats a really good take there by Judah Mintz slides his feet stays in legal guarding position the off arm there by Burton sells the call Applause wow how about Joe Gerard had three at the half and we said he was going to have to have a big second half hes got 16 and you know look youre playing from behind and those shoot those shots come a little bit more Loosely you could kind of Let it Fly wow some big ones you had talked about it at the half they were playing solid defense it was one of their keys and points to emphasis he was over three from the field with three total points and you just said it now hes got 16 13 in the second half hes hit three threes and now its Syracuse possession down by one with 174 what do you got Chris I think he got Joe Gerard I mean at the very least you get him coming off and then you know theyve been able to hit if its Copeland if its brown somebody at that foul line area and honestly their best offense has been just getting the ball up on the glass and allowing those guys to go get the offensive rebound theyve had 15 second chance points in this game to your point right there its very well taken only four for Pittsburgh and if your pet coming out of this time out here whats got to be going through your mind after youve really LED comfortably this entire game and now youre in danger of losing it hes down to getting a stop comes down to possessing the defensive rebound and again they have a they have a timeout in their pocket you know that going in away Gerard goes the way this team goes especially here in this second half its 8382 Pittsburgh by one they have one time out remain in Syracuse is out of timeouts orange possession 15 seconds here we go shoot a mess 24 tonight for the orange to shoot oh its intercepted by Henson he wanted to go down to Edwards and Hinson picks it off and hes fouled and read it the whole way canson read it the whole way and he was shading over Music and Edwards has fouled out Applause Rock Dave Davis and Stefan Dix and the Buffalo Bills theyre trying to diagram something over there listen Applause this ones got to go to you dont have a timeout if youre Syracuse this has got to put the ball in June them into his hands hes got to attack the rim get it up on the glass Jeff Gable just said that Tim clockerty he makes us a lot of timeout all right so Pittsburgh has used their final timeout they lead by two six seconds remaining Here We Go Again Chris you know when you play and weve seen this with Syracuse man when they play from behind they throw on that press and when youre pit youre almost playing not to lose when youre up that much youre playing not to lose they got a little casual with the ball and all of a sudden now Syracuse has momentum and we said coming in the one thing Pitt wanted to do with Syracuse is take Joe Gerard out of the game they said if he starts making threes it changes the dynamic and that is exactly whats happened over the last 10 minutes of this half Joe Gerard making shots has changed the dynamic those two freshmen Brown and Copeland off the bench has changed the dynamic it brought a different energy to this Syracuse team and right now this comes down to Judah Mintz with the ball in his hands doing his creation doing what he does best getting into the paint get that ball up on the glass and you gotta have everybody in Syracuse from Syracuse attacking the offensive glass so mens who had nine points for the first half 15 here in the second half been 24 for the game thats a team High Henson with 25 for Pittsburgh thats the lead all scorers in this game six seconds to go here we go Syracuse ball down by two no timeouts remaining for either team Mintz has got it Miss for three Copeland and a chance at it it doesnt go and thats the end of the game and Pittsburgh hangs on 8482 and have defeated the orange here in Syracuse tonight that cant be the shot you want I mean if youre due to Manson Pitt does a nice job give them credit they corralled the ball they knew it was going to be minced theyve got two guys here just making life hard but you got to find an angle and youve got to get that get put your head down and get that thing into the pain and just not enough time for the offensive rebound Pittsburgh has won four of the last five versus Syracuse in the last two out of three here in the dome big win for them theyve won eight of their last nine
