move on the drop step by Tyron Lindsay and welcome those of you along the ACC networks to WinstonSalem North Carolina were at the Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum on this Veterans Day with Corey Alexander Im Doug Sherman glad you can be with us here for the first minute and a half with the Demon Deacons with a onepoint early lead on the threepoint play by Andrew Carr this is a rare test at least this season in the first week of the regular season between a couple of power conference schools it absolutely is one of the first Power conference matchups that weve seen this early season so far and again a good one with first year coach Mike White well first year at Georgia coming on the road and taking on the way for us seemed to hit a great year last year Steve Forbes looking to continue to build on the culture here in WinstonSalem and with karaoke window for the bucket and the fouls committed by Terry Roberts while shooting the three ball itll send Tyree Appleby to the line theres the first year head coach of the Bulldogs Mike White former Ole Miss guard graduated in 99 and he had a good run at Florida but he decided to leave Gainesville go to Athens and start new in the SEC and go to the Rival so its going to be interesting for Mike White this year especially when he has to go down to the odome to take on the Florida Gators but you know Mike White is happy with his decision to make the move to Georgia Georgia hes got a great group right now he loves the team that hes coaching and it feels almost important for them to win this season not just waiting and building and for the future but important for them to win this season my big question is what does he and his family do with all of that orange and blue Gear with the gator on it well I wont say burn it I will say that there are many people that can use those those clothes in the city of Gainesville Florida so Im sure there are many places they can donate wide open look of window rattles out Ansel him got a hand on it but here comes Tyree Appleby former Cleveland State star gets denied on the drive by Mark drez McBride we talked with Kyrie Appleby pregame who played the last two seasons under Mike White at Florida we asked him who has the advantage him having coached you or you having played for him he looked at us with a right smile and simply said I got the advantage I know Mike White I know him inside and out yeah I like the way Tyree Appleby carries himself young man from Jacksonville Arkansas whos a grad transfer pass inside off of the fingertips of Davion Bradford give it back to the Bulldogs Mike White has himself nine transfers including seven firstyear transfers on his roster a couple of freshmen as well so its an almost completely reworked lineup in Athens this year it really is but he did mention that there was not a lot of success at Georgia last season so they have a lot of work to do nice looking move Inside by Braylon Bridges right now Wake Forest going to guard Bridges mantoman but when you see guys get looks like that early you got to think about how were going to double team if they kick if they get going to Flying Without Matthew Alexander Moncrief tonight because of the ankle injury he sustained to the win Monday over Western Carolina Applause a lot of contact the whistle comes on the shot with three on the timer thats Mark played by Damian Williamson attacking the basket even though the shot clock is going down you dont have to settle for the jumper there is the native of Lone Tree Iowa 57yearold Steve Forbes in his third season as head coach of the Demon Deacons last years ACC Coach of the Year great conversation with him earlier today we probably talked with Coach forums for the first 30 minutes of their shoot around he just kind of hung out with us she eventually said well let me go be a head coach and walk away but great conversation with him talking about the state of college basketball the program here in WinstonSalem and Wake Forest and everything that they have going on the coach Forbes is excited about this opportunity and excited about this team knowing that the success they had last year and trying to use that to build this program to where he wants to see it Go and they went 25 and 10 a year ago and were disappointed not to get into the NCAA tournament but they didnt mope their way into the NIT they made it all the way to the NIT quarterfinals and thats what you have to do when youre building a program and Advantage taking advantage of opportunities like that when you get into the NIT another nice bucket by Braylon Bridges and Braylon Bridges is showing that he can be a force in the post and right now Mike White continuing to feed him down there Wake Forest may not be able to guard him oneonone throughout this game well Bridges started all 32 games a year ago the only Bulldog to do so under Tom crean but with a new coach come changes in starting assignments and rotation assignments and so I wonder with oquinda who like I said averaged over 18 points per game during conference play last year in Grayling Bridges whos coming off the bench but what I loved was Mike White running over to pick up Tyree Appleby who runs it to the scoring table those two guys of course we talked about their history and Applebee not only he played for Mike White but his brother played for Mike White at Louisiana Tech back in the day yeah tyrees older brother Raheem played at Louisiana Tech for Mike White and was First Team allconfidence USA 1700 career points so a lot of history between the Applebees and Mike White I was gonna say so now quindo hes got to take a new role Bridges has to take a new role and I would think for a coach in the position of Mike White thats not necessarily an easy thing to do to reprogram these guys no its absolutely not especially for guys whove had success I mean you talk about a window whos had success hes a preseason all SEC performer and you talk about a guy like that that does step into a new role in a new system where hes had success before oftentimes that could be difficult but Mike White talked about how his guys have been very receptive they stepped up and at and he was very honest with them in rerecruiting many of them to stay in this program and he wasnt sure Carrio was going to stay went into the portal rerecruited him and since that time coach white tells us that he has honest challenging conversations every day trying to build the role that Oquendo needs to play for this team to win more basketball games this year and thats the only thing you can ask from the coach oh the spin and a chance for three for Williamson Music speaking of having history with coaches David Williamson played for Steve Forbes in East Tennessee State and he loved him so much he bought him to wake and its been beneficial as you see the beautiful move with the Finish oh friends getting acquainted here at the Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum is Tyree Appleby goes to the ground but who is it his former coach Mike White coming to his rescue to help him up off the floor the smile from Tyree who says that he knows Mike White better than anyone great to see these guys still having a great relationship even though theyre on both sides of the team and you know for as accomplished as Tyree Appleby has been at Cleveland State and then if Florida under coach white here at Wake Forest and as we mentioned his older brother Raheem was a 1700 Point scorer at Louisiana Tech they got nothing on their big sister Shakila is a Grambling State Legend 2 000 points 900 rebounds 600 assists 480 steals two quadruple doubles so you know what she tells them on Thanksgiving yeah what you guys doing thats cute when youve got 2K come on man along with 900 rebounds 600 assists almost 500 steals come on so Ill read you a little 1550 thats cute 108 Wake Forest with the early lead with Corey Alexander on Doug Sherman Georgia turns it over with the steal damari Monsanto wake beat Fairfield on Monday and its opener 7159 Trio of players score 14 that is the fourth turnover already tonight for Wake Forest and thats trying to hit a home run in comparison taking the singles if you swing that to the outside Damian Williamson has a good look at a three but trying to pinpoint it ends up in a turnover in and out for jabri abdur Rahim the former Virginia Cavalier thats my guy my young fella right now looking very confident in his Georgia uniform Mike White talked about him if he defends hell be one of the best players on the floor he can score with the best of them I was surprised debris seemed genuinely happy to see it today will you make a surprise Here Comes Justin Hill with the basketball Applause pulse gives it back hill a little strong on the three rebounds Buck four out of bounds off of the Bulldogs Abdul Rahim the last baton but thats another one of jabrice Prince offensive rebound he had two offensive rebounds last time out and as a score he knows has a knack to get into the basketball and oftentimes coming up with those getting extra opportunities of course you want to get extra opportunities for yourself so thats one of the reasons why hes in great office rebound he loves to score points wait for the twopoint lead and the basketball is the Bulldogs have gone cold nearly three minutes since their last point Wick just keeps coming Damien Williamson from the corner now you see why that was such a bad play earlier to not swing it to David Williamson on the other side when hes over 43 on the wing get the basketball into this young mans hands he knows what to do with it one of the biggest mistakes is helping on ball side UC too far away from David Williamson he has a quick trigger you got to be there on the catch not giving him that easy look even though its not that easy its easy for Damian Im not sure if you make that shot are you kidding me are you kidding me I gotta show you some pictures of me at Boston Garden oh yeah Ive seen it you keep your picture Applause Falcon to be called on Oquendo getting back to try and stop Cameron Hildreth on the run out Lake Forest coming up with the turnovers getting out in transition nice ball movement once again and Hildreth a shooter getting the opportunity to get to the free throw line put points on the board early 14 points for him coming off the bench in the opener versus Fairfield and you know hes one of those young men that you can see having a big impact for Coach Steve Forbes in the rotation this season well I always love to find out the origin stories in Recruitment and we asked coach Forbes about Cameron Hildreth and apparently Camerons father Daniel played throw ball in England for Steve Forbes good friend now the head coach of the Toronto Raptors Nick neerson that is what consummated that friendship yeah I mean again youve got guys like Nick nurse that youre talking to in a regular basis thats a pretty good uh coaching Circle to be a part of capital of Iowa guys who came up together another Georgia turnover turns into more points for Williamson tell you what the Bulldogs turned it over 21 times on Monday and got lucky to win that game against Western Carolina they keep turning it over like this theyre not going to win David Williamson also scored 14 up against Fairfield but didnt have a very good shooting day now hes off to a much better start offensively in this one and right now you can see this game means a lot twoway course when you think about it now mind you youre playing against an SEC opponent last season Wake Forest didnt play the toughest of nonconfer schedules but they got off to a great start I believe it 111 and so this year Steve Forbes has challenged his team by creating a much greater schedule but I believe that his players understand that and these are guys who didnt get into the NCAA tournament when you think about a guy like David Wilson he didnt get to the NCAA tournament a year ago and he wants that opportunity he knows that these are games they have to win to get to them coach Forbes told us you know when they scheduled this game he thought hed have Jake laravey event now he didnt anticipate that he would turn into a first round draft pick he knew a Lotus Williams the ACC player of the year was going to be gone but as you know Corey when coaches are building their schedule for the next year they dont want to over schedule based on their own roster and those schedules are normally done in the spring of the following year and so at that point Jacob ravia was still in the NBA draft process and could have easily come back to school but I like the fact that Coach George is taking on this type of challenge early step back by monsantos no good Applause the force is different you see monsantos coming up with the Steal Applause Music finally to his feet curio oquindo after having committed the fifth Georgia turnover in the last five minutes I tell you what monsantos is a great guy though you see he does a great job here coming up with the strip but the issue is as his Georgia opponent is on the floor Monsanto stays in the backcourt with him better than me Dougie fresh thats a five or four I might get a look out of that one I gotta run down Ill check on him on the way back there avian Williamson the games leading scorer sits down with 10 points but you see right now Georgia the five turnover was already that was a problem for them and their Monday win against West Carolina at 21 turnovers for Western Carolina only turn those into 16 points another near turn over there Applebee couldnt quite get his hands on shot clock down to two Oquendo Houston air ball the Georgia offense has completely stalled out foreign busts of delight of the defense of the Demon Deacons here holding a seven point lead and Lawrence Jones Veteran Memorial Coliseum here on Veterans Day it is a homecoming game it went to sell a product getting out in the transition putting people in the spin cycle knocking down the difficult three from the corner and then attacking in transition David Wilson off to a great start here tonight yeah hes well on his way to challenging his career high which came actually on senior night last spring when he put 28 on North Carolina State he is back now for his graduate year out of WinstonSalem prep he had himself as you mentioned Corey a good opening night with the 14 points and and they need that sort of production out of him this year they really do and right now Doug you know exactly what hes thinking I got it rolling why am I sitting here on this coach Ford the time for me to go back see thats the thing when you got it rolling you keep stay in the game and when you dont have it rolling you got to stay in the game to get it though exactly Appleby with the air ball and it goes back over to Georgia Bobby Clinton has come into the ball game hes the fourstar freshman from Sweden for that each who they are very high a couple of true freshmen also with Zach Keller who they think both have high ceilings in this program and a lot of international flavor to this Wake Forest team when you think about many of the guys up front are from Europe swish Justin Hill gets the Bulldogs back on the board after going five and a half minutes between field goals welcome sight possessed Hill to knock down the three Mike White happy to see the basketball go through the hoop he knows there is not a lid on it Applause is now two for three on the year so hes shooting 67 percent he doesnt have to talk about that he banked that in Im about to say Im taking it off I know the score official score keeper wont but not from the top of the key were not going with that hes got to make a clean one now to make me a believer Applause rebound by Cameron hildus who brings it up turns it back over to the dawn now Williamson comes back in how quickly does he get his shot off oh I mean Im thinking the first possession has got to be run for you right maybe we give them one to one back up a little bit but second possession we got to go to my man David all right keep an eye on number four in white Music another rebound see one right here one right here okay oh hes got the big he had the mismatch I like the way David is playing Team Basketball Dougie Ill be looking for one here Geeks turn it over its used to the body by Jackson Eder Applause good look and a slam by Bradford but I love the play by Clinton getting into the painted area the interior passing is dropping it off that was all set up one big foula to another but the big fella putting it on the floor making plays off the bounce and when you say big fella the former Kansas State Wildcats 7 feet 270 pounds would you take that charge first off I dont take charges from guy smaller to me so Im not taking a charge but think look at this that is big on big action right there and UC the finish and again when the basket comes down that far after a dunk yeah yeah its a lot of power behind that but youre right Bobby Clinton a 69 freshman with the dry the dish nine minutes remaining first half here at the Joel theres our guy Williamson nothing with him get my man the ball thats what Im talking about I like it Tyree Appleby recognizing the hot guy on the court right now after he does a great job getting downhill and finding David in the corner for the easy three that was much easier to know Applause Richards getting more run tonight than Ansel him so far he turns it over here comes Williamson again thats out of the basket Applause its a 10point lead and we talked to Mike White earlier about the turnovers and he said I dont want to bog my guys down and have them thinking about it while theyre playing weve handled the basketball well in our scrimmages but we cant do that here tonight if we turn it over against Wake Forest well get beat by 20 and right now turnovers have been an issue and have led to a 12 point Wake Forest lead so far and I correct myself its now 12 point lead dont worry about Syracuse its all right we knock a hold it against you thats all right well since that Justin Hill three Corey wake has gone off on another 70 run Another Empty trip for the Bulldogs right now you might want to pick David Williamson up early balls knocked out of bounds Bradford had a much smaller man on him he put the ball down and it got knocked out of bounds by Edgar but we talked about how much these games mean to David Williamson you can tell it means a lot to Tyreke as well playing against Mike White his former coach and coaches other coaches on their staff at UC hes got a little extra juice early in this I like the sauce on that play I wish hed been able to get his teammate to finish heres Williamson Elites all scores with 15 points still running offense gotta respect not me offensive foul against Clinton and there is Jackson Etter the senior from Woodstock Georgia throwing his body in there again the backcourt for the Demon Deacons has been exceptional early Tyree Appleby with the nice bond to the hot man David Williamson three ball Corner pop a year ago the narrative around many parts of college basketball but it was a down year in the ACC only five teams made it to the NCAA tournament Even though three of those five made it to the elite eight two made it to the final four Wake Forest was on the outside looking in and the numbers and I dont youve mentioned Im a Syracuse guy the numbers are Beyond me but the reality is the ACC needs to win more games like this one in November and December where they are beating other power conference opponents agreed wholeheartedly but this Wake Forest team should have been an NCAA tournament last year they went on the road got a win at Virginia they beat North Carolina a runnerup National Championship runner up on this court last year and beat them convincingly and they did not get quadrant one win for either of those if you kick quad 1 wins with those theyre in the tournament and so thats the thing you know a lot of that happens because the ACC teams last year many of them young and with a lot of new faces struggle in November and so when you struggle in November and it was held against them in March even though all those teams for the most part got better as the season goes along thats one of the things that the ACC does for you because its such a great conference its iron sharpens iron teams get better because you play against so many different styles throughout the season Williamson has had the hot hand a rare Miss for him long rebound comes to the Bulldogs and Terry Roberts I like the other Syracuse guys quote hows that he had some pointed words as Coach Boeheim has been known to do mainly about the Big Ten Conference yeah we dont need to repeat him no people who want to know at home they can look them up themselves thats why my guy coach behind puts it on record hes not getting fired you and I could be dismissed exactly right now Mike White trying to figure out how they can score where they can get points from against this Wake Forest defense and again give away 4C a lot of credit because thats a tough shot you know and when you force teams to have to make tough shots against your defense coach Schwarz will live with that well Terry Roberts can score First Team all MVC a year ago at Bradley left Peoria to move to Athens the bottle Jam by Bradford so youre not taking a charge on that no charges but what I do like is the fact that Bradford follows that up but for Georgia someone has to go in if a shot blocker goes to go get the shot someone has to get in there to take the big guy off the glass and help the helper on that possession long rebound to Applebees hes still looking for his first field goal tonight there comes on the drive he was just waiting for you to say that and right now Mike White not happy and it wasnt as though transitioned they didnt get back defensively no one just stopped the basketball allowing Appleby to get to an easy bucket his first bucket of the day but to build the lead to 14 for the diva d Damian Williamson and the Demon Deacons with the 14point lead Corey what do you think the ceiling is for this Wake Forest team we showed already last year the huge jump they made but its a completely new roster this year its a completely new roster but theyve got veteran backcourt players theyve got size up front to compete in the league theyve got shooting I believe that this is a top half and so when you think about that agency with 15 mens basketball teams you have to be in that top eight to be in their top half I think they are top 18 they were preseason pick ninth but Ive got a lot of trusted team Forbes in his coaching abilities I think this team is a better team than not Terry Roberts get right back up after the hard fall to the floor you know at our Advanced age now youre not even 50 yet dont yet dont grow up your Advanced age then when you see something like that does it hurt you just think about wow oh he jumped and felt like that right now yeah I mean to be young in this athletic such a blessing for these young men Im not sure I know at that age I didnt I definitely took it for granted yeah Im sure many of them do as well Applause shot clock running down and so you got to Chuck it up another Miss by McBride but thats another great defensive stand by weight Williamson finds the cutter and again its the big man who is fouled by Holt but you see the way wake is sharing the basketball as hot as David Williamson has been he turns down to three drives it to the basket and gives it up even though hes got it going hes still looking to make the right play for the team two shots here is Bradford whos got a couple of dunks so far in the ball game he was originally a fourstar recruit out of Melville High School in St Louis opted to go to Manhattan Kansas to play for the Wildcats and his freshman year 62 percent he made from the floor second highest in Kansas State history nobody should ever shoot at a high of a percentage when youre seven feet 270 I dont care shoot threes if youre that hot keep shooting well hes putting together a nice ball game here tonight on Veterans Day in WinstonSalem hell take a break after the free throws Applause and thats one of the things you know coach Forbes talked to us about they have three centers that theyre going to play theyre going to mix it up and see which one of them is playing this afternoon back given tonight investors take down gets the most minutes but its a luxury to have three guys that he trusted he can put out there in that spot and at the very least youre giving up 15 fouls out of that position yes shouldnt be anything easy around the basket most places dont have three guys where theyre going to trust to put it and put in game Applause Oquendo has it Rim out the leading scorer for the Bulldogs coming back from a year ago and he scored 18 in their opener still has only two tonight for the dog but thats it byproduct of when a team is guarding well because even when the opponents best scores get easy looks theyre thinking about the defense and where its coming from but oftentimes they dont get those looks to go down and right now wake doing a great job defending not just with everything theyre doing when the offensive on the floor defending very well which is starting to creep into the minds of the bulldog Corey heres one of the bigs youre talking about 610 freshman Zach Keller for Highlands Ranch Colorado he was a fourstar recruit one of those guys coach Forbes is comfortable throwing out there yeah and Coach Forbes talked to us about making sure that he got his young guys Menace early in the season to get their confidence going but also to make sure they know theyre a part of this and theyre going to be needed as the season goes along Bulldogs turn it over again on the steer Keller and Keller on the other hand missed the layup able to get it back Applause Andrew Carm is fired on the three whats the important right now even though Keller missed the layup for Coach Forbes to keep him in the game let him keep playing dont take him out for that mistake because thats how players lose confidence and right now you keep him in the game give them let them get a couple more reps on the floor hopefully he gets another opportunity and gets it to go down Tyron Lindsay with Five Points he was held scoreless in 21 minutes of the opener against Western Carolina Applause under four minutes to go in the first half Applause by Appleby and he connects I can tell you right now Doug E fresh nothing feels better for Tyree Appleby than to make that shot in front of it in front of Mike White and remember he airballed a three earlier in the game so it was good for him to see that one go down hes got seven points Williamson leads all scores for Wake with 15 points of a dick last to touch was Monsanto and so the Bulldogs will have it when we come back and when we come back we will have a salute to the veterans here on Veterans utmost respect for Mr Lawrence Joel everything that he did for our country and especially as a black man representing the United States of America learned a lot about him actually in the AfricanAmerican museum in Washington DC I didnt really until then I didnt know that he was black and it was I was interested to see that and I played in this building knew it was named it never knew the history of it until then you know tremendous amount of respect well Mr Joel was the first living black man to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor and the first soldier from WinstonSalem so on it very cool stuff 3419 with Corey Alexander Im Doug Sherman its been all Demon Deacons Georgia LED briefly from an 87 score but since that time its been all deep we talked about Tyree hapsby and his scoring the young man came into the season with over 500 assists in his career so we got to talk about his passing as well Bradfords block gets Williamson at the other end had it knocked away here comes Georgia back the other way all right foreign Music Bridges came off the bench in the pivot for Georgia but has gotten the majority of playing time in place of Frank Ancilla you see the put back by Holt and thats kind of the way Mike White told us today is going to go about the five position for the Bulldogs this year well take a break with Timeout on the floor wait up 13 college basketball season were so glad youre with us here in WinstonSalem North Carolina the ACC leading the SEC at the moment 3421 Wake Forest in Georgia they decided hey lets get together play a power conference game and test ourselves before we really jump into the deep end of the pool I think that was a theme from both coaches to see what they have as we see Georgia coming out in the zone defensively stretching it but Tyree Appleby continues to get inside the painted area late ticket out was Frank anselom and the Demon Deacons made him pay well Andrew Carr the Junior from Westchester PA he might be 610 but he can shoot that shot I dont like Damian Williamson rolling around on the floor like that glad to see him up with a nice fine as you mentioned it handsome late to get out there to cover Carr Carr is capable of very capable threepoint shooter actually LED Delaware a threepoint shooting last season thats a big he was ninth in the country last year a twopointer overall field goal percentage 56 and as you said very proficient from beyond the line as well made the uh CAA alltournament team helping the Blue Hens reach last years NCAA tournament thats another theme with both of these coaches with the transfers who theyve brought on they want to get guys who have been in winning programs have been to the NCAA tournament and that helps throughout the locker room because if youve got guys whove been there before that helps guys who are young and also guys who have not because they understand whats necessary what it takes to be able to win at a level to make it thats the second time Bradfords really gotten off the ground to contest this time though he picks up the foul Ill tell you what it was a lot of basketball up top Im not sure if there was body underneath but that looks like a very good block from that angle as though Bradford got a lot of basketball Mike White likes to call him he sure does new Bulldog six transfers three freshmen rolls still being defined and thats the case even if you have everybody coming back because every year the team is different regardless of whether the roster is the same or not I mean people grow players grow teams change and I think thats the case really when you look at the I mean we call it power five but thats not really it in basketball but when you look at the major conference schools because they are bringing in so many transfers because there arent so many new faces in comparison to many of the mid majors in low Majors who have their line of returning theyre playing better basketball in November and so the power power schools all the time takes some love early but as they get to play more games and develop that chemistry thats why those teams get better as the season goes along great defense by Hildreth to cut off the Baseline ball goes out of bounds back over to the Demon Deacons final minute 10 of the first half here at the Joel you have to be almost lost it off his hip still with the dribble nice looking side and the layup made by Bobby Clinton weve seen a lot of very good passing from The Bigs from Wake interior passing getting into paying the air sharing the basketball between the two big guys with another highlow situation that they take advantage of and that was Andrew Starr with the assist just Walling up Clinton with a blocked shot hildred with the Euro Step Hayes from England why not the sophomore from Worthing England makes it a 20point bowl game two seconds one second foul at the buzzer thatll send Georgia to the freethrow line and the person is Chiron Lindsay Applause Cameron Hills is getting out in transition the Euro to the opposite side thats a move you work on in your skill sessions Dougie fresh that you might be able to still do that one well at least it gets a comb not a good night not in real action but thats one you work on in your skill sessions against the cone this that another hell just bringing it out into the game now Hildreth playing a bigger role this year had a careerhigh 14 points in the opener against Fairfield having a good first half here as are the Deep they will head to the locker room with a 19point lead strong performance for Wake Forest early defensively turning those turnovers into points on the other end Georgia with 10 turnovers leading to 12 points for the degree over Fairfield meanwhile Georgia turned it over 21 times in their opener and that Trend unfortunately for the dogs is continuing here tonight yeah those 10 turnovers have already led to 12 points for Wake Forest and getting out of transition God wait for us going early open up the basket for them to start making shots and they did that at a higher cliff good step through by Ty es Mike White switching principally right now so that puts a lot of onus on guys to be able to make individual plays that time Tyree after getting the job done Gary Roberts on the spin move hes called for the offensive foul well back home in New York City Terry Roberts is known as Mr 40 playing at Dykeman Park on West 204th Street in Manhattan Lincoln Park in Queens Gersh park in Brooklyn and his hometown Mack Park in Suffolk County Long Island in Amityville apparently he would would go for 40 so easily is Mr Ford oh yeah yeah I like it I figured youd like that well you know everybody can get 40 Im a fan oh nice five car tees it up Ill tell you Im impressed with Applebees playmaking right now I know he can score the basketball but he is Diamond out here tonight still not as good as his sister Chicago no this is true thats a nice bucket right there they needed bucket another three only the third threepoint field goal made for Georgia in this first points scored by the north Texas transfer ardrez McBride helped Conference USA to the NCAA tournament a couple of years ago space Davion Bradford now with seven points lets just say the deviants have been good Applause and there is a difference between we gotta I gotta be more careful its Damian Williamson and Davion Bradford oh yeah yeah yeah okay but Davion coming up with those seven points hes a school meal or something dude look at the five that is a beautiful pass you have to make that through 18 points for Williamson off the sweet dish Cross Court into the corner by Appleby and thats the fifth assist by Appleby right now hes working on a double double but right now Wake Forest seems to be very comfortable with the basketball and the hands of apple and you see the movement away from the ball and the recognition the nice hook pass over the top Williamson gives the basketball up relocates to the corner now he knows exactly where hes going wait from the gets there takes care of business again there are two of the transfers to Wake Forest Damian Williamson same spot Applause has been here while Appleby is new this year Braylon Bridges lost the dribble tell you what Steve Forbes done a great job look at another fine but Steve Forbes done a great job of going out and getting transferred that fit into what it is that theyre trying to accomplish you go back you look at Alanas Williams a year ago ACC Player of the Year along with Jake laravia who ends up being a firstround pick in the NBA draft and then you look at a guy like Tyree Appley whos come into this game and this season really but they need a point guard he has stepped into taking over that leadership role better helps defense to come over and block the shot and a traveling violation is Bradford went to the floor and secured the basketball and again we talked about Applebee we did talk about Bradford Bradford has been spectacular here not only on the offensive end of the floor but defensively as well continuing to contest block and add resistance at The Rim so well Bradford to Kansas State last year a season was slowed down by about as covid got himself a fresh start this year here in WinstonSalem looked for Justin Hill Way Off the Mark oh you got a seal hes got to get the basketball Lindsay head after he right on his back hes got to get that Bulldogs in another scoring drought now reaches two and a half minutes after another brick there comes an empty trip but give Lindsay credit he ran the floor hard he had a much smaller Defender behind him sealed and got his position in the post but yet did not get the basketball and get a good opportunity on office Steve Forbes third year head coach graduate of Southern Arkansas University class of 1988 but hes in Iowa he grew up in Lone Tree Iowa and its been a long road for him to the top of college basketball he has coached at the JC level at the mid major level got that opportunity to come to wait three years ago right at the height of the pandemic a tough time to take over for Steve Forbes a tough first year but got some excitement back in this program last year yeah he said that was so important last year because again the 2020 2021 season what are you gonna do he got hired in the spring didnt meet his team until the summer so thats kind of a throwaway in a lot of ways but he thought it was important to win games last year and get energy back in the jewels yeah and again when you say get by and get hired in the spring I mean it was late spring and again so he mentioned he never met his team until she bought and so he talked to him on Zoom everything thats it but thats different from being able to be on campus with your guys and it was a tough year of the first one but he showed his coaches over the last season got a foul on the rebound after the missed shot by Martez McBride First Media timeout in the second half well step away Ill Wake Forest so far tonight once again coach expects him to play a key role for this team this year yeah and when you look at the transfers fourway Force its four transfers coming in three of those transfers are in the starting lineup and so we talked about Steve Forbes and his ability to identify their needs and be able to go out and find those guys but at the same time its one thing to transfer in and be in the rotation its something completely different transferring to be a starter and a key member early Applause wake is now six of 17 from Beyond The Arc Georgia only four for 21 but Georgia coming out of timeout a little energy there you knock down the three and then you get an opportunity to get out in transition get to the freethrow line and this is necessary for Georgia right now to try to find a way to build some momentum to see if they can get back into this game a lot of time remaining 15 and a half minutes more than enough time for them to make this a game Marge res McBride was a big part of what the mean green of North Texas put together the last two years NCAA tournament two years ago they won the Conference USA regular season a year ago and you might remember two years ago he was part of the upset of Purdue in the opening round of the NCAA tournament another one of those winning pieces Mike White wanted to bring to Athens yeah I see that and Mike why going back to some full court pressure and this is the Mike White that I got to know and love the Louisiana Tech way back in the day press for it from him in my coaching time but I remember getting it from him and thats one of the things Im thinking of my C for Mike White throughout the season is to try to pick up the pressure full court a little more and make the game faster and try to really you know throw a couple function wrenches in the opponents Arsenal because right now theyre playing a bit under man foreign thats a terrific looking setup and finish Lindsay Above the Rim for two more did you see the false pressure once again just giving Wake Forest something to think about and trying to see if you cant come up with a turnover and Steve Forbes not liking what he sees he caused the Timeout on that one as David Williamson is pinned against the Baseline its a nice finish by Lindsay over the top Georgia with some momentum some energy forcing the time out of the Demon Deacons Mark drez McBride has gotten off to a great start here in the second half not one but two threepointers and attacking the paint theyre able to find Lindsay over the top for the dump and just like that a 70 run capped off by the Georgia Bulldogs as they try to make this a game and find some energy here on the road Ill lay to the points for McBride coming in the second half being Chiron Lindsay both have eight to lead the way for Georgia which is playing without Matthew Alexander montrieve here tonight an ankle injury suffered Monday in the win over Western Carolina has him sidelined for the short term good answer coming out of the break as Appleby buries the three thats big thats what you need from the guy thats going to be your point guard from your leader being able to come out when teams start to make a run on You Wake Forest hadnt scored had three turnovers over the last two and a half minutes thats a big bucket to give wake a little more Breathing Room Apple beacon score as we talked about he put 37 on Bowling Green his sophomore year at Cleveland State Applause foreign Defender way behind giving him more than enough space to catch a shoot in Rhythm knocking down a big three stretching the lead back to 19 as a sophomore of Cleveland State second Team all conference average 176 assists per game then if Florida spent three years including the transfer year in Appleby averaged 11 per game got his bachelors degree in AfricanAmerican studies so he comes into this year with over 1500 career points he can get to 2 000 thats a big number I know you get the extra year but thats a big number is there asterisk boy I mean I know his sister will say there he is especially if she did it at four thats true another turnover on the inbound oh the officials going to take okay great officiating hes going to say thats on me Mike White doesnt like it Music Applause former Ole Miss rebel to help lead in his playing days his school to the NCAA tournament three straight years yeah earlier you called him a guard Mike White was a point guard you got to throw the point in there for point guards we dont like it when you call this discards we had the ball in our hands down Ill work on that no you wont no you wont I know you better youre not going to do it now because and anyhow in this day and age all these definitions that we grew up with are all being blurred this positionless basketball but that we we played at a day where it was not positionless we did McBride knocked down another three thats 11 points all in the second half including three threepointer Ill tell you what he is finding a way into the rotation earning more minutes on the Fly here tonight foreign Applause nice job defensively to get the hand up and get out there by hole and heres Holt back at the other end Music Applause play by Roberts left his feet nowhere to go gets failed out and it opened three from the corner by Jason Holt and right now Steve Forbes not liking what hes seeing a 20plus point lead now cut to 11 and Georgia starting to heat up from Beyond The Arc McBride getting his started knocking down three threes here in this second half and Hulk getting involved in the action as well the corner three is good and the pressure picking up full court Mike White changed the game when they started he started getting his guys picking up in the backcourt going to a 221 Zone pressure just to show Wake Forest a different look and his throne Wake Forest really out of rhythm offensively and been a game changer this far and Ive got to figure Bulldogs fans and and people like me observers Wonder if its so effective why not do it more often why not do it earlier why did it take to be down 23 before you went to golf well the same thing that I always talk about your alma mater I know you do thats why I led you that way and you know if Jim beijam has told me time and time again you cant do it the entire game because people scouting but when you get down and you need some energy to be able to come back into a game thats when you go to the pressure if you do it the entire game it wears your team down also so right now Mike White bringing it out at the right time and its allowed his team to be able to get back in this game call inside thatll send Davey on Bradford to the line I bring that up because Ive heard you say multiple times on the air while calling Syracuse game yeah and then that same thing I asked coach behind about right you know I mean I dont just say it on the air I actually go to him and say coach your press is so great why dont you do it more often right but you know Jim behind likes to play a much smaller rotation he doesnt like to play 10 guns and to be a pressing team youve got to play a lot of guys because it takes so much energy out of you so I understand it but you know and I go back to of course you know the game that you always remind me of where Syracuse Beats Virginia to go to the final four in the elite eight and it was the Press Virginia up 18 is that what it was I had forgotten it was 18 dont do that dont do that but you know I I remember that vividly and every time I see Syracuse go to that pressure its always effective cam Hildreth got away with a little pushoff to get the rebound they reset he finds an opening on the wing and buries the three and a big bucket needed that just to give wake a little more breathing room they can feel Georgia starting to walk them down right now every bucket of the Wake Forest is a bonus at this point Applause inside for Braylon Bridges posting up good shot bait off the front rim though for McBride who has been hot here in the second half traveling violation Justin Hill tried to come to a stop didnt do it though before passing the ball and track lead was 23 George has been trying to make a push but the Demon Deacons have made a couple of big shots lately they really have Tyree Appleby coming out of timeout knocks down to Big Three and then an offensive rebound off a free throw allows cam Hilda to get open in the corner knocked out another three but those the only two baskets that Wake Forest has made to try to stem the tide as you mentioned Georgia cutting a 23point deficit to 11 at one point now standing at 14 heres childrens with the basketball being guarded by Hill to Tyree Appleby off the hesitation picks up the dribble bring it back out front hildras passed off the fingertips of Williamson whos got it six to shoot I think if shes gonna have to go he does makes it in its all experience of Williamson knowing the shot clock is going down but recognizing how much time he has Roberts answers with a midrange jumper at the other end Georgia only shot 30 percent in this first half but second half theyve been shooting the basketball much better you can see them theyre much more confident offensive team Idris a lot of dribbling finds the cutter no its knocked away nicely done by Holt defensively no one stopping the basketball right now and again down with the offense starts to go bad oftentimes it affects your defense those are the mistakes that you cant make as a team that wants to be a winning team especially in the Hsu SEC level on a play like that off a turnover someone has to stop the basketball not giving away an easy bucket 12 Wake Forest turnovers have been turned into 15 points now for the or by the Bulldogs Appleby spins for two more I love the way Appleby is understanding the climate of the game when he needs to be a facilitator when he needs to be a scorer right there knowing his team needs a bucket takes it up on his shoulders to go get one sister Chicago would approve foreign Applause by Braylon Bridges hes the more offensive minded five at the disposal of Mike White you know but between you know Bridges and then you look on the other side and Bradford these guys have been special at the five positions today both of them giving their teams a lot on the offensive end defensive in the floor another wave turnover and Roberts will bring it back out smart play by Roberts didnt have numbers make sure you get your team to Quality look inside of nine minutes to go here at the Joel Applause under control little leaner no by Roberts fight for the ball Demon Deacons with it got numbers hell Griffin starts around the rim and out but he tips it back in you want to know whos upset about that play Hildreth gave himself an extra rebound on it though oh see right there momentum blowing your direction you pull up for three if youre David Wilson you have the green light youve got the ability and when you dont it turns out to be a turnover your team may tackles you because hes running down the floor and you cant the Big Fellas cant stop if Williamson pulls up and shoots the three Wade gets a good look but because he does it his teammate runs him over its a turnover giving Georgia the basketball right back did he keep his dribble there though doesnt matter it was close should have shot to pull up Marcus Haynes Curly Neal right there wait wait wait Im going way back though you will not disrespect Curly Neal I saw Curly Neal play when I was a kid at manly Fieldhouse I saw a curly theyll play as a kid also and unbelievable one of the best shows Ive ever seen the Harlem globetron yep another triple for Wake Forest this time one of the big men Andrew Kahn Wake Forest has used timely threes to slow down to Georgia run defensive foul on Robert and thats the second time Appleby has made that play and Georgia has aided it by extending that forearm Tyree after doing a great job getting over cutting off the offensive player absorbing the contact and on the other end of the floor its been timely threes to keep weight in the league three Georgia 46 Bulldogs with all sorts of new faces for first year head coach Mike White including Justin Hill who growing up in Houston it was predestined pretty much that he was going to be a good college basketball player his dad Keith Hill helped lead New Mexico state to the 1990 and a whole hill was the 1988 ACC Player of the Year at Virginia and a member of the 50th Anniversary team in ACC history on the dunk by Bradford mom was a twotime AllAmerican for the whos I knew that name and when I saw the picture I knew exactly where that game was played University Hall I know the name remember it very well I looked at my partner and your jaw was down oh yeah that doesnt happen very often well again when you see Hill yeah I dont know but hope the bed I know Donna Holt one of the alltime greats in ACC history and her son after transferring from a school in your neck of the woods Longwood University he was very good for the lances and now in his first year with Georgia Bradford putting together a really nice game but Bradford coming up gimpy limping back down the floor on that possession cant get back and defend the rim Applause yeah and asking for a sub now Steve Forbes turned his back I dont want to see that but you see Bradford limping back down the floor going to check out for a second and get checked out but he has made his presence felt in this game 11 points five for five from the field perfect from the field all right the line here is the aforementioned Justin Hill out of Fort Ben Travis High School in Houston pick George over Oklahoma State West Virginia Vanderbilt Oklahoma when he was looking to transfer from Longwood did you know who came in by the way I cant let it go do you know who came in Tyree Tyree made me Let It Go I was in a thought right there but Tyree took me out of my thoughts now does that qualify as a little jelly ah the jelly is the Finish thats just Saucy thats spicy Im like 16 for Tyree Appleby so the thought that I was in do you know who replaced Donna Holt at University of Virginia John Stanley the greatest point guard to ever play at University of Virginia she she had an unbelievable handle she was one of the first female basketball players I remember watching and just being in awe she is the first and only female basketball player that Ive ever played against and watched who did stuff like this and more importantly did stuff that I said I cant do that Applause of course dawn has put together a Powerhouse at the University of South Carolina so Will she end up going into the Hall of Fame again yeah is that how that works yeah because shes a Hall of Fame coach hes already in as a Hall of Fame player yeah so she will be you know as a Hall of Fame coach thats another beautiful fight its gonna make Tyree Appleby fan this is the first live game Ive been able to call Ive seen him play before but I can tell you right now the way hes moving the basketball and helping his teammates I like what I see Steve Forbes got one here you think Mike White wishes he was still on his side tonight I do believe he would most preferably wearing the red uniform and comparison Applause Tyree Applebys not the biggest guy 61 only 165 but he has put together some kind of performance and this backcourt for Wake Forest I mean weve got some good back courts in the ACC Carolina at Miami this could be a pretty formidable backboard and wait I believe it is and the thing about it its a veteran backcourt youre talking look at tyrealby with a smile the fans love him only in his second game here the fans love him already and look at the game hes put together 166 rebounds six assists and an efficient six for nine from the field but again he should have more than six and six and he told you this afternoon as Oquendo buries the three he had the upper hand over his former coach and its played out that way he was confident with his answer hes a confident young man had time to spend with him at Jasmine Thompson with the ACC media day and I think hes going to be great here for the Demon Deacons this season Applause Clinton turns it over Roberts danger is passed gets away with it Williamson nearly took it away foul on Hildreth sending Eder to the floor you know what I like also about this Wake Forest famous DeForest told us this early today hes going to have to play more guys as we see the foul right there at the Philippe hildrift gets that foul but hes going to play more guys this year theyre going to have a much larger rotation and he has more guys to be able to play chance for three for Jackson Etter Etter who just drove the ball to the basket and got vowed is a great job there on underneath out of bounds with a nice cut but hes defined to be able to finish on the bucket and opportunity for the hand one you talk about people playing different roles for Mike White this year than they did for Tom Green a year ago Etter started 22 games last year for the Bulldogs and at the end of the bench now but in the rotation I should say at the end of the rotation young man out of Etowah High School Georgia native who stayed home to play his college ball well just a moment ago Davion Bradford with one of the staff members for Wake ran to the tunnel at the end of the Arena but he has since come back and now hes getting onto the stationary bike weve seen him limping around a couple of times thank you first of the foul called on Lucas Taylor not popular here at the Joel not popular at all and again and that really shows you the way the game has changed you know back in the stone ages when you and I were playing basketball if you got out and it was one person offensively with two guys back that is not a good shot no but this ends up being a great opportunity for Glendo as he misses the first free throw but he attacks the basket gets the foul and coaches are okay with that today because again you would much prefer to take your chances and transition with your guy will go ahead of stream going to the basket I could have probably got up another 200 300 field goal attempts during my college career if I could have done that well I do appreciate here the Georgia pressure again this time handled by weight youre talking about our playing days as though I was somehow in your orbit well but Ill tell you what my high school coach at Jordanelle Bridge High School Bill the King Solomon hed have been yelling at me if I tried to go one on two for sure I saw I saw you in you know your Syracuse uniform at the pickup game that you got thats true thats true so thats why I said hour Ive also seen your photos of you you know doing your replica Larry Bird at the Boston Garden so I Applause and Ill keep reminding you and keep sending you the picture weve got to remind the viewers this is an 11 point game now I mean this is Georgia has fought their way back and theyve gotten to this point before an 110 run over the last 310 and again theyve done this before but then they had turnovers and kind of hurting themselves take away opportunities well see if they can continue to extend that run get some stops Lucas Taylor getting some run bounces it off nice cut by Bobby Clinton who gets the two and another one of those great interior passes that weve seen from Wake Forest in this game and Im pretty certain we will see Charlie Appleby back in the game after this next time out finish it off Applause oh quindo trying to heat up after a relatively quiet night so far Williamson keeps a dribble Applause smartly Cameron Hilda says lets work a little clock foreign Applause missed the rim Applause here is just a hill another time no one stops the basketball that is unheard of the college basketball you cant allow a guy to get a defensive rebound go all the way down the floor and lay it in and now Georgia with a chance to get it into single digits looks pretty comfortable in his first year as a demon Deacon and the former Mike White point guard getting the job done here for the Demon Deacons tonight four or five from the field in the second half timely buckets three assists and most importantly the nicest move of the night the spin the cross over the Finish to look to the bench and still the 10point lead but Apple will be back into the game right now as Georgia has an opportunity to make this a ninepoint game at the free throw line two minutes remaining more than enough time for Georgia to come back Justin Hill at the freethrow line and Corey this is the first time since 9 30 one of the first half that it was a single digit deficit and Wake Forest has been in control of the entire game but give Mike White a lot of credit and his guys for sticking to the game plan and once they started with the full court pressure it was a game changer Wake Forest has made timely baskets they need one here good pressure by the Bulldogs better hustled by Appleby boy look for a second like Georgia was going to take that basketball away and thats just want to thats will I mean again you know there was Tyree up because of easily not sprinted down to get that basketball and theres been a turnover but because of his effort Wake Forest gets the foul and keeps the basketball Appleby looking like he paid the price a little bit for it gimpy coming back down the floor but they keep possession solely because of Kyrie Africas house Applause Appleby out of bounds last to touch they say was Georgia its on Holt with the rejection Applause you want to see this at the end it almost looked like it the basketball went off of Applebees and the officials are going to go over and look at that because we didnt get a good view of it on that angle but in live action I kind of felt like that basketball when it came down to the floor hit Appleby on the way out that was why I said the officials said it went out on Applebee because I wasnt sure either well its a 152 Georgia run to make things interesting here at uh Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum in WinstonSalem lets take another look see if we can tell better on this angle so as you see Appleby Go to the ground the shot is blocked but who does it hit last that looks like its sorry Applebys foot does it not but is it definitive yeah I would say I think it does but I think it has to be definitive if we could see that angle again because I dont think theres anyone elses foot or anyone else in that area did it change direction did it change rotation it did change rotation so as you see when he goes to the ground and youll see his left foot still somewhat in the air but as the ball goes down right there it changes Direction when it hits the ground but it hits his hand last also on the way down I think theres enough right there to be able to overturn that and that basketball goes back to Georgia with a key review here and you know three seconds on time because under I mean over two minutes youre not able to go back and look at that right so so that happens at 157 remaining on the clock and the officials have now the opportunity to be able to go back and see for certain my ball guys the call will stand on that when it will stay with aptly so it doesnt I guess they didnt have enough definitive inpatient from our angles it looked like that hit app will be last though and we both felt live that it hit alphabetes and Im not dissuaded from that but Im not sure that there was definitive video Yeah and our officials have done a great job this evening offensive foul on the inbounds pass not sure which of the Deeks they got thats a play right there when you get a break and then you give it right back Music and if youre Georgia right now this is a time where youve got to take advantage of this opportunity to try to cut more into this league Applause that was file number three on Bradford now weve got one going the other way turnovers have been the story and here at crutchtown youve got both teams giving the basketball away when they need to get quality looks lets find a way to continue the board two Defenders come at Appleby gets rid of the basketball under a minute 45 now Music Mildred back to Appleby nicely done by The deeps Killing Time and forcing the foul against Justin Hill after having worked the clock and worked the basketball very nicely and this is the benefit if youre Steve Forbes of your transfers the guy that guys that you bring into the program news big older theyve been through it before weve talked about Appleby this time at Cleveland State at Florida weve talked about Carr his time at Delaware these guys have been on the floor in these situations before so they know how to conduct themselves up still waiting on the return of Xiao ituka last years Mac Rookie of the Year at marriage and Coach Forbes says is going to be a key member of that backboard when he is healthy once again hes got knee trouble recently had a PRP injection but they are hopeful and hell be back in the deeps lineup before long you know his first week of the season first time Ive been able to see Wake Forest live and I like what I see from the demonique yeah you know I know of course coach Florence isnt going to necessarily be the happiest about the way this game has ended and how theyre allowing Georgia to get back into it but from what Ive seen from Wake Forest I I think they got a shot this year I mean youve got some older players you got some veteran guys and youve got some young Talent mixed in together and a great coach I mean you know one thing about Steve he knows what hes doing on this island Applause Applebees got a nice stroke out the line six for six in the opening game against Fairfield calmly sinks his first one here Music caught iron but well still count it two for two those count the ones off the glass those are one timeout Georgia we talked about that for both of these teams one from the SEC one from the ACC this is a first week test where youre flying another Power conference opponent give you an idea of maybe where your team is now and for Wake Forest they wont play another Power Conference Team until November 29th at Wisconsin well when you look at what Steve Forbes dealt with a year ago the fact that they did not have a strong nonconference schedule was held against them when it came to NCAA tournament selection Sunday and so Steve Forbes went out and changed it playing for power conference schools in the nonconference this year but you know in the ACC now were playing 20 20 games yeah conference play is on you early December its here before you know it yeah their first game in conference at Clemson December 2nd thats after the ACC Big Ten challenge up in Madison against the Badgers but then theyve got a nonconference game Saturday December 10th against LSU been an unconference game at Rutgers thatll be a good test as well and I believe wake is in a arent they in a uh in season tournament didnt they go to Jamaica or Bahamas I thought coach Forbes mentioned somewhere that they would be traveling maybe hes just going to take a vacation you know what thats always great to do right in the middle of the Season especially in November well you and Ill be vacationing of sorts out in Portland Oregon coming up later this month during the uh Thanksgiving holiday for PK 85 both very much looking forward to that yeah Wake Forest will go to Montego Bay Jamaica theyll play LaSalle and then theyll play the winner of Georgetown Loyola Marymount out there so Georgetown if they get that one and the South I count the A10 as a foul accomplish oh Terry Roberts for three active Fran Dunphy turn around as alma mater the Explorer foul in the backcourt goes against McBride you know if Georgia does not win this game and again eight point lead 113 remaining we still have to say if crazy things can happen but Mike White has to be impressed with the effort and the way that his team has approached this second half you know down big at halftime a 19point lead for the Demon Deacons coming out of the half and then the lead ballooning to 23 at one point before Georgia really starts to fight back the full court pressure was something that Mike White used and I think it helped his team tonight to find some energy and get some things going offensively and Im sure thats something that we will see much more from them as this season goes along remember hes in year one at Georgia still trying to establish a culture from a team that was one in 17 in conference play a year ago doesnt get the roll and a foul on the floor and the folks here at the Joel start to sense that uh with one minute on the clock double figure lead I dont think theyve completely started to celebrate but you could sense after that last foul call that the Deeks are feeling pretty good the fans are feeling pretty good I believe they should be right now and how about you know Cameron Hills finishing the game again doesnt start but you see them coming off they move car to the five position foreign with a hustle play to come up with his own offensive rebound hes very skilled at using his hands and not getting called so basically youre saying that was a foul well hes had a couple of them its not a foul if its not called this is very true you know better than I do you can get away with it yes I agree no I like what Ive seen out of Cameron Hildreth playing a bigger role here tonight and even though he made the hustle play he comes up with the basketball you can see Bobs body language right now hes upset he missed that free throw of course he is well again his dad Daniel Hildreth was a pro basketball player over in their home country of England and he played for Nick nurse the current Toronto Raptors head coach and because Nick nurse and Steve Forbes are great friends from decades ago growing up and coming up in Iowa that was the connection to get Cameron Hildreth here to WinstonSalem well how about the fact that Steve Forbes offered Nick nurse a job Nick nurse turned him down to go coaching Europe because he wanted to be a professional coach and I think it was a great decision by Nick yeah that was not a great decision to foul the threepoint shooter Oquendo will go to the line to shoot three if your car in that possession use your size you wanted to contest a shot but not lunge toward the shooter at that point giving them opportunity to put three on the board from the free throw line Applause thank you Applause on the putback thats a fourpoint possession a huge turn for Georgia to keep that door ajarred this is far from over 35 and a half seconds eight point game it is far from over and right now I mean again if youre Steve Forbes you like whats happened in this game but youre not happy with the way that has ended thus far giving up offensive rebounds on missed free throws turnovers these are the things that cost you games especially as you get into ACC play playing against a team like Georgia whos going to continue to scrap you can never take your foot off the gas pedal at a time like this and we see Wake Forest has done that at times here in the second half well Georgia will have the weekend off before hosting Miami Ohio on Monday and then the next games are against Bucknell St Joes South Florida or UAB as they play in the sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach Florida Applebee breaks the pressure to Williamson theyve been the story largely for Wake Forest the backcourt combining for over 40 points and I believe thats something that you know Wake Forest can lean on throughout the season a veteran backcourt that can score and weve seen Appleby make some unbelievable passes throughout this game and not only the spectacular passes with the passes where hes pretty much throwing his Guys open and leading guys into very good looks Music Lindsay takes a seat abdur Rahim back in Georgia as Williamson with 22 points former East Tennessee State star who was on the 2019 socon all freshman team 23 to lead all scores Applebees got 20 but you know Im sorry David had with 16 in the first half something like that so you know what Im thinking he didnt shoot enough 32 I mean whatever it is in the first half you should multiply by two thats what you should end up with at least long two is good by McBride Georgia is not going away many of the fans sticking around to make sure this becomes a win you dont want to get in the car and turn on the radio find out youre in overtime and got to run back into the building be one of those people in the 88 World Series at Dodger Stadium when Kirk Gibson hit the Home Run and you see all the brake lights out beyond the right field fences they are driving out yeah like wait a second although in Reverse Dodgers they thought the game they thought it was over they thought the As had the game I never understood the rush to get to the exits if youre taking the time and paying the money to come to the game Im one who wants to stay to the end I agree wholeheartedly some people think theyre going to beat the traffic Applause Applebee now with 22 points does Georgia have one last trip no and the shot clock is off and it looks like the Bulldogs are going to step away and let the Demon Deacons dribble it out this is a great not just a good but a great early season win for Wake Forest for Steve Ford for the culture here in WinstonSalem to be able to get a power Conference win this early in the year well do wonders for his teams confidence as well as building chemistry knowing that they can win game
