last Music year theyre in the Infantry blue NC State in the home white uniforms itll be one of the transfers Mohamad dearo tips it up and wins the M time tips away we go on the 2023 24 season first possession to the wolf pack couple of transfers DJ horn Jaden Taylor play catch this is Casey Morel one of the familiar faces in the first touch for DJ burns the crowd lets you know it nearly a turnover seven is shoot for Applause Taylor and theres burns with a recycle offensively going to work and that first possession it looked like they were trying to trap from the Baseline obviously got deflected on a pass but it looks like early on thats one of the things that theyre going to do is really try to trap DJ heres the starting five for the Citadel they added quite a bit of size in Winston Hill and Quinton malora Brown a couple of transfers malora Brown coming from Vander Bill and a back door cut and a layup for dur take a look at the wolf pack starting five here in the season opener for Coach Keats it is three transfers along with morcel and burns yeah hes got that free throw line Jumper in his bag and theyre going to have to find a way to contain him if they let him get going its going to be a rough night for him so a couple of quick baskets for DJ burns the season barely minute into it heres malora Music Brown AJ Smith Physical guard goes into Attack Mode Corner three wont fall and thats one of the things that theyll have to do attack him in the pick and roll made a good pass just missed the corner jump shot oh that Baseline spin move is too good great touch great touch great hands great Applause footwork Burns has all six early for the wolf dur able to drive around morel all the way to the basket no help defense yeah dur and Elijah Morgan both really good guards you know dur was the on the Freshman of conference team last year so hes had big minutes hes one of the guys that were going to have to stop tonight for sure Taylor lost his balance lost the Music basketball loose dribble from mure Brown I dont know if coach Conroy wants him dribbling out there too often tough shot W go for for Winston Hill and thats one of the ones Casey Marcel is such a good on ball Defender that you you know unless youre just an elite offensive player that you dont want to try and take him oneonone too much tough shot orell way off and an offensive rebound as NC State fans get acquainted with Mohamed Dior thats something he can bring to this team and thats one of the things especially seeing him in the practice and shoot around really high motor and thats one of the things that NC States going to need out of him it seems like he can do just a little bit of everything and he draws the start here in the open hell backing him down cant finish and a chance maybe to push here for horn three on two deep three and thats what they want to do they really want to push the ball get out in transition get those open threes and thats a good job by them they didnt get the first one but attacked one more time made the extra pass and got a good look this will be a kickball Kevin Keats now in his seventh season with the wolfback took them to the big dance last year and looking to get them back you see they have been dominant against nonconference opponents at home with so many new faces its a lot to juggle as a coach he did it well last season it is and thats just kind of the landscape of college basketball today I think citadels going through it too you know especially early on how are these guys going to mesh I think this is something that the coaches want to see especially being one of the first games of the year Michael oconnell then middle Brooks have both checked in for NC State couple more transfers from Power five programs late in the shot clock and a steal from horn oh con with a fast break bucket is first in an NC State uniform thats just good defense Yar down there on the Baseline he kicks it out way to keep your man in front attack and transition and get the easy layup the defense leading to offense NC State hoping its defense can be improved this year with added size and athleticism and right on Q nearly a steal from Taylor Hill finds the shooter thats Elijah Morgan from that left wing and theyve missed a couple good ones I think thats what coach probably wants him to get theyre getting good looks especially from those Corners off of a dribble penetration so thats something that theyre going to take all night NC State out to a 104 lead at the First Media break Michael oconnell in transition defense to offense this is exactly how they want to play creting the stop getting the Music layup s this go took over off and Music welcome you back here in Raleigh alongside Scott Wood Im Andrew Sanders NC State leads it 104 early take a look at last years recap 23 wins overall 12 of them in ACC play Scott what was it about last years team that made him so good you know I think a lot of is they had two all ACC type players they had Travon Smith and Jarel Joiner who was a great leader for them and now they missing them you see 15 and two here in this building a couple of dynamic guards and a lot to replace DJ horn who gets that inbound and has the ball now hes one of the guys they brought in to try and fill that and one of the reasons he told me that he came here to Raleigh as Jaden Taylor is off with the three and another recycle NC State up seven to2 in the rebounding battle so far and the Citadel did a really good job on that Baseline out of bounds there especially in the exhibition NC State was able to get some easy ones off that and they just they uh defended it really well well the three Off the Mark for horn but getting back to that one of the reasons he wanted to come to NC State style of play and he knew that there were a lot of shots to be had and a lot of points that needed to be replacing and hed like to do some of it yeah theyre going to need some guys to fill that void uh especially taking guys off the bouns thats one of the things that Im interested in seeing is that cam Roberts just into the game he gets an and one opportunity as he is fouled by Dennis Parker the lone freshman for NC State and cam Roberts is one of those that you know Im Im really interested in seeing especially in their exhibition got some good minutes as a freshman you know talking with Coach earlier he wants to see what they have early on uh and he has a really high motor especially uh after what we just saw and he gets his own offensive rebound another rebound off a tip from malora Brown Roberts whos from South Boston Virginia but making kind of a homecoming he played a ball for Garner Road here in Raleigh yeah really good connection the David West Connection as well as TJ Warren ball playing Applause there Jaden Taylor the butler transfer finds Dennis Parker and you see he is bouncy he follows up his own Miss hell go to the line to shoot to look watching NC State in practice he is going to be awfully good hes really really athletic uh I think I saw some clips of him dunking the basetball thats one thing he is really athletic hes also a little bit more smooth and skilled than probably people really expect but very highly talented recruit and it would be interested to see his PR here freshman from Richmond Virginia rolls in his first Collegiate point the Virginia player of the year but I think the most important thing that three time state champion probably would have been four times but they didnt play the championship due to co so he comes from a winning program he knows how to win and hes looking to bring some of that to in thats something a lot of coaches are looking at guys that have the winning history cuz there is they art to win it uh and its not easy NC State pressing full court and the Citadel turn it over okell of three and thats what theyre going to do theyre going to pressure you and the Citadel has to handle that pressure a little bit better than what they have early on they had only six turnovers in their exhibition against Newberry College but the amount of pressure has been turned up here little bit more athleticism little bit more size and length uh but I think you know especially after they see it a few times theyll start to handle a little bit better as the game goes on last Touch by oconnell as he was pressuring Elijah Morgan the Notre Dame transfer second year in Charleston with the Bulldogs and he was their leading scorer in that aforementioned exhibition against Newberry College he had 18 heres Keenan Music Davis trying to find an outlet off the Roberts thats where you got to come back to the ball they kind of left them hanging there in the corner you got a back cut come to the ball help him out we talk about what NC State is replacing right and its awfully tough to replace the scoring ability of tur quavon Smith that that fifth year veteran Guard Leadership from jar Kel Joiner but one thing that they maybe did in bringing in so many new guys is they brought in some vets and also some lengthen athleticism you think they could be better defensively yeah and I think thats one of the things I think theyre a little bit deeper this year I think they can go 11 guys especially the style of play Kevin Keats wants he wants to pressure he wants to do it you know for a quarter of a game every once a while come back into his half half court defense but he really wants the pressure he can get guys now in and out and know when they need a break hes got somebody who can bring Music Applause in C love to post up their guards if they can nearly another steal Applause hill now oh sloppy maybe got away with the travel and its going to be a shot clock violation before the tie up and you can see that length and pressure of ins State really bothering the Bulldogs early yeah and thats one of the things that hes talked about hes trying to implement that defensive scheme since hes been there and having the right pieces in place and having a deeper roster and this is one of those years that hes really going to be able to implement Music that great to talk to Conroy the head coach it listed as his second season but as you see he was also the head coach from 06 to 2010 and its a homecoming for him theres a lot of tieins between NC State and the Citadel but catching up with him when we went to talk with him he was talking to an NC State Legend Chris corani because he actually coached Mr corani back in his senior year under Les Robinson so he was an assistant at NC State here from 1990 1993 so first thing we said to him was hey coach welcome back well first off welcome come back and its got to be easy I would imagine to be able to coach a Rodney Monroe and Chris corani so things were probably a little bit easier on him than what hes got to go through tonight you know afterwards and obviously we know corani pretty well I asked him I said hey what was it like to be coached by coach conro he said you know back then he was he was 24 years old so you know he kind of fit in well because he was he was basically our age also but he immediately earned our respect just a great coach and a great person they were able to catch up and States making them start their offense so far out they really got to try to start this in a scoring position right at the threepoint line and again the pressure gets to Fourth turnover for the Bulldogs itll take us to the Under 12 timeout 126 well Music F these moves looking real nice in the future lets take a look at this Bulldogs team and yeah 13 of the 16 players are under class minut its the young pumps including seven freshman and Scott you discussed this just a little bit earlier but coach Conroy is going to play a lot of guys in his rotation early in the season in the nonconference to kind of find out what he has with all these freshman yeah and I think he really likes his Freshman Class um theyve got a mixture of some really good sophomores that had some really good minutes for him last year and I think they sprinkled in those graduate seniors so theyve got some leadership there and I think especially as the season goes on theyre going to get really good Madison dur back in for Coach Conroy he picks up okon DJ Burns back in the left elbow catch and Bon pass gets his first minutes of this season T to shoot for NC State thats a thats a better defensive kind of play for them they they forced the catch out almost by the threepoint line and made DJ really have to back it in those are the things that they need to do Hill backing down Dr on that left block you see the length of Dr forcing a tough Applause Music shot open three and one goes down paint touch kick it out knocks it down those are the type of things that are going to be winning plays for them I think especially with them being a little deeper and missing turqu and Jarel thats the style of basketball theyre going to have to have really get a paint touch make the right play pass got his hand in there mure Brown able to reather I was given got a hard time during the break both teams have been 0 for three from Deep oh conell was able to save us on that it was it was a rough little stretch but you know we broke the ice now I dont think anybodys made more threes in this building than you as dur makes the turnaround good player in control kind of backs him down a little bit and great space with a Fade Away really good player I like his game Burns boy he is such a unique player hes got a good pep in a step right now I will say that you know hes hard one hes just hes tough to guard you go Zone do you trap and I dont know if anybodys really figured out the answer to really contain him even going back to last year foul before the shot well hes got such a great personality and a great game to go along with and uh immediately the fans in Raleigh embraced him and I asked him I said you know did did you ever expect when you came here that anything like this could happen hes like no I mean it was you have to remember that Duan mahic got injured and that really led to an increase of minutes for him where he was thrust into a rle he wasnt expecting to play 30 plus minutes uh but when he did he was even better in ACC play when he got his opportunities yeah and especially early on last year they kind of tried to protect him and then when duon did go down he was thrown into a roll and he really thrived at it and I think he just kind of bought into the crowd loving him and now like you said just a huge fan favorite and a blocking foul away from the ball as Burns ends up on malora Brown Burns in the first 10 games of the Season he played 16 1 12 minutes that was his average but after the mahor injury the last 24 games over 25 minutes his average and as you can see one of the better Shooters in the Applause Music ACC and again thats where I would probably tell DJ try to catch a little bit lower hes notorious for kind of backing him down from the threepoint line but especially all the types of Defense hes going to see this year it makes it a little bit easier to dig trap and get the ball out of his hand starting from the threepoint line Taylor with the three way too strong I think were seeing a little bit of those Jitters especially a lot of newcomers in the game today they really want to play well at our first time just I think they got to kind of take that deep breath take your time a little bit and Trust everything you worked on the summer is going to take care of Music itself tend to shoot from aora Brown good Inside Out game no three but be a foul on Taylor for NC State the offensive rebound to AJ Smith you had a nice freshman year you played a lot how long do you think it it felt it took you to settle in I think everybodys a little bit different um I think theyre excited to play and see new faces I think that was the first thing that I remember is just getting worn out by my teammates every single day in practice but you want to see something new but it is its its different its a different speed different physicality so its going to take a few games for them to get used to for sure that is of course the story for a lot of teams across the country Applause Smith fairly good defense by DJ horn and I know thats one of the things that we dont talk to talk about him a lot hes known for scoring but really good defensive possession by Applause him cido will look to push it when they can diara Pauls in his sixth rebound already and hes fouled by Smith thats why they brought him in here hard work rebound give DJ some good spells especially if we you know if we if they Sorry play against another big thats a little bit more athletic gives him a little bit better Music matchup Morel tough Drive lost it on the way up wanted a foul didnt get it Smith tough finish and one one of the first times weve been able to see the Citadel get out and transition a good defensive possession and anytime you get one of those and youre able to get out usually results in something good yeah both teams obviously struggling to score right now in the half court they would love to get out and push pace and a turnover allows that I think theyre just trying to get a feel for each other I think both coaches mentioned they want to get substitutions early get everybody some minutes and thats kind of what were seeing just nerves and also getting used to one another in the game completes the threepoint play by the way thats the second foul on Jaden Taylor he will stay Music in Music oh Connell earns the wolf back in extra possession Taylors unselfish horn a spot up three and thats all conell right there thats the the hard work not giving up on the play even though the other team gets rebound just tipping in the back and giving your team another possession he could be a crucial player for NC State this season as a pass first point guard really like his game hes not going to make a lot of mistakes I think thats one of the things that they need a good floor General and a great pass from DJ steel at the top NC State starting to get out and transition and create some Havoc DJ burds with the steel and the dish its not every day you get to see the big fell throw a dime like this in between two guys to Jaden T Taylor running and finishing on the other end right here kids watching this is how you get minutes gets the steal creates gets the ball to Jaden Taylor we make an extra pass DJ horn knocks it down these are the type of things especially as a newcomer that you got to do to earn your minutes ell already with Five Points a rebound and that steel you just saw speaking of Steel DJ burns with a steal that led to the Taylor free throw thats coming up you see Michael oconnell he graduated from Stanford thats impressive enough Scott he did it in 3 years hes got two years of Eligibility here at NC State and if that wasnt impressive enough academically he was a top 100 recruit both in basketball obviously but also in Lacrosse well and thats probably why defensively he brings that physicality hes not afraid of contact so Im really interested to see him especially throughout the year cuz I think he does he brings this team a different element hes not going to allow you but he plays the game the right way three ball banked in Keenan Davis The Freshman they still count they all count take all three of them young and that one is his first collegate Music bucket it counts for a little more in the memory bank for sure I hate to tell you I dont remember my first DJ Burns DJ Burns five for five from the floor hes done it a bunch of different ways with his jump shot hes made a floater hes backed it all the way down hes just a handful of guard Scott you made too many of them to remember your first one you had 334 in your career I remember actually the funny thing is I remember my preseason game but I do not remember my first Music game keina Davis see if he remembers this one in in 10 years or so I mean right off the corner of the square just like he was meaning to do and it was good defense it was really good defense to dig contest and he knocked it down Keenan Davis one of the freshmen that theyre excited about from Chicago coach Conroy says hes the Swiss army knife on the court and one of the things that he can do and its out of many is shoot it well from Deep he played the most minutes of anyone Off the Bench in their exhibition against Newberry College he played 25 minutes and had eight points in that cont DJ Burns picking up that foul his first thats a storyline as well right NC State would like to keep him on the court obviously to do so he has to limit his fouls and Coach keeps saying that one coming off the penetration right coach keep saying a lot of times its up to the guards to prevent him from fouling they have to limit guard penetration yeah it definitely goes hand in hand now I always blame the big guy but you also got to keep the guy in front but it also is where he needs to be smart he needs to understand how important he is to the team and try not to get your second foul in the first half OK Connell nice find to Applause Horn nice back cut by DJ horn and I think thats one of the reasons he scores many different ways he can shoot the three there you see him cutting for a basket many facets to his offensive game attack Defender falls asleep finish it the rim the assist to oconnell Horn he can really scored he was second on the team at Arizona State last year 12 a half points per game he was even better uh in their NCAA tournament run couple years at Illinois State before going out to Arizona State now in his Fifth and final year hes back home in Raleigh Im sure he has a big fan section today yeah the homec com in a long time coming big block by Dennis Parker my goodness we talked about the athleticism and there he is we they get beat on you know the penetration he comes across and eliminates it thats what exactly what they want him to do I mean you talking about help defense thats a different atmosphere up there Music Smith on the pull up nice shot I think thats where coach ke if if we went back to that thats a middle Brooks di screen they should probably switch Music that middle Brooks the Clemson transfer hands off Parker spin move showing out on both ends I was always a big believer if you make a really good defensive play you should be able to score it on the on the other end and he gets the deflection is not going to result in a turnover but thats something this NC State coaching staff coach Keats they aim for 40 deflections thats been a main stage since he got here to Raleigh seven years ago yeah and if you go to their practice its one of the things that are on the board every time they go through a drill or theyre scrimmaging they mark it down every deflection they get and try to you know utilize that when they go back and watch game so the Bulldogs have to face the NC State full court pressure and they need a timeout to do Applause so the wolf pack lead it by Music 10 these moves look nice in the future these moves looking real ni in the future look nice I dont think they Music ready quick timeout by the Bulldogs facing NC State pressure this wol pack team is knocked down five for its last five the offense is starting to come and its a little easier when youre getting it done on the defensive yeah and I always said that offense starts from the defensive end theyre getting in a stance theyre making it tough on The Citadel and theyre getting out and running exactly the things that they want to do and it translates you get easier looks because now youre out in transition theyre cross matched and you get the buckets offense starts from the defensive end in your case your range basically extended to the defensive end right the other side of the run from threepoint line to threepoint line its easy for me they did they didnt expect me to guard Applause Music either dur back out Davis 12 to shoot tries to drive Parker oh a cold three boy Madison dur has played well so far tonight good defense better offense he leads the Citadel with nine points trailing only DJ Burns who has 10 already diara now he can hit that shot not that time thats a shot he can definitely make I dont know if they want him taking it that early in the shot clock but he can definitely knock it down Bulldogs in attack mode AJ Smith will go to the line when we come Music back the Bulldogs cutting into the NC State lead 2821 AJ Smith going to the line here to shoot two Madison Durr leading them with nine points already and hey new number whos this Madison dur wor number 11 last year hes in the number three uniform this season but hes the same guy that had a great freshman season also called freshman team you see he played very well against Clemson in his season opener last year and more the same here yeah he can score at all three levels I think last year shot 30 from three I think thats something that hes going to improve on especially going into his sophomore year and you know right now between Madison dur and AJ Smith theyre really kind of keeping them in the ball game you say he can score from all three levels we saw made a contested three against Dennis Parker something that stood out to me in the exhibition against Newberry College he took 13 free throws Scott he drew 10 fouls if you can kind of create shots we saw NC State tur quavon Smith and jel Joiner could do that some sometimes if your shots not falling being able to get to the line can be huge anytime you can see the ball go in the basket a couple times especially when youre struggling is what you want so the fact that he does get to the line is going to make him an even better threepoint shooter I Music think great pass and thats what okell can bring thats one of the easier baskets DJ Burns has had tonight still hasnt missed hes six for Applause six Bulldogs four for their last five from the floor but in the hands of dur drive and Music Applause kick Music its a couple of times now Morel I think he added a little bit of AR to his shot last year those last two threes have been pretty flat dur to the rim and diara again cleaning the glass and this is the type of game NC States going to want to play I think the citadels got to slow it down a little bit and kind of control the pace be a little bit more selective of when they get out in transition jump ball as Morel got his hands on it possession arrow favoring the Citadel yeah talking to coach Conroy said you know wed like to be aggressive and we have numbers wed like to push but we do not want to get into a complete up and down game with NC State you just got to be a little bit selective I I really like the idea of getting out in transition cuz it is its an opportunity for you to get some easy looks but you also got to know if you miss one youre not going to have numbers going back the other way and thats something NC State likes to do they break the pressure a little miscommunication oh and it falls in Roberts with the friendly bounce again hes played in Raleigh before hes got Applause Music four love the pick on the ball Donell hoist up a three Bo he struggled in the exhibition against Mount ol he had five turnovers but he played very well in their scrimmage against Georgia and this is more reminiscent of that the big lights come on and everybody plays better thats thats how its supposed to work thats a good job by DJ just staying down hes got to understand foul trouble is the one thing thats going to keep him on the sideline so make sure you stay down I even think he can do a better job of squaring up and maybe not hit him with the hip but no call so hes okay OK connells got eight points to go along with a couple rebounds and a couple of assists and a steal Music allora Brown and airball I think he only took two of those at bner B maybe not the ideal shot the coach is looking for oh Burns kick out the fans wanted him to take a three and in on a secret he told me in the preseason he said you know I didnt shoot any threes last year Im going to shoot some this year he said dont dont worry not too many maybe like 10 I might have to run that by the coaching staff uh I think his preferred location is in the paint but maybe he has you know developed that over the over the summer but if he could just Davis team three try to bank another one in if he can yeah hes not a bad free throw shooter right got good touch catch and shoot OK Connell feeling it and the double figures with 11 another great pass they do a good job on the defensive end they push it a little bit theyre not matched on the defensive end able to get a good open Applause three talking to the NC State staff as okon will be called for a block here because they have depth they say look you know we might have a different leading score every night and thats fine it seems like outside of burns it might be okells night yeah and I think thats one of the things that make teams dangerous its hard to scout when you have anybody at any time that could lead you in scoring so I think that would be a perfect formula for them because it makes it a little bit harder to guard burns with 12 oono with 11 little 60 spurt for the wolf pack as okell with his second foul will come out replaced by Brion Applause pass pass skies for the rebound now in is Junior season the junior Guard from Reedsville averaged just about 8 minutes per game last season he played well in the exhibition with nine points and hell be a good change of pace for them I think hes a little bit different Pace then oconnell and even horn so hell change change the pace really well for them Parker to the rack great move you just got to finish that shot clock turned off the Bulldogs can have the last shot if they want Applause it Morgan tough pull up L Brown at the horn got it to go second half as they did the first half same thing with the Citadel double comes Burns passes out of thats one of the hard things about him is even when you do come and double team hes a willing passer Music first possession of the second half for the Bulldogs and Hill throws it off of diars foot shot clock will reset to 20 here and M Mara Brown had a good seal inside and I think one of the things especially after watching that theyre going to try and Target him especially with DJ getting in a little bit of foul Applause trouble nearly a steal by diara oh active hands from Jaden Taylor and eventually turns into a turnover blocking foul Elijah Morgan with the infraction Jaden Taylor from Indianapolis he played his first couple years at Butler they played NC State in the battle for Atlantis last year and he told me that going up against the wol pack was eye openening for him just the style that they played how much fun they had the first Miss for Burns and just the love they have for one another you could tell that they were having fun and the chemistry was there and that was really his first introduction to NC State and so when he eventually went in the portal uh he had that as a school that he was interested in because he had seen it firsthand up close in person yeah and I think thats one of the things with the transfer portals youre seeing a lot of kids that played against other teams they get to see their style of play see how the coach is and then when they realize maybe theyre not in the best fit you know it kind of Sparks that conversation with some other uh some other universities he had 18 points against the wolf pack in Atlanta but the Wolfpack won the game Hill maybe got away with the travel he got rejected by diara morcel who scored 14 points to lead the wol pack in the exhibition against Mount Olive did not score in the first half and thats his third turnover the fifth year senior has struggled early on but one thing he can bring is on this defensive end Smith contested three short and whistling a foul on Morel and thats one of the things Casey may be kind of pushing it a little bit more than what he needs to but you know as weve kind of mentioned defensively hes always going to be there so even if hes not knocking down shots theres always a spot for him on the court because hes such an elite on ball Music Defender Hill in the paint nice move no Music finish Marcel had a huge year last year made 78 3pointers breakout season for him Beyond The Arc o for two in this half thatll be something to keep an eye on Scott he he shot right around your percentage right 41 from three and a lot of that was you know open Corner threes with the defense focusing on tqu Smith or J yeah theyre definitely going to lock in on him a little bit more this year so Im sure that percentage may come down a little bit and hes going to also have a a couple more opportunities to get the shot up Ive always said The more volume you have which percentages drop down a little bit but hes an elite shooter and hes going to keep shooting the ball as is diara he had missed a couple hell dared him to shoot it and he knocks it down but diara limping after making that triple obviously in some discomfort he had fallen down earlier on transition defense and Im wondering if that might have kind of sparked it but hes definitely asking for a sub now dur just lost the Applause handle and diara is going to go Applause out and we told you this is a shot that he can hit and you see Hill kind of sizing him up diar says okay if youre going to give me that Ill take it and I I need a sub too yeah I was always told if youre injured or dont feel right dont take the shot but you know what it paid off there you passing up a shot every once in a while horn hits the back Music iron Smith getting downhill all the way to the rim and thats what theyre going to have to do you know they get a good defensive possession they force a step back three and then they got to push it they attacked DJ when he was on the free throw line get downhill and create the foul and they called Burns and thats the kind of foul right there that coach Kats is telling he cant have yeah you just got to be a little bit smarter and you also got to understand your importance of the team you know they need to have him in the game and it shouldnt be the reason why hes getting subed out is because he gets him any kind of foul trouble and that his third foul do it again Dennis Parker comes in so Ben Middlebrooks is going to play the five with burn saddled with the foul trouble I think two one especially when duon got hurt last year they they were a little bit thin on size so I think thats why you see Middlebrooks coming in here di coming in here and DJ so that they can get a good mix up Taylor well he averaged over 12 points per game for Butler and they played a very slow tempo with NC States Tempo is Smith again pushing the pace he go to the line with NC States Tempo you have to think hell have a chance to maybe score even more yeah and I think thats one of the things you know weve mentioned Jarel and Chon they got to find someone that can kind of create off the bounce you know you cant just give the ball into DJ every possession and hope that he makes a good pass or play so theyre looking for some of those guys that can really take the ball off the bounce and create Smith 11 points hes having a very quietly good game and I always said those are the best ones when you score points and you dont really notice it this is how hes done it he is now eight of nine from the free throw Applause line and cadel shooting just 31 but hanging around down nine still plenty of basketball left this is where another freshman Christian Moore it looks like checked in the ball game hes another one that you know coach had mentioned that he wants to get some minutes and kind of see what he has uh coming off that bench and Christian Moore from all the way out in La Parker has his pocket picks by Music Applause Morgan the brown hierarch three rain maker and I will say one of the things that the Citadel is doing a little bit more is they being a little bit more aggressive defensively defensively and its resting and then being able to push and get some good shots on the offensive end what a big answer right back by Jaden Taylor timeout Bulldogs Music Music Citadel with some momentum but calling a timeout and heres why coming out of the threepoint basket by malora Brown yeah they get arguably their best defensive possession malora Brown knocks down a three but then they just dont get back in transition uh they got a match up there and then a slow close out Jaden Taylor knocks it down and that will get a coachs Bud blood boiling Lora Browns same spot contested by Middlebrooks catches back Iron okell Boy nice pass inside really good patience and I think okono could have taken the shot but he passed up a good one for a great one and again thats the scouting report on him hes going to be unselfish pass first he finds middle Brooks his first career in Sea State basket well he owes him a couple since he gave him his career high last year yeah its not often uh that you have a career high against the team that you currently play for but that is the stat for Middle Music Brooks this will be the under 16 timeouts middle Brooks with the foul heres his first bucket in his State Career M Connell taking his time again passing up a good one for a great Music one back with Scott Wood Im Andrew Sanders a lot of connections between NC State and The Citadel in terms of coaching but how about in conference The Citadel joined the socon all the way back in 1936 one of the longest serving members but NC State not just a founding member of the ACC Scott but a founding member of the socon so from 36 to 53 these two were conference mates and this is the information I like to learn because I wouldnt have known that I also learned that in a roundabout way the socon is the original Super conference it was loaded back in the day so maybe one day we can bring back a loaded socon yeah out of the socon came both the SEC and the ACC lot of the same schools yeah think about the radio deal that they could have got back in in 1921 with that super conference yeah big 10 Music who Jaden Music Taylor tough shot draws front iron and we have a whistle away from the ball I believe its going to be on Hill it is as he was trying to box out Parker great effort by Parker just attack back in the offensive glass and this is one of the things that Ive really been trying to see out of NC State offensively whats it going to look like especially without two creators and jel and quavon talking about The Citadel and NC State coaches Les Robinson went to the Citadel of course coached at NC State where coach Conroy was his assistant here middle Brooks going at malora Brown nice move give him two more Norm Sloan of course National Championship coach also coached at cin middle Brooks active hands pokes it away this is a really good series for Middle Music Brooks and an offensive foul po two soon well youre new at this but some people will say that as a commentator you have a little power this is the curse of the commentator here but you know it is interesting with burns on the bench with foul trouble and Dior hasnt come back in since he was limping this is a great opportunity for guys like Parker or middle Brooks to kind of show what they can do yeah and I think thats one of the things that they need to find out especially if you know Burns gets into foul trouble one what do we have from the defensive end but also you know you lose a lot offensively so being able to find something on that end as Applause well Taylor going to be whistled for the foul here this will be his third foul thats just one of the things especially when youre trying to pressure the basketball that youre going to give up but you also got to kind of be a little bit smarter theyre in the bonus so you dont want to give up free uh charity stripe Applause shots missed it andc stayed on the push its horn thats a blocking foul now shoot two Ill take it Ill take it thats the second time this half Citadel has just been a little bit slow getting back in defensive transition they got to find a way to stop the ball and match up you know especially on the free throw line sometimes youre going to be cross matched first and foremost you have to stop the ball and then match up from behind Music there horn to the Music line look at last year it was a fun season for the wolf back and they were fun to watch right scoring a lot of points getting out in transition forcing turnovers thats what coach Keats wants them to be year in and year out yeah its going to be hard to maintain those numbers but I think theyre theyre still going to try to stay play the same style theyre going to get you know real defensive pressure and get out in transition so I would imagine a lot of those would really stay close and you know turnover margin it helps when you force a lot of turnovers they really took care of the basketball well speaking of this Parker turns it over and then I spoke too soon that time right on Q both teams trading turnovers but NC State only had three turnovers in the first half thats already their fourth of the second half but that would be a trend they would like to see too can they take care of the ball theyve been one of the nations best the last couple years and I think thats one of the things we talked about The Citadel has been just very much more aggressive on the defensive end and theyre creating some of those turnovers and its resulting in good buckets on the other end like this m Hill wanted a foul to go along with it we got a timeout called by coach Conroy well take it with Music him I dont think theyre Music ready back here in Raleigh we talked to you about how young The Citadel is they have out of their 16 players 13 or underclassman but remember they open at Clemson last year they also played in Chapel Hill against North Carolina there were they opened against pit and beat them two years ago although theres nobody on from this squad uh that was on that Squad but this is a team that that went through some battles last year against ACC opponents they get a home game against Boston colle next so this is a team that is certainly not phased to come into a big arena like this and play an ACC team and theyre playing well hanging in there yeah I mean I think thats one of the things that the coach wants to see he wants to see them play you know against ACC schools and really kind of find out what theyre about great ball movement from NC State Burns to Horn to oconnell turned down a good one to get a great one thats the best its the best shot in basketball right there unselfish play o Connell now Leading The Way with 14 points good to see diara back in the game for NC State as Hill is able to get him up in the air and finish and Hill had a little bit of a quiet first half but hes hes come out and got two quick buckets and starting to get himself a little bit more comfortable yeah hell look to get going there as with that basket he is two of 10 diara oh his second triple and that one in front of the NC State bench has them fired Music up largest lead for the wol pack here at Music Applause Music 15 that could have been the fourth on burns instead its another malora Brown offensive rebound and he will be shooting when we come back but how about the new always had to replace its leading score of course tquan Smith last year at almost 18 points per game and we dont know who the leading score is going to be I think most most people expected T to be the leading score last year yeah and I think you know obviously Jarel you know was a good you know side man to that where they were kind kind of ham and egg things I think this year the teams just a little bit different again I think its going to be a tough Scout because you have no idea whos going to be that lead SC I mean obviously everybody expects a DJ Burns to be that that guy but I think hes going to get double team so much this year and theyre going to try to get the ball of his hands if someone else iss going to have to step up lower Brown goes one of two and diara whos knocked down a couple of Threes pulls in another rebound hes got eight points now 10 rebounds so double double watch for modar there is the double double on the feed from DJ Burns great pass and he has such good patience he takes his time and tries to figure out where that double teams coming from he sees its Baseline and makes the right play State replacing leading scorers year overyear trivia question as Morgan short on the three the last NC State player to lead them in scoring backto back years I know I I spoiled this one for your pregame Scott I was just curious if you knew it took you a while to get I I my original guess was Cat Barber uh and I thought hard about TJ Warren but then I realized TJ couldnt have done it um and then eventually we got the CJ Leslie CJ Leslie a guy you played with the last NC State player to lead them in scoring in backto back Applause Music Seasons burs playing with those three fouls double comes again not to be theres morcel his first basket thats the effort youre always going to get out of case hes always in there battling doesnt matter if hes not the biggest guy on the court but just in there battling gets the offensive rebound and finishes hes the eighth player for NC State to score tonight again he was the leading scorer in their exhibition and again it might be a different leading score every night tough move by Smith that was pretty on the tear drop I think coach wants them to be a little bit higher on that switch again especially when its guard to guard they always tell you to switch high and that time okell was a little bit late so he was able to get downhill and finish Burns Morel DJ horn three of the best candidates maybe to lead this team in scoring of course this is their last year of Eligibility so they might have to oh tough tough play here and malora brown right now theyre playing four on five as hes just now getting to his feet on the other Music side might have to replace the leading scorer again how about a double double in your debut Scott thats big time from Mohamed diara well and obviously seeing him in practice he just plays so hard he does everything the right way and again I think because this guy right here is going to get so much attention and a lot of double teams are going to come off Dr because theyre going to think hes not as good of a shooter hes going to have opportunities well coach Kei said that diara was maybe their most consistent maybe their best player in the off season coming in so this is not coming as a surprise to this willpack staff uh the type of game that he has put together here timeout Citadel NC State ballooning the lead to 18 points and Mohamad diar a big part of that obviously his is scoring his rebounding as well but look he made four threepointers All Season at Missouri last year weve already seen him knock down to I hate to tell you theres something in PNC Arena that just brings out the shooters and everybody and he is knocking down shots it also helps all of these are coming off with paint touches so theyre getting the penetration theyre making the kick those are always the easiest ones for Shooters is to be able to get it inside out contest late knock it down good to see him shake off that lower body injury come back in knock down the three and whether it is diara or Burns Middle Brooks Parker this is an NC State team that has more depth particularly in the front Court yeah and that can maybe help to some of that inside out that youre talking about in those paint touches yeah and its going to be interesting especially you know theyve kind of gone to a two big lineup so especially when they kind of play some smaller teams if theyre still going to kind of utilize that so thats one of the things especially going forward are they going to be able to utilize a diara and a DJ Burns at the same time both of these teams had five score in double figures in their exhibition NC State three in double figures o Connell and burns with 14 diara with 10 its just AJ Smith by his Lonesome right now for the cital again hes done most of his work at the line I think especially if theyre going to creep back back into this game somehow Madison dur is going to have to get going and theyre going to have to start to get some defensive stops CC States got some really good looks theyve been patient and knock down shots when they need to all right so out of the timeout said itll have one remaining its Smith hes been cooking not this Music time nice little quick hitter they got the pick and roll action thats one of the things we talked about G getting DJ Burns involved especially on the defensive end just missed the shot driving kick Music diara oh not the three on one end but he gets the big block on the other horn a pullup too strong hustle play diara kept it alive but maybe a chance two on one Roberts with an easy finish and even though missed the shot he sprinted back got the block on the one end and almost got the offensive rebound those are the type of things especially as coaches you want to see and then the Citadel took advantage of it able to push it made a good bounce pass and finish on the offensive Music end see State play a different lineup with Brion pass now in alongside horn late in the shot clock really good defensive possession there and I think the Citadel theyve gone a little bit smaller so I think DJ will have a little bit more Advantage but I think theyre trying to create some Havoc especially on the defensive end and create some mismatches on the offensive end foul on Roberts will take us to our break Mohamed diara having an incredible debut with a double double still seven plus minutes to play Music for the eighth time in the last 11 years NC State picked seven in the preseason the 15 team ACC no players named preseason all AC thats a hard decision you just havent seen enough I could tell you uh flip Kowski would be a good safe pick though yes yeah but I think number 30 might have something to say about that of course he was honorable mention last year looking to drop a dime there to Bon pass instead its a turnover Bulldog trying to make something happen its Christian Moore in transition thats a great job by AJ Smith getting that paint touch weve talked about it multiple times the best shots come from that paint touch and then makes the right play just the eighth NC State turnover the C will make him Applause pay DJ porn off the ball screen hesitation this just two for 11 tonight the middle Applause Brooks yeah both horn and Morel struggling offensively dur had it taken away had a really good possession they missed a couple threes they got the turnover on this end but again I think Ben Middlebrooks is giving them some of that energ energy very similar to Michael Connell theyre making the right plays again nothing in the stat sheet May stand out although connells you know leading them in scoring and getting some assists but its one of those things that kind of goes unnoticed at times still some time left in this game but one of the big takeaways so far you know what youre getting with DJ Burns but the other post diara and middle Brooks they are showing that they can be big contributors and this is what NC State loves to do turn you over got to love it when you see a shooter on the rim you dont see it very often anymore I feel like although I will say I feel like the athletes are a little different than when I played Music I dont know you you played with some great players and obviously against some great players as well yeah these training staffs man theyre I dont know what theyre pumping into some of these guys but theyre just theyre faster theyre stronger they just look a little bit different than when I was running out there Applause this is where the citadels really needs to get some stops not give up an easy one and then get out and transition midd Brook Spence Baseline runs into a wall of two Music Applause Music Defenders oh its more colliding with his teammate Kobe mallister whos seeing his first minutes and ends up being wolfb basketball oconnell back on the floor for the first time in a Music while seeing a lot of different lineups Taylor the young man from Indianapolis if youre from Indiana you can shoot yeah Perry Meridian I believe High School uh I tell everybody I had the choice of being a shooter and play basketball could or I could farm and I just wasnt cut out for Applause that thats oh look pass by Mo inside the hill for two thats really good movement they just kept moving the ball attacking you know coach mentioned they want to see different lineups theyve got a little bit unique lineup on the court that we really havent seen and theyre getting some good defensive possessions and starting to really move the ball in the offensive Music end Taylor knocking down that three in his NC State debut hes now has eight points its a big transition for him remember hes from Indie and Hill throws down the flush hes from Indie and played at PL so coming to NC State this is the furthest that hes ever been from home its definitely adjustment its adjustment for all these kids how much of an adjustment was it for you it was a lot I was I was one of the lucky ones when my parents were were there frequently uh but again all these freshmen got to go through that transition they got to get used to the physicality they got to get used to the Music speed this will be the under four mediate timeout wolb leading by 15 but the Bulldogs again Winston pass Winston Hill just does a good job sealing inside middle Brooks needs to push him outside that uh semicircle a little bit and a good Music finish back with Scottwood Andrew Sanders here a look at the scores tonight for NC State three in double figures and you look its four guys making their debut exciting stuff for NC State yeah I mean thats one of the things that weve mentioned you know obviously NC State lost a lot of scoring so whos going to fill that void and I think tonight youre kind of seeing it its just going to be a team effort night in night out and you see DJ horn back in his home City yes two for 12 he struggled from the field but I tell you what hes got the six points he also has six rebounds and four assists hes had the ball in his hands a lot hes done a lot as Marcus Pam Glides to the rim and hes also been very good defensively I think thats one of the things again I havent heard a lot of that on the defensive end but hes guarded at a really high level tonight as well first Collegiate basket for Pam The Freshman out of Whitney Young High School in Chicago where they were City Music Champs big to Big post to post you bet not every not very often you see a post toost pass from block to block and get the bucket Music Applause thats more kicks out three ball mallister Applause Music Applause n coach Conroy play some of his freshman here down the stretch more so thats what he can do in transition 41 last year and he gets it to fall I know he did not want to finish this game without making one so its going to set him up for a for a good next game thats for sure at 78 last year thats his first here this season tough move by Moore how did he get that over the front of the rim nicely done great finish Music Taylor no and itll be Music Applause fouled kyp know your personnel knock down threepoint shooter from the left wing get it to him early so he can set his feet and knock it down Casey Morel fan favorite here organized a basketball camp over the summer its sold out thats what a lot of these you know a lot of these players are starting to do a little bit more theyre starting to get a little bit more involved in the community um I mean honestly all the kids especially around the university anywhere love watching these kids so anytime they can put something on you know theyre going to fill it up he organized it all in about a month and it honestly took him by surprise a little bit he said uh that that it sold out so quickly and and that took me by surprise a little bit I think he maybe didnt understands the the impact that hes maybe had in the community and like you said the number of kids that want that kind of experience especially any time somebody like him is is high level thats kids want to learn they want to be around them ask them questions whether theyre silly questions or basketball questions so good for him to kind of get back in the community and have one of those camps he said it was a great experience he would definitely do it again he had torren Dorne who is a great player at NC State come and be a motivational speaker torrins one of the good ones too I think hes out with the uh I want to say Salt Lake City uh the developmental team was on staff with State um last year and is since then moved uh out west official review here under two minutes to play ball was knocked out of bounds and who touched it last Im going off the wolf pack yes that one is conclusive I am one for one for my career just saying shoot a th000 300 gets you in the Hall of Fame we talking baseball now yeah I wish Trey Cher would have been able to pull it out I enjoyed watching that Phillies run but it was good to see I I enjoyed Texas I really did take another look Im going tell NC State womens basketball head coach Westmore you said that Big Texas Rangers Fan celebrated that one just got a good roster but yet you were at NC State during that time with Trey Turner caros trodon yeah Brett Austin really good group made the College World Series back in Applause 2013 Sido also did it back in the early 90s with their current baseball coach Tony skull also Louisville head coach Dan McDonald and Mississippi State head coach Chris lonis they all were in school at the same time with Coach Applause Conroy and thatll be a shot clock violation you make a b baseball reference you didnt know we were going to talk baseball like that Citadel great tieing all right lets look upcoming schedule for NC State Friday night AB Christian right here on the ACC Network extra and then Charleston Southern before they get Vandy out in Vegas over Thanksgiving yeah a few matchups theyre going to have to try and figure out kind of kind of what they have and then once they really get in towards the the end of November its going to be a its going to be a tough lineup couple of subs for NC State LJ Thomas and Ernest Ross seeing their first minutes here with a minute 21 left to go along with Parker morcel and Music Applause Music Taylor traveling violation on Taylor going to say anytime you can shake three guys you got to be doing something that doesnt that doesnt work split two Music Defenders three on pass will replace Applause Taylor nine points three rebounds and an assist in is wolfback Debut one minut the calister tough Music Applause Drive wolf pack still getting after defensively though and mmers amongst the fans because there is Ry State fans that are familiar with the uh chicken promotion its back this year missed two free throws free chicken for everybody in attendance Ive got two kids I could use it Colby mallister he was a perfect 12 for 12 last year from the strike hes not the candidate you would think would miss both uh I would say typically a good shooter the hardest one to make is the first one then once you get a feel for the ball especially if you Haven been in the game much second ones a little easier but he also does have a roaring crowd and a bunch of substitutions to freeze them and knife them out KJ Keats Alex NY and Jordan Snell all into the game for NC State loud as its been all day c chicken possession arrow going the way of the Music Bulldogs Le by per into this game along with Quint neelon both of then making their colle debuts itll be PM shooting here and the Cs got to be saying why arent they yelling as loudly for him as they were for me yeah I dont think they can double up on the chicken I think thats that should be that should be something they should Implement if we get two of them double chicken sounds good to me one for each kid big rebound there Tony Cario I will will say the one thing especially with the Citadel I think theyve got some really good pieces I think obviously theyre a little bit younger ball Club mixed in with some you know upper classmen but I think this is something that coach wanted to see wanted to get everybody some minutes kind of figure out what hes got especially over these next few games before they really get into the you know bulk of their schedule kind of figure out what pieces he has in place so I think you know even though the score may not show it I think they did some things well I think they still got to handle some pressure um but they they brought it tonight they had some good energy and the same thing on the other I think coach Keat saw some guys really step up I think hes going to realize that you know hes got five or six that could easily lead this team each night and its just going to make it a tough Scout for other Music opponents this is Alex Music nunnelly Music Applause Music shot clock Music Applause off nice pass Carpio with the flush on the dish by Levi burkholz so the Bulldogs end it on a high note Thomas will dribble it out and NC State one and0 in this new year as they take it 72 59 the final score the Wolfpack has won 2
