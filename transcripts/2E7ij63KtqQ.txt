today its wong olani and mcgusty in the backcourt with walker and nasir brooks back into the starting lineup in the front court bert smith jerry heater and mark schner officiating today im evan brian in the suite next to me here in miami and we are excited to tip off this saturday in acc basketball six games on the docket and here we go from the watsco center and brooks wins the tip against aluma hurricanes in the white with a basketball first an interesting ryan no harlan beverly in the starting lineup hes been in the starting five 14 of their 17 games so wong initiates the offense on his first Music possession brooks trying to go at aluma forcing him to defend hell kick it for walker hes had that shot lately anthony walker four of seven from three his last few ball games but all for one today yeah evan i think miami the success for them today is that theyve got to be able to drive virginia tech and get into the basket theyre not one of the better threepoint shooting teams in the conference so you dont want to rely too much on that threepoint shot today 29 points last weekend and then 30 on wednesday and an air ball to start things today good possession good defensive possession by miami and what they have to do is make sure that they guard a lumen by committee limit them to one and done and obviously theyve got to stay on top of the threepoint shooters from virginia tech interesting 60 seconds taken off the clock on those first two possessions mike young says he wants this to be a half court game he doesnt want to try to get into a running gun game with the keynes olani off the mark and aluma grabs another rebound for the hokies virginia tech has never lost to miami as a ranked team theyre a perfect 50 against the keynes when ranked miami leads the alltime series 2418 today the 43rd meeting between these former big east rivals jalen cone back rims the three and isaiah wong grabs the rebound miami doing a good job of switching all of the picks and screens that way they always have an active defender in the front of a threepoint shooter you saw jalen coleman come up short walker on the drive this time and both teams are still scoreless two minutes in mike young calls him his most valuable player despite the fact thaluma is getting first team all acc consideration great defense by brooks justin muntz put it on the floor that was not a wise decision and the loose ball scooped up by wong for miami scrappy defense by miami and again you see with brooks being a little bit more physical with iluma not allowing him to be able to bully him down there impressive defensive intensity for both teams early this early tipoff eighties on Applause that shot makes miami oh for four now and evan if youre virginia tech you want to keep miami on the perimeter because again we talked about them not being a great threepoint shooting team and then beatty is one of those guys as a lockdown defender being able to keep the ball right in front of him whos gonna break the ice for us brian will it be nahima lean doesnt look like it jalen cohen with two to shoot blocks and shot clock expired before the ball hit anything out of bounds so the hokies are over three with 2 turnovers miami doing a good job in uc that last time walker recovering again at 67 being able to get to that shot by jalen cohn miami doing a good job of being able to switch under on the perimeter and stay in front of those guys doing a good job also challenging those shots officially over three with three turnovers cam mcgusty from the corner no sir cohn had the rebound fumbled it away and it finds much the strength for virginia tech is obviously getting the ball inside even with the luma justin buns is another one of those guys that you post him up and give him an opportunity to post up and put the ball on the floor spirited defensive effort from miami at the offset here you can say the same thing about virginia tech but aluma finally breaks the seal gets two a little over four minutes into the ball game well i like the fact for illumina he faced brooks up and realized that he can get to the shoddy youll see during the game i got it can shoot that ball over that left shoulder and the right shoulder with both hands Music with the defense at this end of the floor and its saved by a lean i mean kevin aluma has been a 93foot player in a revelation to most in the acc and i think to mike young as well certainly mike young didnt expect him to score 15 16 points a game when i like his mindset you know i saw in the quote after the pick game hes saying that hey ive got to do what i got to do to get my team a chance to win and thats me being aggressive you can tell that as of late not only is he hunting his shop hes taking advantage to be very precise and where he shoots the ball brian dont want to jinx this but were on pace for a really quick game we have not had a foul yet and Applause a timeout call by mike young i believe it was so thatll give us our first time out a little over five minutes gone the two teams dominate inside dominate the paint you know we talked about illumina and must be in those guys that can create issues with miami and for miami shot makers not shot takers and it looks like earlier on from miami theyre more shot takers than shot makers well there hadnt been a maker yet hurricanes were talking about the possibility of maybe getting chris likes back today but he is not in uniform did practice the last couple of days theyre thinking hes getting closer to returning but today is not that day justin goes right at nasir brooks everything but the bucket heres mcgusty drawn contact and who will get the first rethrow attempts of the game brian im curious to ask you personally i feel like the defenses have just been really good so far its not like the offenses have been that inept you agree i would agree and again for those out you of you are watching the game it seems like its really ugly but you got both teams playing solid defense for virginia tech thats what they do theyre going to be aggressive on the perimeter theyre going to lock down the lane miami has done a good job of being able to switch all of the perimeter stuff and limit virginia tech early and now a quick word from works android robotic lawnmower available at mylandroidcom the future of lawn care is here that was called on the himalayan and magusti cranes a pair to tie the game up at two the 20 lead is not gonna stand right aluma inside at brooks again chance for an and one aluma continues to make plays inside for the hokies and again for virginia tech doing a good job of being able to get illuma deep on the box that last time you saw a cross screen for him you see right there getting him deep a deep post and again being able to finish with a contact thats one of the things that we spoke with coach l he was really concerned with how they defend aluma because hes a guy thats been efficient off to a good start for them hes got all five for virginia tech dang gak into the game for the first time for miami replacing this year brooks dan gacks been with those guys as of late been very active from miami special around the rim and being able to finish on those dump offs and offensive putbacks Music augustine once aluma with five mcgusty with four through six minutes today at the watsco center and the nice play you saw walker come and set that pick and give mcgucy a run at the rim hes another one of those guys with his ability to shoot the ball outside makes the defense have to play him for that drive or the three to pull up for him hunter couture is in the game for mike youngs hokies double comes on mutts so hell reverse it for beady shot clocks at one aluma finally realizes that graze is iron and wong has another rebound for the canes great possession by miami yikes bad pass by wong Applause long still has not taken a field goal attempt the leading scorer for the keynes on the drive much hits the cutting aloma for the stuff and thats another thing about justin moss you know hes going to put his his player down in the post but hes a guy on the perimeter can put the ball in floor you see a nice blowby force to help good read by getting a slashing illuminate to the basket you think mutz and aluma have played together for years the way they have chemistry together inside well i love muds and his versatility especially being about six eight wongs first shot rims out gack on the glass puts it back up and in and again were talking about dane gack and what hes meant for this ball club as of late this is a guy that hadnt had much time playing the last three years but this year more active around the rim again with his length good offensive rebound and put back contact inside and then 11 of his last 17 more points in the last four games than he had in his previous 11 offensive foul on a lean and thats his second if you look at miami and what theyve lost in sam wardenberg and then rodney miller then the deal to have a dane gag come in to play as well as he has of late again makes coachells life a lot easier because again gives them somebody that can crash the boards and someone with length on the defensive end Music augustine working on couture months on walker heres harlan beverly and now gaff has had the hot hand lately over illuma no good the rebound for justin virginia tech does a good job of being able to cut off the dribble penetration you saw three guys try to get into the lane good help and recover not allowing them to be able to have a free run at the rim joe bamasil not bashful off the bench rebound mcgusty again no it wont stay down for him not a great finish but i love the fact that that gag saw an opportunity to slip there brian we are eight and a half minutes into the game only three players have scored luma has all seven for the hokies augusti and gak have the points for miami beatty trying to get it on the act no and if im miami ill ill allow beauty to have that shot you know hes a guy thats not a good threepoint shooter on the drive mcgusty off the glass and again cameron mcguzzy hes that guy again because you have to honor the threepoint shot really active and strong around the rim off to a good start miami has his first lead up 87 hunter couture he cant leave him open hell make your pay you saw harlan beverly caught sleep and good read by justin mutts couture is one of those guys averaging almost 14 a game with the last three 18 for his last 37 from three just to shade under 50 in his last eight games including today isaiah wong takes the dish from illumina and scores and evan one of the things that makes the bigs for virginia tech so good and illumina and all so much is that you see both of them very good passers especially out of the low post weve seen on multiple occasions both guys diving up their teammates augustine has been the aggressor for the miami offense hes got six of their eight points meanwhile kevin aluma seven points a couple of rebounds and now this assist to bamisil pokies by four midway through the hat Music treat yourself to 799 sundays at the fresh market featuring bone in new york strips 10 minutes today brian the honda startup presented by honda dealers of the carolinas and aluma has been the energy guy early for virginia tech hey one of the things we talked about him his ability to be able to score you know and put the ball on the floor he can put you know guards and forwards in difficult positions i like the fact that hes always active does a good job of being able to finish over either shoulder they struggled earlier but they found some early offense and kevin luma has been the guy to get them all started hes a human development major and that seems appropriate because no one in college basketball has developed like he has the last few years taking a red shirt year last year after a freshman season at wofford where he played sparingly average two and a half points three and a half rebounds a game and i mean virginia tech fans certainly familiar with his story didnt play much basketball until high school was a soccer player as a kid center back for his youth soccer team isaiah wong quick catch and hell draw the foul on couture and free throws coming for isaiah wong theyre 77 from the line you saw isaiah wong come off of that pick and normally the inbounder should shade a little bit to allow the guy thats actually trailing him enough time to recover interesting to see if isaiah won gets going this is a guy too that you know has been the leading scorer for miami but if theyre going to win this game today theyre going to need him to be able to step up and be able to get his offense going four double figures six straight ball games hidden double figures all but two of his 17 games this year he goes one of two with the line to bring miami back within three with no kevin aluma on the on the floor look for them to get justin mutts more involved especially in the low post speedy couture and theres a turnover wong the steal isaiah off balance gets it to go Applause i mean again you look at what isaiah wong has been able to do throughout the year i mean this guy with no chris likes for most of the season has been able to be not only a shot maker but the leader for her for miami and coming up with defensive plays too off the catch see bemidseal come on comes off the bench hunting his offense again you can tell when he comes off that screen trying to get that left foot shot set so he can get that jump shot joe bamasil as you said looking for his shot first ever acc points here in the first half for famously all of his points had come in the nonconference going back to the freshman who scurries to the bucket nice move but he couldnt finish long the other way one on three excellent defense by bt mutts diving on the floor you see mike young over there and thats what he wants he wants his guys to be grimy he wants them to be able to get on the floor how about you see getting on the floor for it again beatty is that guy he disrupts the play again may not be glamorous because hes not scoring the points but hes definitely the leader of this virginia tech defense hey brian do those tights that mutts is wearing prevent him from getting all the raspberries on his knees that i got when i was a kid absolutely absolutely i wish those were around back in my day i cant believe i just said back in my day that means im officially an old dude i could have told you that you can you can still knock it down from three ive seen you shoot am i going to cory alexander your day meant well at the rim though by gak good defense by gak and what he did is that he went straight up as he saw luma coming to the basket again his length has been really good you see cameron augustine being able to fill it up augustines got eight here in the half eight of miamis 11 augustine and aluma really the only guys in bamaso maybe that have it going offensively so far hassan gives it to aluma brooks back in defensively thought about it whats the flip always aluma control nice baseline fee shot would go and a rebound for the big man brooks great defense you saw brooks shade the baseline trying to force the help there whats impressed you most about the defensive effort from both teams so far well i think from miami how theyre guarding aluma and then you see back traveling back with the travel but with virginia tech you know theyre going to be physical theyre not going to allow you to get to everything and you see as we go to commercial both teams back and forth virginia tech with a narrow onepoint lead and certainly has not been a day at the beach so far for virginia tech or miami hard fought 13 minutes played jim laranegas team trailing by one Music hurricanes it was hard to believe they performed as well as they did on monday night against duke their previous four games before that were all doubledigit losses they had a quick turnaround after losing at wake and isaiah wong had turned his ankle the end of that game last saturday looked no worse for wear on monday night though and they just played a great game against coaches the blue devils on monday well and i think that when we talked about the guys that produced for them you know their ability to be able to drive the ball and finish i think they put duke on their heels early and then they just out tough to i saw when i saw that game it was just too tough for him but coach k called his team soft after the game miami shot 61 in the second half they were five for six from three after halftime against the blue devils back in with two fouls way off he has been chilly lately one of the things that im impressed with miami when you see uh brooks guarding aluma hes shading him to the baseline with baseline help miami has decided that theyre going to make sure that they have a second defender to help out beverly on the drive gets it to go after it off the bracket miami doing a better job of being able to get to the lane and what theyre doing evan is there theyre shifting the defense by good ball movement back and forth that last time you were able to see the penetration by beverly in the finish third lead change of the half oh saw lane and takes it for two we saw the defender go off and he saw the backside help there leaving must wide open good recognition by aluma mutz has been so good lately hasnt he yeah again i just like the fact that hes officially lets the game come to him you know a guy can score down low and i like the fact that as a big guy can definitely read the defense and make the good pass too cam augustine buries a three hes in a double figures with 11 of miamis 18 and you can tell by the way hes putting the ball down that hes feeling himself realizing that hey he can get the shot that he wants hes trying to set him up that last time hunter couture whos a really good defender as a good night get caught reaching for the ball better shooter then he is a defender and he buries his second three again couture one of the guys has been shooting the ball extremely well from behind the arc i like the fact that he came off of that screen ready to shoot a lot of times with shooters and make sure you get your feet set good pass into that shooting pocket all of a sudden brian these two teams cant miss miamis hit its last three shots dad pass that time looking for brooks justin mutts were talking about him with mike young this morning hes listed at six seven which was a little surprising to see that because he plays bigger than that kind of in a similar way that tyrese radford whos currently suspended is listed at 62 but plays bigger than that for virginia tech well we talked earlier too about how teams uh can have their rhythm thrown off and how the season has been with the start stops you know its hard to develop chemistry but when you look at the chemistry between mutts and illumina you can tell that those are two guys that play well off each other you see the high low action and the and one by much tough inside maneuver from the delaware transfer and what do you see is that you see the highlow action you see mutts great position down there on walker being able to finish with the opposite end and that was one of the things too we talked about the ability of virginia tech to put the pressure on miamis defense by pounding the ball inside matts unable to complete the threepoint play by the way we mentioned tyreese radford virginia tech releasing a statement before the game today that radford has traveled with the hokies for the first time since he was indefinitely suspended mike young saying there is a path for him to return present potentially this week which is big news for virginia tech elijah oladi goes baseline to the bucket nice basketball ilani being able to drive the baseline and use the rim to shield off the defender thats another guy for coachells team that can create create instant offense his ability to put the ball on the floor trying to create some more instant offense theres tyrese radford gator mask on certainly hopeful to get back in as according to mike young expressed remorse for what happened that provoked his indefinite suspension Music i encourage you to stick around the ford fast break is coming up some point in the second half so keep an eye out for it Applause luma makes them both hes got nine evan one of the things that miamis been able to do in the first half is that do better job with their ball spacing and that allows them to be able to penetrate and force the help last saturday at wake den gack made his first career collegiate threepointer thought about taking one there instead the cross court pass sails into the hokies bench and hurricanes turn it over for the fifth time hokies have five turnovers too we got ourselves a really competitive ball game here point against syracuse in january guy has played over 100 games in his college career starting at oklahoma and now here at miami seems like there are fewer guys who havent transferred brian then who have transferred theyve all transferred during their career and obviously justin mutts has and what youve seen is that players are realizing that they get to a place and it may not be a particular split fit and take an opportunity to see nice another transfer nasir brooks the former bearcat floats it in nice move by brooks being able to go with that little baby hook there miami doing a good job of getting stops and being able to capitalize on the end aluma extra defender came adam were basically seeing as aluma rises for three no well besides defender is leaving beaty to go double and what miami is doing with the theyre being physical with brooks on the other end you see nice little pass brooks cant finish brooks couldnt finish but back to miami theyre pushing aluma off the box and then theyre shading him with another defender realizing that theyll go ahead and double off abedi oh nice drive to the bucket justin mutts and we talked about his ability to be able to finish musk being able to split the defense Applause mike youngs the one that called the timeout you see justin moss being able to get through with a nice little euro step through in the left nasir brooks there nice penetration again i really like justin mutts and just what he does for this virginia tech team all mutts 12 points eight rebounds per game over the last three and that coincides with radfords departure mutts has really stepped up his game has had more opportunities offensively taking advantage and heres one of the things that when you talk about radford not being around is that it allows some of the other players to step up their game and weve seen that in being justin mutts you may see hunter couture and then also jalen cohn when he comes back having him come in because radford is not a guy that youve got to run a lot of plays for he plays off the team hes very aggressive and so hes going to fit right back in to whenever he comes back jalen cohen started this game but hes only played five of the first 18 minutes brian has not scored Music Applause takes another charge or you saw dane gag trying to penetrate right there must do a good job of being able to rotate anytime you see a big put the ball on the floor like that you see mutts right there and if the gak was paying attention he would have stopped gather himself could have had a nice little dump off there to nasir brooks first foul on gak there are only seven total fouls for the two teams that have been called so far in the game aluma into double figures now with 11 and evan that play was set by great ball screen by hunter couture crawl screen there you see another timeout and this ones called by jim larineg he hasnt liked the defensive effort over the past couple of possessions Music so a buck 33 to play in this first half acc has three coaches named jim and three coaches named mike and we got jim versus mike here in miami today two guys that have been doing this for a long time as we take a look at todays acc leaders brought to you by whole foods market here they are justin champagne leading the league and scoring and rebounding xavier johnson scored 32 in the win over virginia tech sorry to remind hokey fans of that notre dames nate liszeski georgia techs jose alvarado also on that list how about justin champagne you know a guy that leads the league and double doubles you know and then the fact that he was out with that knee spring came back and had some really big games for them yeah he got a little bit lucky in the fact that pittsburgh was on pause three for olani he only missed two games despite the fact that he was out three four weeks i like the fact you saw a lot of heat knocking down that three that was set up by wong being able to pull two defenders on that penetration to the baseline bt gets it to go kimberly kind of looked at the ceiling like really that ones going to go in well it seemed like that was a friendly friendly rim right there but going into the half in miami you want to be able to get some kind of penetration something at the rim long over beating ill tell you what beat hes done a really nice job on wong here in the first half and theres another three for elijah olani and that play was set up by the offensive rebound but nasir brooks giving ilani an opportunity to be able to set up him elijah he has come up and he stepped up and given miami a nice little surge was it his offense quick little 62 run to bring the hurricanes back within one mutts draws contact and i think its going to be number two on nasir brooks and if youre in miami you cant allow justin must to be able to back down a lot of heat like that youve got to send someone there to be an enforcer to pass that ball we talked about doubling off of a bt you got to be able to get to him quick especially as you go into the half with some kind of momentum so heres mutts back to the line with just 15 seconds remaining in the half coming up at the half well have our toyota halftime report toyota driven segment featuring jim larinega 10th year coach at miami also first half highlights and stats you know if the hurricanes win today jim laranega will tie gary williams the former maryland and boston college coach for 36 alltime five seconds left for beverly to gusty and hes blocked by couture who is out of bounds and there are four tenths of a second for miami how about that recovery by hunter couture being able to block that shot without foul four tenths of a second you cant do a catch and shoot flip it inside defended well really good half for justin mutts he had eight points two rebounds two assists aluma had 11 points four rebounds five assists and the post players for the hokies have fit the difference miami though hanging tough hokies by three at halftime today 3128 but a lot of work to do brian oliver because miami is a team that has not gone away about 15 seconds away from the teams emerging to start to second half and im curious to ask him we talk a lot about aluma how he can do it inside and do it outside if youre jim laranega which would you prefer do you want to make him a post guy or a perimeter guy well i think that what theyve done is they uh being able to push him off the post i thought earlier brooks was doing a good job of being physical with him and then what theyre doing is theyre shading him to the baseline with some offside help i think that they have to continue to do that and i think that for virginia tech keep pounding the ball inside if its not to illumina theyve been able to get the ball to mutts success at being able to spread virginia tech out past the ball and get to the lane a little bit more often and then force the help and as of late weve seen to be able to find ilanahi for a threepoint shot official stack keeper did take an assist away from aluma and gave it months so instead of having eleven four and five hes got eleven four and four and beady rare turnover to start the second half looking for aluma inside i thought that bd could be just a little bit more patient and allow illumina to get himself set a lot of times when guys are coming out and running a play they dont allow the play to develop just a little bit more patience allowed him to be able to get his defender on his backside first turnover for bt hes got about a two to one assistant turnover ratio for the season see if isaiah wong can get going so far its been mcgusty whos had the hot hand and that continues how about the pogba he was able to freeze beady by coming off with a nice little fake over to uh wong nice little runner before he went two for 12 on monday against duke mcguffey had scored 50 points in his previous three ball games so he had been hot struggled against duke rediscovered the stroke today oh justin mutts shows his outside touch its his first three since january the 12th i like the spacing of that last time that play was set up by a lean forcing the help and then getting over the bus to knock it down augustine to the basket lets again chance for a threepoint play for mcgusty miami coming out of the half and you see running a nice little stagger for cameron augusts second time you see him being able to get there and you see the weak side help thank your pardon they just call late basket interference count in the basket no foul but mcgusty with 15 including four in the first 70 seconds of the second half evan youve seen miami run that same play back to back for virginia tech that guys gotta hold long enough to allow the defender whos trailing to recover nice little curl by mcgusty being able to get into the lane back to back both these teams run good stuff tell theyve got smart guys coaching heres aluma rising for three left it short and mcgusty had the rebound and lost it mud scoops it up aluma runs over olani but his feet were in the restricted area so its a defensive block and free throws coming for kevin again when you saw luma come in right there big guys normally barrel over and you see him gather himself and like you say alani he was in that restricted area ive enjoyed the ive really enjoyed the scrappiness from both teams on defense you can tell miami has come out and definitely been really aggressive in virginia can you check you see how aggressive it is you see aluma have that one roll out on them now a quick word from coyote tracker at coyote we hold dirt in the highest regard coyote we dig dirt one or two at the line for keve aluma originally from berlin maryland a small town on marylands eastern shore on the delmarva peninsula wong fouled by beatty thats a rare defensive mistake from wabisa to get him over there and beating normally a guy that stays disciplined that last time hand caught in the cookie jar you dont want to foul the shooter you see long get there with a little bit of separation beady a little too aggressive challenging that shot Applause jose wong the sophomore one of two new jersey natives in miami starting five teams a lot of college coaches do you got a play thats working go back to it youve seen miami run that same play four times in a row where theyve gotten three baskets and then when theyve got a foul good to see them go back to running that that play to get them some offense ali knocks down the three and mike young takes a quick timeout Applause aleenes three stretches the lead to five matching the largest of the game 4136 virginia tech in control i mean one of the things we talked about is the fact that miami has run this play where theyve had the iso with wong and running a stagger for either mcgusty or ilanahi and theyve scored on all four of those situations you saw two baskets by mcgusty one by ilani and another on the iso where it allowed isaiah wong to be able to score and again if im jim laranega i keep running this play until virginia tech proves that they can stop it okies this year 30 after a loss havent lost two straight since the tail end of last season augustines three wont go and beady grabs the rebound for the hookies on the other end virginia tech has had a lot of success by being able to run that screen to screen or action get the ball in the post aluma surveys finds a lean mutts takes it uh looking for illuma inside he wasnt expecting the pass long ahead for walker to the basket one of the things that we have not seen a lot from miami is to be able to get out in transition and thats what they want to do get a stop on one end get the ball out and running and then again nice finish by anthony walker good push ahead and delivered by wong walker coming off a 16point game against duke thats his first points of the day and he completes a threepoint play of the baltimore native makes it a twopoint game again evan one of the things that youre seeing a little bit more is that miami is opting to go in and double in the post when they get the ball over to aluma again you see them playing off of wabisabiti and that basically forces them to play fouronfive and yet bds value defensively presumably is too much for coach young to take him out or how does bd take advantage of this at the other end of the floor well hes going to be able to take that shot as you see a lean get into the paint and knock down that shot not be afraid to shoot that a lot of times ball goes inside maybe be an active picker and catch someone sleeping for a backdoor cut Applause petey has done a good job on isaiah wong holding him just five points only one field goal augustines been the guy thats hurt virginia tech the most augustian olani who again unbelievably gets it to go and those are the two guys that we were highlighting going into the half mcgucy and olanihi and you see that last time good penetration by mcgusky getting the ball over and you see miami being able to cut into that lead again great penetration and finish by ilanahi miami cutting it close down by two in the truck game greatness is defined well these two teams met on december 29th in blacksburg where it is about 45 degrees colder today than it is here in miami in that game brian the hurricanes nearly overcame a 17 point second half deficit miami was 54 from the floor for that game its its the only time all year that an opponent has shot better than 50 against virginia attacking at the hokies still won start the second half today miamis five of six how are they getting such easy looks well i think that they found the offense and ilana he and augustine again we talked about their sets and being able to spread virginia tech out thats one of the things i think that theyve made an improvement on at the half and again for virginia tech i keep pounding the ball inside stay active and then force miami to double if theyre going to stay committed to that foul before the break was on bamisil his first aulani now with 13 points Music no on a rebound pulled down by mcgusty cam coast to coast no tip no loose ball scooped up by bamasil missed opportunity there i want you to watch the next time when you see illumina get the ball how far this here brooks is forcing him to get the ball off the blocks being physical with him again aluminum hes going to be off the block either put the ball in the floor and try to get by catches beyond the arc this time hits the cutting couture rebound tip by walker controlled by wong long season open lane kicks it for aulani Music virginia tech ranked 16th in the nation on wednesday night brian there were five different ranked teams that lost to unranked teams so the hokies were not alone and getting knocked off their ranked pedestal on wednesday night its kind of the nature of college basketball this year same teams pop into the polls and then pop out of the polls one week to the next well and again weve talked about that as far as the momentum when you see teams due to the kobe protocol having to shut down and then having advantage you see good defense by virginia tech forcing miami to call a timeout cam augustine was trapped these are two of the teams though that have not had to really pause their schedules for protocols theyve had a little bit of interruptions mostly due to other teams but the hokies the hurricanes and the tar heels leading the league in games played entering the day 17 games apiece the hokies 13 and four the hurricanes are 7 and 10 the craziest thing miami among the league leaders in games played also among the league leaders in different starting lineups because theyve had so many guys in and out of the lineup well and i think that thats interesting when you look at miami and how theyve been decimated by injuries you talk about obviously not having chris likes you talk about no sam wardenberg rodney miller that you talk about and not having timberlake theyve had so many different starting lineups and you could hear the frustration in jim larenegas voice we talked to him the other day but i think right now miami has put themselves in a very good position right now to be able to be in control of this game aulani unable to give miami the lead with that fade away jumper and jim larranaga was asked by local media yesterday jim if you had everybody that you expected where do you think youd be in the acc right now after playing almost everybody in the league and the tough question is a nice jumper vanishing has been a revelation today i mean look at bama said when you see him get the ball he is looking to get his off i mean you can tell from the beginning of the game this is the guy thats come in ultra athletic has been able to be aggressive on the offensive end very active for mike young a gusty double clutch layup wont go but the rebound tipped out of bounds itll stay with miami bama still has nine points today hadnt scored an acc game prior to today and jim laranega basically said look i liked my team i thought we had good depth i thought we had experience with all of our starters back i always liked those if questions i mean my my response to that is if ifs and nuts were beers and nuts then you not have a party or if i had those powerball numbers i wouldnt be sitting next to you right now sure you would nah i love you come on you see me somewhere in my feet in that in that nice miami uh water that we showed earlier couldnt leave the water for a couple of hours to join me for the ball game no way now you twist them all this doesnt work come on were the luckiest guys in the building today i would agree i would most definitely agree i mean especially when you look at how the season has gone and how many games weve been able to take part of and be in the arena youre not very fortunate oh my goodness talking about putting him on the poster oh my and that was set up by great recognition and getting the ball into brooks and him having illumina right there deep on the basket caught it in the right spot and flushed it with authority bamisil finds gassan how about those two bench guys off mike youngs pine offense and again weve talked about bama still and how hes been in this game i like the fact you can see that his face in his defensive stance taking advan advantage of the opportunity being aggressive normally scoring for himself but that last time a nice dime get the ball over to gassan augusti again trying to get downhill heres walker on the drive and one official jerry heater is going to wave off the basket it looked like mark schner would get ready to signal and one tim laranegas certainly thought it should count you see my gus you see anthony walker going into the reach in right there and you see that but then on the other end how about brooks you see how low hes got illumina and then put him on the poster oh my god you know to quote my daughter that was just downright disrespectful evan got to give hayden all of her invention thats her thing is that when she doesnt like something she gonna call it disrespectful we see again by gassan and brooks is going to get to the free throw line nice recognition by by long right there you see two defenders and then you see the recover and you see gassan love the fact that he comes over he looks over realizes that hey did i really foul him but sierra brooks i you really like the fact that hes been a pleasant surprise for jim larry on both ends of the floor this year great feature on brooks written by michelle kaufman of the miami herald earlier this week this year 10 siblings his grandmother taught him how to make eggs early in life and he fell in love with the kitchen and hes aspiring to be the seven foot chef that youve never met before jim larrone also just braves about brooke saying hes gonna do great things for humanity currently interning with an organization called empowered youth working with underprivileged kids and theres a culinary program and empowered youth that rook slots into very nicely nice recognition by b you realize hes got hunter couture and you cant cheat on him if anything youve got to stay close to him force him to put the ball on the floor good recognition i like the fact that couture took his time to come off that screen get his feet set it doesnt feel like every time miami gets within one or two virginia techs making a big shot see if Applause elijah gets it back outside for beverly spinning on couture who defended it pretty well but a better offensive play by harlan beverly when you look at miami now versus in the first half evan theyre doing a better job of being able to have their offense spread and that forces the help and that last time you saw harlan beverly here to gather himself and get some separation between he and couture heres couture again different result this time and wong grabs the board melanie doing a better job of being able to follow him off with that stagger and challenge that threepoint shot tell you wong has only got five points but hes got six rebounds and six assists in 23 minutes for jim laranegas hurricanes walkers tease it up and pretty good box out that time by gassan on brooks i would have liked to see anthony walker drive that ball right there because i think that hes best for being able to put the ball on the floor thats a shot that virginia tech is willing to give him gotta be willing to put a little bit more pressure put the ball in the floor i think thats an excellent point by you up and under too strong sir brooks got to realize if hes got the double coming hes got to protect that baseline offensive foul called on beverly to the dismay of the miami bench Music aluma takes the hit its the foul first foul on beverly youd be the judge charger block they called it of charge you cant put a price on love but if you did it 11 in the first half and yet virginia tech has not trailed here in the second half well i think that coming out coming out of the half is that miami has decided that every time he gets the ball on the post theyre gonna double and thats gonna force him to be able to make that extra pass but what youve seen is that virginia tech has been able to make the adjustment weve seen a couple of threes by hunter couture that youve seen other people from virginia tech step up and i think that going into the good of this game is that its going to be some adjustments because youve seen back and forth each team being able to do a good job of being able to execute their offense 20 to 6 in bench scoring lopsided bench score in numbers on wednesday in pittsburgh because xavier johnson didnt start for the first time all year came off the bench and scored 32 on the drive hanging in the air van is still too strong mutts gets a rebound kicks into a wide open bd for three and hes got to shoot that shot i mean regardless if hes only less than a 29 shooter hes got to shoot that shot to keep the defense honest good recognition by months get the ball out to the open man bds now got five points for virginia tech oh great defense there bamisil picks the pocket of brooks keeps his balance takes it all the way to the cup and how about ben still we talked about the fact that the guys whove got to pick it up for virginia tech he has been that guy coming up with that steal breakout performance for joe bamasil matching his career high with 11 doing it at both ends batman still being able to gather himself and talk about how athletic he is and since hes come out been super aggressive for mike young has been that shot in the arm again you talked about not having a jalen cohn he basically has robbed those minutes from going for this game yeah sure has cone started hasnt played in the second half though has only played five minutes all game isaiah wong hasnt really gotten going so far today and if im jim laranega thats not the shot we want you know were down by seven virginia tech has made a run we want to get the ball inside again i dont like that shot because you you dance with the ball and you should have contested air ball three holani coming back in replacing walker seven point gap now as wide as it has been throughout the entire game if im virginia tech i run either something to get bust the ball inside or im running couture off of a stagger to see if we can get a wide open three theyre going to bama still hes had the hot hand a little heat check the ball came back to him ricochets for gassan the dutch freshman creates another possession for the hokies back to bamisil was a bigtime scorer in high school 28 a game as a junior before he was hurt as a senior justin mutts nice iso for months you realize that he had the big and nasir brooks over there on the island being able to blow by seven nothing run for virginia tech and jim laranega has seen enough he takes a timeout with 8 46 to play again you mentioned mutts he can do it in a variety of ways like aluma and you see him being able to do the blowby defense late on the recovery a lot of times you get a big out there on the island with a guy like justin mutts we talked about him in his ability to be able to put the ball on the floor and then finish forcing the timeout and getting jim larinega to get his troops back together mutts in the double figures for the eighth time this season hes got 13 double figures in three of his last four games since tyrees radford went out with the indefinite suspension so evan i think that when you look at virginia tech being up nine there are two things that happen because you saw that miami seemed like they had the momentum virginia tech couldnt stop virginia tech picked up their defense on the perimeter became more physical with them then they were able to get their their looks inside by either getting the ball to months and you saw hunter couture his ability to knock down the shot had to keep the defenders from miami a little bit more glued to him allowing him to get the ball inside brooks the big man with beverly wong olani and mcgusty on the drive great defense by beatty he blocked it and he touched it last as it went out of bounds and weve talked about isaiah wong not being a factor a lot of that has been the defense of obesity being physical going straight up and being able to challenge that shot media is one of those guys that when you put him on a defender he stays there and stays disciplined may not get all the glam and cliffs for being the offensive guy but definitely one of the guys thats the leader of the defensively in the brooks not really the spot where you want to get him the ball shot clock down to four now and mcgusty gonna need to fire im not sure he got it off raised the iron rebound for months good defensive possession by virginia tech now it looks like miami a little out of sorts offensively again if youre going to get the ball inside to nasheer books hes got to decide to go soon wasting too much time you dont want your big guy dribbling around the freako line a great Applause nice dime good movement by uh mutts again a lot of he caught sleeping definitely got to see the ball at all times hadnt been larger than a fivepoint game for the first 30 minutes and all of a sudden a ninenothing run for the hokies have opened things up swatted it out of bounds but they got him for the foul and miami will get some muchneeded free throws to try to snap a long drought great passing today 20 assists for the hokies who lead by 11 on the road treat yourself to 799 sundays at the fresh market featuring bonein new york strip steak and wild north atlantic lobster tails our steak is aged for maximum Music when youre ready for your tomorrow to begin start planning at disneyworldcom from the oldest robberies to the most normally virginia tech is the one thats disrupting teams on offense and i think in the last five minutes miami has done a better job of limiting virginia tech on what they want to do they have not been able to exploit getting the ball into aluma and being able to capitalize on the other end make it a two possession game no he missed it so the hokies could tie it with a three again looking at where they are virginia tech youve had success with getting the ball to justin mutts allow him to be able to get something on the perimeter and penetrate you see the help mutts passed up the three pass to aluma juggled hung on two and brooks found him under a minute to go aluma will shoot two nice penetration by justin again this is the guy that is six seven six eight can put the ball on the floor and penetrate with control at last time dumping it off to to a luma whos gonna go to the line luma shooting 62 excuse me 72 percent from the line four or five today the last missed the line for olani was the first miss in the second half miami had been 17 of 17 from the line since halftime aluma coming off backtoback games of 29 and 30 first hokie with at least 28 backtoback games since eric green did it eight years ago acc player of the year back in 2013 aluma makes the most virginia tank extending the pressure and timeout called walker wide open on the front court miami takes its final timeout Music with 57 seconds left a little surprised to see the timeout call there well i think jim larry wants to make sure one that theyve got a good play not so much to get the ball inbounds make sure that this play right now they go they go back to something thats going to get them a basket because as of late virginia tech has been able to get the ball to mutts you want a good play again i go back to the beginning of the second half they ran up one play where they had iso fries for isaiah young a stagger for either mcgusty or ilanahi virginia tech had problems with that i want to make sure that we get a good shot take our time and run and be able to get a twopointer well take a three forget it but have some success driving the ball its been a quieter offensive game for walker as you see but olani has nearly doubled up his season average points per game again meanwhile justin mutts has been phenomenal for virginia tech i mean if we go to overtime he has a legit chance at a triple double hes got 19 eight rebounds and seven assists right now in 34 minutes and we got a lot of highlight packages for this guy well again we talked about his ability to be able to finish and put the ball on the floor i think that all afternoon long hes been able to do a good job of being able to seal inside and be able to finish around the rim a guy also theyve been able to go in iso and put the ball on the floor and take the bigs out blow by them when you look at the fact that his numbers have been impressive not only with scoring but you talked also being able to deliver dimes to get his teammates scoring opportunities as well monstas collegiate career began at high point university in the big south and he transferred to delaware now in the acc and needing to defend hokies have one timeout left miami has none virginia tech you want to make sure you defend without fouling and also turn around and put a body on your man for a block out long pestered on the perimeter walker gives it back to him shot block at eight isaiah trying to create for himself now down to two has to launch not even close and thats a shock clock violation 262 again thats not a play that i i really think that that they really wanted because you look at what bcb being able to allow not allowed wong to be able to get by him contested shot if youre jim leroy im sure thats not the shot you really wanted looked like jim laranega was just letting his players know they can foul here miami has two fouls to give signaling again a lot of time left though 262 feels like a marathon i know lumas the guy but i feel like i give the ball to justin mutts and allow him to be able to either get a penetration or maybe some kind of a duck in inside much and he hit the ground hard and hes shaken up they did say its virginia tech ball with 119 to play no they call the foul foul i dont know ive got to see that one again because i actually thought that that was an amazing block obviously you hope that elijah and ilana he is okay and what looked to be an open shot and you see a lot of he comes over here and seems like there was contact on their left arm but hes had shoulder issues all season long great defensive play there was contact but about the play recovery by ilanahi talk about going all left wow giving up the body looks like hes going to stay in the game too but now justin mutts who at the free throw line is two for three today shooting has not been his greatest strength this year 51 and hes got two at the line with his team trailing by one and remember miami does not have a timeout first one ties the game at 71 again if youre miami youve got to turn around and luma is one of those guys very good at crashing the boards and bama still as well you want to make sure that you block out for the lead no were tied miami can look for the final shot to win it ahead its mcgusty with five back to wong hell shoot the three good with two seconds to go timeout and virginia tech finds itself on the verge of another heartbreaking loss courtesy of isaiah oh what a shot evan libler well i thought that cameron mcgusty had an opportunity to penetrate but then he opted to get the ball back over and right there i thought he could have gone in penetrate opted to give it to wong and then how about wong with the 30footer pulling it up money from behind the arc oh my god you see the play again walking into it late recovery by illumina not wanting to foul isaiah wong coming up with a dagger say he had been shooting the ball 28 from three for the season until a few games ago and now including today hes made 11 of his last 21 from deep and none bigger than that one they added a few tenths to the clock so virginia tech brian has to go the length of the court in 24 seconds they need a three and the luxury for miami is they still have a foul to get well and theres always the debate at the end of the game if youre up three do you foul or not and i think that if im virgin if im miami coach larnega i tell him that hey as soon as you get the ball you stay at home you make sure that you dont foul until right before they get over the half court foul and then force them to take the ball out i think here you only foul if they dribble absolutely absolutely and if you look whos on the floor then youve got threepoint shooters Music well jalen cohen has been absent he started the game played five minutes i havent seen him in the second half bama still the freshman is going to inbound looking for either mutts aline aluma or couture no timeouts for either side hokies down three pass to aluma knocked away by olani with 17 to go and theyre going to review it to make sure it was last touched by miami which gives mike young an additional time out to diagram and inbounds from midcourt if it is indeed hokeys basketball and absolutely you want to make sure if youre mike young that your guys are are dialed in here because ive been on the other end of this because again sometimes you can have teams that can be deflated and you see as they review it you see a lot of heat come over Music and from the angle that i see it seems like it may be off a lot of heat but im not sure whether it could have gone off of as well the difference in the game right now is a threepointer from isaiah wong whos got 16 of his 19 in the second half assuming this stays hokey ball theyll have a chance lets see after a closer look oh wow im not sure well im assuming that theyre going to keep it its going to be virginia take a ball but if youre miami you make sure that you guard that threepoint line you switch everything and realize that im still under the impression evan i may try to foul on on the pass now beatty has replaced bamasil hes going to inbound dang gak with his long reach greater than seven foot wingspan will try to disrupt the entry pass 21 on the clock hokies need a three beady gets it in couture a good look and were going over time on the three from hunter at the buzzer oh my what a play what a shot one great bucket from isaiah wong deserves an answer and hunter couture with the response five more minutes on the clock and you see the good good play by aluma setting up hunter couture a lot of heat late hunter couture stepping up and knocked down that three hey is there any chance couture stepped out of bounds before taking that three i dont know if we can see that again he was really close and a miami player was pointing to the sideline to indicate i mean i dont think thats reviewable in this last second this first step yeah you know what they did miss it because you see right the right foot there but im not going to lie to you what a great basketball hunter couture you saw that play was set up by big pick by kevin aluma and you see right there in the right foot stepping out of bounds how about the clutch three and miami didnt defend that well i mean going for the steal falling over he had a wide open look well if anything if youre in miami you would have wanted both guys to go out a two would have hurt you but now you know we joked about neither one of us had any place to be right now because we got a later flights looks like weve got five more minutes well these teams played three overtimes last year remember in blacksburg jim laranega said it was the only three overtime game hes ever been involved in in his career a three for wong with 24 to go and then couture ties it at the buzzer and weve got overtime here in miami again youre looking to you if you look in the huddles of both teams and where are we going for virginia tech i still think that if you double a luma you ride justin mutts and then for miami youve got guys in magusti ilana he and then isaiah wong hokies look to draw first blood in the overtime mux backing down walker no call mutts gets two nice patient by justin muscle you saw walker trying to opt for that foul i like his patience being able to finish and again a lot of times you ride the hand thats hot and for virginia tech justin munsters that guy can get the ice up ryan its just a second overtime game in acc play this season nc state clemson went to overtime back on january 5th a month later bonus basketball and the hokies up by two of the ball coming up for the steal interesting to see if mike young continues to get the ball over the justin mutts realizing that he can get him isolde in oneonone and he can win that battle between here and anthony walker won it over and over again 22 points for months tour tried to entry to aluma muntz is going to take a three rebound wong look gusty had the hot hand in the first half cooler in the second half and a pretty good look right there wouldnt go down i like the move and the penetration because again i think for miami you still want to be able to spread virginia tech out and penetrate not fall in love theyve hit some big threes but you dont want to fall in love with that threepoint shot aluma kicks it couture not this time walker the rebound that last time kelly uh kevin aluma was what he had oneonone coverage i think he was so used to being double he didnt realize that was an opportunity to maybe go oneonone against masier brooks body language of both coaches they really want this game nice take theyre on contact mcgusty will get to the line and aluma picks up i believe its fourth nice recognition recognition by augustinian come around and then go right to the basket you see again aluma a little late turning that corner a lot of times you want your bigs to hedge out to be able to buy some time Applause aluma did not have any fouls in this game for the first 25 or 30 minutes but now hes got four here in the overtime big free throw missed there for mcgusty just the third miss 23 tries for miami makes one of two 18 for mcgusty virginia tech runs a little screen to screen or action you either get that over for a looma to pin down and try to get mutts on the block heres mutts again great spot blocked by brooks from behind plus losing that ball right there had the advantage against walker good help by brooks coming over to come over and get that block he defensive play mcgusty a little step back gets his balance wont go but brooks creates another possession walker keeps it alive Applause versus a lean three in the air beanie the rebound again i know thats a shot that wong can can take but again i still like to see him being able to penetrate and theyve had success as being able to get downhill on a righthand penetration youre playing right into virginia techs hands by throwing up that three heres a lean on the drive kicks for couture air balls it wow weve had going into this overtime both both teams making big plays and the two guys who hit threes in the final three seconds of regulation coming up empty on their long shots in the overtime augustine again back outside walker walker with five to shoot trying to create something himself on mutts who fouled him oh just brought the arms down just enough to get called for the foul its gonna give walker and justin must play a solid defense that last time he only had to stay solid you see being able to move his feet and then youve got walker shooting an off balance shot you do not want to bail him out thats exactly what he did and walker ties the game at the line Applause 128 to go were still tied one of two from the line for walker virginia touch you try to get in something inside again see how theyre going to play aluma mutts has been that guy thats been able to get inside at will open mans beady hell take it Music i feel like jim laranega is okay with that shot yeah and again you forced uh will be sabidi to beat you every time the ball goes inside i would double beam again from miami you want to run some kind of pin down pin down on the opposite side and try to get a penetration wong and walker playing a little twoman game Music and it is virginia tech basketball that last offensive possession by miami you had an overload too many guys on one side and you see the penetration and you see both teams fighting for the ball scrambling that last time it seemed like it may have been out on anthony walker yeah i thought he touched it with his back on the line they could look at it if they want but its currently hokies ball with 398 remaining we are still here because of a couple gigantic buckets in the final seconds of regulation augustine leaves it for wong this with 24 to go made it 74 i mean its 7168 or 7471 excuse me couture at the buzzer nothing but net Music well you looked as right now as we both we see deadlocked with under 40 seconds left to go again both teams have struggled in the overtime of being able to find points but then when you look for virginia tech the guy that seems like hes been able to get the ball at will is justin mutts virginia tech certainly feels like they should win this game aside from needing a buzzer beating three i mean theyve led for 33 of the 44 minutes of the game they were up by 11 with midway through the second half and fouled miami threepoint shooters twice in a fourpossession span miami made all the free throws that was a sixpoint gift that the hokies gave the canes a big part of why were still here yeah absolutely and i think that when you look at if youre in the huddle with virginia tech sometimes you gotta use your best player as a decoy theres been a couple of times where theyve been able to use a luma because they realize that miami is adapted to double teaming him i use aluma to lure them out and get the ball to justin muscle on the short wing allow him to be able to penetrate understanding that if miami comes to double then youve got hunter couture somebody that you have maybe on a backside screen get them wide open hard to believe that with 15 minutes to go in the first half the score was two to nothing yeah again this has picked up since then it most certainly have and we we joke the fact that that by being a noon star that both teams are going to take some time to wake up but this has turned out to be a good game and if im miami im looking at saying that if they go inside we double immediately immediately off it would be sabidi stay stay home on your threepoint shooters especially hunter couture although it is worth mentioning brian the scoring has slowed in overtime its two to two in the four minutes and 20 seconds of overtime and theyve added half a second back to the clock 403 officially and a 76 all tie hokies basketball with aluma couture aline mutts and bamisil miamis got long mcgusty walker olani and brooks connor couture running the offense to the elbow its muds give off to aleene little teardrop for two nice shot being able to get a lead to his left hand if youre miami i dont know if you run this down all the way and take the last shot but youve got to get some kind of penetration hurricanes do have a timeout wong making a move with 10 kicks it olani steps inside the arc on the runner no its an offensive foul Applause 66 seconds remaining ive got to see that one again im not sure whether i thought couture was there especially on the penetration i thought alanine had a shot right there but opted to still go thats a close one for me im not sure that he was set again i would have liked him to take that one dribble and shoot right there and i i just dont think that hunter couture had that left foot established they give the fallon couture in the backcourt its only the seventh team foul of the second half in overtime but couture is an excellent freethrow shooter 82 on the season take another look at this block charge there wasnt a lot of contact brian yeah again watch the left foot right there i see i dont think that hunter couture had that foot set for him to be up for that to be a charge i mean obviously im sitting up here with you and im not down there i dont want that job but i still thought that jim laranega has a huge case for that to be called a block now youve got the easier job just to give your opinions without much ramification absolutely well theres a lot of ramifications im going to hear from my wife one and one here makes the first miami does have a timeout Applause if couture makes this one at miami you want a quick two well its a two possession game mike young yelling not to foul and miami is going to use its last timeout and a tall task here needing four points in the next 44 seconds and you have to go the length of the court here too so if im mike young i tell my guys okay were going to play with them in front of us dont give them just an easy look but we want to go ahead and defend without fouling if im generally renego we run some kind of quick play to try to get a quick drive well take a three if we can but we need a quick a quick score we cant use too much clock wow a lot to unpack in this ball game i mean the hokies have five in double figures hurricanes have four melanie wong each have 19 magusti has 18 mutts as the games high score with 22 whats the deal with jalen cohn thats a question for mike young going forward is this just today or did something get tweaked or what but hes only played five minutes to be honest with you i dont think that you read too much into jaylen cole not playing well we talked about joe bemisil coming in off the bench and the game that hes had i think that mike young just opted to go with the best guy that was playing better augustine throws it length to the court justin mutts has been the star he picks it off and the hokies win virginia tech survives and prevails in overtime on the road at miami 8076 the hero shot from hunter couture beat the buzzer in regulation and virginia tech was the better team in the bonus segment to prevail and bounce back from pittsburgh on wednesday night wow what a game brian yeah i think that it was a lot of back and forth virginia tech had a
