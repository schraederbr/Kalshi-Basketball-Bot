Applause its a good momentum booster however Jacob agnesevich who got that winning Basket in the final second hell be the Sixth Man tonight a strong sixman coach a sophomore yeah okay Valparaiso Universe in the portal here we go Nate waszewski and asan as Angela will take the tips for their respective teams and Notre Dame will win the tip start this one off with Trey works on the top of the king Clemson coming out mantoman very aggressive both teams play a lot of spread out five on four well you know theyre looking the situations where theyre gonna post up try attack and drive turnover Works has his pocket picks boy pushing down the court onto The Far Side venom for the corner three and Gibson scarf her Lipscomb making sure that they can come out quick that was the current a concern of Coach a cup is they were going to be able to handle things early is that Notre Dame will line up here is there a consistent lineup not too much change this fourth game of the season this is the same lineup they saw in game one its continued to produce as Notre Dame comes in undefeated 30 on this season minor tries to work a fade away and gets it great start great start exactly what you want to look for that young man came from the division three basketball so coach has found the right fit for his program Applause Starling on the near side wing oceans and drives in dishes out to lashesku try and come in off the Baseline Applause Sports off the rim no good Lipscomb again with another offensive opportunity down low looking to post up lucesky turning lays it in cant get the finger roll I had a great look there great look back to down its got great size you know hes coming off of a great year but it has come off to a slow start so far this year startling The Freshman kicks out driving in to Goodwin got it one of the things that Lipscomb was concerned about is a penetrating kick of the Irish and theres a great example penetrate great look great shot knocked in a three heres Lipscomb starting five pretty consistent to their three games earlier this year to this one as well not too much changes sanchoa cant get it to go inside the paint Goodwin well run it with the Notre Dame offense went inside twice and boy theyve had great looks theyve just not taken advantage of that will be called Asana sajula preseason all a sun player someone that coach it comes has really wanted here yeah were getting a little bit too much chance here trying to push that ball straight trying to get that off of there again uh I think uh lachesky did a good job of uh selling that file but uh it was definitely eight time two hands is on it on offensive play like that theyre gonna call it sometimes you gotta be good at acting too yes right especially in the soccer and basketball Arts looks down to Sterling Brian down on pull away off the rim tipped it away Boyd will be able to try and save it and does pushing up you know you study both teams they mirror each other and what theyre trying to do both offensively have great spacing Great Cuts patience at time reading the defense very very similar what theyre trying to do offensively off the screen guy he is impressive young man where he has no no hesitation on that pullup jump shot working right off the screen there Trey Venom from Concord North Carolina Notre Dame trailing Lipscomb currently Starling trying to work in takes it inside the paint takes it 101 and lays it in Big Time attack of the basket there not only being able to attack but also finishing at The Rim which was a key right outside the ark Sergeant dropping it down to shiner turn on it look for the cutting back door way underneath will get the rebound Notre Dame will punch now Pruitt had a great post up he just didnt finish you know look for the of the comeback to that same look because they had a pointblank shot Mac Ryan welcome to get the offense going as a Notre Dame team that has a lot of experience on especially on the court yes theyre not going to panic theyre not going to panic at all fade away great defense that time by lipstick great defense Music Applause got it has come in and came out firing in this one currently absolutely and hes the type of kid that just loves that hes hes a young player but a great player and uh theyre gonna have to find a way to find him in the zone or find him in a man and keep on him because hes just gonna bury that shot hey luceski gets it down to Goodwin working around high off the glass and gets it in White Blank shot Dave Goodwin does an incredible job his versatility was a concern going to this game because he can post about people and finish around the rim handing it off to Boyd dropping it down to assagila now Benham again the hot hand currently for the Bison hell go up off the glass Venom cannot be stopped on the drive set things up with a pullup jump shot then step out hit a three then all of a sudden now he goes inside complete player darling taking it inside high off the class shesky tried to push it in Venom will wait for numbers oh my deep I guess that was a heat check there because uh he shot that from Elkhart County Lipscomb has come in firing and its been Trey Venom from Concord North Carolina whos been getting it done off your back well just come up leading Notre Dame 127 currently and this is a bison team coach that has eight new faces together as a former coach how do you interweave them into the program especially this early on and find their foot you know what its called its called the portal especially for men majors and so you look at that list you know talking to coach a cup before the game hes still learning their names about what they can do so thats part of the whole process is finding a way to get the right guys in the right places and uh put the pieces together which is a fun part of coaching Ryan drops it down to luccheski spinning cant get it to go fruit will get the rebound for the bison and push quickly up Court yeah we mentioned that hes got a division three AllAmerican hes got Nai AllAmerican part of those newcomers which says a lot China off the rim Goodwin comes down with a rebound necessarily you dont have to go to another division one school to go pick up especially with the transfer portal out yeah so you get people that are experienced know how to score good win unable to connect theres more than one way to find great players out there and there are all levels and so uh why not go uh the division three route if you got a special kid heres the hero of the other game the other night down low will get called for the travel Goodwin all over there defensively you know there is a good lesson there if you watch a youngster one of the key things if you watch Dane Goodwin here he just stays down stays down he doesnt go for ball fakes both feet stay on the ground keeps one hand up that is perfect post defense Music thought about the three this games going to come down to who can defend the perimeter shot the best it really is going to be they marry each other so much and what they do whos going to knock in threes and whos going to defend threes something that was both consistent in talking to both coaches earlier today good one is able to get it wow with the shot clock expiring thats a veteran thats just a veteran knowing how much times on the clock what hes got to look for he didnt Panic got a good look and knocked it in were driving in spin moves season Lane kicks out our China got Happy Feet and travel thats gonna happen again trying to get settled in because you gotta take the time you cant be in a hurry gotta put that ball on the floor before you can take off see all that hes got to make sure you got the ball first before you start moving get this program is not intimidated though they this is the same even though they got a lot of newcomers they went into Dayton last year and beat Dayton on her home floor so uh this team is is young but they know exactly how to win chesky unable ortz is able to get the rebound get another offensive chance Brian sinks it you know hes talking to coach gray theyll shoot around the day and says Mike I think were starting to get a feel of the threes and the magic number has been 10 threes if they hit 103s theyve been very successful so he says I I feel it and uh you know as a coach you do have a better feel the guys are shooting the well in practice Applause toyed thought about it gets it off to Venom en twisting and turning cant get the roll well he is really struggling Venom taking it himself taking all Irishmen with him that number three is not struggling thats 63 sophomore has come here to play Music getting the Bison back out in front Lubin unable to get the open three five on four right now Venom so Angela kicks it out lets see if webs can sets it back up oh they got a mismatch inside take the mismatch inside backness of it cant get if I look a lifts could you know theyve had a lot of easy shots Inside by their bigs they just have not taken advantage of that so if youre Notre Dame you got to feel good about it Ryan to works answers from downtown Notre Dame out in front now by one were starting to hit those threes and thats been something that carried them through the turn you know get up got him to the tournament last year of the foul before and that will bring us to a break Notre Dame firing back their leading by one currently its Lipscomb and Notre Dame right here on the HTC Network extra comes 14 coach whats he doing right now hes having fun thats what hes doing you know why not but you know many times somebody comes from a mid major program and theyre playing a high major power five school all of a sudden theyre saying Hey I want to show these guys I can play too and thats exactly what hes doing last year named an Asun all freshman team member all right now he is finding a way to get it through the nylon as boy drives in off the Baseline oh nice save beautiful job by the Bison blocks it now Notre Dames offense will run the corner great job of moving the ball not allowing it to stick aside ball screens being able to get the ball inside and out which has allowed them to hit wide open threes saski from the Baseline trying to go underneath and uses geometry in his favor to make it off the glass and thats whats made him so good and the conference player of the week and doing all things because he could score inside and outside and his game has just gotten better over the years especially inside gets his first bucket of the night long time coming maybe thatll get him started because coach a cup needs to have him score if he has a chance Music pray work slowing it down here for the Irish Music evski good win see the lane kicks off to Starling taking it inside drives in and gets the roll great attack by the freshman Ive been so impressed with him in the early going he doesnt seem to panning he lets the game come to him uh he likes to run the offense and thats what you want from a point guard especially a freshman point guard agnesevich gets it to go there Notre Dame leading by one we expected a great game and I think were going to see it good one takes the three off the ball screen and got it its raining threes early by the Irish and thats a good sign if youre Notre Dame fan Music down to Pruitt coming in off the Baseline foul called however Notre Dame leading at the current moment Lipscomb still staying around stay with us right here go to eventually go to the senior you go to somebody can post up has a great presence there on the stockpot got the shot off the tie the thing about Goodwin is he can step out and hit the three you can post up there that was a was absurd for Lift salary report is that how are we going to defend him currently leads the hours with 10 points Adam gives it off to Pruitt trying to drive in takes to one on one with Ryan minor off the Run no good luceski comes down with it great defense coach Salmons really been emphasizing a much better half court defense after the last couple games and you can see the Improvement at the half court defense for the Irish starling its a good one on the top of the key Works driving in raining ACC player of the week gets it swatted away Boyd and the Bison will run Venom taking the one on one with Goodwin unable to get it to go too close that time hes been knocking them so far so far deep he finally got one real close and missed it Keith six minutes here if your lips can you want to finish this half coach says one of the things theyve struggled with in the past on the road against Power five teams is finishing the first half lets see how this team does startling in the paint Fade Away got it oh goodness wow yeah JJs Starling the 64 freshman Guard from Baldwinsville New York really the highest ranked Notre Dame or crew to come back into South Bend in a really long time thats right right here at La lemur down the road and uh boy and I are so happy to see him on the on the court for them thats for sure flying out to lachefsky open three cant get it Music big pickup for Mike Bryce staff especially when you lose Blake Wesley to the NBA you got to go find somebody to not take over that point guard position absolutely down low looking for the back door cut Starling picks it up that was a youth mistake there about communication where one player saw a role the other player that was rolling didnt see it well Mack Ryan lazeski tried to put it away and its the back of the rim I like lips can pushing the ball because the iris is only playing five or six players so I think its an advantage to try to push the ball when they can Music trying to go inside unable to the length the late successfully there really really happy to play hurts to go to one driving in stuck in the paint away from the charity strike and its a quick timeout from the bison and Coach Acuff Music walking it back to South Bend Indiana Jane Goodwin leading a team with 12 points shooting efficiently five out of six and then rebounding however its also his defense getting in on there coach yeah I just love this game because if hes not hitting the three he doesnt settle for that he goes right back to you know his dads a coach his dads a college coach or a capital in Ohio they the young man plays like a coach if he doesnt hit threes hes got to go back inside post up and take away that fade away and hes Unstoppable right now Google is that for Mike for Coach Bray in this situation when you can have a coach on the floor the South holler trying to get it yeah its very valuable I mean you you want to have basketball IQ on the floor all the time and theres no one better to have a basketball IQ than a coachs son whos lived it all of his entire life Dan Goodwin the coachs son makes no mistake thought was a concern for the Bisons how are they going to defend the three and uh you can see the results they have not done a very good job theyve had wide open looks back door cut tipped Away by good ones stay a bison ball yeah I think good was on fire right now theres no question one of the team captains this year for the Fighting Irish on that large pool of graduate students for this Notre Dame Fighting Irish team they have six student athletes getting their masters degree this year theyll go on an offensive foul off the shoulder voter James starting to rock at the current moment in a rocking Purcell Pavilion Dan Goodwin yeah welcome you back to South Bend Indiana Notre Dame currently leading Lipscomb 21 29 18 at the current moment taking a look at head coach Mike Bray alltime winningest coach for Notre Dame in their history and it was a long resume and coaches who have been successful I tell you what hes special not only what he does for the program and for the institution here but what it does for the community uh coaches for cancer hes big big time involved with that and you know both coaches are involved in the nabc the National Association basketball coaches that have served on that National Committee so these guys have a great relationship it goes a long ways back first time these two teams are meeting Music here in South Bend Goodwin inside the paint theyll get called for the travel after the Bison swarmed to the graduate student theyre gonna have to figure out a way to double him in that situation because hes just gonna back you down and finish that time he got ahead of himself just a little bit in traveling lets see Clark bringing it up sajula getting it off to Benham founder blocked by luceski Applause the things that lipskin in playing in the mid major they usually dont see a 611 guy coming off the back side and blocking that shot in the league that they play in normally theyre going to get an easy finish words for three around the rim no good Applause Music great find with works this year who didnt play lot has been able to really respond and has a steady appearance as a another point guard that doesnt panic at all again the length of the Irish hurt this team heres another example this I think they got layup and all of a sudden you know you got six five guard with long arms coming across and getting a great defensive block just sliding in there for the block late Tony Murr will come in its not seeing game action so far this year hell be the inbounder however officiating crew of Roger Ayers Bill Covington Jr and Matt Potter will go over to the scoring table just to make sure everythings in line yeah Furr has been injured with his shoulder so this is his first game back so uh you know hes probably just trying to get a couple minutes here and a half big minutes here to see if Lipton can cut into this lead cutting Murr gets it to him what a great pass by Burr great pass words in Notre Dame will slow it down Music good one from the top of the key around the rim cant get it to go you know thats again a great look when the shooters hot you got to give him the ball Music man thats got to be a key Music Applause were dropping it down to assangeela up against lachesky Im gonna switch driving in great ball movement great ball fakes now they need to get a shot off her highly contested Applause its off the glass and yeah that was a fourth shot seeing the shot clock going down you want to try to attack the basket there if youre a coach you dont want somebody just pull up and shoot a you know 18 to 25 footer especially when youre just getting in the game that will be called Music the assangeelo down on the far side just making it look easy on the motion coach just a great release off of that screen again thats a thats a play that theyve worked on time and time again to get the perfect timing to get the perfect pass its been a very smooth first half not a lot of fouls not a lot of stopping to play both teams have have handled themselves really really well reports hes unable to get it to go only five fouls between both teams so far now under 120 because its in uh perimeter game so far so theres no banging and pushing inside so everybodys been pretty content by you know getting perimeter shots the timeout from coach Bray here talk things over with his team theyre still leading by nine though 108 to go in the first half D1 level now in his fourth year with the Bison one of the best coaches in the country and you know theres no question what level you could be at hes been at the Devil division two level now hes just going to move that up and once he gets his guys and right now I think he has his guys but theyre just off the Young and we talked about it you knowing coach AKA he likes the veteran team he likes he likes it so this is a little bit of a new thing for him over his last couple of years of coaching to have such a young team and have to try and build that culture within him Huntsville was such a great academics for them most of almost all of his players redshirted their freshman year so that created a great movement of very old teams every year Cormac has it rattled around now under one minute or Music agnesevich thats a huge basket cutting the lead to six and now theyre back in the game that was the current a concern that coach Acuff had before the game weve got to make sure were within 10 at halftime and uh theyve pretty much done that foreign Applause steps back with a three off the rimless Jeske gets a rebound Goodwin open plenty of time one shot Im gonna pull it back out heres a coach you go through a setup youre gonna have a high ball screen coming here here comes a high ball screen and theyre gonna come off that screen looking to score Sports cant get it with the clock stopping I think we have a little malfunction there Ill probably go to the monitor here but I dont think theres very much time left on that clock duck on that 38 thats pretty much when the shot goes this shouldnt take too long to pretty much decide if there is any time if there is its very very limited but again if youre coach Jacob you got to be really happy right now with only six point deficit into this game knowing that uh you could have been down 10 or 12 or 15 and uh thats been something thats happened to him against Power five teams and so you can see that hes pretty happy right now yeah you saw it Lipscomb middle middle way through that first half went on a scoring drought over four minutes long it has now battled back to find himself within six of a Notre Dame Fighting Irish team that now has themselves on a scoring jump they havent scored in the past four minutes and 24 seconds so both games playing some potent defense at the current if both teams know each other very well they play very similar I think the main concern if youre the licenses youve got to finish inside and theyre going to talk about that a lot theyve got their allconference big that has really struggled so far so theyve got to focus on trying to get the ball inside so oh it looks like the game yeah they they videotaped that they looked at it this is the second half yeah its gonna start here after this that will take us into the half after the clock runs off after the replay Notre Dame leading by six but Lipscomb sticking up trying to get the ball inside and get the iris in foul trouble because the Irish dont have depth in the front line and it only has played Seven so far this year the Irish have oh inbound it to Venom and were underway in the second half in this nonconference Friday night matchup Music Boyd coming in off the lane Works their offense yeah the great play coming out knowing that they need a bucket to start the second half theyve drawn that up they went over that at halftime and then they executed it to the T Applause Arling its a good one Applause good spacing by the Irish words just puts it too high out of the reach of lachesky and right away we look at again Lipscomb Bisons are back in it right away four points down to start to second half were gonna hand off to Venom going inside will get called on the player control foul chesky falling to the ground Music coach hes coming right back at him saying you know were going inside again hold your ground get your feet set and thats exactly what the cesky does he gets his feet set takes the charge you know thats uh were gonna see more of that I think in the second half balls going inside whos going to defend will have Music another stoppage potentially must be cold outside and our scoreboard is freezing up or something hook one though yep already back in Midway through the house back court s will bring it up on a cold winter night weve had a really great turnout a lot of people here Im sure theyre here for the game again tomorrow the Notre Dame Boston College game on the football field but theyve all come out here and supported this game Applause all right on the far side gives it off to Goodwin get great spacing by Notre Dame Commack Ryan spinning and gets involved here in the second half his old Dorman in the first yeah you know if youre looking at Notre Dame you say we gotta get more people involved we cant just allow on one guy to be scoring our points and so I think thats a point of emphasis you got to get Cormac Ryan going a little bit and there you go avoid answers yeah and again theres another guy that came from an Nai program same as schools around here in Indiana and uh you know has answered the call this kicks off the good one Music starling oh hi inside the Freshman was able to attack and then Elevate over and have a nice teardrop shot there thats thats pretty special boy quick pullup off the ring cant get it to go this will slow it down for the Irish Music foreign cuts it back pulls up off the rim now the Bison trying on their offense again they have a lot of good looks 98 cop runs a lot of great sets a lot of great looks getting their people the ball in the right place Applause Anastasia no call on the offensive foul there got away with one there he just kind of cleared out with a ball but it is a big call for a offensive foul again Lipscomb now within three Music now the wasseski on the top of the key great lets keep cutting and gets it typical Coast spray offense where they are able to curl make a great read great cut great finish both teams are executing their offense right now boy to us Angela high off the glass again you dont want to get into a chess match here with a lips because those kids know exactly what they want to do you need to execute your defense Music stay on the top of the key uh Dane Goodwin a little stock looking for somebody clock clock down to three lasheski pulls it up for a three he got it again theres another example of a senior knowing how much times on the clock not panicking did a good look getting a great finish back door cut designer streaking just too far into the basket and had to try and bounce his way back out yeah he had a great cut a great look just too far underneath the basket Music this match inside Applause Music right now Starling will now reset with eight seconds on the shot clock Music right hands there great hands a timeout from coach Lenny a cup Nate laceski getting it done from the perimeter as Notre Dames continues to lead 3832 Music off look for a live play here with two seconds on the shot clock s gets it to lashevski Waits hell get fat for the three now if you go back for those Irish fans have watched a lot of games thats exactly the offense they read but natewski I believe two years ago where he knocked out a game winner uh with that same look a great read a great out of bounds play Music pretty uneventful when you can talk about people in the paint or or careless fouls its just been pretty simple but well played game and now with this foul here now seven fouls alone in this game not just within oh the first half but now both the first and second half combined only seven fouls yeah and coaches really like that officials love it coaches love it when the players play and you know dont yell as a fan you want to see the players play we dont we didnt come here the payer observed to watch referees ref and great refs know that they just want to be got unnoticed and let the game take care of itself another key possession here for the Bisons Music were on the top of the key shes only loses it by the charity strike Music thought about it and gets it to go off the glass yeah great patience does a great job at cuttings a basket then spinning back and posting up so if youre trying to defend that cut the next thing you know your mans posting up and youre pinned underneath the basket well be trying to get it down Ill be an offball foul whats happening there in that situation is lipskin is is switch on their post Springs so all of a sudden you put a guard on a big and so the Irish recognize that tried to get the ball inside loose ball goes out of bounds Notre Dame turning it over Music on four stairs as a coach those are what creates gray hair and I have a lot of them I think coach Mike Bray is right there with you and wasnt too happy with that one Music situation or possessions in this game are always going to be important because this is the game where both teams are going to get into a half court offense itll be a jump ball possession arrow in favor of the Irish as they get the possession back thats part of quarterback Ryan though you know hell make a mistake or make a bad pass or do something then hell come back because of an effort and hustle play and you gotta love it as a coach thats what you want your upper class to do Music Applause polishatsuki offensively this team for the Notre Dame has set up so much difference with the graduation of Blake Wesley where like Wesley was able to break down the defense this team has to execute their half court offense Music okay emotions send it around Applause I miss it losing it to quarterback Ryan hell bring it up himself Music tries to get it down to Reuben poor trying to take transition basketball Music unable to get it yes as hot as he was in the first two minutes he quality is right now theres a he had a wide open look there that he wished he could have back Music doing all the ball waiting for the offense to set its interesting both teams dont get out the passing Lane location battle trying to get it to boy liszewskys there passing up to Goodwin Goodwin well wait for numbers were going to try and go up against estadgillon really good decision there recognized you know why you didnt have the advantage good one that answers back for three that I may not enforce anything but Im going to step back ahead of three gets an extra point there for that smart choice Applause oh here we go inside again Applause Angela off the glass and bodies up with that is a big man inside and Goodwin kicks it out to lucesky for Matt Ryan get it towards to slow it down if Notre Dames going to be successful in their league this year theyre going to have to consistently have to hit threes and you know thats something that is no secret to Notre Dame or their opponent so how can you defend a three and make them Miss threes contest those threes because if you dont the Irish are going to have a lot of success because theyve got so many great shooters Music gets it off the back of the rim well the message was very clear at halftime for Lipscomb weve got to get inside touches in the second half and thats where coach a cup and his staff has really focused in and you can see a big difference theyre really focusing getting the ball inside Applause Music Applause Lubin fade away from the Baseline always well through it now Juliet Tennessee native running the offense both teams are in their comfort zone at a half court because theres no pressure so they they feel very comfortable what theyre doing what a great great pass there I mean Boyd had a no look behind the back great luck and a great pass that forces the timeout here which will allow us to take your time out lets go battling back again after moment Notre Dame only leading by four but Dave Goodwin knocking him down to keep him in it although the perimeter has been of whats really been allowing these teams to scores the Difference Maker right now in the second half has been the post Point yeah and you know going inside and thats something that you can see that this was done getting the ball inside coach says thats going to be a key form in this game halftime they made that unjust hes been coaching a long time got a lot of wins he knows what to do 26 points in the paint compared to Notre Dames 18 hello tried to force it today and go to him and Pruitt pushes it out of bounds will take a quick break at the current moment Notre Dame still leading by four over the Lipscomb bison on this cool scoring run and Coach Aikos got to be happy yes he is you can just tell hes in the hunt you know he talks before the game as many times theyve gotten down by eight or ten at half then its been 18 and then you cant come back this has been a situation where they have that waszewski answers with the three and that is pretty called the gym coach Brandon staff a Big Dot because thats the second time theyve come out of the timeout and got a bucket itll be a foul on the floor they were trying to feed it the Agnes of itch like we talked about in the open was the hero the battle of the boulevard between Lipscomb and Belmont one of those key Marquee games of the year Music through it and everybody has Rivals you know and so thats a big rivalry and because of that you know you just look for an opportunity Applause steps out of bounds stepped out in the shoe too he blew a tire has to pop that one right back up yeah I guess they dont lace up their shoes like we were caught coach wood taught us all how to do that and thats been a good thats thats gone by everybody just kind of lets him go and they slip out of them now theyre gonna make it Bell bro yeah its exactly right off ball foul itll be down low underneath for the inbound Music lets see again what the Irish have on this side of bounds play the last two theyve done really well Music its a back over to Goodwin No One chasing Applause Music 10 on the shock block here Berts driving in Van gooon from the corner well I looked over at his dad there it is really happy because again he knows his sons having a great a great night he fills it inside and outside what you want seniors to do and every one of these baskets have been really really big for the Irish hes gonna down by 10 at the current moment put it on the far away diving it off the Baseline trying to take on Words floater Pro accounting itll be a 30 second timeout here from coach acup to talk it over until when it flips go gotta find a way theyre trailing by eight at the current moment eight cup wants to talk it over King the Bison by a and this is exactly what I look for as this game is Alexis Scott report I expect that both teams to play extremely hard execute their offense it was going to be a really really good game and thats exactly what weve got a little full court pressure here in the man just picking up the ball picking up the tempo just a little bit now come under 10 minutes left in this game Applause switch out we got big on small Music Applause Works coming in from the paint and so in that situation we had a big old spot but then we had a smaller big and so because of that switch you know words took advantage of it attacked the basket gets a a bigger bigger guy you could attack and get a round on thank you president called for the foul there will be his third of the contest Music Applause Starling from the paint cant get it to go freiner is there Applause Music I guess a wide open down low good post up and a great pass coach was talking before the game how good his post players are passing the ball that was perfect love inside Applause bringing it up Music the one with it and and one is here driving in kicks to Euro Step goes the line now to try and make it a threepoint now thats what makes him affected because hes been a spotup shooter most of his career now hes doing more of this this is what makes you the player of the cop was being able to get to the rim drawn found be strong at that big elephant Finish Well I have to be the sole Postman as Angela has to come off with now with four fouls see thats thats going to be a huge Music Applause now they have to go really small Music thats a getting it off to Benham Music Applause I had a match inside Music fade away and gets it hard shot from that shiner graduate student from Boca Raton Florida yeah hes he had a great game against Belmont hes got great vision and thats his movement hes almost like Goodwin likes to play to his back for the basket Words answers with a three and a quick time out Notre Dame increases their lead by 10 they informed their last five oh thats the south end of Indiana dang Goodwin having the time of his life tonight 21 points being efficient as well just showing you why hes been named to the Jerry West award watch list absolutely hey Jerry West you know where did he play Music a Laker and if you ever look at the NBA logo that is Jerry West what a great candidate I think Goodwin is because you know he he represents exactly what youre looking for the player is consistent not just on his offense but his defense handling the basketball his leadership hes a quiet leader he leads by example and thats kind of like Jerry West all right now in the bonus for the rest of the half or do you make me feel old though you dont know Jerry West yeah Im a fossil I know a little more experience I dont know all right West College Express okay great movement here get the ball inside agnesevich has it roll around using every inch what he has a young kid he looks like hes 15 years old doesnt he hes got that mask on and thats hard to play with a mask on Music for Mac Ryan airball falls into the hands of Trey Venom not a good not a good shot by Ryan I mean that was uh quick that was really a quick shot you want to see your offense run down with a eightpoint lead you want to take your time Applause Music cant get it following his shot Dan Goodwin comes out Victorious hes got numbers here Starling pushing going in our will be will be offensive oh boy that may be a little bit more of a fresh mistake they had the numbers if you want to kind of come to jump stop so lets kick out it really wasnt any Lane there to go you look here attacking the basket you know theres really no options here look at theres all these yellow shirts in the way so theres where you gotta come to a jump stop and kick it out and look for a three from Dave Goodman how much of that is just being a Freshman to drive a team
