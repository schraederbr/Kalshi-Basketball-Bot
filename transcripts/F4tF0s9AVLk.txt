Music Notre Dame last one a true Road game against the top 25 team back in 2016 Clemson with a win tonight would set a new program record for ACC wins in a season Tigers coming off six straight road wins in League Play they won at SMU last time out Notre Dame coming off its best win of the Season against pit and jayen Zachary was light out and the SMU win he build up the box score he gets the first two for the Tigers hes shooting the ball with so much confident its hit five threes against SMU just his offense is just running so smoothly at this point Notre Dame is without two starters it was announced Braden Shrewsberry one of their top scores as the Irish turn it over out for the season lower abdomen injury and then mat Alo whos got one of the highest assist to turnover ratios in the country hes out again with a wrist injury hes now missed six of the last seven Brad Brownell knows hes got a good team and one of the things hes done of late hes gone to this smaller starting lineup Dylan Hunter making his fifth straight start Dylan Hunter his brother Chase and Zachary give this team three legitimate ball handlers as lockin misses on the three and Sir mohamd making his seventh straight start with the rebound off the hand of Davis and it goes back to Clemson and with this smaller lineup and I want to say quote unquote small smaller line L up Dylan Hunter 6364 Chase 6364 Jaden Zachary long arms and strong build they play much bigger than what theyre listed at and defensively they are menacing here is Dylan Hunter the floater no and the rebound by Jr kesn redir Jr from South Bend now Burton the leading score in the ACC more than 20 a game where do they get offense without Shrewsberry without Alo kzns shot no good hey look theyre going to find open looks today because so much of the attention is going Demarcus Burton kzne needs to have a nice game shooting the basketball you have to knock down those perimeter jumpers lock in with a soft home roll he had backto back 22point games in wins against Duke in North Carolina defense but what touch at 7t right at that ACC logo just p over the rim heres Tay Davis one of the most improved players in the Applause league big fan of Tay Davis seeden Hall transfer second year with the Notre Dame program talented young man Burton with six to shoot knocks down the triple he missed seven games earlier this year with a knee injury since coming back hes gone for 20 in 11 of 14 games hunter lines it up and rattles it home thats the biggest Improvement in his game so far the ability to knock down shots so calm when he catches it its amazing to think his jersey could be up in the Rapters youve alluded to it he has been that good in a Clemson uniform Tay Davis with an airball a hunters threepoint shooting at 43 this year first time in his career above 40 thats his brother Dylan he shefflin had a double double against the Irish last year two off the window and Sir Muhammad The Freshman from Charlotte Nazi Muhammads son yep with the rebound Myers Park High School really nice player still kind of learning the game at the college level but the pedigree is certainly there inside to J Davis using the shot fake and the finish and I love the shot fake and finish thats all well and good but if youre keev Ai and youre right there go ahead and put that ball in thats an easy left hand Music Applause layup you notice right away Clemsons offense second third side always ends up moving side to side moving that helps side defense around and once you start doing that the screws tight loosen a little bit and youre able to find those gaps in the defense three or four excellent offensive possessions for the Tigers to open and the Notre Dame has had its struggles on defense Davis hits the corner three last four games for the Irish opponents shooting 56 from the field thats basically Subway Turn Style defense absolutely it is going to have to guard at a higher rate Notre Dame finding some shots in the half court its going to have to be some of the other guys Marcus Burton hes going to car a large load sure Dylan Hunter the triple he had a big game and a win against Florida State earlier this month career high Music Applause 17 Alberton against Applause Music Hunter ji looking for help shot clock at five Davis is going to have to put it up over sheflin offensive rebound chased down by mohamd and he gets the Baseline floater thats tough you got to close out possessions if you have one thing to nitpick Anish tigers can give up offensive rebounds and Spurs and that thatll happen on occasion because theyre so position heavy all that being said have to do a better job but I I think you look at the difference between the offensive plays and philosophy for Clemson and what Notre Dames doing Clemson lot of seniors on the floor a lot of Juniors on the floor they understand how to play and be patient let the ball work for you Hunter defended by or rather Burton defended by Dylan Hunter and Burton misses the layup at The Rim now Hunter and Zachary really give Clemson a twoheaded defensive monster locking open Direct Hit enough time to check the wind Victor locket talked about how well he shot the ball over the last five I mean its been incredible 538 over the course of the last five games in another Rim contest in Clans us Off to the Races yeah Brad Brownell told us thats one area where loins given them more than they thought they were getting shefflin with a little Michelin star on top of it you got to love it theyre pushing the pace theyre finding extra guys playing un selfishly and you talk about a break good defensive play by lockin and the ball just continues to move Clemson off to a quick start here at Little Music John that man right there Marcus Burton and without Shrewsberry and Alo you also missed two of your better threepoint Shooters absolutely and Shrewsberry is a guy that throughout the course of his career has shown that ability to get 20 to 25 points on a given tonight and obviously thats unfortunate but theyre going to have him for a little while thats the optimistic part of the Irish fan croud favorite Ian sheflin completes the threepoint play hes second in the ACC and rebounding behind the Stanford Frenchman Maxim Reno how good has he been this hes been an incredible double double machine Logan Imes into the game for the Irish along with Garrett sundra who had a career high at 11 in the SMU game here is sundra hampsons gone to its bench Dell Jones miles Foster chony Wiggins whod been starting most of the year thats where wigginss length comes into play 610 contesting a three on tay Davis we get a held ball it stays with Notre Dame Tio what are your keys for tonight well I got a few for you if youre Notre Dame you got to guard the paint as a unit this is a Notre Dame team a little bit smaller and youre going up against the Clemson team so physical at the four and five spots and they open up driving lane so you have to know where guys are when theyre attacking the lane and then Clemson forceful execution you are the bigger more physical team use that to your advantage not just in the front court but in the back court with the guards as well Burton wide open and theyre going to get a goal tending on Chase Hunter and I guess well get a foul he almost popped the ball can we have another replay of this that is an unbelievable display of athleticism he gets beat sure and you dont want that to happen but Chase Hunter my goodness he fouled the ball now a lot of body obviously but my goodness hes done that all season long he did it against Duke hes done it against almost everybody the athleticism of Chase Hunter is what differentiates him from other guards in this league so no goal tend instead two shots for Burton and he gets the bo youre right hes kind of made that his trademark Applause play Del Jones has had some moments freshman out of Lando over Maryland hes a nice player he hes going to turn in to the next guard at Clemson that plays with so much confidence and gets them in what they like to run hes playing behind Chase Hunter too so I mean the minutes have been limited but still shot clock down to one and and Wiggins una Music aware Brad brownells talked about chony Wiggins being The X Factor if he can start to scratch a little more of that potential he unlocks another staircase for this basketball team he he certainly does and he started out the season starting but its been the little things with chy and the inconsistency thats that drives you nuts at times but the natural Talent is there when that light comes on hes got NBA potential but were all still waiting for it to come on 610 with range they want him to play inside a little more and they want him to rebound more heres miles Foster with a chance for a threepoint play now Foster on Saturday played 12 minutes against SMU the most hes played since November and really the last question for Clemson thats the bench it it is and Miles cler cant be relied on too much at the ACC level because hes only about 65 66 but what he can do is he comes in hes got a junkyard dog mentality and hes pretty wide built so hes able to hold off the defense against some of the younger players in the conference he was a double digit scorer the last two years at Illinois State and Monmouth in fact had a 2015 game for Illinois State against Kentucky last season played for former North Carolina guard King rice yeah greetings from B park Burton pulls and hits when youre going to be a small guard in the ACC your focus level has to be so good because there were contest everywhere just doesnt matter how talented is Marcus Burton listed generously at 6 feet very generous I might be 64 by the time I leave this gym if he6 fet and we get a foul along the sideline when we come back whats time with them in the locker room after they won the NBA Championship and it wasnt for his lack of w winning nice shot by high breeder good look but heres the other part he had just won a gold medal at the amphia America cup for u8 as an assistant coach so he flew directly from Buenos Aries all the way back home and then directly to Boston to catch the championship game so winning on top of winning Ill do mine Celtics did theirs pretty cool story and it shows you that he cares about his players old and new lockin whos got seven already offensive rebound Wiggins not known for his rebounding locking almost walk may have gotten away with one shot clock at 10 Hunter boomerangs it to Jones Wiggins with five swivels too strong and it comes to the Irish for Notre Dame the issue right now Burtons got seven Davis has five rest of the team just two and again no Alo no Shrewsberry where does the help come from offensively I I think you just let the ball continue to move and thats the thing when youre young move that ball around and try to find some open looks for your teammates and if all breaks down just get it to him and there have been some touchy foul calls as far as shooting are concerned they get Dell Jones and it sends Burton back to the line for Music two its a good call Dell Jones got Burton on the arm on the way up but you see his ability to score right off the bounce pick and roll really talented a number two Duke highlights that Saturday mens basketball triple header the Blue Devils home for Florida State youve got the call for that game albe in Atlanta andc State and Georgia Tech the wolf pack last years Cinderella in danger of missing the ACC tournament Al together this year only 15 of the 18 get in huge game and Im excited about getting the Cameron Indoor because Ah thats just a freshman mistake right there Im excited about getting to Cameron Indoor Leonard Hamiltons final trip to Cameron and what a career that Leonard has had and break TR Leonard Hamilton uh will step down at the season end and that will make Brad Brownell the longest tenur head coach in the ACC hes done a terrific job at Clemson couple years to get his feet wet but ever since they have been one of the better teams in the league a three by Burton rims out hes got nine and hes eight points away from a th000 for his career he would be the seventh fastest to the Millennium Mark in Notre Dame history Zachary off the hard screen Tipp by lockin and its saved by kesn you better show to the ball if youre not just Dylan Hunter but the teammates around him you have to show your chest whenever Burton gets out in transition Cole Serta entered the circle of trust recently at a career Game 12 points three triples and the win against pit last time out thats five in blue mohamd has a poked Away by Hyer and Zachary comes away with it Hyer can shoot it so can Zachary had a slow start from three better than 40 over his last 12 games from downtown Hunters got a match up boomerangs it to highy breeder rebound by kzn thats what high Greers there for I mean he was an allc conference election in the Mountain West for Air Force a knockdown shooter thats been up and down at times but thats his role space the floor be ready to shoot the right career 40 threepoint shooter sir mahamed over Wiggins Harum to Wiggins locking working jve wild shot and theyre going to get locking with an over and back over the back Kenny is a strong young man his lower body hes able to hold out Victor Lock and he cant find leverage to give in order to get that ball up around the rim tell you what chony Wiggins has a quick pull right now what is that tell you that that tells me one they love him so theyre trying to fix some of these problems that hes fallen into two is theyre on him right now before the ACC tournament starts thats what stands out to me more than anything else you have to have him play well if you want to win that ACC Championship something theyre fully capable of doing something that we they have never done it would be a first in program history Burton spin cycle and he goes back to the line I think they got Hunter Dylan they did and Marcus Burton eating right now with the stripe and Dylan Hunter terrific positionally you need to stay straight up right here but Ill give Burton credit he pushes in and he knows where the defense is contesting doing a really nice job getting to the line right now four of four or excuse me five of five currently thats pretty Music good can really score and a nice sub substitution by Micah Shrewsberry next whistle its going to be a media timeout so youre trying to get two or three extra minutes of real time break for Marcus Burton whos shouldering a huge load for Notre Dame right now 11 out of their 18 points he leads all scores Imes defending Dylan Applause Hunter they love this Baseline stagger for Chase Hunter to try to find some speed exib a got to knock it down shefflin the offensive rebound and he gets tied up and fouled Dy from a scoring perspective here early in this first half little floater at the ACC finishing around the rim that should have been a foul somebody call something and then my mans could step out from Beyond The Arc over the last five Bucket over the last five shooting close to 58 or excuse me 548 from three he has been really really good those two bigs right there terrific and beast on the glass I had one ACC assistant coach tell me that the trouble with defending Clemson Bigs like locking you throw chony Wiggins in there they can play inside outside shefflin again one of the top rebounders yeah and then youve got the three guards with the hunters and Jaden Zachary this teams hard to defend they really are because exhibit a you cant sink in too much with sheflin when hes trying to post because locking can step out and shoot it provides so much extra spacing for these quick Clemson guards Burton had 21 against Clemson last year tigers have missed eight straight from the field after starting eight of 12 Notre Dames last six have all come from the foul line and all Burton ji left it short and it is knocked over the backboard John feel like we keep waiting for Kenny ji to be be this extra offensive piece for Notre Dame hes been okay at times but hes got the size hes got soft hands something you kind of wait for him to develop into is a more reliable score inside of about 10 ft hes done a better job this year staying out of foul trouble but as you alluded to offensive game still a work in progress stays with the Irish IMS kesn well executed off the Baseline nny its kind of taken him a long time to get going in a Notre Dame uniform but this is a guy hes the hometown kid from South Bend he has the ability to have a good game or two played well against pit 10 points five rebounds 29 minutes in that game the most he played in almost two months theres been a li on the basket Burton inside canes and Notre Dame on a 10 run theyve got their first lead and its been starting on the defensive end of the flooor contesting everything Notre Dame playing well last year when Clemson made and then when you have to command so much attention kesn understands that little 45 cut from the opposite Wing its going to be open because the help is drawing in thats terrific play recognition by both Burton and kesn kesn needs to have a good game today started off well two and three from the field and a few rebounds uh hes a guy with some Talent with so many guys out hes going to have to pack some scoring punch Clemson has gone six minutes since its last points and the chase Hunter draws the foul Tigers had missed their last nine from the field what has gone a ride for this offense they found good looks they just havent knocked them through theres been a lid on it over the last five minutes and change uh but what do you do you go back to Mr Dependable if youre Brad Brown in this Clemson team get the ball to Chase Hunter the composure on the perimeter to just create an advantage now hes at the free throw line cant hit it number three Notre Dame the woman highlighting our final Thursday night womens basketball double header of the regular season he got Notre Dame Florida State a chance to watch the great Hannah Hidalgo and then Clemson and Louisville preceding at 6 pm now the Tigers offensive WS are continue d has it poked Away by shefley push the ball run the lane find that next guy this is when theyre at their best playing with speed and Pace yeah this is the same Notre Dame team that gave up 50 in the first half against SMU and we get a foul I Notre a off the Wiggins Miss ji moments ago had picked up his second and thats the second foul on sundra when we talked Brad Brown now before the game in he mentioned that theyre going to have to be patient within their offense because the Notre Dame Fighting Irish love to play in The Gap so you have to work the basketball but that doesnt mean taking away from your pace that means fast moving the basketball cutting with speed and force 11 straight misses for Applause Music Clemson Hunter contested that doesnt go 12 misses in a row sheflin finally ends the long drout and how do you write the ship its with those effort plays the offensive boards the finding the easy ones Irish playing really well right now the game is being played at their Pace its a Notre Dame team that has struggled defensively most of the Season ims looking for Davis turns it over Music Applause Hunter draws the double shefflin open and knocks down the triple wi and doubt Ian sheflin will figure it out big time shot right after the offensive rebound sometimes you just need to see the ball go through terrific pick and pop rejecting the screen Chase Hunter understanding the defense Music IMS wide open barbecue sauce he can do that Logan Imes talented young man smart basketball player saw him play for the Indiana Elite in a just such a cerebral player sheflin has scored the last five for Clemson Wiggins draws the double shefflin Zachary for to shoot now Hunter working past kesn too strong shefin the Finish Chef will figure it out man thats a strong body guy dambos in the crowd hes trying to find his next tight end it might be it might be Burton got hunter in the air Burton back to the line and Chase Hunter picks up his second second foul he and Chef and him him on the offensive glass strong up and over the Freshman Garrett sunra but hes showing his versatility too you we talked about what makes this Clemson team dangerous its the ability to knock down shots from the perimeter from their front Court players and that we always knew this is what his games about its those extra effort plays theres a little Jimmy Graham in there Im just going to throw that out there but hes a guy who has boarded consistently throughout his entire Clemson career he went a Grayson High School in Loganville Georgia thats where Clemson running back Phil mafa played Wayne Gman another great Clemson running back also played there and sheflin chony Wiggins sheflin and mafa were yeah they were teammates in eighth Applause grade its a scary D dbo knows what hes doing yeah he does how about the fact the basketball team at Grayson had Ian shefin Chanty Wiggins and Devon Smith is now starting at St Johns yeah not bad thats ranked in the top 10 and hes a start yeah they got a big one against Butler sheflin has scored nine in a row for Clemson with a chance to make it 10 theyve needed an injection of energy and thats where he specializes excellent pass by Chanty Wiggins you got to throw a second Defender at him because he has so much size he can shoot over the top but nice recognition nice Cut and Strong Finish you know you look up and down the stats a niche like Clemsons got 10 assists to two turnovers its not that they havent found looks they just havent knocked down shots thats what its come down to and what makes this Clemson team dangerous everybody knows what Chase Hunter can do thats going to be a goal tend on Wiggins but weve seen almost everybody have their turn of late Lin had the big game against Duke and Carolina Zachary went off against SMU now Wiggins when Chase Hunter was sick carried the team at Virginia Tech back in late January Dylan Hunter had the game against Florida State it could be a different guy on every single night and thats the thing that makes them so dangerous and Tay Davis is trying to take as many steps as this referee crew will allow thats five turnovers for Notre Dame no but youre absolutely right thats a great point I mean johy Wiggins has had that game Jaden Zachary has turned up the defensive energy at times hes going to need to today cuz Marcus Burton is feeling some type of way right now but other days it could be hi High breeder who comes in hits four threes and Sparks a run so like you said somebody different every single game chy Wiggins is in his own head yeah hes forcing it heres shefflin hes done it all that time he throws it away yeah Wiggins is thinking too much hes too talented and thats kind of what you battle at times and another quick pull he hes thinking about the game too much as opposed to just letting it happen exam perfect example right there doesnt see people coming over and tries to shoot over the top they go to double team Ian cheffin its his responsibility to cut hes a half second late Ian shefflin has nowhere to go and for Clemson to reach its potential they need an Engaged in activated Wiggins Burton has tried to do all of it by himself hes got 15 eight from the free throw line High breeder Catch and Release yes count it hey nice read Victor locket at the top of the key pass fake get it to the corner hide breeder that funky looking jump shot pretty efficient young man from Floyd Knobs Indiana Davis on the drive its ta back out kesn carals Cera calling for it hes a sharpshooter Burton instead cork screws inside hes been outstanding hes got 17 and with that basket a th000 points for his career seventh fastest Notre Dame player to get Applause there chaelin open got it six 16 for sheflin he and Burton have got mono aano for the better part of this first half they absolutely have but heres the difference between the two Burtons having to work hard for every single one and while sheelin will get an offensive rebound and feed it in make it from the post Burtons creating all of his looks theres a shelf life on that and Burton missed that jumper sheflin with his sixth rebound Dylan Hunter locking now he gave a little pump fake to realized there was nobody there and shefin slow to get up on the other end hes been nursing a back injury for the better part of this season hey Marcus Burtons been a problem look at this got away with a little gather step there big time move Marcus Burton is a problem corn in college basketball thats the recipe for college basketball you need four guys Five Guys to carry on your culture and your way of doing things and then bring in Talent like you did actory and Victor Lock its not coming thats the recipe but to have those ingredients its hard to make that meal Applause 100 sundra little too much helium and Clemson can hold for one the Tigers have won 12 of their 14 conference games by double digits a chance to take a double digit lead into halftime all switch somebody has to make something happen chefin to Zachary down low against Burton and gets the roll As Time expires Clemson up by Burton with more than half the points for Notre Dame Clemson started fast had a cold spell in the middle of that first half and then finish strong Dylan hunter from his brother Chase lock and battling for the rebound it comes to Applause kesn for the Irish Braden Shrewsberry their number three score at 14 a game declared out for the season with a lower abdomen injury and then Matt Alo their fourth leading scorer hes missing yet another game thats six of his last seven with a wrist injury so really its Diggs and Burton who have to be the offense thats Davis and he gets the tough two and those two against pit last time out both went for 20 thats a twoheaded monster right there both of those guys can score in a hurry and Tay Davis Im just a big fan of his game good skill at the four spot can Spotlight at the three and hes just really continue to improve at Notre Dame Under Michael shrew shefflin through a double team draws the foul and a chance for two more at the line Ian sheflin just plays harder than thats what it comes down to with him but as you see in the first half and Brads not thrilled with how the offense is working but they started great the middle part was tough and then they started to find the rhythm again and heres the thing the numbers always catch up they were consistent in their approach they were finding a lot of the same shots and that always kind of returns to the Applause norm on Saturday huge lacrosse game between Maryland and Notre Dame that game being played in Atlanta Notre Dame lacrosse two time defend defending national champion they have not really been tested since a loss to Georgetown early last year I think theyve got almost a calendar year since their last Music Applause defeat maintain your discipline when he gets in there thats a perfect example right there just because he puts his head down you cant lose sight of your man and you cant jump at the end of the play to give him a foul opportunity Hunters got five assists today winningest player Chase hunter in program history Here Comes Zachary Dylan Hunter chot clock inside ATT attack blocking in the landlock navl of that defense using the window and J snares the caram really nice defense canny J just using that strong lower body not to give up any space Burton machete through the def defense kicks it out kesn and we get a whistle before the shot a foul against Zachary you have to find ways to continue to be physical on the defensive end of the floor despite some of these foul calls going the way they are now Burtons been able to draw a lot of fouls tonight 8 for eight at the free throw line here comes Davis lost his balance gets bumped and able to draw the foul its on shefin theyre hanging around and theyre finding shots but they have to be able to finally knock down some of those shots and somebody not named Marcus Burton has to step up here in this second half for the Irish and the win against pit they had Garrett sunro The Freshman who had a you know pretty decent showing uh Cole Serta kind of came out of nowhere career high 12 points hit three threes that one doesnt go get a quick drag screen find something in the open floor get Chase moving a little bit move that basketball from side to side ex exhibit a lock him but thats a good shot thats a good offensive possession you dont have to call something ball changes sides of the floor you go inside out and you get a quality look youre not going to make them all but you give yourself that opportunity and BT able to draw yet another foul he is in attack mode every time he touches the ball and you cant overcommit to him off the ball so how do you play him I mean youre talking to a guy who played zero defense so its important that thats the disclaimer here however I I think their initial man defense in front of him has done pretty good its the H side thats been coming over here in the second half and losing their way a little bit just stay disciplined on the ball eight points for kesn inside to shefin bobles recovers and hes got 20 to lead Clemson and to lead all scores Ill tell you this though Kyle getter one of the assistant coaches for Notre Dame at shooter around today he said whos doing the game with you I said Terrence Oglesby and I thought he had PTSD he recalled a game here at Little John he was coaching in it he said you hit two from the logo back to back and the place exploded yeah they had a good team he was at Liberty at the time and Seth Curry whos now with the Charlotte Hornets they had a really nice team he and sheflin thats a th points for him isnt it yeah thousand points now for sheflin he and Burton reaching that Milestone tonight shefflin also three points for matching his career high lock in leans and one nice patience terrific scam pass to lockin and he hit that shot in the first half right so you get a little side ball screen short roll action right here well not a ball screen just a quick flare he relocates to the elbow and hes shown the ability to hit that shot at a high level keeva hes got three hes the only guy on this Notre Dame roster with real size that could be an issue 11 for lockin after the missed free throw also has three assists 16 assists on 18 made baskets and if youre Brad Brownell you say hey trust the process right some of the shots havent been falling but theyre moving the ball theyve gotten a lot of good looks Davis off the Baseline Drive against lockin one of the top shot blockers in the ACC I I think he hes not the Top Shot blocker hes right there at it thats absolutely right nice play to move his feet against a really nice player in Tay Davis and hes second behind pit Zack Austin way Hunter loin iron sides chefin keeps it alive is there a better player in college basketball at going for rebounds with two hands than Ian shefflin he gets his Ms on leather you can forget about it 22 for sheflin a oneoff a career high now the thing that always impresses you when you watch Ian chefin his motor it never first stops its amazing really he beater in the sweet 16 two at leite eights and school history program history the other one coming last year I mean think the momentum is really good right now hey maintain your discipline you saw it right there he made two guys jumps stay on your feet and make him score over the top dont lose that discipline you know Burtons had to go against Zachary and Dylan Hunter two of the better defensive guards in the ACC thats does that wear on you at some point it absolutely does but even on the switch Jake high high rer oh thats strong thats strong Flex on him Jaden Zachary what a Applause move unbelievable move you get downhill Jaden Zachary hes built like a linebacker hes playing like a linebacker up and over the top thats an n one success and its its hanging on to guys that you recruited out of high school and now hes jumping over that line and getting into the transfer within reason within reason I just cant figure out why the Carolina dont draft into CL and Tigers players thats my big issue you being in Charlotte Im trying to figure these things out theres a lot of talent down here down 85 the Panthers team president Christy Coleman oh man happens to be a Clemson Tiger there comes Zachary thats a nice job Notre Dame getting back staying in front matching up well and we get a foul no going the other way out of bounds got over higher stepped out of Applause bounds we apologize the technical issues lead is Irish have not had have not had scoring to compliment Marcus Burton theres t Davis coming off a 20point game over shefflin and he draws the foul and really the free throw line kind of been the salvation for Notre Dame tonight it has been and the crazy part about it Anish is like if you look at what Notre Dames doing theyre getting to spots but theyre being cut off and then because Clemsons losing their discipline in the last half second of a possession they end up at the free throw line Notre Dame is without Bren Shrewsberry son of the coach third leading scorer hes out for the season he didnt play against pit on Saturday with an abdomen injury and was officially ruled out for the year today and then matako missing yet another game hes now missed six of his last seven with a wrist injury thats tough two starters yeah two starters and two guys who can give you 10 to 15 points and Shrewsberry can give you 15 to 20 to 25 on a given night so certainly hurts Applause chony Wiggins back in there Brad Brownell has had a quick hook with him a couple of times tonight pressure by Notre Dame now youre up 14 points you need to take advantage of this match up you need to take advantage of this match up right here if youre chy size Advantage gives it up to Zachary too strong Davis Skies but nice play he attacks the middle of the floor draws help gets an open shot to Jaden Zachary who on the season shooting 36 so you just want him to be assertive at this point youre struggling with confidence a little bit just be assertive spin cycle Davis in the feathery touch tough shot heyy Tay Davis has skill real skill at 6869 plays with such good balance I Id like to see him be more assertive officials looking for help and Kip Kissinger says itll stay with Clemson last touch Notre aim I think Clemson got away with one there I think so too now if youre Chanty Wiggins right now struggling a little bit finding a rhythm and flow in this game see if you cant find something here just move the basketball play with Pace do those other things that whenever I had an off shooting night I had to find other ways to be effective and then my shooting would eventually pick up that one rimmed out again tough shot there over CTA Davis spills in the back court Burton accelerates kick Serta catch release No Good were now Serta had been a scout team guy most of the season a freshman Zachary with the jumper hes got nine its amazing him and Chase Hunter good job of just remaining poised when they get to that 15 ft theres no reason to rush your shot no reason to rush your decision making its what happens you have senior guards playing quality minutes IED breeder picks up the foul on Jak his first you told Notre Dame Chase Hunter Midway through the second half would have one field goal if youre the Irish are probably thinking hey we got a got 14point game its been the mo though I mean if its not Chase Hunter its somebody else if its not Jaden Zachary its Victor lockin thats the blessing of having a team like this Burton gets it back basket plus one and hes got 19 looking for yet another 20point game what a move I think were going to be able to take another look at it Marcus bur just staying aggressive throughout the course of this game pretty fortunate bounce and un forunate bouns if youre Victor L take your pick thats when you cant do anything about being 611 no so Burton after missing those seven games in late November through early January in the 15 games since hes gone for 20 a dozen times Hunter all the way to the rim and a foul is called the lead for Clemson is 11 Burtons got 20 for Notre Dame oh right now they got Tay Davis out there with IMS ji sir muhamad and then Sera a seldom used freshman up until this past weekend against pit now Chase Hunter with his first points of the second half and now you have to have sir Muhammad a freshman taking the ball up against this Clemson team that doesnt lack PR pression they are always right there yeah he didnt look comfortable doing it either Ser up that one rims out out of bounds to Clemson I didnt have a good angle H Greer trying to save that ball But Here Comes Notre Dame again showing a little bit of pressure and this is just a a one two two if nothing else just to change up the Rhythm of the offense for Clemson but sometimes you just open it Music up Hunter a chance for a threepoint play and it just like that Marcus Burton to the scores table here comes some freshman out of the game but you open up the game you extend your defense that allows Chase Hunter to use his speed and athleticism not a ton of contact there but it was on the way up that off arm that pushes Chase off balance hes he is entitled to his space whenever he elevates up and youre not in that cylinder he gets pushed off thats a foul call every single time Tio you played here you know the history of this program as well as anybody is Chase Hunter someone who will have his jersey up in the rafters one day I I feel like were getting to that point especially if they make one more run in the postseason he has been that good for that long in that number one Jersey do you retire the number I dont know if you can retire number one but theres a lot of jerseys hanging up here and I I think Chase Hunters name belongs in that mix a sixthe senior all six with Clemson sheflin one point off of matching a career high pass in and out rebound kesn that little scam pass which some college coaches call it a short roll NBA coaches call it a scam pass uh for him to be able to get it on that spot at that ACC logo hes giving Ian shefflin and other times Victor lockin a chance to do something with it not an easy pass especially when youre having to read The Help side as well stay down Burton kicks to Davis and the corner three good 13 for Tay he and Burton have 33 of noted AES Applause 46 and again I mean Burton putting pressure on the rim overc committing a little bit ends up with an open look Hunter no look look deflected it stays with Clemson thats a nice job right there Tay Davis sliding down on the backside help has to slide over he has to help the helper right so he gets down just in time to deflect the pass out cant go under hide breeder with the open Applause three nice move if youre sir muhamad and youre guarding a shooter like Jake Hyer you cannot try to shortcut that screen youre just giving him too much room Davis talented 15 for Tay Davis came in averaging 16 a game up from nine a game last year hes in the running for accs most improved player two for a do iron sides for hide Music breeder Chaplin one rebound away from a double Music Applause double Burton along three Bingo thats tough you go over the screen you chase him you feel like you can relax for half a second no sir not against Marcus B such a talented score 23 for Applause Burton shein open passed it up instead Wiggins down low backing down the Freshman mohamd been a tough knife for Applause Wiggins and a foul with Burton on the ball they get Dylan Hunter boy Burtons been a tough player to defend tonight and when youre playing defense Hy Breer if you try to cut that short as a Defender and go underneath that screen that is dangerous territory for somebody like Jake HB we understand what his role is hes not going to put it on the deck all that much to create for him so but you give him a shot off a catch he can hurt you seventh team foul on Clemson so a one and one for Bert tomorrow 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header are the nothing but net crew takes over theyll break down tonight in the ACC highlights and Analysis of everyone womens game on the Slate and a look ahead to the best matchups for the final weekend of the regular season 25 points tonight for Marcus Burton his career high 32 dont look now Notre D cut this down to nine and they just hang around and thats whats all you want to do on the road give yourself a chance in the last four minutes but youre going to have to play better defense than that lock in with 13 you give Micah shrewsburys team a lot of credit theyre shorthanded uh theyve had just guys in and out of the lineup due to injury All Season theyve had a lot of close calls as Chase Hunter picks up another foul five games in conference decided by seven points or less you this team has battled just too often this season they havent had enough horses thats exactly right not enough horses in the barn to compete consistently to get wins however Shrewsberry is such a good coach and hes been a much more ornery Shrewsberry this season he hes been frustrated with his team at times got frustrated with the not fans a little bit that guys a competitor and and the wins are eventually going to come for Notre ding meanwhile for Burton that was his 12th free throw of the night hide breeder will go to the foul line for if Im Micah Shrewsberry before the under four comes up Im wanting this game about six points because that gives you a legitimate shot you got to keep these guys off a free thr L how does Burton hold up over the final8 minutes he hes played 31 minutes tonight and his backs bothering and he averages a little under 33 a game Hyde breeder now A Perfect 14 of 14 from the line on the season its been those two Burton and Davis and the win against Pittsburgh now they combine for 41 kesn the next leading score with eight now the Freshman sundra shot clock at five Burton weaving dishing ji of three thats not his shot offensive rebound by Roper Burton inside through the seoa and he gets the Tipp in by one of his teammates look like ji down low and Notre Dame has cut the lead to 11 you see how long Marcus Burton steps areow through the lane what you say it was listed at 6t and we both said it was generous you know what else is generous number three 43 thats two of those here in the second half hes got 11 Off the Bench for Applause Clemson shot clock Lee celle blew the whistle right away Youre Jake High breeder you come off these screens aggressive if they cut it short thats your green light you cannot go underneath screen when hide breeders coming off you know who got the the handoff three in Niche was the first guy to do it was Pia sto yakovich now Andre stagich at Stanford Cal oh excuse me Cal was at Stanford last year youre right one of the top five scores in this leag but P St yakovich he was the first guy to really stop behind the dribble hand off and shoot threes whenever he was playing for the second over and a lot of times he would take that from blot deok in the high post and that was Victor lockin with the assist how about lockin the facilitator hes got about four five assists tonight well thats the great part about having a fiveman that can facilitate offense out on the perimeter a and it used to be get the ball in the post and then run action on the outside now its keep the ball on the outside and lets see if we can put pressure on the rim in different ways and Victor lockin is a perfect example of that heres Burton lightning in a shot glass that time denied at The Rim H braider got 11 season high as 15 lock in down the lane and a foul what about the Euro from the Euro well its rushing what what are we what are we doing here not to get geopolitical at this point in the game dont want to do that however big Russian going left right gets fouled how about the skill from Victor lockin Asia I think partly in Europe though Eurasia I know that Russia plays in the Euro league I I think its part of two continents its a discussion I never thought Id be somebody somebody in your DMs will correct you if youre wrong uh youve got a big one on Saturday you got the Florida State Duke game I think of the the great upset Florida state had many years ago Michael snare hitting that game winner that game was at the Tucker Center against a highly ranked Duke team NC State fighting for its ACC tournament life they go to Georgia Tech Ill tell you what and then SMU on the bubble at Stanford Georgia Tech is a team I think that may have a chance to be this years NC State I absolutely agree Nathan George is as good a point guard as we have in this league and he just continues to improve as a scorer and then they have our favorite guy Duncan pal who has played high level over the last month and change but I respect this hide breeder trying to get through the screen just got his feet tangled up sometimes when youre playing aggressive off the ball those things are going to happen Im not all that mad about that Georgia Tech had a triple overtime win here at Clemson they beat Louisville and Brad Brown now not happy with that foul call but the reason being is they say his feet were too spread out now were going to cancel the free throw so everybodys going to be unhappy Applause thought about it Zachary blocked bling Quick Pass sheflin a career high 24 and the chefs kiss off the window you were waiting for that werent you add it to the holster there you Applause go these are your two right here if youre going to make something happen its got to be those guys Clemson with its largest lead Burton to sundra Burton gets it back launches left it short fouled and its a three shot foul they get Zachary Marcus Burton may have to pay rent at the free throw line hold on we have something else Applause happening okay so heres whats call theyre calling the foul on Jaden Zachary who hes saying pushed gar into Marcus Burton so wow Im not sure I agree with that call at all so sundra to the line both teams in the bonus I got to say something about Garrett sunra real quick this guys going to be a good player at Notre Dame he needs his body to catch up a little bit with the rest of the league I saw him play for Team Takeover he has real skill and talent at about 610 so body needs to catch up but theres a future with that young man that was Notre Dame now in the double bonus 10th team foul against Clemson lock in with a turnaround 16 for lockin who in his last four games has averaged 17 plus per and I think Notre Dames starting to run out of juice a little bit it just comes down to so many injuries at the guard spot they maintain their discipline and 10 years ago thats a carry but thats a heck of a move by Marcus Burton who has been the Energizer Bunny 27 for the sophomore I breeder another three got it hes been on his fourth triple he has 14 one off a season High keep it simple sir kisss and if he puts it on the deck hes not near as effective but if he comes off screens or he gets catch and shoot forget about it Burton hesitates basket foul and a chance to get to 30 at the strike hes got probably the best on ball defender in the league guarding too and Jaden Zachary is starting to get irritated Applause Zachary picked up his third and its like he baits you in with that high dribble and that pause to want to reach and try to get the ball and whenever he does that he reads your momentum and goes and it makes it so difficult to defend 30 points for Burton a dozen of them have come at the stripe Clemsons largest lead tonight has been 18 locking backing down ji Davis comes over to help shot clock at five lock in open for three in and out Burton the rebound he so for so many teams your defense or your offense dictates your defense I think its going the other way around right now for Clemson theyre struggling to get stops theyre getting frustrated guarding Burton and its affected their ball movement a little bit on the other end of the floor were having clock issues again clock never started record if they win this by double digits it would mean 13 of the 15 wins would come by 10 plus and oh M Shrewsberry knew he was shorthanded tonight without his son Braden without Matt Alo Burton and Davis have really had to do everything they really have and you know credit to the rest of the team s of 15 thats not a bad night just sometimes times whenever you have so many players out just finding shots for those other guys not an easy thing 30 points for Burton 15 for Tay Davis Burtons two off a career high lockin has 16 for Clemson its been a quiet night for Chase Hunter whos not even on the Applause floor sheins been the big offensive star for Clemson 24 points nine Applause Music rebounds last touch Notre nine turnovers for Micah Shrewsberry team now pressure this is when it gets dangerous for Notre D because Clemson makes such good decisions and trans and they can really break pressure so its kind of a catch 22 do you need to Speed the game up yes but you have Jaden Zachary some of these older players making those decisions in the open floor thats bad news 11 for Zachary Music Imes tipped by ji and a foul down low you want to break pressure you want to get the ball to the middle of the floor then attack nice job hi breeder quick ball fake and Jaden Zachary strong up at The Rim way to attack the body of Kevin ja Music Zachary last time out against SMU 19 points six rebounds seven assists five steals two blocks only the 12th time a division one player had done that since the 9697 season and the only instance in that span of an ACC player putting up that stat line its amazing really and Marcus Burton now finally gets a little bre breather and you want to talk about putting in work over the course of the game 36 minutes eight of 19 for the floor Dro so many fouls ends up with 30 points Joe Barry talked about in the pregame he needs to get 30 40 maybe even 50 he got 30 still didnt matter its been a workmanlike effort for Clemson and you here they are about to crack 80 points lock in little Dipsy do Up and Under hes up to 18 Music points now this was what Clemson was expected to do against the shorthanded Notre Dame team as sheflin comes up with the steal when you look at the full body of work I know Duke snags all the national headlines and they have been unbelievably dominant this season they might very well be the last team standing when all is said and done Clemsons about to be 152 in the ACC 13 wins by double digits you theyve won six straight road games this is a Clemson team and we said it before they got three more games left yep Virginia BC Virginia Tech theyre going to be favored to win all three of those substantially theyve got a chance to move up to a four maybe even a three seed when all is said and done and theyve got a chance to do some things this year that theyve never done in the history of this program they are that good I think thats the biggest thing to take away not just from this game but the entire game as Ian shefin Gets a breather and a welldeserved one ends up with 24 and nine boards on nine of 11 shooting thats some big time play and he stepped up when they really needed it but you alluded to Dukes run through this league Clemsons run through this league Louisvilles run through this leag so its it the top three in the Atlantic Coast Conference have been great they havent been good theyve been great and they theyve held serve every single night a shefin a careerhigh 24 points he is our carvana player of the game one rebound shy of a double double that was a nobrainer I mean his buckets were impactful today too they they werent empty times of the game Wiggins a run hed score seven in a row and finally Wiggins hes going to be able to get to the free throw line now Wiggins has had a a tough night 0 for five from the field looking for his first points Clemsons the only team in the ACC to beat Duke nonconference win against Kentucky if they can beat out Duke and Louisville and might need a little help obviously Duke has to lose one more time Clemson would lose the tie break to Louisville its a threeway tie gets a little more convoluted but if they were to win the ACC regular season title that would be a first since 1990 if they were to win the ACC tournament that would be a program first and remember Clemson was a charter member of the ACC and I remember many weeks ago talking to chase Hunter who said one of the reasons he came back for a sixth year was to lead this team to its first final four some unfinished business thats kind of been the theme with this team and some of these older players they feel like they have that opportunity and Im going to be honest with you Nish I think its a real possibility wow wheres that b thats Logan IMS for you we mentioned theyve shown especially of late it doesnt just have to be one or two guys theyve got four or five guys who can be the star on a given night they have experience and to I think people are sleeping on the continuity factor I mean we talked about it to me thats the recipe have a certain amount of guys that understand what your programs about what your coaching staffs about and you can have some success and we see it with Duke with Tyrese proor and some of those guys we see it with Louisville who Pat Kelce brought over rain Smith and brought over James Scott guys that knew exactly how to approach practice every single day and as a result they pick up the EVs and the flows the new players that is picks up the ABS and the flows of the standards of your program so much quicker miles Foster commits the foul on Serta its also a a battle tested team off of an Elite 8 run with four key guys who returned whove all played together for three plus years and Chase Hunter was awesome in the NCAA tournament he was incredible and he has carried that momentum into this season and today not his best work eight points on five assists but still very very solid one of the best seasons in program history for Clemson and they add another notch to the Belt Clemson School
